At any time, for any reason, you can withdraw from Epicodus and receive a
refund as follows:


    • If you withdraw within 5 days of signing the enrollment agreement, we
      will refund your tuition completely.
    • If you withdraw after 5 days of signing the enrollment agreement, but
      before classes start, we will refund all but the $150 enrollment fee
      included in your tuition.
    • If you withdraw after classes start, we will refund your tuition minus
      the $150 enrollment fee in proportion to the remaining days in the
      class. For example, if you paid $3,400 in tuition and withdraw 25 days
      through a class with 100 days, you will receive a refund of: ($3,400
      tuition - $150 enrollment fee) * ¾ of days remaining = $2,437.50.


We will calculate your refund based on the last date you attended class.


If you are expelled from Epicodus, you will receive a refund on the same
schedule as if you had withdrawn.
