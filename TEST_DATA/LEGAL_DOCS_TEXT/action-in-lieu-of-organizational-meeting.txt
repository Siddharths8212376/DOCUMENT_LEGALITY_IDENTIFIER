      The  following  resolutions  are  hereby  adopted  by  the  Board   of
Directors:


             AUTHORIZATION OF TREASURER TO OPEN AND USE ACCOUNTS


The treasurer of the Corporation is authorized to select one or more  banks,
trust  companies,  brokerage  companies,  or  other  depositories,  and   to
establish financial accounts in the name of this Corporation. The  treasurer
and other persons designated by the  treasurer  are  authorized  to  deposit
corporate  funds  in  these  accounts.  However,  only  the   treasurer   is
authorized  to  withdraw  funds  from  these  accounts  on  behalf  of   the
Corporation.


The  treasurer  is  further   authorized   to   sign   appropriate   account
authorization  forms  as  may  be  required  by  financial  institutions  to
establish and maintain corporate accounts.  The  treasurer  shall  submit  a
copy of any completed account authorization forms to the  secretary  of  the
Corporation, who shall attach the forms to this resolution  and  place  them
in the corporate records book.


                         S CORPORATION TAX ELECTION


The Board of Directors considered the advantages of electing  S  Corporation
tax status for the Corporation under Section 1362 of  the  Internal  Revenue
Code. After discussion, which included a report from the treasurer that  the
Corporation’s accountant had been consulted and concurred with  the  board’s
decision, it was agreed that the Corporation shall elect S  Corporation  tax
status with the IRS.


It was further agreed that the treasurer of  the  Corporation  be  delegated
the task of preparing and filing IRS Form 2553 and any other required  forms
in a timely manner so that the S Corporation tax election will be  effective
starting with the 2013 tax  year  of  the  Corporation.  The  treasurer  was
further  instructed  to  have  all  shareholders  and  their   spouses   (as
applicable) sign the shareholder consent portion of the IRS form.


      The Board of Directors of the Company  has  executed  this  memorandum
effective July 9, 2013 to record the actions taken without a formal  meeting
for the purpose of waiving the requirements of a formal meeting.


DIRECTOR:


Michael Kaiser-Nyman
