FROM: [YOUR NAME]


In reponse to the list of damages you sent dated __________, which I didnâ€™t
receive until this date, __________, I am writing to dispute the following
charges against my security deposit.


As required by Michigan law, I am responding to you by ordinary mail,
within 7 days of when I received the list, indicating in detail my
disagreement relative to the charges listed.


[DISPUTED DAMAGES]


A total of all disputed charges amounts to $______________. Please refund
this amount of my security deposit promptly: $______________.


Please note that under Michigan law, the security deposit is considered the
lawful property of the tenant until the landlord establishes a right to the
deposit or portions thereof. Within 45 days after termination of occupancy
and not thereafter the landlord may commence an action in a court of
competent jurisdiction for a money judgment for damages which he [or she]
has claimed or in lieu thereof return the balance of the security deposit
held by him [or her] to the tenant or any amount mutually agreed upon in
writing by the parties.


If you wish to discuss this matter with me, please contact me at
_________________________.


Sincerely,
