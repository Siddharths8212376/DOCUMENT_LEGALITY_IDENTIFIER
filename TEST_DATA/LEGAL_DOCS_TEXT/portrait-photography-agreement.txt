Agreement Overview


This agreement contains the entire understanding between the Photographer
and the Client. It supersedes all prior and simultaneous agreements between
the Parties. The only way to add or change this agreement is to do so in
writing, signed by all the Parties. If the Parties want to waive one
provision of this agreement, that does not mean that any other provision is
also waived. The party against whom a waiver is sought to be effective must
have signed a waiver in writing.


Coverage


Coverage will begin at [COVERATE START DATE/TIME] , and continue for the
number of hours purchased, contiguously.


Change of Date or Venue


The Photographer must be notified immediately of any changes in schedule or
location, at least one week prior to the scheduled date of event.
Notification of any changes can be made by phone along with written notice
sent via email for documentation. If an email is sent, a confirmation of
receipt must be sent back by the Photographer in writing or via email. It
is the client’s responsibility to confirm all arrangements at least 7-10
days prior to the event. In the event of change of address or contact
information (time, etc.) as
listed, you must notify the Photographer.
The Photographer kindly asks that the Client get in touch with the
Photographer two weeks prior to the date of the event in order to touch
base and go over last minute details. The Photographer will make every
effort to contact the Client, but it is the Client’s responsibility to
contact the Photographer to confirm all events and times.


Retainer


A retainer fee of $[RETAINER FEE AMOUNT] is required for all portrait
sessions.
This is a non-refundable retainer. In the event of cancellation, the
retainer paid is non-refundable. It shall be liquidated for damages to the
Photographer in the event of a cancellation, or breach of contract by the
Client. No date is reserved until a retainer is received. The retainer
shall be applied towards the total cost of the service to be rendered. The
balance of the complete package price must be paid before or on the day of
event. If final payment is not received, the Photographer will not be
expected to attend said event. Additional custom orders (reprints,
enlargements, albums) must be paid in full at the time of order.


Cancellation


There shall be no refund of retainer after the signing of the Agreement and
the reservation of the photography date. If the event is cancelled within
two weeks of the date, the client shall pay the balance of the contract due
to the high probability that the Photographer will not be able to further
book that date. Once a balance is paid, it is non-refundable. Any other
arrangements shall be discussed between the Clients and the Photographer.
All arrangements will be put in writing. Cancellation must be in writing
even if a phone call was made to inform the Photographer of the
cancellation.


Failure to Perform


The parties agree to cheerful cooperation and communication for the best
possible result within the definition of this assignment. Due to the
limited and subjective nature of the event, the Photographer cannot be held
responsible for requested photographs not taken or missed, lack of coverage
resulting from weather conditions, or schedule complications caused by but
not limited to, anyone in or at the event, or by the church or location
restrictions. The Photographer is not responsible for lost photo
opportunities due to other cameras or flashes, the lateness of the clients
or other principles. The Photographer is not responsible for the lack of
coverage due to weather conditions, scheduling complications due to
lateness of individuals, rules and restrictions of venue, or the rendering
of decorations of the location. It is acknowledged that any lists submitted
to the Photographer will be used for organizational purposes only and in no
way represent photography that will actually be produced. The Photographer
will do its best to fulfill all requests but can make no guarantees all
images will be delivered. The Photographer recommends that the Client point
out important individuals for informal or candid photographs to the
photographer during portrait shooting that they wish to have photographed.
The Photographer will not be held accountable for not photographing desired
people if there is no one to assist in identifying people or gathering
people for photographs. The Photographer is not responsible if key
individuals fail to appear or cooperate during photography sessions or for
missed images due to details not revealed to the Photographer.
Clients are responsible for all location fees and permits.

Photographer until client has paid in full. All photos are copyrighted. The

posting of images on the internet must be acknowledged as images by the
Photographer.

photograph shall be the exclusive photographer(s) retained by the Client
for the purpose of the portrait photography. Family and friends of the
clients and other event vendors shall not interfere with the Photographer’s
duties. Guests will be asked to refrain from taking flash photographs at
certain intervals of the event to ensure proper exposure of images.
