   1. Power/Network Outages.  Customer acknowledges and understands that the
      Phone Service will not work if any of the necessary Equipment is
      unplugged or otherwise disconnected from necessary power sources. 
      Customer further acknowledges and understands that the Phone Service
      may not function in the event of power failure or if Customer's
      broadband cable connection is disrupted or not working properly. 
      Should there be an interruption to the power supply to Customer's
      home, the Phone Service may be powered by backup battery supply, but
      the inclusion of a battery backup does not ensure that the Phone
      Service will work in all circumstances.  In the event that there is a
      loss of power or other problem that disrupts Suddenlink's network,
      Phone Service will not be available until the network is restored. 
      Cordless telephones powered by electricity will not function during a
      power outage, even if the Phone Service is functioning properly. 
      CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES AND UNDERSTANDS THAT SUDDENLINK DOES NOT
      GUARANTEE THAT E911 OR 911 DIALING WILL BE AVAILABLE IN THE EVENT OF A
      POWER FAILURE OR FAILURE OF THE SUDDENLINK NETWORK.
   2. Enhanced 911 Service.  Enhanced 911 ("E911"), or 911 service is a
      feature of the Phone Service.  Prior to initiation of Phone Service,
      Customer must provide Suddenlink the valid street address where the
      Phone Service will be utilized ("Registered Address").  Customer
      agrees not to move the telephone cable modem ("EMTA") from the
      location it was originally installed.   IF CUSTOMER MOVES THE EMTA
      FROM THE REGISTERED ADDRESS, CUSTOMER'S PHONE SERVICE MAY NOT FUNCTION
      PROPERLY AND E911/911 OPERATORS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE
      CORRECT LOCATION OF A CALLER IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY.
   3. Customer May Not "Opt-out" of Suddenlink's E911 Service.  Customer
      acknowledges that pursuant to federal law the provision of E911 or 911
      service to Customer is provided as an express condition of Service by
      Suddenlink. As a result E911 or 911 service is not an optional feature
      and customer may not "opt-out," or decline to accept, Suddenlink's
      E911 or 911 service.
   4. Resetting Equipment after a Power Failure. A power failure or
      disruption in Service may require Customer to reset or reconfigure
      equipment prior to utilizing the Phone Service or E911 or 911 dialing.
      A power failure may also include a battery failure in the EMTA. If
      Customer experiences a battery failure in the EMTA, Suddenlink will
      provide a replacement battery and installation instructions.
   5. Use of TDD or TTY Devices.  Customer acknowledges that E911/911
      service may not be fully compatible with all types of TDD or TTY
      devices for the hearing impaired. Suddenlink does not guarantee or
      offer emergency services compatible with any TDD/TTY or other hearing
      impaired devices.
   6. Home Security Systems and other Non-voice Communications Equipment. 
      Customer acknowledges that the Phone Service may not be compatible
      with certain third party home security, medical monitoring and other
      non-voice communications systems.  It is the Customer's responsibility
      to test Customer's home security, medical monitoring system or other
      non-voice communications system.  Customer acknowledges that these
      systems may not function properly in the event of a power outage or
      disruption in Suddenlink's broadband network service.
   7. Calling Plans.  Customer expressly agrees that Customer will not have
      the option of subscribing to a "local only" or "long-distance only"
      service, nor will Customer be able to subscribe to a separate local,
      toll or long distance provider for use in conjunction with the Phone
      Service.


   1. Usage-Based Charges.  In addition to Customers monthly recurring
      charges, Customer agrees to pay Suddenlink for all usage-based charges
      including, but not limited to, collect calls, charges for calls to
      Alaska and Hawaii, international calls, directory assistance, and/or
      Suddenlink assisted calls.
   2. Taxes.  The Customer is responsible for the payment of any applicable
      sales, use, gross receipts, excise, access or other local, state and
      federal taxes, fees or surcharges (however designated) based upon the
      provision of Phone Service, all of which will be separately designated
      on Customer's invoice.  It shall be the responsibility of the Customer
      to pay any such taxes that subsequently become applicable
      retroactively.
   3. Regulatory Fees.  Customer also agrees to pay any applicable fees or
      payment obligations in connection with the Phone Service that may be
      imposed by governmental or quasi-governmental bodies in connection
      with the sale, installation, use, or provision of the Phone Service
      and any regulatory fees that Suddenlink invoices Customer for to help
      defray Suddenlink's contribution to municipal, state and federal
      government programs in which Suddenlink participates, including but
      not limited to, universal service, telecom relay services for the
      visually/hearing impaired, 911/E911 programs and associated
      infrastructure.  Suddenlink, in its sole discretion, has the right to
      determine what fees, taxes and surcharges are due by Customer and to
      collect and remit them to the governmental authority.  The Suddenlink
      Parties shall in no way be liable to Customer for the collection or
      remittance of any fees, taxes and surcharges.
   4. Surcharges.  A surcharge may be imposed on  charges for Phone Service
      originating from states which levy, or assert a claim of right to
      levy, a gross receipts tax on Suddenlink's operations in any such
      state, or a tax on interstate access charges incurred by Suddenlink
      for originating access to telephone exchanges in that state. This
      surcharge is based on state imposed receipts tax and other state taxes
      imposed directly or indirectly upon Suddenlink by virtue of, and
      measured by, the gross receipts or revenues of Suddenlink in that
      state and/or payment of interstate access charges in that state.
      Surcharges may also be imposed for international directory assistance,
      international mobile termination fees charged by foreign wireless
      telecommunication providers, operator assisted calls, and calls made
      to premium services such as chat lines.  Any applicable surcharge will
      be shown as a separate line item on the Customer's monthly invoice.
   5. Charges Caused by Third Parties.  Customer is responsible in all
      respects (including payment obligations) for all use of the Phone
      Service under Customer's account, whether or not Customer actually
      authorized the use.  Customer will be responsible for ensuring that
      all use of the Phone Service under Customer's account fully complies
      with this Agreement.
   6. Casual Calling Charges.  Customer agrees to pay for any charges
      arising out of the use of any "casual calling" (e.g., 10-10-333)
      services provided by any third party.
   7. Pay-Per-Call/900 Calls.  It is Customer's sole responsibility to pay
      all charges or fees assessed by any pay-per-call service provider (if
      such service is available).  Suddenlink does not assist such providers
      in billing or collecting for their services, and Suddenlink will not
      intervene on Customer's behalf in a billing dispute with pay-per-call
      providers.
   8. Wiring.  Customer agrees that Suddenlink and its authorized agents may
      disconnect Customer's existing service to the local telephone company,
      and that Suddenlink or its authorized agent may disconnect, rearrange,
      splice or otherwise manipulate the existing telephone wiring in or on
      Customer's premises in order to connect the premises to the Phone
      Service. 


   1. Unlawful Use.  Customer will not use the Phone Service for any
      unlawful purpose, or for any use which Customer has not obtained
      all required governmental approvals, authorizations, licenses,
      consents and permits.  Nor will Customer use any features, functions,
      or other inputs to the Phone Service (including the features,
      functions and services of a third party) for any unlawful purpose, or
      for any use which Customer has not obtained all required governmental
      approvals, authorizations, licenses, consents and permits.  Suddenlink
      may terminate Customer's Phone Service without notice if Suddenlink
      finds, in Suddenlink's sole judgment, that Customer's use is
      unauthorized or fraudulent.
   2. No Commercial Use.  Customer agrees not to use the Phone Service for
      any commercial reason, including telemarketing, medical transcription,
      facsimile broadcasting, or other enterprise directed at receiving
      income or profit. Unlimited Domestic Long Distance pricing applies to
      direct-dialed domestic person-to-person calls from home phone only. If
      Customer uses the Phone Service for any other purpose,  Suddenlink may
      immediately suspend, restrict or cancel your service without prior
      notice
   3. Interference/Hazardous Conditions.  Suddenlink may shut down
      Customer's Phone Service without prior notice if Suddenlink finds, in
      Suddenlink's sole judgment, that Customer's use of the Service is
      causing interference to others or Customer has moved or tampered or
      allowed others to tamper with any Equipment.  Suddenlink may also shut
      down Customer's Phone Service without prior notice if Suddenlink
      finds, in Suddenlink's sole judgment, that hazardous conditions exist
      that would make Customer's continued use of the Service unsafe.
