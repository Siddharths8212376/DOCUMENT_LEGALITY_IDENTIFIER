SECTION 19a-575


TESTAMENT


If the time comes when I am incapacitated to the point where I can no
longer actively take part in decisions for my own life, and am unable to
direct my physician as to my own medical care, I wish this statement to
stand as a testament of my wishes. I [STATE THE NAME OF THE DECLARANT]
request that I be allowed to die and not be kept alive through life support
system if my condition is deemed terminal. I do not intend any direct
taking of my life, but only that my dying not be unreasonably prolonged.


This request is made, after careful reflection, while I am of sound mind.
