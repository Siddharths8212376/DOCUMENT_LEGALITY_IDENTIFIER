Contractor shall have the sole and complete control over the performance  of
Contractor’s duties under this Agreement so  long  as  such  performance  is
performed to the  client’s  and  Company’s  satisfaction.  Contractor  shall
perform all services hereunder  in  a  professional  manner  that  will  not
reflect discredit or embarrassment upon Company  or  that  will  impair  the
business relationship and goodwill presently existing between  Company,  its
Clients and its employees.


III. Contractor Payments


Contractor shall be paid a pre-agreed rate or flat fee for all  work  to  be
performed. Contractor payments shall be made  according  to  a  deliverables
worksheet to be created and mutually  agreed  upon  at  the  start  of  each
project.


IV. Confidentiality


Company and the Contractor understand and agree that in connection with  the
negotiation and performance of this Agreement, each party may  have  had  or
have access to or may have been or be exposed to,  directly  or  indirectly,
private or confidential information of the other party, including,  but  not
limited to, trade secrets and  any  other  information  that  the  receiving
party reasonably should know is confidential  (“Confidential  Information”).
Each party (on its behalf and on behalf of its subcontractors, employees  or
representatives, or agents of  any  kind)  agrees  to  hold  and  treat  all
Confidential Information of the other party in confidence and  will  protect
the Confidential Information with the same degree  of  care  as  each  party
uses  to  protect  its  own  Confidential  Information   of   like   nature.
Notwithstanding anything contained  herein  to  the  contrary,  Confidential
Information does not include any information that (i) at  the  time  of  the
disclosure or  thereafter  is  lawfully  obtained  from  publicly  available
sources generally known  by  the  public  (other  than  as  a  result  of  a
disclosure  by  the  receiving  party  or  its  representatives);  (ii)   is
available to the receiving party on a non-confidential basis from  a  source
that is not and was not bound by a confidentiality  agreement  with  respect
to the Confidential Information; or (iii) has  been  independently  acquired
or developed by the receiving party without violating its obligations  under
this Agreement or under  any  federal  or  state  law.  This  Section  shall
supersede any previous agreement relating to confidential  treatment  and/or
non-disclosure of Confidential  Information;  provided,  however,  that  any
information disclosed pursuant to that earlier agreement shall be deemed  to
be Confidential Information and protected under the terms of this  Agreement
as if this Agreement had been in place at the time of such disclosures.  The
Confidential Information will not, without the prior written consent of  the
other party, be disclosed to any third  party,  except  that  the  receiving
party may disclose the Confidential Information or portions thereof  to  (a)
its directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives on a need-to-
know basis, or (b) as may be  required  by  law,  applicable  regulation  or
judicial  process,  provided,  however,  that  if  the  receiving  party  is
required to disclose such Confidential Information under this  Section,  the
receiving party shall promptly notify the disclosing party of  such  pending
disclosure and consult with the disclosing party prior  to  such  disclosure
as to the advisability of seeking a  protective  order  or  other  means  of
preserving the confidentiality  of  the  Confidential  Information.  Neither
party shall use any Confidential Information received from the  other  party
except as may be necessary in its  performance  under  this  Agreement.  The
parties acknowledge that unauthorized use by a party of  the  other  party’s
Confidential Information will diminish the value  of  such  information  and
that breach of this obligation may cause irreparable harm  and  entitle  the
non-breaching party to  seek  injunctive  relief  to  protect  its  interest
herein, in addition to any other  monetary  or  other  remedies  it  may  be
entitled to hereunder.


Contractor agrees to not discuss fees or other information the  Company  has
expressed in writing as confidential, directly with  the  Company’s  Clients
unless expressed in writing by the Company.


V. Non-Compete


Unless waived by the Company, Contractor shall not for a  period  of  [#  OF

Company.


VI. Liability


The Company  shall  not  be  responsible  for  any  costs  incurred  by  the
Contractor  in  furtherance  of  this  Agreement  or  otherwise,  such   as,
licensing fees and/or equipment fees.  All  services  under  this  Agreement
shall be performed at the full expense of the Contractor.

PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY  SPECIAL,  INDIRECT,  INCIDENTAL,
PUNITIVE,  OR  CONSEQUENTIAL  DAMAGES  ARISING  FROM  OR  RELATED  TO   THIS
AGREEMENT, INCLUDING BODILY INJURY, DEATH, LOSS OF REVENUE,  OR  PROFITS  OR
OTHER BENEFITS, AND CLAIMS BY ANY THIRD PARTY,  EVEN  IF  THE  PARTIES  HAVE
BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  THE  FOREGOING  LIMITATION

LIMITATION TO BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH  OF  WARRANTY,  NEGLIGENCE,  STRICT
LIABILITY, AND OTHER TORTS.


VII. Disclaimer of Warranty


THE WARRANTIES CONTAINED HEREIN ARE THE ONLY WARRANTIES MADE BY THE  PARTIES
HEREUNDER. EACH PARTY MAKES NO OTHER WARRANTY, WHETHER EXPRESS  OR  IMPLIED,
AND  EXPRESSLY   EXCLUDES   AND   DISCLAIMS   ALL   OTHER   WARRANTIES   AND
REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING ANY  WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. COMPANY  DOES
NOT PROVIDE ANY WARRANTY THAT OPERATION OF ANY SERVICES  HEREUNDER  WILL  BE
UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.


VIII. Indemnification


The Contractor agrees to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend  the  Company,
its officers, directors, successor, assigns, agents and employees, from  any
and all  claims,  demands,  suits,  actions,  proceedings,  costs,  damages,
expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs), and/or losses  of
any kind  arising  out  of  or  resulting  from  any  claims  that  (a)  the
Contractor  breached  any  representations  and  warranties  made  in   this
Agreement,  (b)  the  Contractor  breached   or   allegedly   breached   its
confidentiality obligations  hereunder,  and  (c)  claims  relating  to  the
Contractor’s  Intellectual  Property,  Designs,  or  any   other   materials
provided  by  or  made  available  by  the  Contractor.   The   Contractor’s
obligations are conditioned upon the  Company:  (i)  giving  the  Contractor
written notice of any claim, action,  suit  and  proceeding  for  which  the
Company is seeking indemnity; (ii)  granting  control  of  the  defense  and
settlement to the Contractor;  and  (iii)  providing,  at  the  Contractor’s
expense, reasonable assistance in the defense or settlement thereof. In  any
event, the Company shall have the right to participate, at its own  expense,
in the defense or settlement of any claim, action, suit and proceeding  that
is the subject of an indemnification obligation. If any  settlement  results
in  any  ongoing  liability  to,  or  prejudices  or  detrimentally  impacts
Company, and such obligation, liability, prejudice or impact can  reasonably
be  expected  to  be  material,  then  such  settlement  shall  require  the
Company’s  written  consent,  which  consent  shall  not   be   unreasonably
withheld.

A failure or delay in exercising any right, power or  privilege  in  respect
of this Agreement will not be presumed to operate as a waiver, and a  single
or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege will  not  be  presumed
to preclude any subsequent or further exercise,  of  that  right,  power  or
privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.


If  any  provision  or  provisions  of  this   Agreement   shall   be   held
unenforceable for any reason, then  such  provision  shall  be  modified  to
reflect the parties’ intention. All remaining provisions of  this  Agreement
