applications on the Server; these resources may be used as much as each
Party needs as long as operation of critical services are not significantly

state drive equally, to the best of their ability.The Parties also agree to
keep total disk usage on the solid-state drive under 90%, for optimal disk
operation.The Parties agree to tentatively split hard drive space on the
secondary platter drive to the proportions of each Party’s monthly payment:

be waived if a Party has obtained explicit permission from the other  Party,
or when legally requested by a court.The perusal and modification  of  data,
as well as the killing of processes may also be  allowed  when  required  to
resolve a problem impeding server operation or to  resolve  another  Party’s
