                                                       Illustrator Agreement


Set forth on [DATE], this agreement (“Agreement”) is entered into between
My Company, Inc., hereafter known as the “Client,” and [ARTIST'S NAME],
hereafter known as “Illustrator.” The Agreement refers to the work of
creating illustrations for company (hereafter referred to as “Work”):


We, the Client and Illustrator agree to the following provisions:


   1. Illustrator agrees to create the Work,  along  with  any  supplemental
      materials (visual assets,  etc.)  as  requested  by  Client  for  said
      design.
   2. Payment: Client agrees to pay Illustrator for illustrations in 3 parts
      per illustration: $0 for a sketch, $0 for a completed  black  &  white
      painting, and $0 for the final color painting. Greater amounts must be
      authorized under an agreement replacing this one.
   3. Duration: This Agreement  commences  on  the  day  listed  above,  and
      continues through Completion date, at which point the Work is expected
      to be completed to Client’s satisfaction. Extensions may be  requested
      by Illustrator, and granted or denied by the  Client.  If  the  Client
      believes that the Work is not yet satisfactory, the Client may  extend
      the deadline and/or request revisions of the Work.
   4. Completion: Upon the completion  of  the  Agreement  to  the  Client’s
      satisfaction, Illustrator agrees  to  transfer  all  files,  including
      source, PSDs, etc., for the Work to the  Client.  Within  15  business
      days of said transfer of all parts (as described in 2  above),  Client
      will then tender the  payment  to  Illustrator,  at  which  point  the
      copyright of  the  Work  will  transfer  to  the  Client.  Should  the
      Illustrator not provide the necessary information (tax  forms,  Paypal
      or other payment information, this contract, etc.), this deadline will
      be extended to a  month  after  the  necessary  information  has  been
      provided. The copyright and transfer will include parts  of  the  Work
      that were done prior to this Agreement.
   5. Early Completion: At any point prior to the Client’s deadline,  Client
      may end the project, at which point the  project  will  be  considered
      completed and no further work will be done or paid for, but  all  work
      done up to that point will  be  transferred  and  paid  for,  per  the
      Completion clause above. If a phase of  the  Work  has  not  yet  been
      approved by the Client at the time at  which  the  project  is  ended,
      Client will pay on pro-rated basis for the part of the work  that  has
      been done.
   6. Client Responsibilities: Client agrees  to  provide  Illustrator  with
      text and images (copy, etc.) needed for the Work to  be  completed  on
      time and to Client’s satisfaction.
   7. Rights: Rights, including copyright, ownership, and publishing rights,
      to this Work belong to the Illustrator until  the  completion  of  the
      project and the transfer of payment, at which point they will transfer
      to the Client. The Illustrator will, at that point, also have  license
      to  use  copies  of  the  material  for  the  purposes  of   promoting
      Illustrator’s services.
   8. Severability: If any provision of the  Agreement  shall  be  unlawful,
      void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that  provision  shall  be
      deemed severable from this Agreement and shall not affect the validity
      and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
   9.  Jurisdiction:  This  Agreement  is  a  legal   document   under   the
      jurisdictions of the courts of the State of New York.
  10. This Agreement supersedes any agreement made  before  the  signing  of
      this Agreement.


This undersigned consent to all the provisions in this Agreement,  effective
as of the date at the top.
