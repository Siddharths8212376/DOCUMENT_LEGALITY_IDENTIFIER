                            [COMPANY NAME], INC.


                             MEMORANDUM OF TERMS
                                     FOR
                    SALE OF CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTES


[COMPANY NAME], Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), intends to
issue convertible promissory notes to purchase shares of the Company’s
capital stock to certain qualified entities and/or individuals (the
“Investors”) set forth on Schedule 1 attached hereto. The Company and the
undersigned Investors hereby agree to proceed to closing in accordance with
this Memorandum of Terms. No legally binding obligations will be created,
implied or inferred until a note, in the form acceptable to each Investor
and signed by the Company, is delivered to each of the Investors.


Amount:


The Company will authorize the issuance and sale of convertible, unsecured
promissory notes (“Notes”) with an aggregate principal amount of up to
$1,000,000.


Type of Security:


Notes with eight percent (8%) annual payment-in-kind coupon, convertible as
described below, with warrants (the “Warrants”) to purchase shares of
common stock of the Company (“Common Stock”).


Investors:


Individuals and entities who are “accredited investors” under Regulation D
of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.


Closing:


The initial closing, upon sale of a minimum of $50,000 worth of Notes (the
“Initial Closing”), is expected to take place on or before December 31,
2004. The Company may sell up to an aggregate of $950,000 worth of
additional Notes at such time or times (each, a “Subsequent Closing”) as
the Company deems appropriate.


Conversion:


Upon the closing of the sale and issuance by the Company of shares of its
Series A Preferred Stock, if any (the “Series A Financing”), the Notes will
be automatically converted, without requiring any prior consent or approval
of the Investors, into that number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock
determined by dividing the aggregate principal amount of each Note plus
accrued but unpaid interest thereon (the “Principal Amount”), by a
conversion price equal to the purchase price for the Series A Preferred
Stock established for the Series A Financing (the “Conversion Price”), with
fractional shares to be rounded to the nearest whole share.


In the event that the Company is acquired prior to the closing of the
Series A Financing, the Notes will be automatically converted, without
requiring any prior consent or approval of the Investors, into that number
of shares of Common Stock determined by dividing the Principal Amount by a
conversion price equal to a price that is 20% less than the per share
consideration to be paid to equity holders pursuant to the terms of such
acquisition, with fractional shares to be rounded to the nearest whole
share.


In the event that neither the Series A Financing nor an acquisition of the
Company has taken place by June 30, 2006, then each such Note will be
automatically converted, without requiring any prior consent or approval of
any Investor, into that number of shares of Common Stock determined by
dividing the Principal Amount by a deemed conversion price of $1.00 per
share, with fractional shares rounded to the nearest whole share.


Series A Preferred Stock to be Issued Upon Conversion of Notes:


Upon the conversion of the Notes as a result of the Series A Financing, the
Investors will receive shares of Series A Preferred Stock of the Company on
identical terms as original purchasers of shares of Series A Preferred
Stock in the Series A Financing (other than those rights typically granted
only to lead or major investors).


Use of Proceeds:


The proceeds from the sale of the Notes will be used for general working
capital.


Series A Financing:


The Series A Financing will be made pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement
(with exhibits) drafted by counsel to the Company and acceptable to the
purchasers of Series A Preferred Stock. The Stock Purchase Agreement will
contain, among other things, appropriate representations and warranties of
the Company, covenants of the Company reflecting the provisions set forth
herein, an arbitration provision, an attorneys’ fees provision and other
appropriate conditions, as well as requiring an investor lock-up, co-sale
provision, and other standard obligations imposed on investors.


Conditions of Closing:


The Initial Closing will be conditioned upon the Company raising a minimum
of $100,000 through the sale of Notes.
