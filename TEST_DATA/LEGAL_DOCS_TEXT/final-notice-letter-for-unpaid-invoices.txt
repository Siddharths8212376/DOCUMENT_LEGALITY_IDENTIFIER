Dear [YOUR CUSTOMER'S NAME]:

As of this date, your payment has not been recieved, and thus your account
remains past due.

Unless you promptly cure the default on this account, it will be forwarded
to a national, third-party collection agency.

We urge you to make immediate payment of the above past due amount.

To avoid the collections process, please ensure that we receive payment
before the “Collections Process Begins” date printed above. See your
invoice or contact us if you need the payment information again.

Please be advised that nothing in this letter is intended to waive any
rights or remedies available to us under your contract, at law or in
equity, all of which are expressly reserved.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
