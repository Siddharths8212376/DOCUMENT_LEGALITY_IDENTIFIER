This Confidentiality and  Non-Disclosure  Agreement  (this  “agreement”)  is
between Meld Development Solutions, Inc., an Oregon corporation  located  at
208 SW 5th Ave, Portland, OR 97204 (“Meld”) and (client, located  at  client
address) (“you”).


Summary:


Meld  is  developing  for  you  [include  description  of  engagement]  (the
“Application”). In connection with development of the Application,  we  will
share certain confidential and proprietary information with each other,  and
we agree that neither of us will share any  confidential  information  about
each other, by any means, with anyone  else,  except  as  provided  in  this
agreement.


What’s covered? What are our primary responsibilities to each other?


Confidential information includes: source  code  of  the  Application  being
developed and any adaptations, improvements, revisions and derivative  works
of the same, passwords, API keys, trade secrets,  know-how,  and  any  other
information that we designate as confidential or proprietary at the time  we
disclose it to each other. Any  confidential  information  will  remain  the
property of the party that disclosed it and we  both  agree  to  return  all
confidential information in whatever form  (including  any  copies)  to  the
disclosing party upon request.


We both agree not to use, copy  or  disclose  the  confidential  information
apart from  the  reason  it  was  shared,  except  that  we  may  share  the
confidential information with our employees that have a  need  to  know  the
information in connection with development of the Application,  so  long  as
we advise them of the obligations in  this  agreement  and  take  reasonable
steps to ensure their compliance with it. We also agree take at least  those
measures that we take  to  protect  our  own  confidential  and  proprietary
information, such as keeping files, access to online systems  and  any  user
names and passwords safe and secure so the  information  doesn’t  fall  into
the wrong hands.


If  we  think  that  there’s  even  a  possibility  that  any   confidential
information might have been compromised, we agree to tell each  other  right
away so we can promptly take the steps necessary to protect the  information
from public disclosure. We also agree to help  each  other  to  resolve  any
problems that might arise if confidential information is compromised.


What’s not covered?


If something is already in the public domain or becomes  public  through  no
action or inaction by either  of  us,  it’s  not  confidential  information.
Although we hope it will never happen, this agreement also does not  protect
information that we are required by law to disclose, except  that  we  agree
to give each other notice of the disclosure requirement  in  that  situation
and to assist  each  other  in  trying  to  obtain  an  order  to  keep  the
information confidential.


This agreement will not prohibit us  from  working  with  any  other  party,
provided that we continue to abide by this agreement.


How long does this agreement last?


Our obligations under this agreement will remain in effect until  such  time
as the information protected by it is  no  longer  confidential  through  no
action or inaction by either of us.


Miscellaneous legal stuff


You can’t transfer this agreement to anyone else without our  prior  written
permission. This agreement benefits and binds Your successors and  permitted
assigns.


If it turns out part of this agreement isn’t enforceable, we both  agree  to
remove that part, and we also agree that  doing  so  shall  not  affect  the
enforceability of the rest of the agreement.


If we have a dispute, the State of Oregon’s laws will apply, except for  the
conflict  of  laws  rules.  If  the  dispute  concerns  the  disclosure   or
threatened  disclosure  of  confidential  information  in  breach  of   this
agreement, we both acknowledge it would irreparably damage the  other  party
and agree that the non-breaching party shall immediately be entitled  to  an
injunction  (including  a  temporary  restraining   order   or   preliminary
injunction) without having to post a bond.  We  also  agree  that  the  non-
breaching party shall also be entitled to recover damages for any injury  it
may incur, along with any other  remedies  available  to  the  non-breaching
party. We both agree we will go to court  in  Multnomah  County,  Oregon  to
resolve any dispute arising under this agreement that we  are  not  able  to
resolve ourselves.
