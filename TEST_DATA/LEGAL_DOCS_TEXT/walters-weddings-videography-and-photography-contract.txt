Wedding Video FAQs


Please read through these questions and answers. If you have questions  that
are not clear after  reading  the  following  items,  please  feel  free  to
contact your principal photographer/videographer.


Q. If I want to be videotaped and photographed at the  salon  while  getting
ready, what do I have to do to be able to have you tape at a salon?


A. If you are planning on getting ready at a beauty salon, it  is  always  a
good idea to check in advance  to  see  if  they  will  allow  you  to  take
photographs/videos in their building.


Q. Is it possible  to  video  and/or  photograph  everyone  at  the  wedding
ceremony and reception? How long do you work with  me  on  the  day  of  our
wedding?


A.  No.  It   is   impossible   to   guarantee   that   everyone   will   be
filmed/photographed. As a general rule  with  our  videos/photos,  we  focus
solely on the bride and groom. If you want to  make  sure  that  a  specific
family member  is  filmed/photographed,  you  must  contact  us  before  the
wedding. We will stay at the event until we  get  the  footage  we  need  to
finish your video/capture the proceedings. If there is an  event  that  will
take place later in the evening, please let me know ahead of  time  so  that
we can make arrangements in our schedules.


Q. How do you edit our video?


A. The way we shoot and edit the  video  is  by  using  candid  camera  film
shooting and editing techniques. This means that your  entire  day  will  be
condensed into an hour-long video. Also please note, that  We  only  include
the most important moments from the wedding ceremony.


Q. How do you edit our photographs?


A. While we do our best to keep editing to a honest minimum,  we  edit  your
images to enhance their natural beauty while staying true  to  the  original
emotions captured in that moment.


Q. Can we buy the raw footage? How long do you keep a  master  copy  of  our
video on file?


A. Yes, we do sell the raw footage. The cost is $60USD for 2 DVDs.  We  keep
raw footage on file for only four (4) months after you  have  received  your
wedding video. We keep a master copy of your video on  hand  for  two  years
after your wedding date. After that time period, we  cannot  guarantee  that
we will have a copy of your video. We  highly  recommend  to  every  couple,
that you purchase some brand of media fire  safe:  Sentry  and  Brinks  make
these. This will ensure that you  will  have  a  copy  of  the  video  in  a
protected  location.  Any  photos  or  videos  with  a  copyright  mark   or
professional photographer company logo will not be used in your  production,
unless you have obtained a release signature from the photographer.[JSH1]


Q. How long does it take to finish editing our  video/photos?  Can  we  make
changes to the final video?


A. We finish editing your video in 4  -  6  weeks  and  your  photos  within
30days. A preview (10 photos) of your wedding day  will  be  made  available
within 5 days or less. We allow changes to the final video only if  mistakes
were made on Walters Weddings’ part. Such mistakes include misspellings  and
other changes, which were discussed with us ahead of time. Other changes  to
the final video can be made, but there will be a charge per hour to  do  so.
Changes to the final video, which were not caused by Walters  Weddings,  are
billed at a rate of US$9.50 per hour with a  minimum  of  2  hours  charged.
These charges are not meant to be a deterrent,  but  changes  to  the  final
video that were not discussed with us ahead of time still take a great  deal
of additional editing time and excess materials


Q. How do we get our wedding videos/photographs when you are finished?


A. When we inform you that your video is finished, we will ship the  product
or hand-deliver it  to  you  or  to  your  after  wedding  address.  Preview
photographs and final images will be delivered electronically  via  Pixieset
that allows for not only easy online sharing to friends  and  relatives  but
also allows for easy printing of a multitude of print products at  any  size
you desire.
