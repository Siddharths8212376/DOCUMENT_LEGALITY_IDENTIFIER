           Re: Letter of Engagement


Dear [CLIENT REP],


This letter is to confirm your engagement of [AGENCY] (“Agency” or “we”)
for the development of the [PROJECT]. We are very excited to be working
with you and your organization.


Upon execution of this letter of engagement, together we will commence the
discovery phase of our partnership. At the end of discovery, we will
provide the following for your approval:


      • Detailed scope of work and deliverables


      • Fee estimate


Additionally, we wish to agree to the terms and conditions of our
partnership with you via a Master Services Agreement (the “MSA”),
integrating all our commitments to both organizations. We will begin this
conversation by sending you our standard version for your review.


As we finalize the Statement of Work (the “SOW”) and MSA, we will bill you
for the estimated project fee of $[FEE] [OR “ the estimated fee for work
being completed”], which will be payable within [30] days of receipt of our
invoice. When the SOW has been completed, we will adjust future billings to
reconcile to the approved fee.


If either of us terminates this engagement after Agency has begun ideation,
design and development work, and in the event that the MSA or SOW is not
finalized by [EXPIRATION DATE], or if you fail to make the required
payments set out above, we may suspend services pending execution of the
MSA, or payment of amounts due, and invoice you for the work in progress on
a time-and-materials basis at our standard rates. If we do not receive
payment of our invoice as agreed net 30, you will reimburse us for
resulting costs and legal fees.


Please have this letter executed by an authorized representative and fax it
to us at your earliest convenience.


Sincerely,


[AGENCY]
