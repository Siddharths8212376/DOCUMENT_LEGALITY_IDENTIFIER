2.4 All Other Assets (My "Residuary Estate"). I adopt only one Property
Disposition Clause by placing my initials in the box in front of the letter

distribution in clause “C”. If I fail to sign the appropriate
distribution(s) or if I sign in more than one clause or if I fail to place
my initials in the appropriate box, this paragraph 2.4 will be invalid and
I realize that the remainder of my property will be distributed as if I did
not make a will.
