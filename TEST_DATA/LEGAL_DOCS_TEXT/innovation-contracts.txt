One of the biggest flaws with intellectual property law today is that it
restricts the free market's capacity for creative destruction. This is a
problem because creative destruction is the ultimate check against
oligopolies which stifle innovation and limit economic growth (via
assertion of exclusive intellectual property rights).


Innovation Contracts is a new paradigm which shifts the current
intellectual property regime from a property law model of exclusive rights
toward contract law which allows for more nuanced and negotiable mutual
benefits. One of the primary reasons for re-envisioning creativity and
innovation as a contract, between artist/innovator and the public, is that
the concept of efficient breach in contract law - that it's acceptable to
breach a contract if doing so generates enough economic value to compensate
the non-breaching party with a surplus left over - analogizes well with the
concept of creative destruction. Hence, Innovation Contracts essentially
build a mechanism for creative destruction into our free market system. 


We plan to demonstrate the concept through a sample contract wich covers
the subject matter of modern day copyright.
