   3. Status of the bye laws


        1. These bye laws were adopted as bye laws of the Charity by the
           Directors on 14 August 2011, as empowered by a resolution of the
           members of the Charity in General Meeting on 23 February 2011.
           They have subsequently been amended by the Directors in
           September 2013 and May 2014.
        2. Proposals to amend these bye laws shall take the form of a
           resolution at a general meeting, the procedures for which are
           described in the Articles.


   4. Membership of the Charity


        1. Any organisation or individual meeting the criteria for
           membership, as determined from time to time by the Directors,
           may apply for membership of the charity.
        2. The Directors shall at all times have the discretion to reject
           applications for membership if they consider such action to be
           in the best interests of the World Schools Debating
           Championships.
        3. Notwithstanding any other bye law, the Directors may terminate
           the membership of any member in the manner described in article
           4 of the Articles of Association if they reasonably believe that
           a change in the Charity's membership would be in the best
           interests of the World Schools Debating Championships.
        4. The Directors may charge, on behalf of the Charity, such
           reasonable membership fee (as the Directors in their sole
           discretion shall determine) to any applicant for membership, and
           may charge different fees to different members as they
           determine.
        5. The Directors shall at all times maintain a register of the
           members of each class of members of the Charity.
        6. The class to which a member belongs shall indicate that member’s
           country of affiliation for the purposes of the rule below.
        7. Each class of membership (in as much as that class is determined
           by and consists in the indication of the member’s country of
           affiliation) shall be deemed to have an equal voting weight with
           all other such classes at general meetings of the Charity, as
           described in bye law 4.8 .
        8. The votes cast by each class shall be deemed to be one hundred
           in total, and the proportion of that one hundred to be counted
           as votes either for or against a resolution shall be determined
           by the proportion of the members of that class so voting.


   5. The Directors


        1. The Directors shall conduct any activities to further the
           development of the Charity, including, but not limited to:
           strategic development; the creation and maintenance of an alumni
           programme; fundraising efforts; management of funds,
           investments, property and staff; legal issues, the creation of
           learning and publicity materials to further the Charity's aims,
           and the maintenance of strategic partnerships with member
           organisations and other national and international debating
           organisations.
   6. The Tournament Rules


        1. There shall be a set of guidelines for the setting, drawing,
           conduct, format, scoring and
           adjudication of debates held at a Championship, known as the
           Tournament Rules.
        2. The Tournament Rules shall include complaints procedures as
           described in those rules.
        3. The Tournament Rules shall describe the prizes awarded at a
           Championship and define the
           membership of any categories of nations or individuals that may
           be used to award those prizes.
        4. The Tournament Rules shall decide the eligibility of individuals
           to participate in a
           Championship, including defining the meaning of the term Nation
           for the purposes of bye laws 7 and 9, insofar as the assignment
           of an individual to a Nation may be used to determine the
           membership of the Tournament Committee.


   7. The Tournament Committee


        1. There shall be a Tournament Committee for each Championship.
        2. The Tournament Committee shall consist of one adult (coach, team
           manager, adjudicator or observer) from the delegation of each
           Nation participating at a Championship.
        3. Adults representing Nations on the Tournament Committee shall be
           nominated during the registration process by the person
           responsible for registering that Nation's delegation.
        4. The Chairperson of the Tournament Committee Executive shall also
           serve as the Chairperson of the Tournament Committee, unless the
           Chairperson of the Tournament Committee Executive is unavailable
           in which case the Tournament Committee meeting shall be chaired
           by Acting Chairperson who shall be:
              1. The Vice-Chairperson of the Tournament Committee Executive
                 if available, or
              2. A member of the Tournament Committee Executive selected by
                 the available members of the Tournament Committee Executive
                 in the event that both the Chairperson and Vice-Chairperson
                 are unavailable.
        5. The Tournament Committee shall:
              1. vote on proposed changes to the Tournament Rules brought
                 before it by the
                 Tournament Committee Executive, such changes requiring a
                 two-thirds majority of
                 Tournament Committee votes cast either 'yea' or 'nay' to be
                 'yea' votes;
              2. elect the Tournament Committee Executive;
              3. elect a Motions Committee;
              4. elect a Complaints Committee;
              5. choose, by a vote using the first-past-the-post system,
                 between competing candidates
                 to be Hosts of upcoming Championships; and
              6. approve or reject the Host's choice of Chief Adjudicator.
        6. The Tournament Committee shall also receive a report at each
           Championship from each of the Tournament Committee Executive,
           Host and Chief Adjudicator.

        7. Between Championships, the Tournament Committee Executive may
           put resolutions to the Tournament Committee to be approved by
           electronic ballot.


              1. Eligibility to vote depends on the nature of the
                 resolution.


                    1. Subject to 7.7.1.2, for an electronic ballot, an
                       eligible nation is one who has attended at least two
                       of the previous three Championships and taken part in
                       the Tournament Committee meetings held at those
                       Championships (“eligible nation”).


                    2. For an electronic ballot for a resolution to decide
                       whether to cancel or postpone a championship that is
                       already scheduled to take place, an eligible nation
                       has the same meaning as in 7.7.1.1, but also includes
                       any nation which has registered to take part in the
                       championship the subject of the resolution.


              2. Each eligible nation shall give to the Executive an email
                 address for an authorised representative of that nation
                 (“the authorised email address”), and shall update that
                 email address from time to time if the authorised email
                 address changes.


              3. The Executive may propose for an electronic ballot any
                 resolution that could be passed by the Tournament Committee
                 at a meeting of the Committee, including changes to the
                 Rules.


              4. The Executive must propose for an electronic ballot any
                 resolution where at least two eligible nations have asked
                 the Executive to propose it.


              5. At least three weeks before an electronic ballot is to take
                 place, the Executive must send to the authorised email
                 address of each eligible nation notice of any resolution to
                 be proposed. The notice must state:


                    1. the text of the resolution,


                    2. who moved it,


                    3. (in the case of a resolution under 7.7.4) which
                       nations asked the Executive to propose it,


                    4. the period during which the electronic ballot is to
                       occur, and


                    5. the Executive email address to which the ballot must
                       be sent, or the address of the secure online form
                       approved under 7.7.7


              6. An electronic ballot takes place for a period of not less
                 than 24 hours and not longer than 72 hours, measured at the
                 place of the Executive email address (“the electronic
                 ballot period”).


              7. During the electronic ballot period, an eligible nation may
                 cast its vote on each resolution either by email sent from
                 its authorised email address, or by a secure online form
                 approved by the Executive access to which is only available
                 by use of the authorised email address.


              8. At the end of the electronic ballot period, the Executive
                 shall count the number of votes.


              9. (Except for a resolution to amend the Rules, or to decide
                 whether to cancel or postpone a championship that is
                 already scheduled to take place), a resolution is passed by
                 electronic ballot if a majority of eligible nations who
                 submitted votes in the electronic ballot voted yes.


             10. For a resolution to amend the Rules, or to decide whether
                 to cancel or postpone a championship that is already
                 scheduled to take place, a resolution is passed by
                 electronic ballot if at least two thirds of eligible
                 nations who submitted a “yes” or a “no” vote in the
                 electronic ballot voted yes.


             11. For a resolution to amend the Rules, the electronic ballot
                 period must start no less than 60 days prior to the start
                 of the next Championship.


             12. As soon as possible after the Executive has counted the
                 votes, it shall send a notice to the authorised email
                 address of each eligible nation the result of the vote on
                 each resolution.


             13. If the Tournament Committee is voting on an issue for which
                 a two-thirds majority is not required, in the event of a
                 tied vote the casting vote shall be made by the Chairperson
                 of the Tournament Committee Executive, or the Acting
                 Chairperson (as outlined in 7.4.) in the event that the
                 Chairperson is unable to do so.



   8. The Tournament Committee Executive


        1. There shall be a Tournament Committee Executive for the term
           between each Championship.
        2. The members of the Tournament Committee Executive shall be:
              1. a Chairperson elected by the Tournament Committee;
              2. a Vice-Chairperson elected by the Tournament Committee;
              3. a Secretary elected by the Tournament Committee;
              4. six members, elected by the Tournament Committee.
        3. The elected members shall hold office from the Tournament
           Committee meeting at which they are elected until the following
           Tournament Committee meeting.
        4. No person shall serve in any one of the capacities of
           Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson or Secretary of the Tournament
           Committee Executive for more than five consecutive terms of
           office.
        5. The Tournament Committee Executive shall be responsible for
           action in areas concerning the hosting arrangements or
           tournament rules of current or future Championships falling
           outside the responsibilities of the Charity or Host, and will
           focus on key issues through its working groups.
        6. The Chairperson shall determine which areas each working group
           shall focus on and which of the elected members shall chair each
           working group.
        7. The Tournament Executive Committee may provide interpretation of
           the Tournament Rules to the Host or Chief Adjudicator of the
           current or future Championships as and when required.


   9. The Host


        1. There shall be a Host for each debating tournament considered by
           the Charity to be a World Schools Debating Championship.
        2. Organisations may apply to the Charity to be candidates to host
           the Championship for a particular year.
        3. Those organisations meeting the minimum criteria for candidacy,
           as decided by the Directors, shall be eligible to be chosen as
           Host for a particular year.
        4. That choice shall be made by the Tournament Committee, up to
           three Championships in advance of the Championship for which the
           bid is made, according to the following procedures.
              1. If the Directors approve more than one bid, the Tournament
                 Committee shall first vote to select a Final Applicant from
                 among the bids.
              2. If there are more than two bids and no applicant receives
                 more votes than all the other applicants combined, a second
                 round of voting will be held involving the two applicants
                 which had the highest numbers of votes in the first round
                 to determine the Final Applicant.
              3. Once the Final Applicant has been determined, the
                 Tournament Committee will then vote on a resolution that
                 the Final Applicant shall be the Host for the Championship.
              4. If a majority of members voting on that resolution do not
                 vote in favour, no host is selected.
        5. Once chosen, the Host has the right to call their debating
           tournament the World Schools Debating Championship for the year
           in which it is held.
        6. If chosen, Hosts must ensure that their debating tournament
           complies with these bye laws, the Tournament Rules, and any
           contractual obligations imposed by the charity.
        7. The officers of the Charity may from time to time request
           information from a Host. This implies neither an oversight role
           nor responsibility to act on that information.
        8. If a Host does not comply with these bye laws, the Tournament
           Rules, or their contractual obligations, or if the Directors so
           choose for any other reason, the Charity may withdraw from a
           Host the right to call their debating tournament the World
           Schools Debating Championship for a particular year.

              1. For a Championship held in 2014, the Tournament Committee
                 will be asked to consider an electronic ballot as to
                 whether to withdraw the right of the existing host to call
                 its competition the World Schools Debating Championships.
                 Should acceptable alternative bids be advanced, the
                 Tournament Committee would be asked, in a separate ballot,
                 to consider whether those alternative qualifying hosts
                 should be accepted.


                    1. Such qualifying bids are to be confirmed by the
                       Directors, as per 9.3.


                    2. The ballot(s) will be held in accordance with 7.7,
                       with the following modifications:


                         1. The reference in 7.7.5 to “three weeks” is
                            changed to “5 days”.


                         2. The ballot is only valid if at least two thirds
                            of eligible nations vote "yes" or "no".


                         3. The ballot(s) shall be supervised by two
                            independent returning officers, to be appointed
                            by the Directors. A representative of each of
                            the Directors and the Executive will oversee
                            the work of the independent returning officers.


                    3. Nothing in these bylaws affects the power of the
                       Directors to make any decision they are empowered to
                       make under bylaw 9.8.
