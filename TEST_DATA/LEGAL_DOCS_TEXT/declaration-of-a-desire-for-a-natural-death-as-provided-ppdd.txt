§90-321. Right to a natural death:


(d1) The following form is specifically determined to meet the requirements
of subsection (c) of this section:


            ADVANCE DIRECTIVE FOR A NATURAL DEATH ("LIVING WILL")


NOTE: YOU SHOULD USE THIS DOCUMENT TO GIVE YOUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS
INSTRUCTIONS TO WITHHOLD OR WITHDRAW LIFE?PROLONGING MEASURES IN CERTAIN
SITUATIONS. THERE IS NO LEGAL REQUIREMENT THAT ANYONE EXECUTE A LIVING
WILL.


GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS: You can use this Advance Directive ("Living Will")
form to give instructions for the future if you want your health care
providers to withhold or withdraw life?prolonging measures in certain
situations. You should talk to your doctor about what these terms mean. The
Living Will states what choices you would have made for yourself if you
were able to communicate. Talk to your family members, friends, and others
you trust about your choices. Also, it is a good idea to talk with
professionals such as your doctors, clergypersons, and lawyers before you
complete and sign this Living Will.


You do not have to use this form to give those instructions, but if you
create your own Advance Directive you need to be very careful to ensure
that it is consistent with North Carolina law.


This Living Will form is intended to be valid in any jurisdiction in which
it is presented, but places outside North Carolina may impose requirements
that this form does not meet.


If you want to use this form, you must complete it, sign it, and have your
signature witnessed by two qualified witnesses and proved by a notary
public. Follow the instructions about which choices you can initial very
carefully. Do not sign this form until two witnesses and a notary public
are present to watch you sign it. You then should consider giving a copy to
your primary physician and/or a trusted relative, and should consider
filing it with the Advanced Health Care Directive Registry maintained by
the North Carolina Secretary of State: http://www.nclifelinks.org/ahcdr/


                        My Desire for a Natural Death


I, ____________________, being of sound mind, desire that, as specified
below, my life not be prolonged by life?prolonging measures:


1. When My Directives Apply


My directions about prolonging my life shall apply IF my attending
physician determines that I lack capacity to make or communicate health
care decisions and:


NOTE: YOU MAY INITIAL ANY AND ALL OF THESE CHOICES.


_________ I have an incurable or irreversible condition that will result
(Initial) in my death within a relatively short period of time.


_________ I become unconscious and my health care providers
(Initial) determine that, to a high degree of medical certainty, I will
never regain my consciousness.


_________ I suffer from advanced dementia or any other condition
(Initial) which results in the substantial loss of my cognitive ability
and my health care providers determine that, to a high
degree of medical certainty, this loss is not reversible.


2. These are My Directives about Prolonging My Life:


In those situations I have initialed in Section 1, I direct that my health
care providers:


NOTE: INITIAL ONLY IN ONE PLACE.


_________ may withhold or withdraw life?prolonging measures.


(Initial)


_________ shall withhold or withdraw life?prolonging measures.


(Initial)


3. Exceptions – "Artificial Nutrition or Hydration"


NOTE: INITIAL ONLY IF YOU WANT TO MAKE EXCEPTIONS TO YOUR INSTRUCTIONS IN
PARAGRAPH 2.


EVEN THOUGH I do not want my life prolonged in those situations I have
initialed in Section 1:


_________ I DO want to receive BOTH artificial hydration AND
(Initial) artificial nutrition (for example, through tubes) in those
situations.


NOTE: DO NOT INITIAL THIS BLOCK IF ONE OF THE BLOCKS BELOW IS INITIALED.


_________ I DO want to receive ONLY artificial hydration (for
(Initial) example, through tubes) in those situations.



NOTE: DO NOT INITIAL THE BLOCK ABOVE OR BELOW IF THIS BLOCK IS INITIALED.


_________ I DO want to receive ONLY artificial nutrition (for
(Initial) example, through tubes) in those situations.


NOTE: DO NOT INITIAL EITHER OF THE TWO BLOCKS ABOVE IF THIS BLOCK IS
INITIALED.


4. I Wish to be Made as Comfortable as Possible


I direct that my health care providers take reasonable steps to keep me as
clean, comfortable, and free of pain as possible so that my dignity is
maintained, even though this care may hasten my death.


5. I Understand my Advance Directive


I am aware and understand that this document directs certain
life?prolonging measures to be withheld or discontinued in accordance with
my advance instructions.


6. If I have an Available Health Care Agent


If I have appointed a health care agent by executing a health care power of
attorney or similar instrument, and that health care agent is acting and
available and gives instructions that differ from this Advance Directive,
then I direct that:


_________ Follow Advance Directive: This Advance Directive will
(Initial) override instructions my health care agent gives about
prolonging my life.


_________ Follow Health Care Agent: My health care agent has
(Initial) authority to override this Advance Directive.


NOTE: DO NOT INITIAL BOTH BLOCKS. IF YOU DO NOT INITIAL EITHER BOX, THEN
YOUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WILL FOLLOW THIS ADVANCE DIRECTIVE AND IGNORE
THE INSTRUCTIONS OF YOUR HEALTH CARE AGENT ABOUT PROLONGING YOUR LIFE.


7. My Health Care Providers May Rely on this Directive


My health care providers shall not be liable to me or to my family, my
estate, my heirs, or my personal representative for following the
instructions I give in this instrument. Following my directions shall not
be considered suicide, or the cause of my death, or malpractice or
unprofessional conduct. If I have revoked this instrument but my health
care providers do not know that I have done so, and they follow the
instructions in this instrument in good faith, they shall be entitled to
the same protections to which they would have been entitled if the
instrument had not been revoked.


8. I Want this Directive to be Effective Anywhere


I intend that this Advance Directive be followed by any health care
provider in any place.


9. I have the Right to Revoke this Advance Directive


I understand that at any time I may revoke this Advance Directive in a
writing I sign or by communicating in any clear and consistent manner my
intent to revoke it to my attending physician. I understand that if I
revoke this instrument I should try to destroy all copies of it.


This the ________ day of ____________, _________.
