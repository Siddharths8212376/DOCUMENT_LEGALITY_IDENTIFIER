Issue Date: December         , 2010

THIS WARRANT CERTIFIES THAT, for value received as consideration pursuant
to that certain Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement, dated December 29,
2010, by and among the Company and the Investors named therein (the
Â“Purchase AgreementÂ”), and for other good and valuable consideration the
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged,
                                 (Â“HolderÂ”) is entitled to purchase up
to                         (            ) fully paid and nonassessable
shares of the CompanyÂ’s common stock, $0.001 par value per share (the
Â“SharesÂ”), at the Exercise Price, all as set forth herein, subject to the
provisions and upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Warrant.


ARTICLE 1. EXERCISE.


1.1 Method of Exercise. Holder may exercise this Warrant by delivering a
duly executed Notice of Exercise in substantially the form attached as
Appendix 1 hereto to the principal office of the Company. Unless Holder is
exercising the net exercise right set forth in Section 1.2, Holder shall
also deliver to the Company a check or wire transfer (to an account
designated by the Company), for the aggregate Exercise Price for the Shares
being purchased.


1.2 Net Exercise. In lieu of exercising this Warrant as specified in
Section 1.1 for cash, the Holder may elect to receive shares equal to the
value of this Warrant (or the portion thereof being exercised) by
surrendering this Warrant at the principal office of the Company and the
Company shall issue to such Holder a number of Shares computed using the
following formula:

|  | |       |
|X | |Y (A - |
|= | |B)     |
|  | |A      |


Where


X =     The number of Shares to be issued to the Holder.


1

| |Y|The number of Shares purchasable under this Warrant or, if only |
| | |a portion of the Warrant is being exercised, the portion of the |
| |=|Warrant being cancelled (at the date of such calculation).      |

| |A |The fair market value of one (1) Share (as determined      |
| |= |pursuant to Section 1.3).                                  |

| |B |The Exercise  |
| |= |Price.        |


1.3 Fair Market Value. If the common stock of the Company, $0.001 par value
per share (the Â“Common StockÂ”) is traded in a public market, the fair
market value of each Share shall be the closing price of a share of Common
Stock reported for the business day immediately before Holder delivers its
Notice of Exercise to the Company (or in the instance where the Warrant is
exercised immediately prior to the effectiveness of the CompanyÂ’s initial
public offering, the Â“price to publicÂ” per share price specified in the
final prospectus relating to such offering). If the Common Stock is not
traded in a public market, then the Board of Directors of the Company shall
determine fair market value in its reasonable good faith judgment.


1.4 Delivery of Certificate and New Warrant. Promptly after Holder
exercises or net exercises this Warrant and, if applicable, the Company
receives payment of the aggregate Exercise Price, the Company shall deliver
to Holder certificates for the Shares acquired and, if this Warrant has not
been fully exercised or net exercised and has not expired, a new Warrant
representing the Shares not so acquired.


1.5 Replacement of Warrants. On receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory
to the Company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this
Warrant and, in the case of loss, theft or destruction, on delivery of an
indemnity agreement reasonably satisfactory in form and amount to the
Company or, in the case of mutilation, on surrender and cancellation of
this Warrant, the Company shall execute and deliver, in lieu of this
Warrant, a new warrant of like tenor.


ARTICLE 2. ADJUSTMENTS TO THE SHARES.


2.1 Stock Dividends, Splits, Combinations, Etc. If the Company declares or
pays a dividend on the Shares payable in Common Stock, or other securities,
then upon exercise of this Warrant, for each Share acquired, Holder shall
receive, without cost to Holder, the total number and kind of securities to
which Holder would have been entitled had Holder owned the Shares of record
as of the date the dividend occurred. If the Company subdivides the Shares
by reclassification or otherwise into a greater number of shares or takes
any other action which increases the amount of stock into which the Shares
are convertible, the number of shares purchasable hereunder shall be
proportionately increased and the Exercise Price shall be proportionately
decreased. If the outstanding shares of the Company are combined or
consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of
shares, the Exercise Price shall be proportionately increased and the
number of Shares shall be proportionately decreased.


2


2.2 Reclassification, Exchange or Substitution, Etc. Upon any
reclassification, exchange, substitution, or other event that results in a
change of the number and/or class of the securities issuable upon exercise
or net exercise of this Warrant, Holder shall be entitled to receive, upon
exercise or net exercise of this Warrant, the number and kind of securities
and property that Holder would have received for the Shares if this Warrant
had been exercised immediately before such reclassification, exchange,
substitution, or other event. The Company or its successor shall promptly
issue to Holder an amendment to this Warrant setting forth the number and
kind of such new securities or other property issuable upon exercise or net
exercise of this Warrant as a result of such reclassification, exchange,
substitution or other event that results in a change of the number and/or
class of securities issuable upon exercise or net exercise of this Warrant.



2.3 Merger or Consolidation. Upon any capital reorganization of the
CompanyÂ’s capital stock (other than a subdivision, combination,
reclassification or exchange of shares provided for elsewhere in this
Section 2) or a merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another
corporation, then as a part of such reorganization, merger or
consolidation, provision shall be made so that the Holder shall thereafter
be entitled to receive upon the exercise or net exercise of this Warrant,
the number and kind of securities and property of the Company, or of the
successor corporation resulting from such reorganization, merger or
consolidation, to which that Holder would have received for the Shares if
this Warrant had been exercised immediately before such reorganization,
merger or consolidation.


2.4 Fractional Shares. No fractional Shares shall be issuable upon exercise
or net exercise of this Warrant and the number of Shares to be issued shall
be rounded down to the nearest whole Share. If a fractional share interest
arises upon any exercise or net exercise of the Warrant, the Company shall
eliminate such fractional share interest by paying Holder an amount in cash
computed by multiplying the fractional interest by the fair market value of
a full Share (as determined pursuant to Section 1.3).


2.5 Certificate as to Adjustments. Upon each adjustment of the Exercise
Price, the Company shall promptly notify Holder in writing, and, at the
CompanyÂ’s expense, promptly compute such adjustment, and furnish Holder
with a certificate of its Chief Financial Officer or other officer setting
forth such adjustment and the facts upon which such adjustment is based.
The Company shall furnish Holder a certificate setting forth the Exercise
Price in effect upon the date thereof and the series of adjustments leading
to such Exercise Price.


ARTICLE 3. COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY.


3.1 Notice of Certain Events. If the Company proposes at any time (a) to
declare any dividend or distribution upon any of its stock, whether in
cash, property, stock, or other securities and whether or not a regular
cash dividend; (b) to effect any reclassification or recapitalization of
any of its stock; or (c) to merge or consolidate with or into any other
corporation, or sell, lease, license, or convey all or substantially all of
its assets, or to liquidate, dissolve or wind up, then, in connection with
each such event, the Company shall give Holder: (1) at least three (3) days
prior written notice of the date on which a record will be taken for such
dividend, distribution, or subscription rights (and specifying the date on
which the holders of Common Stock will be entitled thereto) or for
determining rights to vote, if any, in respect of the


3


matters referred to in (a) above; and (2) in the case of the matters
referred to in (b) and (c) above at least three (3) days prior written
notice of the date when the same will take place (and specifying the date
on which the holders of Common Stock will be entitled to exchange their
Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon the
occurrence of such event).


3.2 No Stockholder Rights or Liabilities. Except as provided in this
Warrant, the Holder will not have any rights as a stockholder of the
Company until the exercise of this Warrant. Absent an affirmative action by
the Holder to purchase the Shares, the Holder shall not have any liability
as a stockholder of the Company.


3.3 Closing of Books. The Company will at no time close its transfer books
against the transfer of this Warrant or of any Shares issued or issuable
upon the exercise of this Warrant in any manner which interferes with the
timely exercise of this Warrant.

imprinted with a legend in substantially the following form:


THIS WARRANT AND THE SHARES ISSUABLE HEREUNDER HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED
UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE Â“ACTÂ”), OR THE
SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD OR OTHERWISE
TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED UNLESS AND UNTIL REGISTERED UNDER SAID
ACT AND APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAW OR, IN THE OPINION OF LEGAL COUNSEL
IN FORM AND SUBSTANCE SATISFACTORY TO THE ISSUER OF THESE SECURITIES, SUCH

(180) days) (i) lend; offer; pledge; sell; contract to sell; sell any
option or contract to purchase; purchase any option or contract to sell;
grant any option, right, or warrant to purchase; or otherwise transfer or

other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of

such transaction described in clause (i) or (ii) above is to be settled by
delivery of common stock or other securities, in cash, or otherwise.

4.4 Additional Stockholder Agreements. Upon the exercise or net exercise of
this Warrant, the Holder agrees that the Shares shall be subject to the

4.5 Transfers. This Warrant and the Shares issuable upon exercise of this
Warrant (and the securities issuable, directly or indirectly, upon
conversion of the Shares, if any) may not be transferred or assigned in
whole or in part without compliance with applicable federal and state
securities laws by the transferor and the transferee (including, without
limitation, the delivery of investment representation letters and legal
opinions reasonably satisfactory to the Company, as reasonably requested by
the Company). Subject to the foregoing, this Warrant and the Shares
issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be transferable only in
accordance with Transaction Agreements. After compliance with all
restrictions on transfer set forth in this Section 4.5, and within a
reasonable time after the CompanyÂ’s receipt of an executed Assignment Form
in the form attached hereto, the transfer shall be recorded on the books of
the Company upon the surrender of this Warrant, properly endorsed, to the
Company at its principal offices, and the payment to the Company of all
transfer taxes and other governmental charges imposed on such transfer. In
the event of a partial transfer, the Company shall issue to the new holders
one or more appropriate new warrants.

discharged or terminated only by an instrument in writing signed by the
party against which enforcement of such change, waiver, discharge or
termination is sought.

which together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect
