      Re: Advisory Services to [[[COMPANY]]]


Dear [[[ADVISOR]]]:


This letter agreement is to confirm our understanding with respect  to  your
role  as  an  advisor  to  [[Company]],  a   [DELAWARE]   corporation   (the
“Company”). The Company looks forward to  a  continued  mutually  beneficial
association  with  you  on  the  following  terms,  which  are  hereby  made
effective as of [[Date]] (the “Effective Date”):


   1. Services. From time to time, I  and  possibly  other  members  of  the
      Company’s management may contact you to provide advice relating to the
      Company’s business. We are  expecting  you  to  be  available  to  the
      Company’s management for consultations by telephone, mail or in person
      (for good reason), as your time and other business activities  permit.
      We also would like you to attend meetings,  if  reasonably  necessary,
      which we anticipate will occur infrequently.
   2. Compensation. The Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”)  has
      approved the right and authorization for  you  the  right  to  receive
      shares of the Company’s Common Stock, of which shall vest  immediately
      upon execution of this Agreement (the “Stock Award”), subject  to  the
      restrictions set forth in the Restricted Stock Award Agreement  to  be
      entered into by and between you and the Company. For so  long  as  you
      remain an active advisor to the Company, the Stock Award will vest  on
      a pro rata monthly basis over  a  -month  period  beginning  with  the
      Effective Date. There will also be a chance to accelerate your vesting
      if  certain  milestones  are  met.  For  example,  upon  a  merger  or
      acquisition of the Company, your interests  will  accelerate  to  full
      vesting of all your unvested shares, if any.
   3. Independent Contractor. Until you undertake any executive  or  officer
      position with the Company, your relationship with the Company will  be
      that of an independent contractor, and  you  will  not  be  an  agent,
      employee or representative of the Company.  You  understand  that  you
      will have no authority to enter into contracts or  create  obligations
      on behalf the Company. Accordingly, until such time,  you  acknowledge
      that you will not be eligible for any employee benefits, and that  the
      Company will not make any tax withholdings on your behalf.  You  agree
      that you are obligated to report as income all consideration that  you
      receive in connection with your services under this letter  agreement,
      and you agree to pay all self-employment and other taxes thereon.
   4. Section 83(b). You will be responsible to file a Section 83(b)  notice
      with the IRS within 30 days following the date the Restricted Stock is
      granted to you.
   5. Property of the  Company.  For  purposes  of  this  letter  agreement,
      “Designs  and  Materials”  shall  mean   all   designs,   discoveries,
      inventions, products,  computer  programs,  procedures,  improvements,
      developments, drawings, notes, documents,  information  and  materials
      made, conceived or developed by you alone or with others  that  result
      from or that are made, conceived or developed in connection  with  the
      services you provide to the Company pursuant to this letter agreement.
      You hereby irrevocably transfer and assign to the Company any and  all
      of your right, title and interest in and  to  Designs  and  Materials,
      including but not limited to  all  copyrights,  patent  rights,  trade
      secrets, trademarks and moral  rights.  You  agree:  (a)  to  disclose
      promptly in writing to the Company all Designs and Materials;  (b)  to
      cooperate with and assist the Company to apply for, and to execute any
      applications and/or assignments  to  obtain,  any  patent,  copyright,
      trademark or other legal protection for Designs and Materials  in  the
      Company’s name as the Company deems appropriate; and (c) to  otherwise
      treat all Designs and  Materials  as  “Confidential  Information,”  as
      defined below.
   6. Confidential  Information.  You  recognize  that,  in  the  course  of
      performing your services under this letter agreement, you will acquire
      information  and  materials  from  the  Company  and  knowledge  about
      information of a confidential or secret nature concerning the Company,
      including without limitation, knowledge about the Company’s  business,
      products and planned products, marketing plans, financial information,
      forecasts, personnel, customers, clients, suppliers, experimental work
      and  programming  techniques.  All  such  knowledge,  information  and
      materials acquired, the existence, terms and conditions of this letter
      agreement, and all Designs and Materials, are and will  be  the  trade
      secrets and confidential and proprietary information  of  the  Company
      (collectively, the “Confidential Information”). You agree to hold  all
      such Confidential Information in strict confidence, not to disclose it
      to others or use it in any way, commercially or  otherwise  (including
      without limitation lecturing upon or  publishing  articles  concerning
      Confidential Information), except in performing your obligations under
      this letter agreement, and not to allow any unauthorized person access
      to  it.  Confidential  Information  will  not  include,  however,  any
      information which is or becomes part of the public domain  through  no
      fault of yours, is independently  developed  by  you  without  use  or
      reference to any Confidential Information, is authorized  for  release
      by prior written consent of the Company, is required to  be  disclosed
      by law, or that the Company regularly gives to third  parties  without
      restriction on use or disclosure. You agree to return to  the  Company
      promptly  upon  request,  and  in  any  event  after  termination   or
      expiration of this letter agreement, any and all records, paper, media
      or other embodiment containing any Confidential Information.
   7. Conflicts of Interest; Non-Contravention. You  hereby  represent  that
      the obligations contemplated hereby do not, in any way, conflict with,
      violate or breach any other agreement and/or commitment on your  part,
      including any employment agreement or policies of your  employer.  You
      agree to inform the Company  promptly  and  in  writing  if  any  such
      conflict, violation or breach arises. You  agree  that  you  will  not
      disclose to the Company any proprietary information that you currently
      have obtained, or may obtain in the future, from any other  individual
      or organization.
   8. Non-Solicitation. During the term in which you provide services to the
      Company pursuant to this letter agreement and for one year thereafter,
      you will not directly or indirectly  solicit  away  any  employees  or
      consultants of the Company for your benefit or for the benefit of  any
      other person or entity.
   9. Termination. Either you or  the  Company  may  terminate  this  letter
      agreement on delivery of  written  notice  to  the  other  party.  The
      provisions of Sections 4, 5,  6,  7,  8,  9  and  10  of  this  letter
      agreement will survive any expiration or termination  of  this  letter
      agreement.
  10. Interpretation. The terms  contained  in  this  letter  agreement  are
      subject to interpretation under the laws of the State  of  California,
      without giving effect to that body of laws pertaining to  conflict  of
      laws, and can be amended only in writing and  by  joint  agreement  of
      both you and the Company. If any provision of this letter agreement is
      determined by any court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction to  be
      invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such provision  will
      be enforced to the maximum extent possible given  the  intent  of  the
      parties  hereto.  If  such  provision  cannot  be  so  enforced,  such
      provision shall  be  stricken  from  this  letter  agreement  and  the
      remainder of this letter  agreement  shall  be  enforced  as  if  such
      invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had  (to  the  extent  not
      enforceable) never been contained in the letter agreement. This letter
      agreement constitutes the complete  and  exclusive  understanding  and
      agreement  of  you  and  the  Company   and   supersedes   all   prior
      understanding and agreements, whether written or oral, with respect to
      the subject matter hereof. This letter agreement may  be  executed  in
      two  or  more  counterparts,  including  by  facsimile  or  electronic
      signature transmission, with the same force and effect as if  each  of
      the signatories had executed the same instrument.


      If the foregoing represents your understanding  of  your  role  as  an
advisor to the Company, please sign below and  return  the  executed  letter
agreement to me. The enclosed  copy  is  for  your  files.  Once  again,  we
appreciate your interest in [[[COMPANY]]] and look forward to a  stimulating
and mutually beneficial association with you.


                                             Very truly yours,


                                             [[Company]]
