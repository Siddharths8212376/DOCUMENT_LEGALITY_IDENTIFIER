Email: [WRITER EMAIL]

                             Terms & Conditions


   1. SERVICES; PROJECT. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
      herein, Client hereby engages Writer to perform, and Writer agrees to
      perform, professional freelance writing services (“Work”) to be
      performed on/for the following project (s): [LIST PROJECT(S)]
      (“Project”) 


   2. DELIVERABLES; DISCRETION. Upon completion, Writer shall submit the
      completed Project in written form in format reasonably acceptable to
      Client. Subject to the terms set forth herein, including Paragraph 3
      below, the manner and method of producing the Project is solely at the
      discretion of Writer as long as they comply with Client requirements,
      which Client shall communicate in writing to Writer. Writer is obliged
      to work only on the Project and the Client is not entitled to
      demand Writer's engagement in another project unless or until Client
      and Writer enter into a separate agreement to cover such project on
      mutually agreed-upon terms. 


   3. OBLIGATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF WRITER. 

      (a) Upon submitting the Project to the Client, Writer represents and
      warrants that the Project (or any part of it):


         o is plagiarism-free and original (is not owned by any third party
           fully or partially and does not contain any previously produced
           text, “copy-pasting”); 
         o contains full and absolutely correct references to third-party
           authors; 
         o contains quotations of texts by third-party authors that are no
           longer than one (1) sentence or fifteen (15) words per each
           quote, and not exceeding 15% of the total Project text, with
           obligatory indication of page or paragraph of cited source; 
         o complies with all requirements provided by
           the Client (formatting style is considered a requirement) 
         o has not been obtained by unlawful means; 
         o has not been previously published in any manner or medium,
           specifically including but not limited to, print or electronic
           means.

           This is too heavy a burden to put on the writer. You should use
           a standard of reasonableness. Absolute guarantees are very
           dangerous because they're easily invoked. Suppose, for example,
           that the writer cites a reference that she believes is accurate
           because it appears multiple times on the web, but it's not
           actually accurate.


      (b) The Writer acknowledges and agrees that if they fail to adequately
      complete the Project by the due date the Client has the sole right to
      cancel this Agreement; provided that Client must pay Writer a
      reasonable prorated amount of the Fees proportionate to that portion
      of the Project completed to date. If the Writer fails to meet
      the Project deadline, they must contact the Client to request deadline
      extension at least 24 hours prior to the due date. Extension is not
      guaranteed and can be granted in Client’s sole discretion. 

      (c) The Project must conform to general readability standards as
      determined by the Client. Writer acknowledges and represents that if
      the Project fails to conform to the general readability standards,
      the Client has the sole right to request immediate revision
      of Project, deny payment, and/or cancel this Agreement. If
      the Project is deemed inappropriate by the Client at the time of
      submission or publication, either for content or other reasons,
      the Client has the sole right to request immediate revision
      of Project, deny payment, and/or refuse to use any portion of the
      Project in any publication related to the business of Client or
      otherwise.

      Some states require payment for work done regardless of acceptability.
      Regardless of state law, though, all contracts should have that
      provision. Which means the client has to monitor the work closely,
      esp. in early stages of the project and with writers new to her. You
      can help the client do this by writing milestones into the contract
      and scheduling reviews of your progress at every milestone. You should
      give the client a short period of time to do the review and provide
      that if he skips or ignores it, the milestone is deemed completed.
       
   4. COMPENSATION; CHANGES. Client agrees to pay Writer:

      $___________ per hour 

      If the parameters of the Project changes, or if it involves much more
      time than originally estimated, Writer will inform Client and they can
      renegotiate the rate. Writer will bill for half of the total estimated
      cost when Writer begins the Work and the rest upon completion. Writer
      will submit the final invoice for the Work upon receiving approval
      from Client. If Writer has not received any comments or revisions
      within a week of submitting a completed draft, Writer will send the
      invoice. Writer requires half of the total estimate cost up front
      before beginning a rush job if for a first-time client.

      Writer requires a purchase order number or an initialized agreement
      before beginning Work. Incidental expenses such as long distance phone
      calls, postage, courier service, are absorbed by Writer. Mileage to
      special events or interviews is billed at the rate currently accepted
      by the IRS. Writer is responsible for the payment of all federal,
      state and/or local taxes with respect to the Work he/she performs for
      the Client as an independent contractor. The Client will not treat
      Writer as an employee for any purpose. 

      Any verbal or written changes made by Client to the scope of the Work
      following its initiation by Writer are subject to additional charges.
      Should such changes negate any part of the Work already completed at
      the time of the changes, Client accepts responsibility for payment of
      the completed work and all services related to it, in addition to
      charges for the change itself. 
       
   5. PAYMENT AND COLLECTION; JURISDICTION. Unless otherwise specified in
      writing, invoices not paid within 30 days of the invoice date will
      accrue interest at 1.5% per month. Client agrees to pay for each check
      returned for insufficient funds or any other reason $25 per occurrence
      or 5% of the value of each returned item, whichever is greater. Client
      agrees to pay all reasonable attorney’s fees (at least 15% of all
      amounts due, including interest) if any account is placed with an
      attorney for collection. Client agrees that the purchase of the
      services described herein constitutes “doing business” in the State of
      [WRITER'S RESIDENCE] and submits itself to the jurisdiction of the
      State of [JURISDICTION] with respect to any suit brought by Writer to
      collect any sums hereunder. The parties agree that the only venue for
      any suit brought by either of them with respect to the services sold
      hereunder shall be in the State Court of [VENUE] County. 
       
   6. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR STATUS. 

      (a) The parties expressly agree and acknowledge that the relationship
      created by this Agreement is one of Independent Contractor. Writer is
      not the employer of the Client. The Writer agrees to be treated as an
      Independent Contractor for all employment purposes. Therefore, no
      payroll deductions for employment taxes or insurance of any kind shall
      be paid by the Client for or on Writer's behalf. Payroll deductions,
      employment taxes and insurance that are subject to this paragraph
      include but are not limited to FICA, federal, state, and local income
      tax withholding; state disability insurance; state unemployment
      insurance; and workers compensation insurance. 

      (b) In order to meet State and Federal rules and regulations
      applicable to Independent Contractor status, the Writer must meet the
      following criteria: (i) be engaged in a distinct occupation or
      business; (ii) perform services without direct supervision; (iii)
      provide tools & equipment for said services; and (iv) provide business
      license, and/or Federal I.D. number, or valid Social Security Number. 

      (c) The Writer shall not hold [HIMSELF/HERSELF] out to the public as
      an employee, agent, or partner of or with the Client. The Client is
      engaged in the business of [CLIENT'S BUSINESS] and is not an employer,
      partner or joint venture of or with the Writer.

      In California, in WFH contracts with writers and other creators of
      copyrightable material, the creators have to be hired as employees,
      not contractors. Check it out with the state's Employment Development
      Dept.
       
   7. MATERIALS. The Client agrees to furnish the Writer with all necessary
      materials needed to complete the Work described herein. Such materials
      may include, but are not limited to, podcast files, articles, training
      documents, client’s products, passwords/logins, marketing collateral,
      feedback and guidance on what the Client’s objectives are, and other
      materials. 
       
   8. TERM; TERMINATION. This Agreement will begin on the Effective Date set
      forth above and shall continue until terminated as provided herein by
      either party. If either party violates a term of this Agreement, then
      the other party (the "Non-breaching Party") may terminate this
      Agreement, effective immediately upon delivery of written notice of
      termination by the Non-breaching Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
      either party may terminate this Agreement at any time for any or no
      reason, effective upon three (3) days written notice. Upon written or
      verbal cancellation, Client is responsible for payment for all
      expenses incurred and any Work performed by Writer toward the
      completion of the project based on the percentage of project
      completed. Should Client cancel the project following its completion,
      Client is responsible for full payment as per the above estimate plus
      all other expenses incurred. 
       
   9. OWNERSHIP/COPYRIGHT. All original Work created for this project shall
      be considered “work-for-hire” performed in the United States of
      America. The copyright for all Work produced under this agreement
      shall belong to the Writer until 100% of payment has been received.
      Upon receiving full payment, the Writer shall transfer all rights to
      the Client. Client shall exclusively own in perpetuity all now known
      or hereafter existing rights of every nature worldwide pertaining to
      such Work in or as part of any version of the Client’s publications
      that are published in print or displayed through computer-assisted and
      other interactive media such as the Internet and World Wide Web
      (collectively the "Rights"). Writer hereby irrevocably grants and
      assigns to the Client all Rights for the Work free from any
      restrictions and limitations.

      In WFH, the client has the copyright from the start. It never belongs
      to the writer. That's is distinctive about WFH and it's one of the
      primary reasons that clients use it.

      All the language in this section about the writer granting rights
      should be deleted. The language would be appropriate in a standard
      freelance agreement but not here. And since this contract is
      boilerplate, it would be a good idea to include the following quote
      from the copyright law defining the kinds of works that can be created
      in a WFH contract. This is from Section 101, Copyright Act of 1976
      (USC 17 §101):

      A work made for hire is
      (1) a work prepared by an employee within the scope of his or her
      employment; or
      (2) a work specially ordered or commissioned for use
           as a contribution to a collective work,
           as a part of a motion picture or other audiovisual work,
           as a translation,
           as a supplementary work,
           as a compilation,
           as an instructional text,
           as a test,
           as answer material for a test, or
           as an atlas,
      if the parties expressly agree in a written instrument signed by them
      that the work shall be considered a work made for hire.

      If a WFH contract is used with other kinds of works, the copyright
      remains with the writer. Because of this, WFH contracts often have a
      provision that if WFH doesn't apply, the writer transfers all rights
      anyway.
       
  10. CONFIDENTIALITY. The Writer agrees to abide by the provisions of the
      Personal Information Protection of Electronic Documents Act and that
      any and all information provided by the Client (the “Information”)
      shall be kept strictly confidential. The Consultant agrees not to, at
      any time, or in any manner, either directly or indirectly, use any
      information for the Consultant’s own benefit, or divulge, disclose, or
      communicate in any manner any information to any third party without
      the prior written consent of the Client. The confidentiality
      provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect
      after the termination of this Agreement.

      This section as written is unenforceable in most, maybe all, states.
      It is far too restrictive.

      The only information that the writer should hold confidential is info
      whose disclosure would actually and directly hurt the client. It's up
      to the client to identify all such information beforehand (clients can
      use a rubber stamp saying "Confidential" or a note on the title page
      of a document). The writer can be required to exercise reasonable
      judgement when in doubt, but she should verify her judgement as
      quickly as possible.

      Also, the info should be held confidential only as long as necessary,
      that is, only for as long as divulging it would actually and directly
      hurt the client and rarely more than a year. For instance, the designs
      for this year's fall fashion shows shouldn't be divulged before the
      shows, but once the fashions are in the stores, there's no point in
      holding the designs confidential.
       
  11. INDEMNIFICATION. Client agrees to hold Writer harmless for any such
      damages that may arise from Writer’s work product. In no event shall
      Writer be liable for any direct, indirect, punitive, incidental,
      special consequential damages whatsoever arising out of or connected
      with the use or misuse of her work product. Writer assumes no
      responsibility for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential
      damages of any kind, or any damages whatsoever (including without
      limitation, those resulting from her work product or from: (1) user or
      Client reliance on the materials or documents produced (2) costs of
      replacement writings, training, or documents (3) loss of use, data, or
      profits (4) delays or business interruptions, (5) and any theory of
      liability, arising out of or in connection with the use or performance
      of Writer’s work whether or not Writer has been advised of the
      possibility of such damages. 
       
  12. FINAL AGREEMENT. This Agreement terminates and supersedes all prior
      understandings or agreements on the subject matter hereof. This
      Agreement may be modified only by a further writing that is duly
      executed by both parties. 
       
  13. SOLE AGREEMENT; AMENDMENTS. The agreement contained in this Contract
      constitutes the sole agreement between the Writer and the Client
      regarding the project outlined above. Any additional work not
      specified in this contract requires a separate agreement. All prices
      specified in this contract will be honored for two (2) months after
      both parties sign this contract. Continued services after that time
      will require a new agreement. 
       
  14. GOVERNING LAW. This contract will be governed by and construed in
      accordance with the laws of the State of [GOVERNING LAW], without
      giving effect to its choice of law rules

      For writing contracts, governing law should be New York unless there
      is a compelling reason to do otherwise. The state has a large and
      widely-used body of publishing law and publishing-related employment
      law, whereas many states don't or those that they do have are too
      client-friendly. New York's laws are helpful to both writer and
      client. California is another publishing-savvy and writer-friendly
      state but only for non-WFH contracts.
       
  15. ENTIRE AGREEMENT; AMENDMENTS. This Agreement constitutes the entire
      understanding of the parties. Any changes or modifications thereto
      must be in writing and signed by both parties.


I, [CLIENT REPRESENTATIVE NAME], assert that I am a person employed by

services rendered by Writer for the aforementioned Work. I assert that I
have read, understood and agree to the terms of this Work-for-Hire
Freelance Writing Agreement.


I, [WRITER NAME] assert that I have read, understood and agree to the terms
