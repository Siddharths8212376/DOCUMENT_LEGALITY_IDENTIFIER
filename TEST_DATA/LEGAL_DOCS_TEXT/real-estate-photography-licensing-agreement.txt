Scope  of  this  Agreement.  This  Agreement  applies  to  any   photograph,

for the property [[PROPERTY ADDRESS]] (“PROPERTY”). This  Agreement  governs
the relationship between the parties  and  in  no  event  shall  any  e-mail
communication or other exchange, amend or  otherwise  modify  the  terms  of
this Agreement unless agreed to in writing.


Rights: All Photos and rights relating  to  them,  including  copyright  and
ownership rights in the media in which the Photos  are  stored,  remain  the
sole and exclusive property of the Photographer. This license  provides  the
Client  with  the  limited  right  to  reproduce,  publicly   display,   and
distribute the Photos only for promotional or advertising purposes  directly
related to the sale of  the  Property.  Photos  used  for  any  purpose  not
directly related to the sale of  the  Property  must  be  with  the  express
permission of Photographer  and  the  payment  of  additional  fees,  unless
otherwise agreed to in writing.


Photos may be uploaded to any MLS listing service solely  for  promotion  of
the Property during the pendency of this Agreement. However,  regardless  of
any terms and conditions of the MLS, at no time does this Agreement  provide

copyright  management  information  (CMI)   at   the   discretion   of   the
Photographer in the form of either 1) a copyright notice © and/or  2)  other
copyright and ownership information embedded in the metadata  or  elsewhere,
unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties.  Removing  and/or  altering  such
information  is  prohibited  and  constitutes  violation  of   the   Digital
Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)  and  Client  will  be  responsible  to  the
Photographer for any penalties  and  awards  available  under  the  statute.
