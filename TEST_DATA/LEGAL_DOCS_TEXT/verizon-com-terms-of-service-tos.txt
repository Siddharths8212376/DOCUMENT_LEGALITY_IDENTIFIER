   1. If PWS and/or Storage Services are made available as a feature of the
      Service, you agree that you are solely responsible for all content you
      store on or retrieve from such services. Additional terms and
      conditions applicable to Storage Services are posted on the Website
      and are incorporated herein by reference. You understand that we do
      not provide telephone technical support for PWS or Storage Services.
      Storage Services may be accessed from any suitable Internet
      connection.


   2. If you breach this Agreement, we reserve the right immediately to
      suspend or terminate your Service and/or an Additional Service(s) with
      or without notice. In such case, you agree that we may immediately
      delete all data, files, and other content stored on your Storage
      Services, including archived data, without further notice to you. It
      is your responsibility to remove or copy any content stored on the
      Storage Services prior to closure of your account; otherwise, it may
      be lost.


   3. Verizon reserves the right to access your PWS or Storage Service
      account at any time with or without prior notice to you and to disable
      access to or remove content which in our sole discretion is or
      reasonably could be deemed unlawful.


   4. Use Requirements for Free Storage Services Accounts ("Free Account").
      If you sign up for a Free Account, you must actively use it. To
      "actively use" your account means to upload, download, backup or
      restore content to it. In the event you do not use your Free Account
      for a period of sixty (60) calendar days or more, then Verizon
      reserves the right to cancel your Free Account. We will provide notice
      of cancellation by email to your Primary Email Address. Use of your
      Free Account within fourteen (14) calendar days of the date of your
      cancellation notice will prevent cancellation of your Free Account.

      It is your responsibility to remove or copy any content in your Free
      Account prior to cancellation or termination; otherwise, it will be
      lost. Verizon may, at its election, also delete archived data.

   5. 5. Inactivity Disconnect Policy. If your Storage Service is idle for
      fifteen (15) minutes, it will be subject to automatic log-off . Your
      Storage Service will be deemed to be idle if there appears to be no
      interactive, human-generated data received from the remote user's
      computer within a fifteen (15) minute period. Your Storage Service
      will not be subject to automatic log-off if you are accessing your
      account from a wireless device.


   6. Verizon Online Backup & Sharing is provided by DigiData Corporation,
      which is a third party beneficiary of this Agreement capable of
      enforcing its terms independently from Verizon.
