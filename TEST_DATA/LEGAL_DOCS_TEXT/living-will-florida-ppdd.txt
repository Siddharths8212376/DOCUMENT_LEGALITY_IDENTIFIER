PROLONGING PROCEDURE ACT, F.S. 765.05 DECLARATION OF [NAME OF THE
DECLARANT]


Declaration made this [ENTER DAY] of [ENTER MONTH, YEAR]. I [NAME OF THE
DECLARANT] willfully and voluntarily make known my desire that my dying
shall not be artificially prolonged under the circumstances set forth
below, do hereby declare:


If at any time I should have a terminal condition, and if my attending
physician has determined that there can be no recovery from such condition
and my death is imminent, I direct that such procedures be withheld or
withdrawn, and that I be permitted to die naturally with only the
administration of medication or the performance of any medical procedure
deemed necessary to provide me with comfort care or to alleviate pain.


In the absence of my ability to give directions regarding the use of such
life-sustaining procedures, it is my intention that this declaration shall
be honored by my family and physicians as the final expression of my legal
right to refuse medical or surgical treatment and accept the consequences
for such refusal.


If I have been diagnosed as pregnant and that diagnosis is known to my
physician, this declaration shall have no force or effect during the course
of my pregnancy.


I understand the full import of this declaration and I am emotionally and
mentally competent to make this declaration.
