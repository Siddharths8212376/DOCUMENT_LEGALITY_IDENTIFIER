Re: EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT


Dear [[EMPLOYEE NAME]]:


On behalf of [[COMPANY NAME]], a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), I am
pleased to offer you the position of [[TITLE]] of the Company. Your
employment by the Company shall be governed by the following terms and
conditions (this “Agreement”):


   1. Duties and Scope of Employment.


        1. Position. For the term of your employment under this Agreement
           (your “Employment”), the Company agrees to employ you in the
           position of [[TITLE]] [or in such other position as the Company
           subsequently may assign to you]. You will report to the
           Company’s [[BOARD OF DIRECTORS / CEO / CFO / CTO]] [or to such
           other person as the Company subsequently may determine]. You
           will be working out of the Company’s office in the San Francisco
           Bay Area. You will perform the duties and have the
           responsibilities and authority customarily performed and held by
           an employee in your position or as otherwise may be assigned or
           delegated to you by the Company’s [[BOARD OF DIRECTORS / CEO /
           CFO / CTO]] [,including but not limited to [DUTIES AND
           RESPONSIBILITIES]].


        2. Obligations to the Company. During your Employment, you
           shall devote your full business efforts and time to the Company.
           During your Employment, without the prior written approval of
           the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, [which approval shall not
           be unreasonably withheld,] you shall not render services in any
           capacity to any other person or entity and shall not act as a
           sole proprietor or partner of any other person or entity or own

           [Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may serve on corporate,
           civic or charitable boards or committees, deliver lectures,
           fulfill speaking engagements, teach at educational institutions,
           or manage personal investments without such advance written
           consent, provided that such activities do not individually or in
           the aggregate interfere with the performance of your duties
           under this Agreement.] You shall comply with the Company’s
           policies and rules, as they may be in effect from time to time
           during your Employment.


        3. No Conflicting Obligations. You represent and warrant to the
           Company that you are under no obligations or commitments,
           whether contractual or otherwise, that are inconsistent with
           your obligations under this Agreement. In connection with your
           Employment, you shall not use or disclose any trade secrets or
           other proprietary information or intellectual property in which
           you or any other person has any right, title or interest and
           your Employment will not infringe or violate the rights of any
           other person. You represent and warrant to the Company that you
           have returned all property and confidential information
           belonging to any prior employer.


        4. Commencement Date. You shall commence full-time Employment as
           soon as reasonably practicable and in no event later than
           [[ABSOLUTE START DATE]].


   2. Cash and Incentive Compensation.


        1. Salary. The Company shall pay you as compensation for your
           services an initial base [[MONTHLY] / [ANNUAL]] salary at a
           gross rate of $[[RATE]]. Such [[MONTHLY] / [ANNUAL]] salary
           shall be payable in accordance with the Company’s standard
           payroll procedures. The annual compensation specified in this
           subsection (a), together with any modifications in such
           compensation that the Company may make from time to time, is
           referred to in this Agreement as “Base Salary.” [The Board or
           any Compensation Committee of the Board shall review your Base
           Salary at least annually. Effective as of the date of any change
           to your Base Salary, the Base Salary as so changed shall be
           considered the new Base Salary for all purposes of this
           Agreement.]


        2. [Incentive Bonuses. You will be eligible to be considered for an
           annual incentive bonus each calendar year during the term of
           your employment under this Agreement based upon the achievement
           of certain objective or subjective criteria established by the
           Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) or any Compensation
           Committee of the Board. The target amount for any such annual
           incentive bonus will be up to [[INCENTIVE BONUS TARGET]]% of
           your Base Salary. The determinations of the Board with respect
           to such bonus shall be final and binding. You shall not earn an
           incentive bonus unless you are employed by the Company on the
           date when such bonus is payable.]


        3. [Signing Bonus. The Company shall pay you a signing bonus of
           $[[SIGNING BONUS]] (the “Signing Bonus”) on or about the first
           day of your Employment, net of all applicable withholding taxes
           and other applicable deductions in accordance with the
           Company’s standard payroll practices.]


        4. [Up-Front Retention Bonus. The Company shall pay you a retention
           bonus of $[[RETENTION BONUS]] (the “Retention Bonus”) on or
           about the first day of your Employment, net of all applicable
           withholding taxes and other applicable deductions in accordance
           with the Company’s standard payroll practices. You will earn and
           be permitted to retain the full amount of the Retention Bonus if
           you are employed by the Company on the __-month anniversary of
           this Agreement. If you resign from the Company before such time,
           you will be required to immediately return the gross pre-tax
           amount of the Retention Bonus to the Company.]


        5. [Relocation. In order to assist you to move yourself and your
           household from [[CURRENT CITY]] to the San Francisco Bay Area,
           the Company will reimburse you up to an amount that will not
           exceed $[[RELOCATION REIMBURSEMENT MAX]] to cover your actual
           relocation expenses incurred for the following items: closing
           costs on the sale of your home in [[HOME'S LOCATION]],
           transportation from [[CURRENT CITY]] to the San Francisco Bay
           Area, storage of household goods and temporary housing in the
           San Francisco Bay Area (the “Relocation Payment”). The
           Relocation Payment shall be made to you net of all
           applicable withholding taxes and other applicable deductions in
           accordance with the Company’s standard payroll practices.] [You
           will earn and be permitted to retain the full amount of the
           Relocation Payment if you are employed by the Company on the __-
           month anniversary of this Agreement. If you resign from the
           Company before such time, you will be required to immediately
           return the gross pre-tax amount of the Relocation Payment to the
           Company.]


        6. [Sales Compensation. In addition to your Base Salary, you are
           eligible to participate in the Company’s [[SALES INCENTIVE PLAN
           NAME]] (the “Sales Incentive Plan”), subject to your execution
           of an acknowledgment of the terms of your participation in the
           Sales Incentive Plan (such form will be included in the plan
           documents which will be provided to you shortly).]


        7. [Stock Options. Subject to the approval of the Company’s Board
           of Directors (the “Board”), the Company shall grant you a stock
           option covering [[OPTION SHARES]] shares of the Company’s Common
           Stock (the “Option”). The Option shall be granted as soon
           as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement or,
           if later, the date you commence fulltime Employment. The
           exercise price per share will be equal to the fair market value
           per share on the date the Option is granted, as determined by
           the Company’s Board of Directors in good faith compliance with
           applicable guidance in order to avoid having the Option be
           treated as deferred compensation under Section 409A of the
           Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. There is no guarantee
           that the Internal Revenue Service will agree with this value.
           You should consult with your own tax advisor concerning the tax
           risks associated with accepting an option to purchase the
           Company’s Common Stock. [The term of the Option shall be 10
           years], subject to earlier expiration in the event of the
           termination of your services to the Company. [The Option shall
           be immediately exercisable, but the purchased shares shall be
           subject to repurchase by the Company at the exercise price in
           the event that your services to the Company terminate before the
           purchased shares become vested.] So long as your service status
           is continuous, the Option shall vest [and become exercisable] as
           follows: [[# OF OPTION SHARES]] of the total number of option
           shares shall vest [and become exercisable] on [[OPTION
           EXERCISEABLE DATE]] and 1/48th of the total Option shares shall
           vest [and become exercisable] in equal monthly installments
           thereafter. The Option will be an incentive stock option to the
           maximum extent allowed by the tax code and shall be subject to
           the other terms and conditions set forth in the Company’s
           [[STOCK PLAN NAME]] (the “Stock Plan”) and in the Company's
           standard form of Stock Option Agreement (the “Stock
           Agreement”).]


        8. [Acceleration Benefit. [Acceleration if Not Assumed: If there is
           a Corporate Transaction that constitutes a Triggering Event and
           any outstanding Option held by you during your continuing

           the Company applicable to Optioned Stock, Restricted Stock or
           shares issued upon exercise of an Award shall lapse as to ___%
           of the Shares subject to such repurchase right, in each case
           effective as of immediately prior to consummation of the

           Successor Corporation that is held by you at the time of
           your service termination shall accelerate and, if applicable,
           become exercisable such that the Options shall become vested and
           exercisable as to the number of Shares that would otherwise have
           vested and been exercisable as of the date __ month(s) from the
           date of termination, and any repurchase right of the Company to

           and expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) up to

           or of the same condition or provision at another time.
            
        5. Whole Agreement. [This Agreement supersedes the offer letter
           dated [[OFFER LETTER DATE]].] No other agreements,
           representations or understandings (whether oral or written
           and whether express or implied) which are not expressly set
           forth in this Agreement have been made or entered into by either
           party with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement
           and the Confidentiality Agreement contain the entire

        7. Choice of Law and Severability. This Agreement shall be
           interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of
           California without giving effect to provisions governing the
           choice of law. If any provision of this Agreement becomes or is
           deemed invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any applicable
           jurisdiction by reason of the scope, extent or duration of its
           coverage, then such provision shall be deemed amended to the
           minimum extent necessary to conform to applicable law so as to
           be valid and enforceable or, if such provision cannot be
           so amended without materially altering the intention of the
           parties, then such provision shall be stricken and the remainder
           of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. If
           any provision of this Agreement is rendered illegal by any
           present or future statute, law, ordinance or regulation
           (collectively, the “Law”) then that provision shall be curtailed
           or limited only to the minimum extent necessary to bring the
           provision into compliance with the Law. All the other terms and
           provisions of this Agreement shall continue in full force and
           effect without impairment or limitation.
            
        8. No Assignment. This Agreement and all of your rights and
           obligations hereunder are personal to you and may not be
           transferred or assigned by you at any time. The Company may
           assign its rights under this Agreement to any entity that
           assumes the Company’s obligations hereunder in connection with
           any sale or transfer of all or a substantial portion of
           the Company’s assets to such entity.
            
        9. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
           counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all
           of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
