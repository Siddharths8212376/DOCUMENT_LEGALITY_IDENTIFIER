This questionnaire is designed to help you provide me with the information
I need to serve you best.

Your answers here will give me a better understanding of what you want and
need from your new website or site redesign, so please be as detailed as
you can. I will also be compiling a price estimate based on this
information.


If there are any questions that you feel are not relevant or to which you
have no answer, just leave them blank for now.
