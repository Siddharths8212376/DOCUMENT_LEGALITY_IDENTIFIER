                              [[COMPANY NAME]]


                       MUTUAL NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT


This Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement (the “Agreement”) is made as of
[DATE], by and between [[COMPANY NAME]], a Delaware corporation (the
“Company”), and [[COUNTERPARTY NAME]] (“Counterparty”).  Each party has
disclosed and/or may further disclose its Confidential Information (as
defined below) to the other in connection with the Relationship (as defined
below) pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  As used
herein, the term “Discloser” shall refer to the Company whenever the
context refers to the Company’s Confidential Information being disclosed to
Counterparty, which is referred to as “Recipient” in that context. 
Conversely, the term “Discloser” shall refer to Counterparty whenever the
context refers to Counterparty’s Confidential Information being disclosed
to the Company, which is referred to as “Recipient” in that context. 


   1. Purpose.  The parties wish to explore a possible business opportunity
      of mutual interest [regarding [THE RELATIONSHIP]] (the “Relationship”)
      in connection with which Discloser has disclosed and/or may further
      disclose its Confidential Information (as defined below) to
      Recipient.  This Agreement is intended to allow the parties to
      continue to discuss and evaluate the Relationship while protecting
      Discloser’s Confidential Information (including Confidential
      Information previously disclosed to Recipient) against unauthorized
      use or disclosure.
       
   2. Definition of Confidential Information.  “Confidential Information”
      means any oral, written, graphic or machine-readable information,
      technical data or know-how, including, but not limited to, that which
      relates to patents, patent applications, research, product plans,
      products, developments, inventions, processes, designs, drawings,
      engineering, formulae, markets, software (including source and object
      code), hardware configuration, computer programs, algorithms,
      [regulatory information, medical reports, clinical data and analysis,
      reagents, cell lines, biological materials, chemical formulas,]
      business plans, agreements with third parties, services, customers,
      marketing or finances of Discloser, which Confidential Information is
      designated in writing to be confidential or proprietary, or if given
      orally, is confirmed in writing as having been disclosed as
      confidential or proprietary within a reasonable time (not to exceed
      thirty (30) days) after the oral disclosure[, or which information
      would, under the circumstances, appear to a reasonable person to be
      confidential or proprietary].  [Notwithstanding any failure to so
      identify it, however, all of the Company’s [ALWAYS COMPANY
      CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION] shall be Confidential Information of the
      Company and all of Counterparty’s [ALWAYS COUNTERPARTY'S CONFIDENTIAL
      INFORMATION] shall be Confidential Information of Counterparty.]
       
   3. [Regulation FD.  Recipient understands that Discloser’s Confidential
      Information as well as the existence of the discussions concerning the
      Relationship and the terms of the Relationship being contemplated by
      the parties may be deemed material non-public information and that it
      is unlawful for Recipient to, and Recipient has no intention to, trade
      in the stock of Discloser while Recipient is in possession of such
      material non-public information.]
       
   4. [Non-Acceptance of Confidential Information; No Compensation. 
      Recipient shall have the right to refuse to accept any Confidential
      Information tendered by Discloser, and nothing in this Agreement shall
      obligate Recipient to accept any such Confidential Information. 
      Recipient shall not compensate Discloser for receiving any
      Confidential Information under this Agreement.]
       
   5. Nondisclosure of Confidential Information.
       
        1. Recipient agrees not to use any Confidential Information
           disclosed to it by Discloser for its own use or for any purpose
           other than to carry out discussions concerning, and the
           undertaking of, the Relationship.  Recipient shall not disclose
           or permit disclosure of any Confidential Information of
           Discloser to third parties or to employees of Recipient, other
           than directors, officers, employees, consultants and agents of
           Recipient who are required to have the information in order to
           carry out the discussions regarding the Relationship.  Recipient
           agrees that it shall take reasonable measures to protect the
           secrecy of and avoid disclosure or use of Confidential
           Information of Discloser in order to prevent it from falling
           into the public domain or the possession of persons other than
           those persons authorized under this Agreement to have any such
           information.  Such measures shall include the degree of care
           that Recipient utilizes to protect its own Confidential
           Information of a similar nature.  Recipient agrees to notify
           Discloser of any misuse, misappropriation or unauthorized
           disclosure of Confidential Information of Discloser which may
           come to Recipient’s attention.
            
        2. Exceptions.  Notwithstanding the above, Recipient shall not have
           liability to Discloser with regard to any Confidential
           Information that the [Recipient] can prove:
            
              1. was in the public domain at the time it was disclosed or
                 has entered the public domain through no fault of
                 Recipient;
                  
              2. was known to Recipient, without restriction, at the time of
                 disclosure, as demonstrated by files in existence at the
                 time of disclosure;
                  
              3. [was independently developed by Recipient without any use
                 of the Confidential Information, as demonstrated by files
                 created at the time of such independent development;]
                  
              4. [is disclosed generally to third parties by Discloser
                 without restrictions similar to those contained in this
                 Agreement;] 
                  
              5. becomes known to Recipient, without restriction, from a
                 source other than Discloser without breach of this
                 Agreement by Recipient and otherwise not in violation of
                 Discloser’s rights;
                  
              6. is disclosed with the prior written approval of Discloser;
                 or
                  
              7. is disclosed pursuant to the order or requirement of a
                 court, administrative agency, or other governmental body;
                 provided, however, that Recipient shall provide prompt
                 notice of such court order or requirement to Discloser to
                 enable Discloser to seek a protective order or otherwise
                 prevent or restrict such disclosure.
                  
   6. Return of Materials.  [Recipient agrees, except as otherwise expressly
      authorized by Discloser, not to make any copies or duplicates of any
      Confidential Information.]    Any materials or documents that have
      been furnished by Discloser to Recipient in connection with the
      Relationship shall be promptly returned by Recipient, accompanied by
      all copies of such documentation, within ten (10) days after (a) the
      Relationship has been rejected or concluded or (b) the written request
      of Discloser[; provided, however, that Recipient may at its option
      retain one (1) copy of such materials or documents for archival
      purposes only].
       
   7. No Rights Granted.  Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as
      granting any rights under any patent, copyright or other intellectual
      property right of Discloser, nor shall this Agreement grant Recipient
      any rights in or to Discloser’s Confidential Information other than
      the limited right to review such Confidential Information solely for
      the purpose of determining whether to enter into the Relationship. 
      [Nothing in this Agreement requires the disclosure of any Confidential
      Information, which shall be disclosed, if at all, solely at
      Discloser’s option.]  Nothing in this Agreement requires the
      [Discloser] OR [Recipient] OR [parties] to proceed with the
      Relationship or any transaction in connection with which the
      Confidential Information may be disclosed.
       
   8. [Independent Development and Residuals.


        1. Recipient’s confidentiality obligations under this Agreement
           shall not be construed to limit Recipient’s right to develop
           independently or acquire products without use of Discloser’s
           Confidential Information.  Discloser acknowledges that Recipient
           may currently or in the future be developing information
           internally, or receiving information from other parties, that is
           similar to the Confidential Information.  Accordingly, nothing
           in this Agreement will prohibit the receiving party from
           developing or having developed for it products, concepts,
           systems or techniques that are similar to or compete with the
           products, concepts, systems or techniques contemplated by or
           embodied in the Confidential Information provided that Recipient
           does not violate any of its obligations under this Agreement in
           connection with such development.
            
        2. In addition, notwithstanding any other provision of this
           Agreement, Recipient’s confidentiality obligations under this
           Agreement shall not apply to, and Recipient shall be free to
           use, the residuals resulting from access to or work with the
           Confidential Information of Discloser.  As used in this
           Agreement, the term “residuals” means information in non
           tangible form, which may be retained by persons who have had
           access to the Confidential Information, including ideas,
           concepts, know how or techniques contained therein.  Recipient
           shall have no obligation to limit or restrict the assignment of
           such persons or to pay royalties for any work resulting from the
           use of residuals.]
            
   9. Term.  The foregoing commitments of each party shall survive any
      termination of the Relationship between the parties, and shall
      continue for a period terminating on the later to occur of the date
      (a) five (5) years following the date of this Agreement or (b) three
      (3) years from the date on which Confidential Information is last
      disclosed under this Agreement.
       
  10. Successors and Assigns.  The terms and conditions of this Agreement
      shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the respective
      successors and assigns of the parties, provided that Confidential
      Information of Discloser may not be assigned without the prior written
      consent of Discloser, unless the assignee shall be the successor
      entity to the assignor upon the dissolution of the assignor in its
      present form.  Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
      intended to confer upon any party other than the parties hereto or
      their respective successors and assigns any rights, remedies,
      obligations, or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement,
      except as expressly provided in this Agreement.
       
  11. Severability.  If one or more provisions of this Agreement are held to
      be unenforceable under applicable law, the parties agree to
      renegotiate such provision in good faith.  In the event that the
      parties cannot reach a mutually agreeable and enforceable replacement
      for such provision, then (a) such provision shall be excluded from
      this Agreement, (b) the balance of the Agreement shall be interpreted
      as if such provision were so excluded and (c) the balance of the
      Agreement shall be enforceable in accordance with its terms.
       
  12. Independent Contractors.  The parties are independent contractors, and
      nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to constitute
      the parties as partners, joint venturers, co-owners or otherwise as
      participants in a joint or common undertaking.
       
  13. Governing Law[; Jurisdiction].  This Agreement and all acts and
      transactions pursuant hereto and the rights and obligations of the
      parties hereto shall be governed, construed and interpreted in
      accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving
      effect to principles of conflicts of law.  [Each of the parties hereto
      consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts of
      [[GOVERNING JURISDICTION]] County, [[GOVERNING COUNTY]].]
       
  14. Remedies.  Each party’s obligations set forth in this Agreement are
      necessary and reasonable in order to protect Discloser and its
      business.  Due to the unique nature of Discloser’s Confidential
      Information, monetary damages would be inadequate to compensate
      Discloser for any breach by Recipient of its covenants and agreements
      set forth in this Agreement.  Accordingly, the parties each agree and
      acknowledge that any such violation or threatened violation may cause
      irreparable injury to Discloser and, in addition to any other remedies
      that may be available, in law, in equity or otherwise, Discloser shall
      be entitled to obtain injunctive relief against the threatened breach
      of this Agreement or the continuation of any such breach by Recipient.
       
  15. Amendment and Waiver.  Any term of this Agreement may be amended with
      the written consent of both parties.  Any amendment or waiver effected
      in accordance with this Section shall be binding upon the parties and
      their respective successors and assigns.  Failure to enforce any
      provision of this Agreement by a party shall not constitute a waiver
      of any term hereof by such party.
       
  16. Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in two or more
      counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of
      which together shall constitute one instrument.
       
  17. Entire Agreement.  This Agreement is the product of both of the
      parties hereto, and constitutes the entire agreement between such
      parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and merges all prior
      negotiations and drafts of the parties with regard to the transactions
      contemplated herein.  Any and all other written or oral agreements
      existing between the parties hereto regarding such transactions are
      expressly canceled.
       
  18. [No Publicity.  Neither party shall, without the prior consent of the
      other party, disclose to any other person the fact that Confidential
      Information of Discloser has been and/or may be disclosed under this
      Agreement, that discussions or negotiations are taking place between
      the parties, or any of the terms, conditions, status or other facts
      with respect thereto, except as required by law and then only with
      prior notice as soon as possible to the other party.]
       
  19. [No Modification.  Recipient agrees that it shall not modify, reverse
      engineer, decompile, create other works from or disassemble any
      software programs contained in the Confidential Information of
      Discloser unless permitted in writing by Discloser.]
       
  20. [Restrictions on Export.  Recipient shall not export, directly or
      indirectly, any technical data acquired from Discloser pursuant to
      this Agreement or any product utilizing any such data to any country
      for which the U.S. Government or any agency thereof at the time of
      export requires an export license or other government approval without
      first obtaining such license or approval.]


The parties have executed this Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement as of the
date first above written.
