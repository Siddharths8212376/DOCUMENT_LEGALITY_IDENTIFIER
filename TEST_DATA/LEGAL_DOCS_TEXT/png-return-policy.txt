We provide a 30-day period for refund on most products:


    • Please check to make sure that your purchase is definitely the correct
      and compatible item for the system you are replacing it in.
    • We are not responsible if you incorrectly order the wrong or
      incompatible part.
    • All products are Tested, cataloged, photographed and the serial
      numbers are recorded before we ship anything out.
    • We will not accept or refund any products that have been switched out,
      modified, tampered with or improperly installed or damaged.
    • The buyer is responsible for all shipping charges on returned items.
    • We only accept PayPal as form of payment.


PLEASE NOTE


    • All defective, dead on arrival (DOA) items will be inspected and
      tested.
    • Some items are non-refundable and can only be exchanged for an exact
      replacement. These items are described as "not refundable" on the
      product details page.
    • Items received by us after the initial 30-day period are no longer
      eligible for refund and will be forwarded to the original manufacturer
      for repair or replacement only, the choice of which will be at the
      discretion of the manufacturer. All items described as "new" should
      come with a manufacturer warranty. For repair or replacement inquiries
      after 30 days, please contact the manufacturer directly.
    • Any physical damage will automatically void the product warranty and
      any products that exhibit physical damage will be returned to you. For
      example, we cannot accept CPU returns if the item is cracked, chipped,
      burnt, has bent pins, or if the item has sustained any other type of
      physical damage. We highly recommend reading the manufacturer's
      instructions carefully before installing your product.
    • Please make sure that your item is actually defective and that you
      have ruled out all possibilities of incompatibility before returning
      the product. When we receive the returned item, we must test it
      thoroughly to verify that it is indeed defective because our suppliers
      (usually the manufacturer) will not accept returns or exchanges for
      functional items. If we determine that the returned item is in working
      condition, we will ship it back to you.
