Go up to the Cashier on the third floor. Pay them $45 (bring cash, get a
receipt). The cashier/clerk will stamp the cover pages of your summons and
complaint with an "index number." They will also take the original  (signed
in ink) copy of all your docs.

Call the court if you have questions:

 Notary Public:


 


                                       


               Go back to Court: File the Affidavit of Service


Yep, another trip to court. Sorry about that.


 


                           Negotiate a Settlement


All your papers are filed, the lawsuit has begun. In a few weeks, a judge
might actually skim through your papers. Use this time to negotiate a
settlement. The ex-client should know you're serious about collecting, and
knows that he will have to spend thousands on a lawyer to defend it (and if
your complaint is legit, he will lose anyway). This is your settlement
leverage. Negotiate a nice reasonable deal, and get paid with a bank-check
or similar.

Plaintiff Sara Freelance files this stipulation of discontinuance, pursuant
to CPLR 3217(a)(2), between the respective parties that the above action be
dismissed without prejudice and without costs to either of the parties.


This was an action to recover $23,435.45 on a service contract. Defendant
