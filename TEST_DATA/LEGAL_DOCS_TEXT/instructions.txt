Hello [RENTER NAME(S)],


Attached please find in separate files:


   1. copy of the filled out landlord rental application
   2. the documents required by the [CONDO NAME] Condo Board for rental
      applications (Undertaking & Agreement By Tenant and [CONDO NAME]
      Bylaws)
   3. the Lease Agreement
   4. Schedule A (so that you can get a good sense of the included
      appliances).


I am sorry for the length of the email but please note that all the
paperwork is included herein and the papers are simple and straightforward.


To me, before [START DATE] you need to please mail:


   1. The original signed Lease Agreement
   2. [MONTHLY RENT] condo Security Deposit
   3. The original signed Undertaking & Agreement By Tenant page (so that I
      can mail it to the manager).


I will then immediately mail to you my countersigned Lease signature page.
On your possession date you need to bring the first month's rent check of
[MONTHLY RENT] and post-dated cheques for the remainder of the rental
period.


I look forward to helping you throughout the rental in any way. I am sure
you will be very happy with your stay in this Condo. Please let me know if
I can be of any help.
