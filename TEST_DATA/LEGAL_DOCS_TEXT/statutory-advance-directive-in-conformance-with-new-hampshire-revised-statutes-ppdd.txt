                      NOTE: This form has two sections.


            You may complete both sections, or only one section.


                I. DURABLE POWER OF ATTORNEY FOR HEALTH CARE



I, __________, hereby appoint __________ of __________ (Please choose only
one person. If you choose more than one agent, they will have authority in
priority of the order their names are listed, unless you indicate another
form of decision making.) as my agent to make any and all health care
decisions for me, except to the extent I state otherwise in this directive
or as prohibited by law. This durable power of attorney for health care
shall take effect in the event I lack the capacity to make my own health
care decisions.
In the event the person I appoint above is unable, unwilling or
unavailable, or ineligible to act as my health care agent, I hereby appoint
__________ of __________ as alternate agent. (Please choose only one
person. If you choose more than one alternate agent, they will have
authority in priority of the order their names are listed.)
STATEMENT OF DESIRES, SPECIAL PROVISIONS, AND LIMITATIONS REGARDING HEALTH
CARE DECISIONS.
For your convenience in expressing your wishes, some general statements
concerning the withholding or removal of life-sustaining treatment are set
forth below. (Life-sustaining treatment is defined as procedures without
which a person would die, such as but not limited to the following:
mechanical respiration, kidney dialysis or the use of other external
mechanical and technological devices, drugs to maintain blood pressure,
blood transfusions, and antibiotics.) There is also a section which allows
you to set forth specific directions for these or other matters. If you
wish, you may indicate your agreement or disagreement with any of the
following statements and give your agent power to act in those specific
circumstances.
A. LIFE-SUSTAINING TREATMENT.
1. If I am near death and lack the capacity to make health care decisions,
I authorize my agent to direct that:
(Initial beside your choice of (a) or (b).)
___(a) life-sustaining treatment not be started, or if started, be
discontinued.


                                    -or-



___(b) life-sustaining treatment continue to be given to me.
2. Whether near death or not, if I become permanently unconscious I
authorize my agent to direct that:
(Initial beside your choice of (a) or (b).)
___a) life-sustaining treatment not be started, or if started, be
discontinued.


                                    -or-



___(b) life-sustaining treatment continue to be given to me.
B. MEDICALLY ADMINISTERED NUTRITION AND HYDRATION.
1. I realize that situations could arise in which the only way to allow me
to die would be to not start or to discontinue medically administered
nutrition and hydration. In carrying out any instructions I have given in
this document, I authorize my agent to direct that:
(Initial beside your choice of (a) or (b).)
___(a) medically administered nutrition and hydration not be started or, if
started, be discontinued.


                                    -or-



___(b) even if all other forms of life-sustaining treatment have been
withdrawn, medically administered nutrition and hydration continue to be
given to me.
(If you fail to complete item B, your agent will not have the power to
direct the withholding or withdrawal of medically administered nutrition
and hydration.)
C. ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS.
Here you may include any specific desires or limitations you deem
appropriate, such as when or what life-sustaining treatment you would want
used or withheld, or instructions about refusing any specific types of
treatment that are inconsistent with your religious beliefs or are
unacceptable to you for any other reason. You may leave this question blank
if you desire.

                               II. LIVING WILL



Declaration made this ___ day of __________, 20___.
I, __________, being of sound mind, willfully and voluntarily make known my
desire that my dying shall not be artificially prolonged under the
circumstances set forth below, do hereby declare:
If at any time I should have an incurable injury, disease, or illness and I
am certified to be near death or in a permanently unconscious condition by
2 physicians or a physician and an APRN, and 2 physicians or a physician
and an APRN have determined that my death is imminent whether or not life-
sustaining treatment is utilized and where the application of life-
sustaining treatment would serve only to artificially prolong the dying
process, or that I will remain in a permanently unconscious condition, I
direct that such procedures be withheld or withdrawn, and that I be
permitted to die naturally with only the administration of medication, the
natural ingestion of food or fluids by eating and drinking, or the
performance of any medical procedure deemed necessary to provide me with
comfort care. I realize that situations could arise in which the only way
to allow me to die would be to discontinue medically administered nutrition
and hydration.
In carrying out any instruction I have given under this section, I
authorize that:
(Initial beside your choice of (a) or (b).)
___(a) medically administered nutrition and hydration not be started or, if
started, be discontinued,


                                    -or-



___(b) even if all other forms of life-sustaining treatment have been
withdrawn, medically administered nutrition and hydration continue to be
given to me.
In the absence of my ability to give directions regarding the use of such
life-sustaining treatment, it is my intention that this declaration shall
be honored by my family and health care providers as the final expression
of my right to refuse medical or surgical treatment and accept the
consequences of such refusal.
I understand the full import of this declaration, and I am emotionally and
mentally competent to make this declaration.
Signed this ___ day of __________, 2___.
Principal's Signature: __________
[If you are physically unable to sign, this directive may be signed by
someone else writing your name, in your presence and at your express

We declare that the principal appears to be of sound mind and free from
duress at the time the living will is signed and that the principal affirms
that he or she is aware of the nature of the directive and is signing it
freely and voluntarily.
