|.|Plans and Designs to us, you will furnish us with resumes and   |
| |other information we request pertaining to the architect and/or |
| |interior designer you desire to retain to prepare your Plans and|

| |representative prototype Guest Room and public area plans and   |
| |schematic building plans as a guide for preparation of the Plans|
| |and Designs. Renovation Work will not begin unless and until we |

| |plans, equipment, layouts, specifications, drawings and designs |
| |for the Hotel. Once we approve the Plans and Designs, no change |
| |may be made to the Plans and Designs without our advance        |
| |consent. In approving the Plans and Designs, we do not warrant  |
| |the depth of our analysis or assume any responsibility for the  |
| |efficacy of the Plans and Designs or the resulting Renovation   |
| |Work. You will cause the Hotel Renovation Work to be in         |
| |accordance with this Agreement, the approved Plans and Designs, |

Hotel during reasonable business hours to visit the Hotel and the
Renovation Work. However, neither we nor our Affiliates are obligated to
participate in progress meetings, or to visit the Hotel and the Renovation
Work, and our and our AffiliateÂ’s participation and site visits are not to
be considered as a representation of the adequacy of the construction, the
structural integrity, or the sufficiency of mechanical and electrical
systems for the Hotel. Before we approve your Plans, your architect or
other certified professional must certify to us that the Plans comply with

| |expense and expend substantial time and effort. You acknowledge |
| |and agree that we will have no liability or obligation to you   |
| |for any losses, obligations, liabilities or expenses you incur  |
| |if we terminate this Agreement because you have not complied    |
