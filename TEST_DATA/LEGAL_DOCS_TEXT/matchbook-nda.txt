                           NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT


           In connection with a proposed business  relationship,  Matchbook
FTW Inc. (“Company”) has allowed you (the individual or entity named  below)
access,  or  may  allow  you  access,  to  business,  technical   or   other
information, materials and/or ideas (“Proprietary Information,”  which  term
shall include, without limitation, anything  you  learn  or  discover  as  a
result of exposure to or analysis of any Proprietary Information).


           In  consideration  of  any  disclosure  and   any   negotiations
concerning the proposed business relationship, you agree as follows:


           1. You will hold in confidence  and  will  not  possess  or  use
(except as required to evaluate the proposed  business  relationship  within
the U.S.) or disclose any Proprietary  Information  except  information  you
can document (a) is in the public domain through no fault of yours, (b)  was
properly known to you, without restriction, prior to disclosure  by  Company
or (c) was properly disclosed to you by another person without  restriction.
You will not reverse engineer  or  attempt  to  derive  the  composition  or
underlying information, structure or ideas of any  Proprietary  Information.
The foregoing does not grant you a license in or to any of  the  Proprietary
Information.


           2. If you decide not  to  proceed  with  the  proposed  business
relationship  or  if  asked  by  Company,  you  will  promptly  return   all
Proprietary Information and all copies, extracts and other objects or  items
in which Proprietary Information may be contained or embodied.


           3. You will promptly notify Company of any unauthorized release,
disclosure or use of Proprietary Information.


           4. You understand that this Agreement does not obligate  Company
to disclose any information or negotiate or  enter  into  any  agreement  or
relationship. You will strictly  abide  by  any  and  all  instructions  and
restrictions  provided  by  Company  from  time  to  time  with  respect  to
Proprietary Information or Company systems. You will ensure the security  of
any facilities, machines, accounts, passwords and methods you use  to  store
any Proprietary Information or to access Company systems and ensure that  no
other person has or obtains access thereto.


           5. The terms of  this  Agreement  will  remain  in  effect  with
respect to any particular Proprietary Information  until  you  can  document
that such Proprietary Information falls into one of  the  exceptions  stated
in Paragraph 1 above.


           6. You acknowledge and agree that due to the  unique  nature  of
the Proprietary Information,  any  breach  of  this  agreement  would  cause
irreparable harm to Company for which damages are not  an  adequate  remedy,
and that  Company  shall  therefore  be  entitled  to  equitable  relief  in
addition to all other remedies available at law.


           7. Until one year after the  later  of  (i)  the  date  of  this
Agreement or (ii) the last disclosure of  Proprietary  Information  to  you,
you will not encourage or solicit any employee or consultant of  Company  to
leave Company for any reason.


           8. This Agreement is personal to you, is nonassignable  by  you,
is governed by the internal laws of  the  State  of  New  York  and  may  be
modified or waived only in writing signed by both parties. If any  provision
of this Agreement is found to  be  unenforceable,  such  provision  will  be
limited or deleted to the minimum extent necessary  so  that  the  remaining
terms remain in full force and effect. The prevailing party in  any  dispute
or legal action regarding the subject matter  of  this  Agreement  shall  be
entitled to recover attorneys’ fees and costs.
