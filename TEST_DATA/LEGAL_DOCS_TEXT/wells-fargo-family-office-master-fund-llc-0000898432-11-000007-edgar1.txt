Code of Ethics


As a registered investment adviser, WFAAM is required to maintain a policy
governing personal securities transactions and insider trading by its
officers and employees.  This Code of Ethics and Policy on Personal
Securities Transactions and Insider Trading (the “Code”) has been adopted
under Section 204A of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (“the
Advisers Act”), and Rule 204A-1 thereunder, in order to establish and
enforce WFAAM’s policies and procedures governing personal securities
transactions of its officers and employees.  WFAAM believes that the Code
is reasonably designed to prevent the misuse of material, non-public
information, and it outlines the policies and procedures for the activities
referred to above.


Section 17(j) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the
“Company Act”), and Rule 17j-1 thereunder, require that every investment
adviser to a registered investment company adopt a written code of
ethics.  Because WFAAM is the investment adviser to the Wells Fargo Multi-
Strategy 100 Master Fund I, LLC, the Wells Fargo Multi-Strategy 100 Fund I,
LLC, the Wells Fargo Multi-Strategy 100 TEI Fund I, LLC, the Wells Fargo

Fargo Family Office Fund FW, LLC, each a registered investment company (the
“Registered Funds”), WFAAM has incorporated the requirements of Rule 17j-1
in this Code.  The Registered Funds have adopted their own code of ethics
pursuant to Rule 17j-1 and a copy is attached as Exhibit J/A.  As a result,
WFAAM is required to provide a report to the Registered Funds’ Boards of
Managers, at least annually, certifying that it has procedures in place
designed to prevent access persons from violating the Code and describing
issues arising under the Code, if any, and the sanction/response imposed.


In addition, this Code is intended to be followed in conjunction with the
policies outlined in the Code of Ethics for Personal Trading by Fiduciary
Personnel that is applicable to all employees of Wealth Management (“WM”)
Investment Management and Trust division (“IM&T”) of Wells Fargo.  In
addition, please refer to the policies outlined in the Handbook for Wells
Fargo Team Members and the Wells Fargo Code of Conduct and Business Ethics
applicable to all Wells Fargo employees.   Acknowledgement of, and
compliance with, this Code are conditions of employment.


All references in this Code to employees, officers, directors, accounts,
departments and clients refer to those of WFAAM.  WFAAM personnel must
avoid actions or activities that allow (or appear to allow) them or their
family members to profit or benefit from their relationships with WFAAM
clients.  WFAAM personnel are also reminded not to use indirect means
(i.e., cause or use another person) to do anything that is prohibited by
law or the policies of WFAAM.

Quarterly Transaction Reporting and Account Certification


Quarterly Transaction Reports that list personal securities transactions
executed for the quarter must be certified by Access Persons to WM
Compliance no later than 30 business days after the end of each calendar
quarter.  In addition, WFAAM Access Persons are required to certify to WM
Compliance all brokerage accounts in which they have Beneficial
Ownership.  Access Persons should submit information on any new or closed
brokerage accounts to WM Compliance each quarter.


Quarterly transaction reporting and account certification are completed
electronically via iTrade, which is browser-based software that allows
users to obtain securities trade pre-clearances, enter executed trades and
submit quarterly reports.  Access to iTrade is via the Internet at:
http://ndcctiw01/itrade3/WebApps/LoginHome/Login.aspx,


Pre-clearance of Trades


It is WFAAM’s policy that Access Persons that are also deemed to  be
Advisory Person are required to pre-clear personal trades with WM
Compliance on the trade date before the purchase or sale of a Covered
Security.


Prior to submitting a personal trade for pre-clearance, Advisory Person
should determine that the reason for placing the trade does not involve any
conflict of interest, including information considered material and non-
public.  Specifically, any trades placed in personal securities accounts
based on insider information and/or tipping of such information is strictly
prohibited.    (See Section IV - Insider Trading, below.)


An Advisory Person may only purchase and sell Covered Securities if:

|a|The security has not been traded in any of the WFAAM Funds and  |
|)|the Advisory Person has no knowledge that the security will be  |
| |traded in any of the WFAAM Funds that trade day.                |

|b|The security has not been subject of a recommendation on behalf |
|)|of any WM models within the last 7 calendar days.  Information  |
| |regarding specific securities that are considered restricted is |
| |available to Advisory Persons and may be found by clicking the  |
| |“List of Restricted Securities” link of this                    |
| |URL:  http://WMG.wellsfargo.com/SiteController?dbid=PAGE_INDEX_1|
| |403100                                                          |

|c|The transaction has been pre-cleared with WM Compliance by the  |
|)|Advisory Person before making the trade.  For limit and stop    |
| |orders, Advisory Persons must document the trade with a screen  |
| |print of the order.                                             |


These procedures apply to all transactions in Covered Securities held in
accounts in which Advisory Persons have a beneficial interest and/or over
which they exercise influence or control, including accounts for their
family members or other household accounts.  The


Updated 12/06/2010

restrictions do not apply to securities transactions through automatic
investment plan and/or securities transactions through direct stock
purchase plans.


Note - pre-clearance does not assure that the trade will not violate policy
because Advisory Persons must ensure that they do not place any trades in
client accounts in the same security after the trade has been pre-cleared
on the same day.


To pre-clear while out-of-office (iTrade is on the Intranet), either e-mail
personst@wellsfargo.com or call the Compliance Consultant in charge of
iTrade.


Restricted /Prohibited Securities


Rules 204A-1 and 17j-1 both require that Access Persons of investment
advisers pre-clear any purchase in an Initial Public Offering or a Limited
Offering (a private placement, an LP or LLC (including hedge
funds)).  Therefore, WFAAM Access Persons may not purchase securities in an
Initial Public Offering or Limited Offering unless approval is obtained
from WM Compliance.  It should be noted that private investment funds,
including Wells Fargo proprietary hedge funds managed by WFAAM, are
considered to be Limited Offerings and must be pre-cleared.


In addition, WFAAM Access Persons may not invest in options (other than
employee stock options), puts, calls, short sales, futures contracts or
other similar transactions involving securities issued by Wells Fargo &
Co.  In the event a WFAAM Access Person has been issued employee stock
options, such options must be pre-cleared before they are exercised.


Exempt Securities and Transactions


Securities excluded from the definition of Covered Securities, above, are
exempt from pre-clearance requirements, as well as initial, quarterly and
annual reporting requirements.  Transactions in proprietary mutual funds
advised by an affiliate of WFAAM are exempt from pre-clearance
requirements, but are subject to the initial, quarterly and annual
reporting requirements.


Note - Transactions in closed-end mutual funds, such as the Registered
Funds, and ETFs are not exempt from the pre-clearance and reporting
requirements because closed-end funds and ETFs are Covered Securities.

| |b|Breaches of Trading      |
| |)|Restrictions.            |

| |i|On a quarterly basis, WM Compliance will run a potential        |
| |.|“front-running” and “restricted securities” report from the     |
| | |iTrade/Examiner personal securities software.  The reviews will:|

| |o|Compare reported personal transactions in Covered Securities    |
| | |with transactions in associated client accounts; and            |

| |o|Compare reported personal transactions with Covered Securities  |
| | |being considered for purchase or sale by IM&T to determine      |
| | |whether a violation may have occurred. Securities being         |
| | |considered for purchase or sale will be determined via Alerts   |
| | |published for changes to the investment models offered by       |
| | |Private Asset Management.                                       |

| |i|WM Compliance will then forward an e-mail to all Access Persons |
| |i|with possible violation information.  Once the Access Person has|
| |.|received the e-mail and corresponding possible violation detail,|
| | |he/she must respond in writing to WM Compliance within 14 days  |
| | |of receipt with an explanation detailing all circumstances      |
| | |concerning the noted possible violations.                       |

| |i|Before determining that an Access Person has violated the Code |
| |i|of Ethics, WM Compliance shall give the person an opportunity  |
| |i|to supply explanatory material.  No team member is required to |
| |.|participate in a determination of whether he or she has        |
| | |committed a violation or discuss the imposition of any sanction|
| | |against himself or herself.                                    |

| |iv. After WM Compliance has received all responses, an analysis   |
| |will be conducted to determine any trending, the legitimacy of    |
| |explanations, and/or possible disciplinary actions. WFAAM Senior  |
| |Management will be contacted in writing should further            |
| |disciplinary action be warranted for violations of this policy.   |


Note:  Failure to respond back to WM Compliance within the required
timeframe will result in further escalation to WFAAM Senior Management.


  Annual Compliance Testing


Missing and/or incomplete annual reports.  WM Compliance will review
holding report files to determine if any Certification and Acknowledgement
of the Code, Holdings Report, and Account Certifications (if applicable)
are missing and/or incomplete and will follow up with the Access Person to
obtain the required report(s).

|     INSIDER      |
|TRADING           |


Insider trading refers generally to buying or selling a security, in breach
of fiduciary duty or other relationship of trust and confidence, while in
possession of material, nonpublic information.  Rule 10b-5 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, prohibits trading on the basis
of inside information.


Inside and non-public information: Any information about a business
organization that is not generally available to or known by the public.


Material inside information:  Inside and non-public information is
considered “material” if there is a likelihood that it would be considered
important by an investor in making a decision to buy or sell a company’s
securities, whether stock, bonds, notes, debentures, limited partnership
units or other equity or debt securities.  Inside information shall be
presumed “material” if it relates to, among other things, any of the
following:

| |a|Earnings, or financial results, before    |
| |)|publicly disclosed,                       |

| |b|Dividend increases or   |
| |)|decreases,              |

| |c|Changes in previously released        |
| |)|earnings estimates,                   |

| |d|Significant gains or|
| |)|losses,             |

| |e|Significant expansion or curtailment  |
| |)|of operations,                        |

| |f|Significant merger or acquisition proposals |
| |)|or agreements,                              |

| |g|Significant purchase or sale|
| |)|of assets,                  |

| |h|Significant new products or   |
| |)|discoveries,                  |

| |i|Significant      |
| |)|borrowing,       |

| |j|Major       |
| |)|litigation, |

| |k|New debt or equity    |
| |)|offerings,            |

| |l|Liquidity        |
| |)|problems, or     |

| |m)|Significant management   |
| |  |changes.                 |


No person covered by this Code may trade, either personally or on behalf of
others, while in possession of Inside Information.  This includes “tipping”
of information to others who trade on behalf of their own accounts.


WFAAM Access Persons shall not trade for their own accounts, or recommend
trading on the basis of material, or inside and non-public information in
their possession.  Access Persons are required to observe the limitations
imposed by the federal securities laws, particularly Rule 10b-5.


If an Access Person has any question as to whether information is material
or inside and non-public, he or she shall resolve the question(s) before
trading, recommending trading or divulging the information.


Updated 12/06/2010

WFAAM—INTERNAL USE ONLY


  If there is any unresolved question in a team member’s mind as to whether
information is material or inside and non-public, it should be brought to
the attention of WFAAM’s Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”).  Wells Fargo’s
Law Department will be consulted prior to trading or recommending trading.

|            |
| PENALTIES  |


WM Compliance will report violations of the Code of Ethics quarterly, or as
they occur, to WFAAM’s President.  In addition, each Access Person must
immediately report to the CCO any known or reasonably suspected violations
of this Code of which he or she becomes aware.


Penalties may range from a notice of censure, disgorgement of profits, to a
dismissal and referral to authorities.  A consistent pattern of violating
any of the above standards could lead to dismissal.

|                  |
|ADMINISTRATION    |


The CCO is responsible for administering this Code.


Any Access Person who has knowledge of misconduct relating to, or wish to
express concern relating to, accounting, internal accounting controls or
auditing matters and/or a violation of any federal or state securities law
of provisions of the Code, should submit a written complaint expressing
such facts and/or concerns to the CCO.


Any such complaint will be held in the strictest of confidence and shall
not be disclosed except when required pursuant to the Code, WFAAM policy,
this procedure or by law.

|                   |
|CONFIDENTIALITY    |


All reports of personal securities transactions, holdings and any other
information filed pursuant to this Code will be kept confidential,
provided, however that such information may also be subject to review by
appropriate WM Compliance Personnel, WFAAM’s CCO and/or Senior Management
and legal counsel. Such information will also be provided to the Securities
and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) or other government authority when properly
requested or pursuant to a court order.

CODE OF ETHICS


Under Rule 17j-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended


Effective December 7, 2010


It is the policy of Wells Fargo Alternative Asset Management, LLC (the
“Adviser”), Alternative Strategies Brokerage Services, Inc. (the “Placement
Agent”) and each Fund that all Fund personnel, the Adviser and the
Placement Agent should seek (1) at all times to place the interests of Fund
investors first; (2) conduct all personal securities transactions in a
manner that is consistent with this Code and in such a manner as to avoid
any actual or potential conflict of interest or any abuse of the
individual’s position of trust and responsibility; and (3) adhere to the
fundamental standard that Fund personnel, the Adviser and the Placement
Agent should not take inappropriate advantage of their position or engage
in any act, practice or course of conduct that would violate this Code, the
fiduciary duty owed to Fund investors, or the provisions of Section 17(j)
of the 1940 Act and Rule 17j-1 thereunder.


The Adviser and the Placement Agent impose additional reporting and review
requirements and restrictions on the personal securities transactions of
their personnel.  The Board of Managers of each Registered Fund (the “Fund
Board of Managers”) has determined that, in addition to the requirements of
this Code of Ethics (the “Code”), the standards and reporting and review
requirements established by these organizations will be appropriately
applied by each Fund to those of its officers and those of its managers who
are affiliated with these organizations.


This Code does not attempt to identify all possible conflicts of interest,
and literal compliance with each of its specific provisions will not shield
against liability for personal trading or other conduct that violates a
fiduciary duty to Fund investors.
