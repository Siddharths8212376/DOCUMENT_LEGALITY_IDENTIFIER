           Client authorizes the Designer to publicize their completed work
           to Web search engines and other Web directories and indexes, as
           well as on Web-based portfolio sites such as Dribbble, Behance,
           etc.


   1. Standard Design Package
        1. Text
              1. Copy for work must be supplied by the Client via Google

                 to be considered legally owned by the Client or the
                 Designer. If used, attribution will be required at the
                 expense of the Client.


   1. Graphic Creation
        1. This custom package contemplates that the Designer will create,
           capture or receive from the Client all the graphic elements
           necessary to complete the Client’s project except where
           otherwise noted. This includes creation / redesign of Corporate
           Identity (logo), ancillary images, animated graphics,
           photography and banner advertisements.


   1. Additional Expenses
        1. The Client agrees to reimburse the Designer for any critical

              3. Purchase of specific software at the Client's request.


   1. Client Amends / Changes
        1. The Designer prides himself in providing excellent customer
           service. To that end, we encourage input from the Client during
           the design process.
        2. The Designer understands, however, that the Client may request
           significant design changes to pages that have already built to
           the Client's specification. To that end, please note that our
           agreement does not include a provision for significant page
           modification or creation of additional pages in excess of our
           agreed page maximum. If significant page modification is
           requested after a page has been built to the Client's
           specification, we must count it as an additional page.
        3. Some examples of significant page modification at the request of
           the Client include:
              1. Designing a new layout or layer structure to accommodate a
                 substantial redesign at the Client's request.
              2. Recreating or significantly modifying the logo and or
                 graphics at the Client's request.
              3. Replacing more than 75% of the text to any given page at
                 the Client's request.
              4. Creating a new navigation structure or changing the
                 graphics at the Client's request.
        4. Clients who anticipate frequently changing the look during the
           design process and desire to be intricately involved design of
           each page are encouraged to negotiate an agreement which exceeds
           the page maximum. If significant page modification is requested
           by the Client after the page maximum has been reached a Change
           Request with estimated costs will be submitted for Client
           approval prior to changes being done.
        5. Moderate changes, however, will always be covered during our
           design of the app.


   1. Third Party or Client Page Modification
        1. Some Clients will desire to independently edit or update their
           web pages after completion of the site.
        2. Note however, the Designer is not responsible for any damage
           created by the Client or agent of the Client. Any repairs
           required will be assessed at an hourly rate of USD$50 [1 hour
           minimum charge].


   1. Web Hosting
        1. The Client agrees to select a web hosting service that allows
           full access to the project directory via FTP. The Client further
           understands that if the web hosting service's operating system
           is not a standards-compliant system, software may not work and
           providing a substitute may incur additional charges.


   1. Search Engine Registration
        1. The Designer will optimize the Client’s project with appropriate
           titles, keywords, descriptions and text and thereafter submit
           the Client's project to each of the major search engines and
           directories. The Designer also offers advanced search engine
           optimization and site promotion services for an additional fee..
        2. The Designer encourages all commercial Clients to obtain
           advanced Search Engine Optimization and Site Promotion services.


   1. Work Schedule and Completion Date
        1. The Designer will submit a first mock-up draft of project no

           from the Client. The Client will provide all data needed to
           complete project, including text, company logo, and photos. Upon
           completion of this stage, the Client will be asked to confirm
           acceptance for the basic design via e-mail. Once this acceptance
           is received from the Client, the work necessary to complete the
           project will continue.
        2. Upon completion of the project, an e-mail or letter and invoice
           will be sent to the Client advising the Client that the work has

           initialing each page in the project via email. After contract

           Client’s hosting company.


   1. Maintenance Grace Period
        1. This agreement includes minor project maintenance over a one-
           month period. This included updating links and making minor
           changes to a sentence or paragraph. It does not include removing
           nearly all the text from a page and replacing it with new text.
           If the Client or an agent other than the Designer attempts to
           update the Client’s project, time to repair it will be assessed
           at the hourly rate of USD$50 and is not included as part of the
           updating time. The one-month maintenance period commences upon
           the date the Client signs this contract.

           billed at the hourly rate of USD$50. This rate shall also apply
           toward additional work authorized beyond the maximums specified
           above for such services as: general Internet orientation
           education, marketing consulting, web page design, editing,
           modifying product pages and databases in an online store, and

           use their own web page editor.


   1. Extended Maintenance Contracts
        1. Terms for Maintenance Contracts will use one of two methods.

                 month, allowing up to 2 hours of changes per month,
                 including new pages and store product changes. The “Flat
                 Rate” Agreement is payable each month, whether the time is
                 used or not. Changes requested, which go beyond the 2 hour
                 limit, are chargeable at the hourly rate of USD$50.
              2. The “As Needed” Maintenance Contract is a monthly
                 chargeable agreement, higher than the “Flat Rate”, but
                 offering cost savings on projects with little to no
                 changes. Charges incur when Client requests a change. 1

           inclusion in web pages are owned by the Client, or that the
           Client has permission from the rightful owner to use each of
           these elements, and will hold harmless, protect, and defend the
           Designer and its subcontractors from any claim or suit arising

           required, the Designer will only use industry recognized
           professionals.


   1. Warranties and Liability
        1. The Client agrees that any material submitted for publication
           will not contain anything leading to an abusive or unethical use
           of the Web Hosting Service, the Host Server or the Designer.
