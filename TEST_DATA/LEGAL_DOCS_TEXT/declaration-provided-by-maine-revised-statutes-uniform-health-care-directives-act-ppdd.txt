§5-804. Optional form


The following form may, but need not, be used to create an advance health-
care directive. The other sections of this Part govern the effect of this
or any other writing used to create an advance health-care directive. An
individual with capacity may complete or modify all or any part of the
following form.


ADVANCE HEALTH-CARE DIRECTIVE


Explanation


[1995, c. 378, Pt. A, §1 (NEW).]


You have the right to give instructions about your own health care. You
also have the right to name someone else to make health-care decisions for
you. This form lets you do either or both of these things. It also lets you
express your wishes regarding donation of organs and the designation of
your primary physician. If you use this form, you may complete or modify
all or any part of it. You are free to use a different form. [1995, c. 378,
Pt. A, §1 (NEW).]


Part 1 of this form is a power of attorney for health care. Part 1 lets you
name another individual as agent to make health-care decisions for you if
you become incapable of making your own decisions or if you want someone
else to make those decisions for you now even though you are still capable.
You may also name an alternate agent to act for you if your first choice is
not willing, able or reasonably available to make decisions for you. Unless
related to you, your agent may not be an owner, operator or employee of a
residential long-term health-care institution at which you are receiving
care. [1995, c. 378, Pt. A, §1 (NEW).]


Unless the form you sign limits the authority of your agent, your agent may
make all health-care decisions for you. This form has a place for you to
limit the authority of your agent. You need not limit the authority of your
agent if you wish to rely on your agent for all health-care decisions that
may have to be made. If you choose not to limit the authority of your
agent, your agent will have the right to: [1995, c. 378, Pt. A, §1 (NEW).]


(a). Consent or refuse consent to any care, treatment, service or procedure
to maintain, diagnose or otherwise affect a physical or mental condition;


[ 1995, c. 378, Pt. A, §1 (NEW) .]


(b). Select or discharge health-care providers and institutions;


[ 1995, c. 378, Pt. A, §1 (NEW) .]


(c). Approve or disapprove diagnostic tests, surgical procedures, programs
of medication and orders not to resuscitate; and


[ 1995, c. 378, Pt. A, §1 (NEW) .]


(d). Direct the provision, withholding or withdrawal of artificial
nutrition and hydration and all other forms of health care, including life-
sustaining treatment.


[ 1995, c. 378, Pt. A, §1 (NEW) .]


Part 2 of this form lets you give specific instructions about any aspect of
your health care. Choices are provided for you to express your wishes
regarding the provision, withholding or withdrawal of treatment to keep you
alive, including the provision of artificial nutrition and hydration, as
well as the provision of pain relief. Space is also provided for you to add
to the choices you have made or for you to write out any additional wishes.
[1995, c. 378, Pt. A, §1 (NEW).]


Part 3 of this form lets you express an intention to donate your bodily
organs and tissues following your death. [1995, c. 378, Pt. A, §1 (NEW).]


Part 4 of this form lets you designate a physician to have primary
responsibility for your health care. [1995, c. 378, Pt. A, §1 (NEW).]


After completing this form, sign and date the form at the end. You must
have 2 other individuals sign as witnesses. Give a copy of the signed and
completed form to your physician, to any other health-care providers you
may have, to any health-care institution at which you are receiving care
and to any health-care agents you have named. You should talk to the person
you have named as agent to make sure that he or she understands your wishes
and is willing to take the responsibility.[1995, c. 378, Pt. A, §1 (NEW).]


You have the right to revoke this advance health-care directive or replace
this form at any time. [1995, c. 378, Pt. A, §1 (NEW).]
