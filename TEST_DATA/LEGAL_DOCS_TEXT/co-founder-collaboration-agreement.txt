                     Co-Founder Collaboration Agreement


The  undersigned  (each  a  “Founder”  and  together  the  “Founders”)   are
collaborating with the purpose of developing  together  a  business  concept
related to the creation of a digital platform and online community  for  the
curation of travel content  and  associated  business  activities,  such  as
content & media distribution, advertising and  writer  recruitment  services
(the “Business  Concept  and  Technology”)  which,  if  developed,  will  be
transferred to and launched by a company to be formed by the  Founders  (the
“Company”).


In connection with such collaboration, and in consideration for  a  mutually
agreeable framework which shall serve as the foundation for the Founders  to
successfully develop the Business Concept and  Technology,  the  undersigned
hereby agree as follows:


             1. TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP TO COMPANY UPON FORMATION


Section 1.1 Each Founder shall grant and assign to the  Company  immediately
upon its formation all of his or her right, title, and interest  in  and  to
the  Business  Concept  and  Technology  (including  all  right,  title  and
interest to intellectual property thereto),  including  all  ideas  (however
formed or unformed) and labor and/or work  product  that  results  from  any
task or work performed by the Founder that relates to the  Business  Concept
or Technology for the full term of such  rights.  Each  Founder  shall  also
perform any and all acts and execute all documents and  instruments  as  may
be required by the Company at its sole discretion to perfect  title  in  the
Business Concept and Technology, and any related intellectual property.


Section 1.2 Any future agreement that requires an ownership interest in  the
Business Concept and Technology and  related  intellectual  property  to  be
transferred to a third party before the formation of  the  Company  must  be
agreed upon  by  each  Founder.In  the  event  of  such  an  agreement,  the
obligations of this Founder Collaboration Agreement  must  be  disclosed  to
that third party.


Section 1.3 For purposes of this Agreement, the Company shall be  considered
formed upon registration  and  recognition  of  a  business  entity  by  the
Secretary of State of any state, including but not limited  to  registration
and recognition of a limited liability company or any form of corporation.


                    2. OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE UPON FORMATION


Section  2.1  Upon  formation  of  the  Company,  the  entire  issued  share
ownership of the Company will be split equally, but in all  instances  shall
be reached by consensus  of  the  Founders.  Should  the  Founders  wish  to
reserve any portion of the shares for future  employees  or  for  an  option
share pool, any such portion of shares reserved  will  dilute  all  Founders
equally.


Section 2.2 The shares issued to  each  Founder  shall  vest  on  a  vesting
schedule to be determined by  the  Founders.  The  purpose  of  the  vesting
schedule is to encourage Founders to stay with the Company over the  vesting
period. If a Founder departs the Company prior to full  vesting  of  his  or
her shares, the remaining portion of any unvested shares shall  be  returned
to the Company in accordance with that vesting schedule.


Section 2.3 The shares issued to each  Founder  shall  come  from  the  same
series and class of shares, such that there is no difference in  the  rights
(including but not limited to voting and distribution  rights)  accorded  to
the shares issued to each Founder.


Section 2.4 Sale of the Company to an  interested  third  party  shall  take
place if the sale is authorized by the board of directors and a majority  of
the outstanding shares, and otherwise  in  conformity  with  all  applicable
state and federal laws.


                             3. CONFIDENTIALITY


Section 3.1 The Founders agree to keep the Business Concept  and  Technology
confidential; disclosure of the Business Concept and Technology  will  occur
only  on  an  as-needed  basis  and  only  upon  consent  of  all  Founders.
Notwithstanding such unanimous consensual disclosures,  the  Founders  shall
take all necessary  steps  to  keep  the  Business  Concept  and  Technology
confidential until the formation of the Company, at which time the  Founders
shall further detail and define any confidentiality obligations.


             4. CONTRACTUAL COMMUNICATION AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION


Section 4.1 Within two months of signature, if the  Founders  have  not  yet
formed a Company, the Founders agree to discuss the  benefits  of  continued
collaboration related to  the  Business  Concept  and  Technology  and  will
discuss a mutually agreeable timetable for the formation of the Company.


Section 4.2 In the event that the Founders do not  wish  to  continue  their
mutual collaboration,  the  Founders  shall  discuss  a  mutually  agreeable
separation and division of  assets  of  their  collaboration.  The  Founders
shall further define any and all confidentiality obligations related to  the
Business Concept and Technology. Consistent with Cal. Bus. &  Prof.  Code  §
16600, et seq., in no circumstance shall the underlying business concept  be
considered confidentialupon termination of this Agreement.


Section 4.3 In the event that the Founders  are  not  able  to  agree  to  a
mutually agreeable separation, the Founders agree that they will  submit  to
a binding confidential mediation and  conducted  by  a  mutually  agreed  to
mediator. The Founders agree and acknowledge that  all  provisions  of  this
agreement,  including  confidentiality  provisions,  shall  be  binding   up
through the end of this mediation process. Costs of the mediation  shall  be
borne equally by all Founders. The Founders hereby waive any  all  right  to
have this agreement adjudicated by a court or jury.


                      5. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES


Section 5.1 Each Founder represents and warrants that he or  she  is  not  a
party to any other agreement that would restrict such Founder’s  ability  to
perform  its  obligations  as  set  forth  in  this  Founder   Collaboration
Agreement. Each Founder represents and warrants  that  no  third  party  can
claim any rights to any intellectual property  or  other  proprietary  right
possessed by that  Founder  as  it  relates  to  the  Business  Concept  and
Technology.


                              6. CHOICE OF LAW


This Agreement shall be  governed  by  and  construed  in  all  respects  in
accordance with California law.


IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Founders have signed this Agreement on 3 April
