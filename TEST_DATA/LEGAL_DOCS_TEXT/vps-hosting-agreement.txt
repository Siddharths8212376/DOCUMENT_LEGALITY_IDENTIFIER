businesses.


Temple Pate is a Open Source shared hosting service, which means that a
number of customers sites and other email or storage services are hosted
from the same server. Temple Pate uses abuse controls to help ensure that

Disk space:
If you use your services consistently with the Terms of Service and these
paragraphs, your site can grow as large as necessary to meet your small

customers sites grow at rates well within our rules, but our abuse controls
may cause a brief delay while we evaluate if expansion is appropriate.


Data transfer:
In most cases, if you use our services consistently with the Terms of
Service and these paragraphs, visitors to your site will be able to
download, upload, and view as much content from your site as they like.
However, in certain circumstances, our server processing power, server
memory, or abuse controls could limit downloads from your site. These are
subject only to the Terms of Service and the rules that control how fast
your site can grow (see above).


Email storage:
You do not have to worry about hitting a storage limit if you use our
services consistently with the Terms of Service and these paragraphs.

your folder size, and there may be a short delay while we assess your
