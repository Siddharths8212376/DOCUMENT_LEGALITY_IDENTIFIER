2.3 Relationship Between  Parties.  Provider  will  act  as  an  independent
contractor under the  terms  of  this  Agreement  and  to  perform  specific
Services. Provider shall retain the power and  authority  to  supervise  and
control performance of the Services by Provider’s employees,  including  the
power to discipline, hire and fire Provider’s  employees.  Nothing  in  this
Agreement shall be construed to (a) give either Party the  power  to  direct

to Provider such information as  is  reasonably  required  for  Provider  to
effectively fulfill and perform the  Services.  Such  information  includes,
but is not limited to, monthly updates on performance of  Services  for  the
duration of this Agreement or any amendments  thereto.  Notwithstanding  the
foregoing, Customer agrees to make its team available to Provider  according

of Work or Services.


2.5 Failure by Customer of Delivery of Information. Customer  shall  deliver
all information necessary for Provider to perform  the  Services  listed  in

failure of execution of Services listed in Exhibit A.


3. Consulting Fees, Other Fees, Expenses, and Invoices



3.1 Costs of Performing Services. If applicable, all costs (such as  travel)
reported by Provider  to  Customer  pursuant  to  this  Agreement  shall  be
reasonable and necessary costs and pre-approved by  the  Customer.  Customer
shall reimburse Provider for all pre-approved Costs.


3.2 Invoice and Payment. Provider shall submit invoices to Customer for  the
Service Fees, together with the written report of Costs  as  provided  under
3.1 above, at such times and for such periods and upon  such  payment  terms
as may be agreed from time to time between the Customer  and  the  Provider.
All Service Fees shall be payable in U.S. Dollars.


4. Consideration


4.1  Calculation  of  Service  Fees.  In  consideration  for  the   Services
performed by Provider hereunder, Customer shall  pay  all  Provider’s  Costs
plus the fees for Services and/or Scope of Work  and  corresponding  payment
terms as specified in Exhibit A  (collectively,  the  “Service  Fees”).  The
Service fees shall be paid monthly  within  thirty  (30)  days  of  Provider
invoice, unless provided differently in Exhibit A.


4.2 Billing; Payments; Late Fees.  At  the  end  of  each  Provider  monthly
billing cycle, Provider will invoice  Customer  for  all  Fees  incurred  by
Customer during such billing cycle. Customer will pay the  invoice  in  full
within thirty (30) days of receipt. If full payment is not  made,  a  charge
equal to one and one-half percent (1.5%) will be added to the  balance  due,
not to exceed the maximum legal limit permitted by law. If Customer  becomes
thirty (30) or more days past due, the Services  shall  be  suspended  until
all past due charges are paid, and Customer shall  be  in  default  of  this
Agreement. Customer will continue to be responsible for any monthly  minimum
charge during any period that Services are suspended or  not  delivered  due
to Customer’s breach. If it becomes necessary for Provider to  enforce  this
Agreement through an attorney, collection agency, or directly through  small
claims court, Customer shall pay all attorney’s  fees,  agency  fees,  court
costs, and other  collections  costs,  including  without  limitation  post-
judgment  costs  for  legal  services  at  trial   and   appellate   levels.
Delinquency may affect Customer’s credit rating.


4.3 Taxes. Each Party shall bear and pay all of its  own  taxes  (including,
without  limitation,  income  taxes)  arising  under  applicable   laws   in
connection with the performance of this Agreement.


5. Records


At all times during the term of this Agreement, Customer shall maintain
full, complete and accurate books of account and records with regard to its
activities under this Agreement.


6. Term; Termination


6.1 Term. The initial term of this Agreement shall be for a  period  of  one
(1) months, commencing on the Effective Date. The Customer  shall  have  the
option to automatically  renew  for  additional  successive  one  (1)  month
terms, unless terminated pursuant to Subsection 5.2  (Termination)  of  this
Agreement.


6.2 Termination. Although this  Agreement  may  not  be  terminated  without
cause during the initial term, either party may forego automatic renewal  by
giving the other party not less  than  thirty  (30)  calendar  days  written
notice of termination prior to the expiration of the then-current  term.  If
either party breaches any provision of  this  Agreement,  the  non-breaching
party shall, upon providing written notice of such breach,  be  entitled  to
immediately terminate this Agreement, provided  such  breach  is  not  cured
within thirty  (30)  days  following  such  notice.  If  this  Agreement  is
terminated as a result of  a  breach,  the  non-breaching  party  shall,  in
addition to its right of termination, be entitled to pursue  legal  remedies
against the breaching party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if  Customer  is
in breach under Section 4 (Fees) of this Agreement, Provider  may  terminate
this Agreement effective ten (10) days after giving Customer written  notice
of such default, unless Customer shall have remedied the breach within  such
ten (10) day period.


6.3 Payment upon Expiration or Earlier Termination. Upon the  expiration  or
termination of this Agreement as set forth above in Subsections  5.1  (Term)
and 5.2 (Termination), Customer shall pay Provider in full for all  products
actually delivered and services actually performed by  Provider  under  this
Agreement prior to the effective date of such expiration or termination.


7. Use and Training


Customer shall limit use of the Service  to  its  employees  who  have  been
appropriately trained.

If the Permitted Applications include providing  a  Service  to  End  Users,
Customer agrees to contractually require all End Users to sign an  agreement
with substantially similar terms to this Agreement. Customer  warrants  that
in no event shall End Users’ use of  the  data  be  unrestricted  or  expand
beyond the Permitted Applications of this Agreement.  This  Section  is  not
intended to provide the Service to End Users  unless  specifically  provided
for in  the  Permitted  Applications.  Customer  shall  be  liable  for  any
violation of the terms and conditions of this Agreement  on  behalf  of  the
End Users, or Processor arising out of End Users’,  or  Processor’s  use  of
the Service as defined under this Agreement.


9. Proprietary Information


The Proprietary Information is and  shall  remain  the  sole  and  exclusive
property of Provider. Customer shall  have  only  the  limited  rights  with
respect to the Proprietary Information expressly granted in this  Agreement,

agrees that only Provider shall have the right to alter,  maintain,  enhance
or  otherwise  modify  the  Proprietary  Information.  Customer  shall   not
disassemble, decompile,  manipulate  or  reverse  engineer  the  Proprietary
Information and shall take all necessary steps to prevent such  disassembly,
decompiling,  manipulation  or  reverse  engineering  of   the   Proprietary
Information. Under no circumstances shall Customer sell, Services,  publish,
display, copy, distribute,  or  otherwise  make  available  the  Proprietary
Information in any form or by any means, except as  expressly  permitted  by
this Agreement, including without limitation the transfer to a  third  party
or, if not expressly prohibited by this  Agreement,  as  allowed  under  the
fair use provision of the Copyright Act, 17  U.S.C.  §  107.  Customer  will
take all reasonable steps, in accordance with the best  industry  practices,
to protect the security  of  the  Proprietary  Information  and  to  prevent
unauthorized use or disclosure. Customer is responsible for  all  access  to
and use of the Proprietary Information by Customer’s employees or agents  or
by means of  Customer’s  equipment  or  Customer’s  Provider  usernames  and
passwords, whether or not Customer  has  knowledge  of  or  authorizes  such
access or use.


10. Consumer Privacy


Customer acknowledges that the Service, while  comprised  in  part  of  data
keyed in by the Customer, describes information that may  be  deemed  to  be
sensitive information by some consumers. It is the  policy  of  Provider  to
respect the request of consumers to remove their name, mailing  address,  e-
mail address or  telephone  number  from  use  in  solicitation.  Customer’s
agreement to comply with this policy is an integral  condition  to  Provider
entering into this Agreement.

next succeeding business day thereafter. The parties hereto  do  not  intend
