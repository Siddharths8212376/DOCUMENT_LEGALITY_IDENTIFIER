    • Legacy.com, Inc. does not intentionally collect from or maintain
      Personally Identifiable Information of children under the age of 13,
      nor do we offer any content targeted to such children.
    • In the event that Legacy.com, Inc. becomes aware that a user of the
      Services is under the age of 13, the following additional privacy
      terms and notices apply:
         o Prior to collecting any Personally Identifiable Information
           about a child that Legacy.com, Inc. has become aware is under
           the age of 13, Legacy.com, Inc. will make reasonable efforts to
           contact the child’s parent, to inform the parent about the types
           of information Legacy.com, Inc. will collect, how it will be
           used, and under what circumstances it will be disclosed, and to
           obtain consent from the child’s parent to collection and use of
           such information.
         o Although Legacy.com, Inc. will apply these children’s privacy
           terms whenever it becomes aware that a user who submits
           Personally Identifiable Information is less than 13 years old,
           no method is foolproof. Legacy.com, Inc. strongly encourages
           parents and guardians to supervise their children’s online
           activities and consider using parental control tools available
           from online services and software manufacturers to help provide
           a child-friendly online environment. These tools also can
           prevent children from disclosing online their name, address, and
           other personal information without parental permission.
         o Personally Identifiable Information collected from children may
           include any of the information defined above as Personally
           Identifiable Information with respect to general users of the
           Services and may be used by Legacy.com, Inc. for the same
           purposes. Except as necessary to process a child’s requests or
           orders placed with advertisers or merchants featured through the
           Services, Legacy.com, Inc. does not rent, sell, barter or give
           away any lists containing a child’s Personally Identifiable
           Information for use by any outside company.
         o A child’s parent or legal guardian may request Legacy.com, Inc.
           to provide a description of the Personally Identifiable
           Information that Legacy.com, Inc. has collected from the child,
           as well as instruct Legacy.com, Inc. to cease further use,
           maintenance and collection of Personally Identifiable
           Information from the child.
         o If a child voluntarily discloses his or her name, email address
           or other personally-identifying information on chat areas,
           bulletin boards or other forums or public posting areas, such
           disclosures may result in unsolicited messages from other
           parties.
