    • Other members of the McAfee family of companies for the purposes
      described in this Privacy Notice, such as to (i) provide services and
      joint content (such as registration, sales, and customer support);
      (ii) help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts and violations
      of our policies; and (iii) guide our decisions about our products,
      services and communications.
    • Service providers and authorized partners who perform services for us
      (such as data storage, sales, fraud investigations and bill
      collection) based on our instructions. These third parties are not
      authorized by us to use or disclose personal information except as
      necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal
      requirements.
    • Third parties with your consent. For example, co-marketing with a
      business partner or sharing limited information as necessary with
      security research analysts.
    • Other business entities legally related to McAfee, such as our parent
      company, Intel, Inc. or any third party that may take over all or part
      of McAfee's functions in the future (provided that such party agrees
      to use such personal information in a manner that is consistent with
      this Privacy Notice). Should a further combination occur, we will
      require that the new combined entity follow this Privacy Notice with
      respect to your personal information.
    • We may also disclose personal information (i) if we are required to do
      so by law or legal process ; (ii) in response to requests by
      government agencies, such as law enforcement authorities or other
      authorized third-parties; (iii) as may be required for purposes of
      national security; or (iv) when we believe disclosure is necessary and
      appropriate to prevent physical, financial or other harm, injury or
      loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual
      illegal activity or exposure to legal liability.
    • McAfee will not disclose your personal information to non-affiliate
      third parties for their own marketing purposes unless you have
      provided consent.
    • McAfee family companies may share personal information with each other
      and use it in a manner that is consistent with this Notice. We may
      also combine it with other information to provide and improve our
      products, services, content and advertising.
    • Where we share this personal information with a third party with a
      contractual relationship with us (such as a provider of services to
      McAfee) these entities must comply with standards at least as
      stringent as McAfee's processing standards and are limited to those
      standards unless you wish to create your own independent relationship
      with that provider.
    • California Shine the Light Law

      McAfee does not share your personal information with third parties for
      their own marketing use without your permission.
