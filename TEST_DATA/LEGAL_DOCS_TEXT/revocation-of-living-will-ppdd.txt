WHEREAS, on [MONTH, DAY LAST KNOWN LIVING WILL SIGNED], [YEAR LAST KNOWN
LIVING WILL SIGNED], I, [NAME OF THE PERSON REVOKING], executed a "Living
Will" (or a similar document styled as a "Declaration" or "Directive to
Physicians") which provided that upon a terminal diagnosis, and my
inability to communicate decisions regarding the course of my treatment to
my physicians, that no extraordinary means be used to simply prolong my
life.


At this time, and after mature reflection, I have determined that I do not
desire for this instrument to have further effect, and I therefore revoke
the same.
