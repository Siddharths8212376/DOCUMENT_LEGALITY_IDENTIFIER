The Parties therefore agree as follows:

works of, edit, alter or otherwise use the  Work  Product  in  any  way  the
Company sees fit. The work the Contractor  creates  for  the  Company  under
this Agreement will not  be  deemed  a  “work-for-hire”,  as  that  term  is

Company also agrees that the Contractor may include, when  referencing  work
for the Company, a general description of the work under this Agreement.


4.3 The Contractor may incorporate into  the  software  various  preexisting
development tools, routines, subroutines, programs, data or materials (Know-

Know-How. The Contractor agrees that after the Company  pays  in  full,  the
Company will receive a nonexclusive, perpetual,  worldwide  license  to  use
the Know-How in the software created  under  this  Agreement.  However,  the
Company shall not resell or make use of that Know-How in  any  other  manner
other than in connection with the software you receive under this Agreement


5.0. Representations. Both Parties represent that they are fully  authorized
and empowered to enter into this Agreement, and that the performance of  the
obligations under this Agreement will  not  violate  or  infringe  upon  the
rights of any third-party, or violate any agreement between the Parties  and
any  other  person,  firm  or  organization  or  any  law  or   governmental
regulation.

limited to, trade secrets, sales figures, employee and customer  information
and any other information that the receiving Party  reasonably  should  know

acquired  or  developed  by  the  receiving  Party  without  violating   its
obligations under this Agreement or under any federal or state law.


7.0. Liability. NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY  SPECIAL,
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL  DAMAGES  ARISING  FROM  OR
RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING BODILY INJURY, DEATH, LOSS OF  REVENUE,
OR PROFITS OR OTHER BENEFITS, AND CLAIMS BY ANY THIRD  PARTY,  EVEN  IF  THE
PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THE  FOREGOING
LIMITATION APPLIES TO ALL CAUSES  OF  ACTION  IN  THE  AGGREGATE,  INCLUDING
WITHOUT LIMITATION TO BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH  OF  WARRANTY,  NEGLIGENCE,
STRICT LIABILITY, AND OTHER TORTS.
