Dear Sir/ Madam,


RE: Job Letter of Intent


I am writing this letter as a job letter of intent to get an opportunity to
be a part of the Golden City Enterprise. I am a graduate with
specialization in computer science and obtained my degree from a
prestigious school in Florida. I have also acquired a practical experience
as a programmer in a retail company for the past two years after completing
my graduation.


I am keen to get a chance to increase my knowledge in this field within
your working environment. Besides the distance advantage from my residence
to Golden City Enterprise, I am aware about the quality of your work that
leads the company ahead in the race. The computer systems undertaken by
your company hold a unique identity in the market as well as in my mind.


Please see my resume enclosed with the letter. I look forward to your
response.


Thank you.
