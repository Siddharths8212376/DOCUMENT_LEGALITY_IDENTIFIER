terms and conditions:


   1. Subtenant shall not assign  the  Sublease  Agreement  nor  sublet  the
      premises described in the Sublease Agreement (the  Sublease  Premises)
      in whole or part; and shall not permit  Sublessee’s  interest  in  the
      Sublease Agreement to be vested in any third party by operation or law
      or otherwise.


   1. This consent shall not be deemed to be a  consent  to  any  subsequent
      assignment  or  subletting.  Tenant  shall  not  make  any  subsequent
      amendment to the Sublease Agreement without Landlord’s  prior  written
      consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Landlord shall  not
      be deemed to have waived any rights under the Lease by virtue of  this
      Consent.


   1. The Lease shall remain in full  force  and  effect  according  to  its
      terms. Lessee shall remain primarily obligated to  perform  all  terms
      and conditions of the  Lease.  Subtenant  shall  remain  obligated  to
      perform all obligations under the Sublease Agreement.


   1. The Sublease Agreement is in all respects subordinate to the terms  of
      the Lease. Insofar as the specific terms  of  the  Sublease  Agreement
      purport to amend or modify or are in conflict with the specific  terms
      of the Lease, the terms of the Lease shall  control,  and  such  Lease
      terms  shall  apply  in  all  respects  to  Subtenant,   except   that
      Subtenant’s obligation to pay rent to Tenant shall  be  determined  by
      the Sublease Agreement. Landlord assumes no  liability  whatsoever  on
      account of anything contained in the Sublease Agreement.


   1. Any rights under the Sublease Agreement may be enforced  by  Subtenant
      only against Tenant, and Subtenant shall have no right to enforce  any
      of Tenant’s rights under the Lease against Landlord by virtue  of  the
      Sublease Agreement, this consent, or otherwise.


   1. Notwithstanding the subletting allowed herewith, Tenant shall  at  all
      times remain fully responsible and liable for the payment of the  Rent
      herein  specified  and  for  compliance  with  all  of  Tenant   other
      obligations under the Lease. If an event of  Default  defined  in  the
      Lease should occur while the Sublease Premises or any part thereof are
      then sublet, Landlord,  in  addition  to  any  other  remedies  herein
      provided or provided by law, may at its option collect  directly  from
      Subtenant  all  rents  becoming  due  to  Tenant  under  the  Sublease
      Agreement and apply such rent against any  sums  due  to  Landlord  by
      Tenant hereunder and Subtenant hereby authorizes and directs Subtenant
      to make such payments of rent  direct  to  Landlord  upon  receipt  of
      notice from Landlord.


IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has executed this  Consent  of  Landlord
as of this ___ day of _______________.
