      WHEREAS, all named parties above wish to pursue discussions  regarding
a possible business relationship between them (the “Transaction”); and


      WHEREAS,  such  discussions  may  require  the  parties  to   disclose
confidential information to each other; and


      WHEREAS, all parties wish to provide a mechanism for the protection of
the confidentiality of such information;


      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and agreements
hereinafter set forth the parties, intending to  be  legally  bound,  hereby
agree as follows:


1. DEFINITION


Each and any party (“Disclosing Party”) may disclose or grant to  any  other
party (“Receiving  Party”)  access  to  information  that  Disclosing  Party
considers  confidential   or   proprietary   (“Confidential   Information”).
Confidential  Information,  as  used  in  this  Agreement,  shall  mean  any
information or data which (a) if in tangible form or other  media  that  can
be  converted  to  readable  form,  is  clearly   marked   as   proprietary,
confidential  or  private  when  disclosed,  (b)  if  oral  or  visual,   is
identified  as  proprietary,  confidential,  or  private  at  the  time   of
disclosure, or (c) is of a nature or is disclosed under  circumstances  such
that a reasonable person would consider it confidential.


2. EXCEPTIONS


A Disclosing Party's Confidential Information shall not include  information
that (i) is or becomes part of the public domain through no act or  omission
of a Receiving Party; (ii) was in the Receiving  Party's  lawful  possession
prior to the disclosure and had not been obtained  by  the  Receiving  Party
from the Disclosing Party; (iii) is disclosed to the Receiving  Party  by  a
third party not known to the Receiving Party, following reasonable  inquiry,
to be subject to an  obligation  of  non-disclosure  with  respect  to  such
information; or (iv) is  independently  developed  by  the  Receiving  Party
without  use  of  or  reference  to  the  Disclosing  Party's   Confidential
Information.


3. RESTRICTIONS


Receiving Party agrees to hold in confidence and not to disclose  or  reveal
to any person or entity the  Disclosing  Party's  Confidential  Information,
and not to use Disclosing Party's Confidential Information for  any  purpose
other than in  connection  with  the  parties'  discussions  regarding,  and
performance of, a  Transaction.  Without  limiting  the  generality  of  the
foregoing, Receiving Party shall not disclose  Confidential  Information  of
Disclosing Party to any of Receiving  Party's  employees  or  agents  except
those employees or  agents  who  are  required  to  have  such  Confidential
Information in order to participate in the parties'  discussions  regarding,
or performance of, a Transaction, and who are under a written obligation  of
confidentiality or nondisclosure to Receiving Party. Receiving Party  agrees
to  take  commercially  reasonable  steps  to   ensure   that   Confidential
Information is not disclosed or distributed by its employees  in  breach  of
this Agreement,  including  but  not  limited  to  advising  each  permitted
employee  to  whom  Confidential  Information  is   disclosed   of   his/her
obligations regarding  confidentiality  and  non-use  of  such  information.
Receiving Party shall be fully responsible for any breach of this  Agreement
by its employees. Receiving Party may disclose Confidential  Information  of
the  Disclosing  Party  if  required  by  law  or  judicial,   arbitral   or
governmental order or  process,  provided  the  Receiving  Party  gives  the
Disclosing Party prompt written notice of such requirement,  reasonably  co-
operates (at the Disclosing Party's expense)  with  the  Disclosing  Party's
efforts to obtain a  protective  order  or  other  appropriate  relief,  and
discloses only the Confidential Information required to be  disclosed  under
such law, order or process


4. RETURN OR DESTRUCTION OF MATERIALS


The parties agree to return to  each  other,  or  to  destroy  upon  written
request of the other party, any and all  Confidential  Information  received
pursuant to this Agreement, together with all  copies  that  may  have  been
made, promptly upon  request  of  the  other  party  or,  if  not  requested
earlier,  upon  completion  of  the  Transaction  or  termination  of   this
Agreement. Upon  destruction  of  Confidential  Information  or  any  copies
thereof, the party accomplishing such destruction shall certify  in  writing
to the other party that such destruction has occurred.


5. EQUITABLE RELIEF


Receiving Party acknowledges and agrees that, due to the  unique  nature  of
Confidential Information, there can be no adequate remedy at law for  breach
of this Agreement and that such breach would cause irreparable harm  to  the
Disclosing Party. The Disclosing  Party  shall  thus  be  entitled  to  seek
immediate injunctive relief, in  addition  to  whatever  other  remedies  it
might have at law or in equity, in the event  of  an  actual  or  threatened
breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party.


6. OWNERSHIP


Confidential Information shall remain the sole  and  exclusive  property  of
the Disclosing Party. No patent, copyright, trademark or  other  proprietary
right is licensed, granted or otherwise transferred  by  this  Agreement  or
any disclosure hereunder, except for the right to use  such  information  in
accordance with this Agreement. No warranties of any kind are given for  the
Confidential Information disclosed under this Agreement.


7. NONSOLICITATION OF CUSTOMERS, CLIENTS AND EMPLOYEES


During the term of this Agreement and for a period of  one  (1)  year  after
the expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason,  each  party
hereto (the “Covenanting Party”) agrees that it shall not: (a)  directly  or
indirectly induce any customers or clients of the other party  to  patronize
the Covenanting Party or any similar business; (b)  directly  or  indirectly
request or advise any customer or client of the  other  party  to  withdraw,
curtail, or cancel such customer's  or  client's  business  with  the  other
party;  (c)  directly  or  indirectly  disclose   to   any   other   person,
partnership, corporation or association, the names or addresses  of  any  of
the customers or clients of the  other  party;  (d)  induce  or  attempt  to
induce any employee, agent or former employee or agent of  the  other  party
to leave the employ of the other party, or hire any such employee, agent  or
former employee or agent in any  business  or  capacity;  or  (e)  make  any
statement disparaging the  other  party,  any  member,  principal,  officer,
director, shareholder, employee or  agent  thereof,  to  any  person,  firm,
corporation or other business organization whatsoever.


8. ENTIRE UNDERSTANDING

parties with respect to its subject matter and supersedes all prior oral  or
written agreements, understandings and communications with respect  to  such
subject matter.


9. TERM AND TERMINATION

for a term of one (1) year, unless earlier terminated by either  party  upon

for one (1) year  from  the  date  of  expiration  or  termination  of  this
Agreement.


10. ASSIGNMENT

delegate its duties hereunder, without the  prior  written  consent  of  the
other party. All of the terms and provisions  contained  in  this  Agreement
shall inure to the benefit of and shall be binding upon the  parties  hereto
and their respective heirs, successors and permitted assigns.


11. CONSTRUCTION

provision shall be deemed deleted  from  the  Agreement  and  the  remaining
provisions shall continue in full force and effect. The provisions  of  this
Agreement may not be modified,  amended  or  waived,  except  by  a  written
instrument duly executed by both parties.


12. GOVERNING LAW


This Agreement shall be governed by  the  law  of  the  State  of  New  York
without regard to its conflicts of law principles.


13. WARRANTY

and to lawfully make the disclosures contemplated hereunder.


14. NO OBLIGATION TO ENTER INTO BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP


Nothing contained in this Agreement or  in  any  discussions  undertaken  or
disclosures regarding a Transaction will  (a)  be  deemed  a  commitment  to
engage in any business relationship, contract or  future  dealing  with  the
other  party,  or  (b)  limit  either  party's  right  to  conduct   similar
discussions or perform similar work with or for other parties,  so  long  as
said discussions or work do not violate this Agreement.


      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the
Effective Date.
