|2. OVERVIEW OF PROXIBID SERVICES                                  |
|Proxibid provides online event services in a variety of           |
|capacities. For auction-style events, Buyers who cannot be        |
|physically present at an event site have an opportunity to        |
|participate in the live event through real-time webcast online    |
|bidding ("live bidding"). Buyers who are unable to personally     |
|monitor the live event webcast have the opportunity to participate|
|in the event by entering an absentee bid ("pre-bidding").         |
|Proxibid also provides timed online event services. Proxibid      |
|allows Buyers to buy and Sellers to sell an item immediately      |
|through its "Instant Purchase" process. Under the "Instant        |
|Purchase" process, a Buyer has the ability to buy an item at a set|
|price (plus applicable buyer's premium, shipping and handling     |
|charges) without having to place a bid and compete in an auction  |
|for an item. As a Seller, you can offer an "Instant Purchase"     |
|option as part of your event listing, or you can offer "Instant   |
|Purchase" as the only option for an item.                         |
|Proxibid also allows Buyers to buy and Sellers to sell an item    |
|through its "Make an Offer" process. Under the "Make an Offer"    |
|process, the Buyer has the ability to submit an offer to the      |
|Seller to purchase the item, either directly to Seller or through |
|a Proxibid intermediary. By submitting an offer the Buyer is      |
|committing to purchase the item if the Seller accepts the offer.  |
|All events are operated by independent Sellers. The Sellers are   |
|solely responsible for running each event and regulating each     |
|sale. While this Agreement contains a set of default terms        |
|governing the relationship between a Buyer and Seller, each Seller|
|has the discretion to alter those terms for their individual event|
|and may impose Special Terms of Sale for participation. (See      |
|"DEFAULT EVENT TERMS" under Section 5 below).                     |
|Sellers have the ultimate discretion over approving or rejecting  |
|Buyers for each event. Creating an account as a Buyer with        |
|Proxibid does not automatically guarantee that a Buyer will be    |
|approved for any of the events hosted by Proxibid.                |
|Many Sellers have their own Web sites and their own Special Terms |
|of Sale which modify and/or supplement the Default Event Terms set|
|forth under Section 5 below and may or may not contain the same   |
|level of protection as the terms of this Agreement. Before        |
|participating in an event, a Buyer must review and accept the     |
|Special Terms of Sale governing the particular event, if any. A   |
|Seller shall not make any material changes to the Special Terms of|
|Sale governing an open event unless the Seller has provided       |
|written notice to all Buyers participating in the event. Any      |
|participating Buyer who does not receive such notice shall have   |
|the right to retract the Buyer's bid.                             |
|Because the Internet occasionally experiences disruptions,        |
|Proxibid cannot guarantee the Proxibid Services will be available |
|100% of the time. Although Proxibid strives to provide the most   |
|reliable services possible, interruptions and delays in service   |
|are unavoidable and Proxibid disclaims any liability for damages  |
|resulting from such disruptions. Thus, you use this Web site at   |
|your own risk.                                                    |
|Proxibid reserves the right to not conduct business with any      |
|individual Seller or Buyer or groups of Sellers or Buyers at any  |
|time for any reason, and to cancel any scheduled event at any time|
|and for any reason. Proxibid may terminate or deny access to this |
|Web site at any time at our sole and absolute discretion. Proxibid|
|will not be liable for any direct, indirect or consequential      |
|damages that result from such actions.                            |
|3. BUYER OBLIGATIONS                                              |
|3.1 Payment to Seller. Placing a bid in an auction-style event,   |
|making an offer through the Make an Offer process, or committing  |
|to buy an item through the Instant Purchase process is a legally  |
|binding obligation. If you are the successful Buyer, you agree to |
|pay the amount of your bid plus all applicable taxes and charges  |
|in the time and manner designated by the Seller. Failure to make  |
|such payment shall be deemed a breach of this Agreement.          |
|3.2 Payment to Proxibid. The parties acknowledge and agree that   |
|Proxibid is paid a percentage, to be solely determined by Proxibid|
|based on the event, of any successful bid/purchase utilizing the  |
|Proxibid Services (the "Proxibid Premium"), and the Seller        |
|incorporates such Proxibid Premium into the total purchase price  |
|due from the successful Buyer. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that |
|its payment of the Proxibid Premium to Proxibid is in             |
|consideration for Buyer's use of the Proxibid Services to become  |
|the successful buyer and such payment obligation is not contingent|
|upon the consummation of the sale transaction between Buyer and   |
|Seller. Accordingly, notwithstanding and without limiting Buyer's |
|payment obligation to Seller set forth in Section 3.1 above or    |
|Section 5 below (or the Seller's Special Terms), in the event for |
|any reason the transaction between the Buyer and the Seller is not|
|consummated or the Buyer otherwise does not make payment of the   |
|total purchase price owed to Seller with respect to the successful|
|bid/purchase offer, within fifteen (15) days of the date of the   |
|bid/purchase offer, the successful Buyer agrees to pay the        |
|Proxibid Premium directly to Proxibid. Any default in payment will|
|be subject to interest and collection fees as set forth under     |
|Section 27 below.                                                 |
|3.3 Absentee Bids. Buyers who are unable to personally monitor the|
|live event webcast have the opportunity to participate in the     |
|event through the pre-bidding process. Under the pre-bidding      |
|process in an auction-style event, a Buyer may not remove an      |
|absentee bid (pre-bid) without the approval of the Seller or      |
|Proxibid, which may be granted or denied in each of their sole    |
|discretion. Proxibid retains the right to take any adverse action,|
|including without limitation termination of a Buyer's account,    |
|against Buyers who are deemed to be abusing bid-retractions.      |
|Buyers expressly acknowledge and agree that Proxibid makes no     |
|guarantee or representation regarding the effectiveness or success|
|of pre-bids. By placing a pre-bid, a Buyer expressly authorizes   |
|Proxibid to begin bidding and continue bidding on Buyer's behalf  |
|at any price in excess of the opening bid (determined by the      |
|Seller in its discretion) up to the amount of the pre-bid. Buyer  |
|expressly acknowledges that Proxibid owes no duty to Buyer to     |
|obtain the lowest possible price on behalf of the Buyer and Buyer |
|may be able to enter a successful bid at a lower price if Buyer   |
|were to actively participate in the event.                        |
|3.4 Disclosure of Maximum Pre-Bids to Seller. Buyer acknowledges  |
|and agrees that a Seller may have access to and knowledge of      |
|Buyer's maximum pre-bid and may determine the starting bid based  |
|in whole or in part on the amount of Buyer's maximum pre-bid;     |
|provided that Seller must affirmatively "enable" such access and  |
|Buyer will be provided notice that such access to maximum pre-bids|
|has been enabled by the Seller prior to Buyer's submission of the |
|maximum pre-bid.                                                  |
|3.5 Due Diligence. Proxibid is not responsible for any errors or  |
|omissions in the description or photography provided on this Web  |
|site or in Proxibid's bidding application. Due diligence to verify|
|the condition and description of an item is the sole              |
|responsibility of the Buyer prior to placing any bid on this Web  |
|site.                                                             |
|3.6 User ID and Password. Buyer agrees to keep Buyer's user       |
|identification and password confidential and Buyer is solely      |
|responsible for any activity generated utilizing its account with |
|Proxibid. Buyer represents and guarantees that any and all        |
|information supplied by Buyer to Proxibid is accurate.            |
|4. SELLER OBLIGATIONS                                             |
|4.1 Seller Requirements/Approval. Sellers must be approved by     |
|Proxibid, in its sole discretion, before they can use Proxibid's  |
|Web site. Sellers must be licensed, bonded (if required by the    |
|state where Seller is located), and have a federal tax            |
|identification number. When deciding whether or not to approve a  |
|Seller, Proxibid will also consider: (1) Seller's outcry auction  |
|experience; (2) any professional designation which Seller may     |
|have; and (3) Seller's state and/or national association          |
|memberships.                                                      |
|4.2. Fees/Taxes.                                                  |
|(a) Fee Schedule – Auction Events . Seller agrees to pay Proxibid |
|the fees and expenses for each event for which Seller engages     |
|Proxibid to provide Proxibid Services (each an "Auction Event") as|
|set forth in Proxibid's then-current rate card (which has been    |
|provided to Seller and Seller acknowledges receipt thereof) (the  |
|"Rate Card") or as otherwise set forth in this Agreement or       |
|otherwise agreed upon in writing between Seller and Proxibid, and |
|any taxes related to the Auction Event.                           |
|(b) Fees for Additional Services . In the event Proxibid provides |
|additional services pursuant to a separate statement of work,     |
|purchase order, or otherwise agreed upon in writing between the   |
|Seller and Proxibid ("Additional Services"), Seller shall pay the |
|fees and expenses associated with such Additional Services agreed |
|upon between Seller and Proxibid. Seller acknowledges and agrees  |
|such Additional Services shall be considered Proxibid Services    |
|subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.            |
|(c) Due Date . Unless alternate payment arrangements have been    |
|agreed to in writing by Proxibid, payment in full is due to       |
|Proxibid no later than fifteen (15) days after the date of        |
|Proxibid's invoice (the "Due Date"). Any request for alternative  |
|payment arrangements must be submitted by Seller to Proxibid      |
|within ten (10) days following the Auction Event. Any amount due  |
|to Proxibid which is not paid by Seller by the Due Date shall be  |
|subject to interest and collection costs as set forth in Section  |
|27 below.                                                         |
|(d) Credit/Debit Card Payment Authorization . If Seller has       |
|provided to Proxibid a designated credit or debit card for payment|
|to Proxibid hereunder, Seller hereby represents and warrants to   |
|Proxibid that Seller is the authorized owner of such credit/debit |
|card account and hereby authorizes and directs Proxibid to make   |
|recurring charges to such credit/debit card in payment of all     |
|amounts due to Proxibid under this Section 4.2, and, if necessary,|
|initiate adjustments for any transactions credited or debited in  |
|error. This authority shall remain in effect for so long as Seller|
|maintains an account with Proxibid or until Proxibid is earlier   |
|notified by Seller in writing to cancel such authorization in such|
|time and manner as to afford Proxibid a reasonable opportunity to |
|act upon it. Seller agrees to notify Proxibid fifteen (15) days   |
|prior to Seller's next Auction Event of any changes made to       |
|Seller's designated account, including but not limited to closed  |
|status, bank ownership changes, account changes and changes in the|
|expiration date of the card. If any charge authorized hereunder is|
|rejected by Seller's credit card company or bank for any reason   |
|(including without limitation insufficient funds or closed        |
|account), Seller agrees to pay Proxibid prior to the Due Date the |
|amount of the declined charge plus, at Proxibid's discretion, an  |
|additional fee up to fifty dollars ($50).                         |
|(e) Reactivation/Recapture Fee . In the event Seller's account is |
|disabled by Proxibid upon Seller's nonpayment or other breach of  |
|this Agreement, and Proxibid agrees in its discretion to          |
|reactivate Seller's account, then Seller may be required to pay   |
|Proxibid a reactivation (as determined by Proxibid in its sole    |
|discretion).                                                      |
|(f) Non-Refundable . Seller acknowledges that all fees paid to    |
|Proxibid are non-refundable, and that under no circumstances will |
|Seller be entitled to a return of any fees paid to Proxibid.      |
|4.3 Auction Events.                                               |
|(a) Selling Options . Sellers can list an item in a combination of|
|ways: (1) through a fixed price (or "Instant Purchase") event, (2)|
|through an auction-style event with the Instant Purchase option,  |
|(3) through an auction-style event without the Instant Purchase   |
|option, or (4) through the Make an Offer option.                  |
|(b) Cancellation . If any Auction Event is cancelled by the Seller|
|during the seventy-two (72) hour period immediately preceding the |
|scheduled start of the Auction Event, Seller will be charged an   |
|amount equal to the standard event fee or per lot fee (as         |
|applicable) for such type of Auction Event as set forth in        |
|Proxibid's then-current Rate Card. If any Auction Event is        |
|cancelled by the Seller prior to such seventy-two (72) hour       |
|period, Proxibid may in its discretion charge Seller an amount    |
|equal to the standard event fee or per lot fee (as applicable) for|
|such type of Auction Event as set forth in Proxibid's then-current|
|Rate Card. Once a timed Auction Event has started, Seller may not |
|cancel, add, or remove any lots or modify the end time of the     |
|Auction Event unless Seller has obtained Proxibid's prior written |
|approval (which may be withheld in Proxibid's sole discretion and |
|may require an additional fee paid by Seller).                    |
|(c) Catalog . Seller must submit to Proxibid substantially all of |
|the content for the catalog not less than twenty-four (24) hours  |
|before the scheduled Auction Event. If Seller fails to do so,     |
|Proxibid may in its discretion cancel the Auction Event and charge|
|Seller an amount equal to the standard event fee or per lot fee   |
|(as applicable) for such type of Auction Event as set forth in    |
|Proxibid's then-current Rate Card. Supplemental auction content   |
|may be submitted up to one (1) hour before the scheduled Auction  |
|Event.                                                            |
|(d) Passed Lot Fee . If Seller conducts bidding for any lot within|
|an Auction Event without allowing Buyers the opportunity to bid   |
|using the Proxibid Services (a "Passed Lot"), Proxibid may in its |
|sole discretion charge Seller a fee per Passed Lot.               |
|4.4 Marketing and Accuracy of Materials. Proxibid is not          |
|responsible for any errors or omissions in the description or     |
|photography provided to us for use on this Web site. In addition, |
|Proxibid is not liable for any damages resulting from the         |
|photographs it takes or information that is collected at the event|
|location. Seller guarantees that the information provided to      |
|Proxibid by Seller (or any agent of Seller) is accurate. Seller is|
|responsible for the content and accuracy of any catalog or other  |
|promotional materials of any kind created for or by Seller in     |
|conjunction with any event.                                       |
|If Seller includes any statement that a product posted for sale   |
|through the Web site is sold "AS-IS" (attempting to disclaim      |
|implied warranties), Seller must also include a clear and         |
|conspicuous description of the known defect(s) in the product (for|
|example, "BROKEN", "MISSING PARTS", "FOR PARTS ONLY"). Any attempt|
|to list a product "AS IS" without a clear and conspicuous         |
|description of the defect is a violation of this Agreement.       |
|Seller shall not knowingly misrepresent any items. All catalog    |
|descriptions must accurately describe the items for sale, and all |
|photos must be original. If Seller uses stock photos, Seller must |
|disclose so in the catalog description as well as in the Special  |
|Terms of Sale for the auction.                                    |
|Proxibid does not evaluate the quality of the items auctioned/sold|
|or verify the claims made by Seller regarding your auctioned/sold |
|items. However, Proxibid reserves the right, at its sole and      |
|absolute discretion, (1) to prohibit Seller from promoting and/or |
|selling certain items; and (2) to replace any image or content on |
|this Web site. Seller agrees to remove any item from this Web site|
|upon Proxibid's request. (See "PROHIBITED USES OF THIS WEB SITE"  |
|under Section 10 below.) Proxibid may, at its sole and absolute   |
|discretion, market/advertise any of Seller's events.              |
|4.5 Legal Compliance. Seller acknowledges and agrees that Seller  |
|is licensed under all applicable federal, state and local laws and|
|regulations to conduct the activity described herein, including   |
|but not limited to acting as a Seller or auctioneer. When using   |
|this Web site Seller must obey all applicable federal, state and  |
|local laws. Any use of this Web site that violates any applicable |
|laws will be grounds for discontinuing your rights to this Web    |
|site. This Web site was created and will be operated from the     |
|United States.                                                    |
|4.6 Competitors. If Seller engages another online event service   |
|provider during any period of time when Seller is utilizing the   |
|Proxibid Services, (a) Proxibid may in its discretion increase the|
|fees owed by Seller in connection with Seller's Auction Events    |
|above the standard rates set forth in Proxibid's Rate Card, and   |
|(b) to the extent the Rate Card imposes any maximum on the amount |
|of Auction Event fees a Seller may be required to pay in a given  |
|period of time (sometimes referred to as an "event fee cap"),     |
|Proxibid may determine in its discretion that such event fee cap  |
|shall not apply to such Seller.                                   |
|4.7 Reconciliation. Seller has a duty to reconcile its event and  |
|to send an invoice through our system to notify the successful    |
|Buyer and Proxibid within twenty-four (24) hours of the end of    |
|each event. For any adjustments or corrections to the initial     |
|reconciliation, please contact reconcile.manager@proxibid.com.    |
|4.8 Recognition of Proxibid. For every event a Seller conducts    |
|utilizing Proxibid, Seller agrees to reference online bidding     |
|"Powered by Proxibid" in a prominent position on Seller's site, as|
|well as to include Seller's custom Proxibid URL in any and all    |
|marketing materials related to events on Proxibid, as appropriate.|
|                                                                  |
|4.9 Compliance with Laws Related to Sale of Certain Products.     |
|Seller acknowledges and agrees that the promotion, advertising,   |
|sale, and distribution of certain products are subject to federal,|
|state, and local regulations, including without limitation,       |
|firearms, Indian artifacts, recalled products, children's         |
|products, alcoholic beverages, coins and currency. Seller further |
|acknowledges and agrees the role of Proxibid with respect to the  |
|sale of products is limited to providing a conduit through which a|
|prospective purchaser is able to participate in an event without  |
|physically being present; Proxibid does not review or evaluate the|
|products auctioned or sold or verify the claims made by Seller    |
|regarding the products.                                           |
|Each Seller expressly represents that Seller is presently in full |
|compliance with and shall continue to comply with all applicable  |
|federal, state, and local laws, statutes, ordinances and          |
|regulations relating to the licensing, distribution, and sale of  |
|any products Seller promotes or sells through Proxibid            |
|(hereinafter, the "Regulations"), including without limitation (i)|
|the Gun Control Act of 1968 and all regulations promulgated by the|
|Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (collectively |
|the "Firearms Regulations"), (ii) the Consumer Products Safety    |
|Improvement Act of 2008, and all regulations promulgated by the   |
|U.S. Consumer Products Safety Commission, and (iii) the Indian    |
|Arts & Crafts Act of 1990 and any additional laws and regulations |
|applicable to the sale of Indian arts and crafts.                 |
|Seller hereby agrees that the Seller shall at all times defend,   |
|indemnify and hold harmless Proxibid, its shareholders, officers, |
|directors, employees, successors and assigns, from and against any|
|and all liabilities, losses, damages, awards, penalties, fines,   |
|costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable     |
|attorney's fees), causes of action, suits, claims, demands, and   |
|judgments of any nature or kind, arising under or resulting from: |
|(i) the use, sale, or distribution of any products in violation of|
|any Regulations; (ii) Seller's use of Proxibid in connection with |
|the sale of any products subject to any Regulations; and (iii)    |
|Seller's alleged or actual violation or breach of any Regulations.|
|                                                                  |
|4.10 PCI Compliance. The Payment Card Industry (PCI) Compliance   |
|Standard is a set of requirements designed to ensure that all     |
|companies that process, store or transmit credit card information |
|maintain a secure environment. All events on Proxibid that require|
|access to the full credit card number for invoicing require the   |
|Seller to view this information through the Auction Payment       |
|Network (www.apn.com) client application. No Winning Buyer Report |
|will be available. This downloadable application is the only      |
|method of accessing credit card information for payment processing|
|for Proxibid-run events. These changes are required to ensure we  |
|provide all Sellers with a safe and secure payment system that is |
|PCI-Compliant.                                                    |
|5. DEFAULT EVENT TERMS                                            |
|Unless and except as expressly set forth in any Special Terms of  |
|Sale, Buyers and Sellers agree to the following Default Event     |
|Terms:                                                            |
|1. Seller agrees that all goods and property sold "AS IS"         |
|(attempting to disclaim implied warranties) shall include a clear |
|and conspicuous description of any known defect(s) of the product |
|(for example: "broken," "missing parts," "for parts only").       |
|2. Buyers are encouraged to bid or make an offer to purchase an   |
|item only after they are completely satisfied as to origin,       |
|authenticity and condition. Questions regarding any item being    |
|sold should be directed to the event staff at least 48 hours prior|
|to the event.                                                     |
|3. For auction-style events, the Seller is allowing the Buyer to  |
|participate in the event through Internet pre-bidding and live    |
|bidding. The Buyer acknowledges and understands that such services|
|may or may not function correctly the day of the event. Under no  |
|circumstances shall the Buyer have any kind of claim against the  |
|Seller or anyone else if the Internet service fails to work       |
|correctly before or during the live event. The Seller will not be |
|responsible for any missed bids from any source. Buyers, who      |
|desire to increase the chance that their bid is acknowledged      |
|during a live event, should use the pre-bidding feature.          |
|4. For an auction-style event, if the Seller determines that any  |
|opening bid is not commensurate with the value of the article     |
|offered, the Seller may reject that opening bid and withdraw the  |
|article from sale; and, if having acknowledged an opening bid, the|
|Seller decides that any advance thereafter is not of sufficient   |
|amount, the Seller may reject the advance.                        |
|5. Due to the complexity of modern electronics and digital        |
|photography it is often impossible to get an exact and consistent |
|reproduction of color. Therefore, the only flawless manner to     |
|assess the color saturation and detail of any graphic is by       |
|personally viewing the subject. The Seller will not be responsible|
|for any variation between the catalog image and the actual piece. |
|6. The Seller may postpone or cancel the event, withdraw any      |
|property from the event, or change any terms of the event or      |
|particular conditions of sale prior to the event.                 |
|7. All announcements made on the day of the event supersede all   |
|printed material.                                                 |
|8. Certain items in the sale are being offered subject to reserve,|
|which is the confidential minimum price below which such lot will |
|not be sold.                                                      |
|9. Items may be offered with a "minimum bid", in which case, the  |
|Seller agrees to sell the item to the Buyer who bids at or above  |
|the minimum bid price.                                            |
|10. The Buyer's premium is set by the Seller and will be added to |
|the high bid to determine the total purchase price paid by the    |
|Buyer.                                                            |
|11. Once a Buyer has won the bid, ownership of the item           |
|immediately passes to the Buyer who thereupon (a) assumes full    |
|risk and responsibility therefore, and (b) shall pay the full     |
|purchase price therefore or such part as Seller may require. The  |
|item(s) becomes the full and sole responsibility of the Buyer at  |
|this point, and the Buyer assumes all risk of loss and damage. The|
|record of sale, kept by the auctioneer and clerk, will be taken as|
|absolute and final in all disputes.                               |
|12. Delivery of the purchased items is the responsibility of the  |
|Buyer unless shipping is offered by the Seller.                   |
|13. Items sold must be picked up or shipping arranged within a    |
|reasonable amount of time or the Buyer may be subject to removal  |
|and storage fees.                                                 |
|14. The value of an item purchased at the event is unrelated to   |
|the cost of shipping/packing. A Buyer who is a reseller of items  |
|should take this into consideration and be aware of shipping      |
|charges before bidding.                                           |
|15. Buyer must submit payment to Seller for all purchased items   |
|within thirty (30) days following receipt of an invoice. Such     |
|payment is subject to the terms of the invoice.                   |
|16. If, within a reasonable amount of time, Buyer gives notice in |
|writing to Seller that the lot so sold is a counterfeit and after |
|such notice the Buyer returns the lot to Seller in the same       |
|condition as when sold, and establishes to the satisfaction of    |
|Seller that the returned lot is in fact a counterfeit, Seller as  |
|agent for the consignor will rescind the sale and refund the      |
|purchase price.                                                   |
|17. These Default Event Terms shall constitute a legally binding  |
|contract between Buyer and Seller, which contract shall be        |
|construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the state in|
|which the Seller is located, without giving effect to the         |
|conflicts of laws principles of such state. In the event of any   |
|conflict or inconsistency between these Default Event Terms and   |
|any Special Terms of Sale, the Special Terms of Sale shall prevail|
|and govern.                                                       |
|Each Seller acknowledges and agrees that Proxibid makes no        |
|guarantee or representation concerning the enforceability or merit|
|of these Default Event Terms and that these Default Event Terms   |
|may not be enforceable or otherwise suitable for use in each state|
|and for each Seller and event. Sellers are strongly encouraged to |
|engage an attorney licensed in Seller's state to represent Seller |
|and modify the Default Event Terms for Seller's particular needs  |
|and specific state law.                                           |
|User acknowledges and agrees that Proxibid has no responsibility  |
|or obligation to police or enforce compliance by Buyers or Sellers|
|with the Default Event Terms or Special Terms of Sale.            |
|6. DISPUTE RESOLUTION                                             |
|6.1 Seller's Return Policy and Privacy Policy. Every Seller must  |
|have a published return policy and a published privacy policy in  |
|the Seller's Special Terms of Sale, even if that policy is that   |
|returns are not permitted.                                        |
|6.2 Seller's Liability. Seller is responsible for all reversals,  |
|chargebacks, claims, fees, fines, penalties and other liability   |
|incurred by Proxibid, a User, or a third-party caused by or       |
|arising out of Seller's breach of this Agreement, the Default     |
|Event Terms, or any Special Terms of Sale, and/or Seller's use of |
|the Proxibid Services. Seller agrees to indemnify and hold        |
|harmless Proxibid, other User, or a third party for any and all   |
|such liability.                                                   |
|6.3 Disputes Between Users. In the event of a dispute between you |
|and another User, you agree to use good faith efforts to resolve  |
|the dispute, including contacting the other User by reasonable    |
|means and allowing the other User a reasonable time to respond. If|
|you are unable to resolve a dispute directly with the other User  |
|through your own good faith efforts, you may contact our          |
|Operations Support Center and follow this process:                |
|Open a Dispute – If you are a Buyer, you must open a dispute      |
|within forty-five (45) calendar days of the date you made the     |
|payment for the item at the subject of the dispute. If you are a  |
|Seller, you must open a dispute within ten (10) calendar days from|
|date of the event for the item at the subject of the dispute. If  |
|you are a Seller and the amount of money or value of property     |
|which is the subject of your dispute is less than $1000, Proxibid |
|may require that you pay an administrative fee before opening a   |
|dispute.                                                          |
|Respond to Proxibid's Requests for Information in a Timely Manner |
|– During the dispute process, Proxibid may require you to provide |
|documentation to support your position. You may be asked to       |
|provide receipts, third-party evaluations, police reports, or any |
|other information or documentation that Proxibid specifies.       |
|Comply with Proxibid's Shipping Requests in a Timely Manner – For |
|Significantly Not as Described (SNAD) Claims, Proxibid may require|
|you, at your expense, to ship the item back to the Seller, or to  |
|Proxibid, or to a third party and to provide proof of delivery.   |
|For transactions that total less than $250, proof of delivery is  |
|confirmation that can be viewed online and includes the delivery  |
|address showing at least city/state or zip code, delivery date,   |
|and the URL to the shipping company's Web site. For transactions  |
|that total $250 or more, you must obtain signature confirmation of|
|delivery with online tracking.                                    |
|Dispute Resolution – Proxibid will make a decision in favor of the|
|Buyer or the Seller within a reasonable time after a claim is     |
|filed and the Users provide all requested information. Proxibid   |
|retains full discretion to make a decision in favor of the Buyer  |
|or the Seller based on any criteria Proxibid deems appropriate. In|
|the event that Proxibid makes a final decision in favor of the    |
|Buyer or Seller, each party must comply with Proxibid's decision. |
|Proxibid will generally require the Buyer to ship an item that the|
|Buyer claims is Significantly Not as Described back to the Seller |
|(at the Buyer's expense), and Proxibid will generally require a   |
|Seller to accept the item back and refund the Buyer the full      |
|purchase price plus original shipping costs. In the event a Seller|
|loses a claim, the Seller will not receive a refund on his or her |
|APN or Proxibid fees associated with the transaction. If Seller   |
|loses a SNAD Claim because the item sold is counterfeit, Seller   |
|will be required to provide a full refund to the Buyer. Seller    |
|liability will include the full purchase price of the item and    |
|original shipping cost (and in some cases, Seller may not receive |
|the item back).                                                   |
|6.4 Assumption of Rights. If Proxibid pays out a claim, reversal  |
|or chargeback that you file against a recipient of your payment,  |
|you agree that Proxibid assumes your rights against the recipient |
|and third-parties related to the payment, and may pursue those    |
|rights directly or on your behalf, at Proxibid's discretion.      |
|6.5 Release of Proxibid. If you have a dispute with one or more   |
|Users, you release Proxibid (and our officers, directors, agents, |
|joint ventures and employees) from any and all claims, demands and|
|damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature       |
|arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.        |
|7. INFORMATION COLLECTED BY PROXIBID                              |
|Collection and use of personal information is governed by our     |
|Privacy Policy. You hereby accept the terms of our Privacy Policy,|
|which can be accessed on our Web site at                          |

|content and materials on this Web site are protected by           |
|copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patents, trade secrets, or |
|other proprietary rights and laws. Except as expressly authorized |
|by Proxibid, you agree not to sell, license, rent, modify,        |

|9. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PROXIBID AND SELLERS                      |
|Proxibid has no affiliation with or control over the Sellers or   |
|over their operation of the actual events. Proxibid provides a    |
|service to Sellers and Buyers by facilitating the connection      |
|between the Seller and the Buyer. Proxibid is not responsible for |
|the content of any Seller's postings. Proxibid does not review or |
|evaluate the quality or origins of the items sold or verify the   |
|claims made by each Seller regarding its items.                   |
|Proxibid does not guarantee the accuracy of any of the postings or|
|content on the Web site. No User has a claim against Proxibid for |
|relying on these postings or content.                             |
|Proxibid has the right to monitor the Sellers' postings, but is   |
|under no obligation to do so. If Proxibid determines, in its sole |
|discretion, that any content posted on the Web site is            |
|inappropriate, Proxibid reserves the right to delete such content |
|from the Web site and to terminate or suspend the posting Seller's|
|account and/or use of this Web site.                              |
|9.1 Event Assistance Policy. Proxibid reserves the right to       |
|regularly monitor events to ensure they are running at peak       |
|performance. Proxibid may in its sole discretion (but shall not be|
|obligated to) assume the role of software operator when it is     |
|determined by our staff that Seller's online Buyers are suffering |
|a poor experience for any reason and/or instances where the       |
|software operator demonstrates an inability to properly run the   |
|software application. In such an event, Seller will be charged the|
|then-current rate for such additional services.                   |
|9.2 Real Estate Auctions. The role of Proxibid in the sale of real|
|property is limited to providing a vehicle for interested         |
|potential purchasers to utilize when they desire to bid at real   |
|estate auctions. Proxibid does not broker, sell, purchase,        |
|exchange, or lease real or personal property. No brokerage        |
|relationship or sales relationship of any kind is created between |
|Proxibid and any seller or buyer of real estate. Proxibid merely  |
|provides a conduit through which a prospective buyer is able to   |
|participate in a real estate auction without physically being     |
|present.                                                          |
|9.3 MarketGuard™. MarketGuard™ is Proxibid's proprietary          |
|risk-assessment software that relies on third party partners, as  |
|well as a Buyer's history with the Proxibid's platform, to        |
|determine a Buyer's "eligibility". Proxibid may limit eligibility |
|for certain events to Buyers that meet certain criteria.          |
|Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Buyer may be identified in     |
|Proxibid records in accordance with the Buyer's MarketGuard™      |
|results. Buyer further agrees that, each time Buyer attempts to   |
|participate in a Seller's event, Buyer may be granted or denied   |
|access to such event based on Buyer's MarketGuard™ results.       |
|Any breach of this Agreement by Buyer may negatively impact       |
|Buyer's MarketGuard™ results.                                     |
