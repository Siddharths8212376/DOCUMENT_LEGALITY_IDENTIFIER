TO: [LANDLORD'S NAME]


FROM: [YOUR NAME]


I received your letter demanding that I be out of my apartment within 7
days. Discussion of this with my lawyer reveals that you cannot carry out
an eviction without due process of law, which means taking me to court.


My defense against eviction will be that I have been withholding rent due
to your nonperformance of repairs. I would like to point out to you that I
have copies of several letters sent to inform you of the need for repairs,
and of the steps I took to obtain repairs. I also have return receipts
which prove that you received these letters. In addition,


I have proof that I have been maintaining an escrow account into which the
full amount of rent money due, or a portion of it, was deposited each
month. Also, I have receipts for all repair work and all bills which were
paid out of my escrow account.


During my tenancy, you have neglected to fulfill your statutory covenant to
repair. I do not feel that you have adequate cause to demand my eviction.


Please contact my lawyer if you wish to discuss this matter. His or her
name is ____________________________________.


Sincerely,


[YOUR NAME]
