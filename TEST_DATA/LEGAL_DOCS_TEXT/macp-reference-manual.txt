|  |for Ld. Judges to decide such tricky points/issues. Such   |   |

   1. While deciding a claim petition, preferred under the Motor Vehicles
      Act, 1988 (hereinafter referred as 'the Act'), more often then not,
      Ld. Judges of the Tribunals are vexed with such questions that it
      becomes difficult for them to come to a certain conclusion, main
      reasons for such vexation are:-


              1. Non availability of judgments on certain points,


              2. If judgments are available on some points, they run in
                 different directions,


              3. Lack of reference book to decide, as to whether the
                 insurance policy is 'Act Policy' (Statutory Policy) or
                 'Comprehensive Policy' (Package Policy).


   1. By way of this Article, an attempt is made to help Judicial Officers
      to decide claim petitions easily, and more particularly, in accordance
      with the law. Hon'ble Apex Court and Hon'ble High Courts have laid
      down principles/guidelines to decide claim petitions, which will be
      discussed herein-below.


3. Requirement for the police to forward to the Claims Tribunal “Accident
Information Report” (AIR) which the Tribunal has to treat as an application
for compensation:-


        1. The Bench comprising of Three Hon'ble Lordships of Hon'ble Apex
           Court in the case of Jai Prakash v/s National Insurance Com.
           Ltd, reported in 2010 (2) GLR (SC) has given following
           directions to Police and Tribunals.


A) Directions to the Police Authorities :


                     ▪ The Director General of Police of each State is
                       directed to instruct all police stations in his State
                       to comply with the provisions of Sec. 158(6) of the
                       Act. For this purpose, the following steps will have
                       to be taken by the Station House Officers of the
                       jurisdictional police stations :


(i) Accident Information Report ('AIR', for short) in Form No. 54 of the
Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 shall be submitted by the police
(Station House Officer) to the jurisdictional Motor Accidents Claims
Tribunal, within 30 days of the registration of the F.I.R. In addition to
the particulars required to be furnished in Form No.54, the police should
also collect and furnish the following additional particulars in the AIR to
the Tribunal :


(i) The age of the victims at the time of accident;


(ii) The income of the victim;


(iii) The names and ages of the dependent family members.


(ii) The AIR shall be accompanied by the attested copies of the F.I.R.,
site sketch/mahazar/photographs of the place of occurrence, driving licence
of the driver, insurance policy (and if necessary, fitness certificate) of
the vehicle and post mortem report (in case of death) or the injured or
dependent family members of the deceased should also be furnished to the
Tribunal.


(iii) Simultaneously, a copy of the AIR with annexures thereto shall be
furnished to the Insurance Company concerned to enable the insurer to
process the claim.


   1. The police shall notify the first date of hearing fixed by the
      Tribunal to the victim (injured) or the family of the victim (in case
      of death) and the driver, owner and insurer. If so directed by the
      Tribunal, the police may secure their presence on the first date of
      hearing.


B) Directions to the Claims Tribunals :


The Registrar General of each High Court is directed to instruct all Claims
Tribunals in his State to register the reports of accidents received under
Sec. 158(6) of the Act as applications for compensation under Sec. 166(4)
of the Act and deal with them without waiting for the filing of claim
applications by the injured or by the family of the deceased. The Registrar
General shall ensure that necessary registers, forms and other support is
extended to the Tribunal to give effect to Sec. 166(4) of the Act.


                     ▪ For complying with Sec. 166(4) of the Act, the
                       jurisdictional Motor Accidents Claims Tribunals shall
                       initiate the following steps :


(a) The Tribunal shall maintain an institution register for recording the
AIRs. which are received from the Station House Officers of the police
stations and register them as miscellaneous petitions. If any private claim
petitions are directly filed with reference to an AIR, they should also be
recorded in the register.


(b) The Tribunal shall list the AIRs. as miscellaneous petitions. It shall
fix a date for preliminary hearing so as to enable the police to notify
such date to the victim (family of the victim in the event of death) and
the owner, driver and insurer of the vehicle involved in the accident.
Once, the claimant(s) appear, the miscellaneous application shall be
converted to claim petition. Where a claimant(s) file the claim petition
even before the receipt of the AIR by the Tribunal, the AIR may be tagged
to the claim petition.


(c) The Tribunal shall enquire and satisfy itself that the AIR relates to a
real accident and is not the result of any collusion and fabrication of an
accident (by any "police officer-Advocate-doctor" nexus, which has come to
light in several cases).


(d) The Tribunal shall by a summary enquiry ascertain the dependent family
members/legal heirs. The jurisdictional police shall also enquire and
submit the names of the dependent legal heirs.


(e) The Tribunal shall categorise the claim cases registered, into those
where the insurer disputes liability and those where the insurer does not
dispute the liability.


(f) Wherever the insurer does not dispute the liability under the policy,
the Tribunal shall make an endeavour to determine the compensation amount
by a summary enquiry or refer the matter to the Lok Adalat for settlement,
so as to dispose of the claim petition itself, within a time-frame not
exceeding six months from the date of registration of the claim petition.


(g) The Insurance Companies shall be directed to deposit the admitted
amount or the amount determined, with the Claims Tribunals within 30 days
of determination. The Tribunals should ensure that the compensation amount
is kept in a fixed deposit and disbursed as per the directions contained in
Kerala S.R.T.C. v. Susamma Thomas, 1994 (2) SCC 176.


(h) As the proceeding initiated in pursuance of Secs. 158(6) and 166(4) of
the Act are different in nature from an application by the victims(s) under
Sec. 166(1) of the Act, Sec. 170 will not apply. The insurers will
therefore be entitled to assist the Tribunal (either independently or with
the owners of the vehicles) to verify the correctness in regard to the
accident, injuries, age, income and dependants of the deceased victim and
in determining the quantum of compensation.


C) Direction with respect to investment:-


In para No. 28 & 29 of Jai Prakash's case (supra) it has been held as
under:-


“28. To protect and preserve the compensation amount awarded to the
families of the deceased victim special schemes may be considered by the
Insurance Companies in consultation with Life Insurance Corporation of
India, State Bank of India or any other Nationalised Banks. One proposal is
for formulation of a scheme in consultation with the Nationalised Banks
under which the compensation is kept in a fixed deposit for an appropriate
period and interest is paid by the Bank monthly to the claimants without
any need for the claimants having to approach either the Court or their
Counsel or the Bank for that purpose. The scheme should ensure that the
amount of compensation is utilised only for the benefit of the injured
claimants or in case of death, for the benefit of the dependent family”.


29. We extract below the particulars of a special scheme offered by a
Nationalised Bank at the instance of the Delhi High Court :


(i) The fixed deposit shall be automatically renewed till the period
prescribed by the Court.


(ii) The interest on the fixed deposit shall be paid monthly.


(iii) The monthly interest shall be credited automatically in the savings
account of the claimant.


(iv) Original fixed deposit receipt shall be retained by the Bank in safe
custody. However, the original passbook shall be given to the claimant
along with the photocopy of the F.D.R.


(v) The original fixed deposit receipt shall be handed over to the claimant
at the end of the fixed deposit period.


(vi) Photo identity card shall be issued to the claimant and the withdrawal
shall be permitted only after due verification by the Bank of the identity
card of the claimant.


(vii) No cheque book shall be issued to the claimant without the permission
of the Court.


(viii) No loan, advance or withdrawal shall be allowed on the fixed deposit
without the permission of the Court.


(ix) The claimant can operate the Savings Bank account from the nearest
branch of U.CO. Bank and on the request of the claimant, the Bank shall
provide the said facility”.


4. How to decide a claim petition wherein Fatal Injuries were sustained by
the deceased:-


4.1 In Sarla Verma v/s Delhi Transport Corporation, reported in 2009 ACJ
1298 (SC) = AIR 2009 SC 3104 guidelines for determination of multiplier,
future prospects of the deceased, deduction towards personal and living
expenditures are issued. The ratio laid down in the case of Sarla Verma
(supra) was considered by the Three Hon'ble Judges of the Hon'ble Apex
Court in the case of Reshma Kumari v/s Madan Mohan, reported in 2013 ACJ
1253 (SC) and it is held that ratio laid down in the case of Saral Verma
(supra) should be followed by the all the Tribunals. The principles laid
down in the case of Srala Veram and Reshma Kumari (supra) quadetermination
of multiplier, future prospects of the deceased, deduction towards personal
and living expenditures are as under:-


a) Choice of Multiplier:-

|Age of the     |Multipl|
|Deceased       |ier    |
|Upto 15 years  |15     |
|15 to 20 years |18     |
|21 to 25 years |18     |
|26 to 30 years |17     |
|31 to 35 years |16     |
|36 to 40 years |15     |
|41 to 45 years |14     |
|46 to 50 years |13     |
|51 to 55 years |11     |
|56 to 60 years |9      |
|61 to 65 years |7      |
|Above 65 years |5      |


b) What should be the multiplier in the case of Fatal injury case, where
deceased was unmarried son/daughter:-


There are difference of opinion as to what should be the multiplier in the
case of fatal injury case, where deceased was unmarried son/daughter. In
Shyam Singh, reported in 2011 (7) SCC 65 = 2011 ACJ 1990 (SC), it has been
held that Multiplier in the case of death of unmarried son/daughter, proper
multiplier should be arrived at by assessing average age of parents of the
deceased. But different views are taken by Hon'ble Apex Court in the cases
of P. S. Somnathan v/s Dist. Insurance Officer, reported in 2011 ACJ 737
(SC), Amrit Bhanu Shali v/s NI Com., reported in 2012 ACJ 2002 (SC),
Saktidevi v/s NI Com, reported in 2010 (14) SCC 575 and Reshma Kumari v/s
Madan Mohan, reported in 2013 ACJ 1253 (SC). In the above referred cases it
has been held that in the case of death of unmarried son/daughter,
multiplier should be a applied on the basis of age of the deceased and not
on the basis of average age of the parents of the deceased.


c) Future Prospect of Deceased:-


In para No.11 of the Srala Verama's (supra) judgment it is held as under:-


“In view of imponderables and uncertainties, we are in favour of adopting
as a rule of thumb, an addition of 50% of actual salary to the actual
salary income of the deceased towards future prospects. where the deceased
had a permanent job and was below 40 years. [Where the annual income is in
the taxable range, the words 'actual salary' should be read as 'actual
salary less tax']. The addition should be only 30% if the age of the
deceased was 40 to 50 years. There should be no addition, where the age of
deceased is more than 50 years. Though the evidence may indicate a
different percentage of increase, it is necessary to standardize the
addition to avoid different yardsticks being applied or different methods
of calculations being adopted. Where the deceased was self-employed or was
on a fixed salary (without provision for annual increments etc.), the
courts will usually take only the actual income at the time of death. A
departure therefrom should be made only in rare and exceptional cases
involving special circumstances”.


        1. From the above referred observations, it becomes clear that
           where the deceased had a permanent job and was below 40 years
           (where the annual income is in the taxable range, the words
           'actual salary' should be read as 'actual salary, less tax'),
           addition should be 50% and if the age of the deceased was
           between 40 to 50 years, addition should be only 30% and there
           should be no addition, where the age of deceased is more than 50
           years. In the cases where the deceased was self-employed or was
           on a fixed salary, without provision for annual increments etc.,
           the Tribunal can usually take only the actual income at the time
           of death.


        1. It is also required to be born in mind that House Rent
           Allowance, Medical Allowance, Dearness Allowance, Dearness Pay,
           Employees Provident Fund, Government Insurance Scheme, General
           Provident Fund, C.C.A. etc should be treated as part and parcel
           of the income of the deceased, while calculating income of the
           deceased for the purpose of computing compensation. Reference
           may be made to ratio laid down by Hon'ble Apex Court in the case
           of Sunil Sharma v/s Bachitar Singh, reported in 2011 ACJ 1441
           (SC) also see Vimal Kanwar v/s Kishore Dan, reported in 2013 ACJ
           1441.


4.4 Now, the question is, when a departure from the above referred
guideline should be made? In this regards, reference is required to be made
to the ratio laid down in the case of K. R. Madhusudhan v/s Administrative
Officer, reported in AIR 2011 SC 979. In the said case deceased was aged 53
years and was working as Senior Assistant in Karnataka Electricity Board.
As per Board Agreement, after completion of five years, pay revision was
compulsory and evidence was produced by the claimants showing that if
deceased would have been alive he would have reached gross salary of Rs.
20,000/- p.m. Hence, even though deceased was above 50 years of age, it is
held that claimants are entitled to compensation calculated on the basis of
such increased income.


d) Deduction towards Personal and Living Expenditures:-


4.5 In Para No.14 of Sarla Veram's case (supra) it is held as under:-


“Having considered several subsequent decisions of this court, we are of
the view that where the deceased was married, the deduction towards
personal and living expenses of the deceased, should be one-third (1/3rd)
where the number of dependent family members is 2 to 3, one-fourth (1/4th)
where the number of dependant family members is 4 to 6, and one-fifth
(1/5th) where the number of dependant family members exceed six”.


4.6 In Para No.14 of Sarla Veram's case (supra) it is held as under:-


“Where the deceased was a bachelor and the claimants are the parents, the
deduction follows a different principle. In regard to bachelors, normally,
50% is deducted as personal and living expenses, because it is assumed that
a bachelor would tend to spend more on himself. Even otherwise, there is
also the possibility of his getting married in a short time, in which event
the contribution to the parents and siblings is likely to be cut
drastically”.


        1. Meaning thereby, the deduction towards personal and living
           expenses of the deceased, should be one-third (1/3rd) where the
           number of dependant family members is less than 3, one-fourth
           (1/4th) where the number of dependant family members is 4 to 6,
           and one-fifth (1/5th) where the number of dependant family
           members exceed six. And in the cases where deceased was
           unmarried son/daughter, the deduction towards personal and
           living expenses of the deceased, should be one-half.


4.7.1. It has been further held in Para No.15 of Sarla Verma's case (supra)
that:-


“Further, subject to evidence to the contrary, the father is likely to have
his own income and will not be considered as a dependant and the mother
alone will be considered as a dependent. In the absence of evidence to the
contrary, brothers and sisters will not be considered as dependents,
because they will either be independent and earning, or married, or be
dependant on the father. Thus even if the deceased is survived by parents
and siblings, only the mother would be considered to be a dependant, and
50% would be treated as the personal and living expenses of the bachelor
and 50% as the contribution to the family. However, where family of the
bachelor is large and dependant on the income of the deceased, as in a case
where he has a widowed mother and large number of younger non-earning
sisters or brothers, his personal and living expenses may be restricted to
one-third and contribution to the family will be taken as two-third”.


4.8 Plain reading of above referred observations, makes it clear that,
unless, it is proved that father of the deceased was not having independent
income, father of the deceased cannot be treated as dependant. Same analogy
applies in the cases of where claim petition is preferred by the sibling/s
of deceased who was/were unmarried brother/sister of such deceased. But if,
it is proved that father of the deceased was not having independent income,
father of the deceased can be treated as dependant. In the cases where
claim petition is preferred by the mother, sibling/s who were solely
dependant on the income of the of deceased, in such cases, one-third
(1/3rd) may be deducted towards personal and living expenses of deceased.


4.9 In Srala Veram (supra) it has been held in par 26 that:-


“In addition, the claimants will be entitled to a sum of Rs. 5,000/- under
the head of 'loss of estate' and Rs. 5,000/- towards funeral expenses. The
widow will be entitled to Rs. 10,000/- as loss of consortium'.


4.10 But a bench of Three Hon'ble Judges of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the
case of Rajesh v/s Rajbir Singh , reported in 2013 ACJ 1403 has held that
claimants will be entitled to a sum of Rs. 1,00,000/- under the head of
loss of care and guidance for minor children, Rs. 25,000/- towards funeral
expenses and the widow will be entitled to Rs. 1,00,000/- as loss of
consortium.


5. How to decide a claim petition wherein claimant has sustained Injuries:-


5.1 If the claim petition is preferred u/s 166 of the Act, in injury cases,
choice of multiplier remains the same, as in the case of fatal injuries
cases. Deductions towards personal and living expenditures are not made in
injuries case. To determine the future loss of income, ratio laid down in
the case of Raj Kumar v/s Ajay Kumar, reported in 2012 ACJ 1 = 2011 (1) SCC
343 is required to be followed. In paragraph 6 of the said decision, the
various elements of compensation are enumerated as under:-


"Pecuniary damages (Special damages)


(i) Expenses relating to treatment, hospitalization, medicines,
transportation, nourishing food and miscellaneous expenditure.


(ii) Loss of earnings (and other gains) which the injured would have made
had he not been injured, comprising:


(a) Loss of earning during the period of treatment;


(b) Loss of future earnings on account of permanent disability.


(iii) Future medical expenses.


Non-pecuniary damages (General damages)


(iv) Damages for pain, suffering and trauma as a consequence of the
injuries.


(v) Loss of amenities (and/or loss of prospects of marriage).


   1. Loss of expectation of life (shortening of normal longevity)".


5.2 Compensation in the case, where an injured victim is Government
Servant/Salaried person, whose salary has increased after the accident and
has not sustained any financial loss:-


              1. The concept of awarding compensation is :- that no amount
                 of compensation can restore the physical frame of the
                 appellant. That is why it has been said by courts that
                 whenever any amount is determined as the compensation
                 payable for any injury suffered during an accident, the
                 object is to compensate such injury" so far as money can
                 compensate" because it is impossible to equate the money
                 with the human sufferings or personal deprivations. Money
                 cannot renew a broken and shattered physical frame.


              1. Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Raj Kumar v/s Ajay Kumar,
                 reported in 2011 ACJ 1 = 2011 (1) SCC 343, has held in para
                 No.10 as under:-


“… On the other hand, if the claimant was a clerk in government service,
the loss of his left hand may not result in loss of employment and he may
still be continued as a clerk as he could perform his clerical functions;
and in that event the loss of earning capacity will not be 100% as in the
case of a driver or carpenter, nor 60% which is the actual physical
disability, but far less. In fact, there may not be any need to award any
compensation under the head of `loss of future earnings', if the claimant
continues in government service, though he may be awarded compensation
under the head of loss of amenities as a consequence of losing his hand...”


5.2.3 Reference is also required to be made to ratio laid down by Hon'ble
Gujarat High Court in the case of Gurdipsinh s/o Bisensingh Sadhu vs.
Chauhan Bhupendrakumar Udesing, reported in 1980 GLR 221. In the said
judgment, it is held that the Court can make rough estimate about loss of
earning capacity in the light of the facts and circumstances and the
available data of medical evidence on record. In the said case, Hon'ble
High Court had estimated the loss of earning capacity at 25% of actual
income and claimant was awarded Rs.45,000, though there was no immediate
reduction in his salary as a Technical Assistant in O.N.G.C. Relying upon
the said decision, Hon'ble Division bench of Gujarat High Court has held in
the case of Mohanbhai Gemabhai vs. Balubhai Savjibhai, reported in 1993(1)
GLR 249 (para 20) that:-


“No doubt, it is imperative for the Tribunal to consider the facts and
circumstances, and the medical evidence, showing the extent of physical
impairment. If no precise and direct evidence showing the percentage or
extent of the disablement is spelt out, the Tribunal can make rough and
reasonable estimate of loss of earning capacity so as to determine the just
amount of compensation under the head of 'prospective economic loss'.”


              1. Even the observations of House of Lords, reported in 1912
                 AC 496 are very relevant and same can be taken into
                 consideration. Reference required to be made to the ratio
                 laid down in 2013 ACJ 79 – para 20.


              1. From the above referred ratios of Hon'ble Apex Court and
                 Hon'ble Gujarat High Court, it becomes clear that Tribunal
                 can grant compensation to those injured persons who have
                 not suffered any financial loss or whose salary income have
                 actually increased after the date of accident and such
                 compensation should not be under the head of 'loss of
                 Future Earnings' but under the head of 'Loss off Amenities'
                 Such claimants are entitled for such amount of
                 compensation, calculated on the basis of 1/4th of the net
                 salary income, which they were getting at the time of
                 accident.


5.3 Determination of permanent Partial Disablement of the claimant:-


              1. In the cases where injured had sustained more that one
                 fracture injuries, it may appear to Tribunal that
                 disability certificate issued by the Doctor depicts the
                 higher value of disability than the injured claimant has
                 actually sustained. In such situation, Ld. Judge of the
                 Tribunal finds it difficult to arrive at the exact amount
                 of disability sustained by the injured claimant. Normally,
                 Doctors issue disability certificate on the basis of
                 formula invented by Dr. Henry H. Kessler in his book titled
                 as 'Disability – Determination & Evaluation'. For
                 determination of disability in such cases, Doctors apply
                 formula evolved by Dr. Henry H. Kessler. Said Formula reads
                 as under:-


A+{ [B (100-A)] / 100}


              1. In the said formula, 'A' stands for higher value of partial
                 disablement, whereas 'B' stands for lower value of partial
                 disablement. Doctors normally, take disadvantage of the
                 comments given on page No.49 of the above referred book.
                 Careful reading of the said comments, leads to the
                 conclusion that when injured victim/claimant has sustained
                 injuries, which resulted into two or more fractures on two
                 different limbs of the body, then in such situation
                 disablement in relation to whole body may be assessed as
                 per the above referred formula. But above referred formula
                 does not apply in the cases where claimant has sustained
                 two or more fractures on the same limb i.e one fracture on
                 right hand and second on left hand or one fracture on right
                 lag and second on the left leg. It is also mentioned in the
                 said book that lower part of the body i.e. legs or upper
                 part of body i.e. two hands are considered as one limb of
                 the body (lower limb or upper limb) and when
                 victim/claimant has sustained fractures on the one
                 particular limb then in such case, disablement in relation
                 to whole may be assessed as one half of the permanent
                 partial disablement assessed by the doctor. Say for an
                 example, claimant has sustained one fracture injury on
                 right leg and doctor has assessed disability in relation to
                 right lower limb as 27% and second fracture injury on left
                 leg and doctor has assessed disability in relation to left
                 lower limb as 7% and if, we apply simple principle in the
                 facts of the above referred example, the disablement in
                 relation to whole body, comes to 17%. (27% in relation to
                 right lower limb plus permanent partial impairment of 7% in
                 relation to left lower limb, divided by two [27% + 7% ] / 2
                 ). But, if we apply the above referred formula, disablement
                 in relation to whole body comes to 32.11%. { 27 + [7 (100 –
                 27) / 100] }. From the above referred discussion, it
                 becomes clear that when victim/claimant has sustained more
                 than one fractures on one limb and when victim/claimant has
                 sustained more than one fractures on two limbs, assessment
                 of disablement in relation to whole body is required to be
                 assessed by applying different formulas. Book written by
                 Dr. Henry H. Kessler, namely, 'Disability – Determination &
                 Evaluation' is considered to be the authority as far as
                 calculation of permanent partial disablement is concerned.
                 However, it is to be noted that Dr. Henry H. Kessler has
                 also mentioned in his book that there is always variation
                 of plus/minus 5%, in the permanent partial disablement
                 assessed by the doctor. Therefore, while deciding permanent
                 partial impairment of the injured claimant, above referred
                 facts are required to be remembered.


              1. Reference may also be made to 'Manual For Doctors To
                 Evaluate Permanent Physical Impairment', which is based on
                 expert group meeting on disability evaluation and national
                 seminar on disability evaluation and dissemination,
                 G.G.H.S.- W.H.O.- A.I.I.M.S., New Delhi -1981. Reference
                 may also be made to 'Disability Guidelines issued by Office
                 of Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities, dated
                 1st June 2001. Guidelines issued in the above referred
                 reports are as under:-


5.3.3.1. Guidelines for Evaluation of Permanent Physical Impairment in
Upper Limbs:-


1. The estimation of permanent impairment depends upon the measurement of
functional impairment, and is not expression of a personal opinion.


2. The estimation and measurement must be made when the clinical condition
is fixed and unchangeable.


3. The upper extremity is divided into two component parts the arm
component and the hand component.


4. Measurement of the loss of function of arm component consists in
measuring the loss of motion, muscle strength an co-ordinated activities.


5. Measurement of the loss of function of hand component consists in
determining the Prehension, Sensation & Strength. For estimation of
Prehension : Opposition, lateral pinch, Cylindrical grasp, spherical grasp
and hook grasp have to be assessed as shown in the column of “prehension
component in the proforma.


6. The impairment of the entire extremity depends on the combination of the
functional impairment of both components.


ARM COMPONENT:-


Total value of arm component is 90%.


Principles of Evaluation of range of motion of joints


1. The value for maximum R.O.M. in the arm component is 90%.


2. Each of the three joints of the arm is weighted equally (30%).


Example


A. fracture of the right shoulder joint may affect range of motion so that
active adduction is 90degree. The left shoulder exhibits a range of active
abduction of 180degree. Hence there is loss of 50% of abduction movement of
the right shoulder. The percentage loss of arm component in the shoulder is
50 x 0.03 or 15% loss of motion for the arm component.


If more than one joint is involved, same method is applied, and the losses
in each of the affected joints are added.


Say for example:-


Loss of abduction of the shoulder = 60%


Loss of extension of the wrist = 40%


Then, loss of range of motion for the


arm = (60 x 0.30) + (40 x 0.30) = 30%


Principles of Evaluation of strength of muscles:-


1. Strength of muscles can be tested by manual testing like 0-5 grading.


2. Manual muscle gradings can be given percentages like


3. – 100%


4. – 80%


5. – 60%


6. – 40%


7. – 20%


8. – 0%


9. The mean percentage of muscle strength loss is multiplied by 0.30.


If there has been a loss of muscle strength of more than one joint, the
values are added as has been described for loss of range of motion.


Principles of Evaluation of co-ordinated activities:-


1. The total value for co-ordinated activities is 90%.


2. Ten different co-ordinated activities are to be tested as given in the
Proforma.


3. Each activity has a value of 9%.


Combining values for the Arm Component:-


1. The value of loss of function of arm component is obtained by combining
the values of range of movement, muscle strength & co-ordinated activities,
using the combining formula


A+ b(90-a)/90


Where 'a' = higher value & 'b' = lower value


Example


Let us assume that an individual with a fracture of the right shoulder
joint has in addition to 16.5% loss of motion of his arm, 8.3% loss of
strength of muscles, and 5% loss of co-ordination. We combine these values
as :


Range of motion : 16.5% 16.5 +8.3(90-16.5)/90 =23.3 %


Strength of Muscles : 8.3%


Co-ordination : 5% 23.3 + 5(90-23.3)/90 =27.0%


So total value of arm component = 27.0%


HAND COMPONENT:-


Total value of hand component is 90%.


The functional impairment of hand is expressed as loss of prehension, loss
of sensation, loss of strength.


Principles of Evaluation of Prehension:-


Total value of Prehension is 30%. It includes :


(A) Opposition (8%). Tested against


Index finger (2%). Middle finger (2%)


Ring finger (2%) & Little finger (2%)


(B) Lateral Pinch (5%). Tested by asking the patient to hold a key.


(C) Cylindrical Grasp (6%). Tested for


(D) Large object of 4 inch size (3%)


(E) Small object of 1 inch size (3%)


(F) Spherical Grasp (6%). Tested for


(G) Large object 4 inch size (3%)


(H) Small object 1 inch size (3%)


(I) Hook Grasp (5%). Tested by asking the patient to lift a bag.


Principles of Evaluation of Sensations:-


Total value of sensation is 30%. It includes :


1. Grip Strength (20%)


2. Pinch Strength (10%)


3. Strength will be tested with hand dynamo-meter or by clinical method
(Grip Method).


10% additional weightage to be given to the following factors :


1. Infection


2. Deformity


3. Malaignment


4. Contractures


5. Cosmetic appearance


6. Abnormal Mobility


7. Dominant Extremity (4%)


Combining values of the hand component:-


The final value of loss of function of hand component is obtained by
summing up values of loss of prehension, sensation and strength.


Combining Values for the Extremity:-


Values of impairment of arm component and impairment of hand component are
combined by using the combining formula.


Example


Impairment of the arm = 27% 64 +27(90-64)/90=71.8%


Impairment of the hand = 64%


5.3.3.2. Guidelines for Evaluation of Permanent Physical Impairment in
Lower Limbs:-


The lower extremity is divided into two components: Mobility component and
Stability component.


MOBILITY COMPONENT:-


Total value of mobility component is 90%. It includes range of movement and
muscle strength.


Principles of Evaluation of Range of Movement:-


1The value of maximum range of movement in the mobility component is 90%.


2. Each of the three joints i.e. hip, knee, foot-ankle component, is
weighted equally – 0.30.


Example


A Fracture of the right hip joint may affect range of motion so that active
abduction is 27degree. The lift hip exhibits a range of active abduction of
54degree. Hence, there is loss of 50% of abduction movement of the right
hip. The percentage loss of mobility component in the hip is 50, 0.30 or
15% loss of motion for the mobility component.


If more than one joint is involved, same method is applied and the losses
in each of the affected joints are added.


Example


Loss of abduction of the hip = 60%


Loss of extension f the knee = 40%


Loss of range of motion for the mobility component


= (60 x 0.30) + (40 x 0.03) = 30%.


Principles of Evaluation of Muscle Strength:-


1. The value for maximum muscle strength in the leg is 90%.


2. Strength of muscles can be tested by manual testing like 0-5 grading.


3. Manual muscle gradings can be given percentages like


Grade 0 = 100%


Grade 1= 80%


Grade 2= 60%


Grade 3= 40%


Grade 4= 20%


Grade 5= 0%


4. Mean percentage of muscle strength loss is multiplied by 0.30.


5. If there has been a loss of muscle strength of more than one joint, the
values are added as has been described for loss of range of motion.


Combining Values for the Mobility Component:-


Let us assume that the individual with a fracture of the right hip joint
has in addition to 16% loss of motion 8% loss of strength of muscles.


Combing Values:-


Motion 16%, Strength 8%


= 16 +8(90-16)/90 =22.6%


Where 'a' = higher value, 'b' = lower value.


STABILITY COMPONENT:-


1. Total value of stability component is 90%


2. It is tested by 2 methods


3. Based on scale method.


4. Based on clinical method


Three different readings (in kilograms) are taken measuring the total body
weight (W), scale ‘A’ reading and scale ‘B’ reading. The final value is
obtained by the formula :


Difference in body weight divided by Total body weight, multiplied by 90.


In the clinical method of evaluation nine different activities are to be
tested as given in the proforma. Each activity has a value of ten percent
(10%).


5.3.3.4. Guidelines for Evaluation of Permanent Physical Impairment of
Trunk (Spine):-


The local effects of lesions of spine can be divided into traumatic and non-
traumatic lesions.

NON-TRAUMATIC LESIONS:-


Scoliosis


The whole Spine has been given rating of 100% and region wise the following
percentages are given:


Dorsal Spine - 50%


Lumbar Spine – 30%


Cervical Spine – 20%


Kobb’s method for measurement of angle of curve in standing position is to
be used. The curves have been divided into three sub groups :

|Particulars       |Cervical  |Thoracic  |Lumber    |
|                  |Spine     |spine     |Spine     |
|30degree (Mild)   |2.00%     |5.00%     |6.00%     |
|30-60degree       |3.00%     |15.00%    |12.00%    |
|(Moderate)        |          |          |          |
|Above 60degree    |5.00%     |25.00%    |33.00%    |
|(Severe)          |          |          |          |


In the curves ranging above 60 0, cardio-pulmonary complications are to be
graded separately. The junctional curves are to be given that rating
depending upon level of apex of curve. For example, if apex of dorso-lumbar
curve falls in the dorsal spine the curve can be taken as a dorsal curve.
When the scoliosis is adequately compensated, 5% reduction is to be given
from final rating (for all assessment primary curves are considered for
rating).


Kyphosis


The same total rating (100%) as that suggested for scoliosis is to be given
for kyphosis. Region-wise percentages of physical impairment are:


Dorsal Spine – 50%


Cervical Spine – 30%


Lumbar Spine – 20%


For dorsal spine the following further gradings are :


Less than 20degree – 10%


21degree – 40degree – 15%


41degree – 60degree – 20%


Above 60degree – 25%


For kyphosis of lumbar and cervical spine 5% and 7% respectively have been
allocated.


Paralysis of Flexors & Extensors of Dorsal and Lumbar Spine:-


The motor power of these muscles to be grouped as follows :


Normal -


Weak 5%


Paralysed 10%


Paralysis of Muscles of Cervical Spine:-

|Particula|Norma|Weak|Paralys|
|rs       |l    |    |ed     |
|Flexors  |0    |5.00|10.00% |
|         |     |%   |       |
|Extensors|0    |5.00|10.00% |
|         |     |%   |       |
|Rotation |0    |5.00|10.00% |
|         |     |%   |       |
|Side     |0    |5.00|10.00% |
|Bending  |     |%   |       |


Miscellaneous:-


Those conditions of the spine which cause stiffness and part etc., are
rated as follows :


A. Subjective symptoms of pain, No involuntary muscle spasm, Not
substantiated by demonstrable structural pathology. 0


B. Pain, Persistent muscle spasm and stiffness of spine, substantiated by
demonstrable and radiological changes. 10%


C. Same as B, with moderate radiological changes. 15%


D. Same as B, with severe radiological changes involving any one of the
region of spine (cervical, dorsal or lumbar) 20%


E. Same as D, involving whole spine 30%


In Kypho-scoliosis, both curves to be assessed separately and then
percentage of disability to be summed.


5.3.3.5. Guidelines for Evaluation of Permanent Physical Impairment in
Amputees:-


Basic Guidelines:-


1. In case of multiple amputees, if the total sum of percentage permanent
physical impairment is above 100%, it should be taken as 100%.


2. Amputation at any level with uncorrectable inability to wear and use
prosthesis, should be given 100% permanent physical impairment.


3. In case of amputation in more than one limb percentage of each limb is
counted and another 10% will be added, but when only toes or fingers are
involved only another 5% will be added.


4. Any complication in form of stiffness, neuroma, infection etc. has to be
given a total of 10% additional weightage.


5. Dominant upper limb has been given 4% extra percentage.


Upper Limb Amputation:-

5.4 What should be the amount of compassion in the cases where injured lost
one of the limb (amputation):-


              1. Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Govind Yadav v/s
                 N.I.A.Com., reported in 2012 (1) TAC 1 (SC) = 2012 ACJ 28
                 (SC) has held that as the cost of living and cost of
                 artificial limb (prosthetic) has substantially increased
                 and, therefore, Rs.2,00,000/- to be awarded under the said
                 head. Rs.1,50,000/-each to be awarded under the heads of
                 pain, shock & sufferings and special diet, attendance &
                 transportation and loss of amenities and enjoyment of life,
                 respectively. And if injured is unmarried and his/her
                 prospects for marriage have considerably reduced,
                 Rs.1,00,000/- may be awarded.


5.5 Whether Dependants of the injured claimant who died his natural death
during the pendency of the claim petition are entitled to get any amount of
compensation:-


5.5.1. Maxim “Actio Personalis Moritur-cum-Persona” is applicable in such
cases. Even provisions of Section 306 (along with Illustrations) of Indian
Succession Act, 1925 would apply. In the cases of Pravabati Ghosh & Anr.
Vs. Gautam Das & Ors., reported in 2006 (Suppl) 1 GLT 15, relying on the
ratio laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Melepurath
Sankunni Ezuthassan v/s Thekittil Geopalankutty Nair, reported in 1986 (1)
SCC 118, and the case of M. Veerappa v/s Evelyn Sequeria & Ors., reported
in 1988 (1) SCC 556, has held in paragraph 8 of the judgment thus:-


“the right to sue will not survive in favour of his representatives, for,
in such an appeal, what the legal representatives of such a claimant would
be doing is to ask for compensation and the right to ask for compensation
to be awarded does not survive if the claimant dies before the claim for
compensation is awarded or decreed in his favour, the cause of death not
being the injuries sustained by the deceased claimant”.


              1. From the above referred ratio it becomes clear that if the
                 claimant dies before the claim for compensation is awarded
                 or decreed in his favour is passed, claim petition at the
                 behest of the legal representative of the such injured
                 claimant is not maintainable.


6.How to determine monthly income of the deceased or injured when no
document in support thereof is not produced:-


        1. In the case of Govind Yadav (supra), para No.17 it has been held
           that when there is no proof of income, income of the deceased or
           injured claimant shall be decided by taking into consideration
           prevalence minimum wages.


        2. Several State Government have issued notifications of the
           relating to Minimum Wages Act, 1948 (hereinafter referred as
           '1948 Act'). Details of such notifications are under:-

7. How to determine income of the deceased or injured claimant when there
is documentary evidence on record to show that the deceased or injured
claimant was earning in foreign currency and not in Indian Rupee:-


        1. Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of United India Insurance Co. Ltd
           v/s S.Malarvizhi, decided on 6 June, 2013 has held that when the
           deceased or injured claimant was getting salary in foreign
           currency, then in such situation such foreign salary/income
           should be converted into Indian Rupee, at the rates applicable
           at the time of accident and deduction of higher percentage of
           60% of the income and low multiplier should be applied.


        1. Reference may also be made to ratio laid down in the case of In
           the case of United India Insurance Com. Ltd. v/s Patricia Jean
           Mahajan, reported in 2002 (6) SCC 281 = 2002 ACJ 1481= 2002 (4)
           Supreme 518. Said case before the Hon'ble Supreme Court arose
           out of a claim made on behalf of the Doctor of Indian origin who
           became the American citizen and was killed in a road accident
           when he visited India. The claim for compensation was based upon
           the income in the foreign country and while considering the said
           case, among other things, the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed
           that the total amount of compensation would work out to Rs.16.12
           crores with interest and looking to the Indian Economy, fiscal
           and financial situation, the amount is certainly a fabulous
           amount though in the background of American conditions it may
           not be so. It was further held that when there is so much
           disparity in the economic conditions and affluence of two places
           viz. place to which the victim belong and the place at which the
           compensation is to be paid, a golden balance must be struck
           somewhere, to arrive at a reasonable and fair compensation.
           Looking by the Indian standards they may not be much too
           overcompensated and similarly not very much under compensated as
           well, in the background of the country where most of the
           dependent beneficiaries reside.


8. How to decide a claim petition where defence of Invalid, Learners
Licence & Fake Driving Licence and Defense of Qualification/Badge is taken:-



        1. Reference is required to be made to ratio laid down by Hon'ble
           Apex Court in the case of National Insurance Com. Ltd. V/s
           Swaran Singh, reported in AIR 2004 SC 1531, in Para No.105 it
           has been held as under:-


105:- The summary of our findings to the various issues as raised in these
petitions are as follows :


(i) Chapter XI of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 providing compulsory
insurance of vehicles against third party risks is a social welfare
legislation to extend relief by compensation to victims of accidents caused
by use of motor vehicles. The provisions of compulsory insurance coverage
of all vehicles are with this paramount object and the provisions of the
Act have to be so interpreted as to effectuate the said object.


(ii) Insurer is entitled to raise a defence in a claim petition filed under
Section 163-A or Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 inter alia in
terms of Section 149(2)(a)(ii) of the said Act.


(iii) The breach of policy condition e.g. disqualification of driver or
invalid driving licence of the driver, as contained in sub-section
(2)(a)(ii) of Section 149, have to be proved to have been committed by the
insured for avoiding liability by the insurer. Mere absence, fake or
invalid driving licence or disqualification of the driver for driving at
the relevant time, are not in themselves defences available to the insurer
against either the insured or the third parties. To avoid its liability
towards insured, the insurer has to prove that the insured was guilty of
negligence and failed to exercise reasonable care in the matter of
fulfilling the condition of the policy regarding use of vehicles by duly
licensed driver or one who was not disqualified to drive at the relevant
time.


(iv) The insurance companies are, however, with a view to avoid their
liability must not only establish the available defence(s) raised in the
said proceedings but must also establish 'breach' on the part of the owner
of the vehicle; the burden of proof wherefore would be on them.


(v) The court cannot lay down any criteria as to how said burden would be
discharged, inasmuch as the same would depend upon the facts and
circumstances of each case.


(vi) Even where the insurer is able to prove breach on the part of the
insured concerning the policy condition regarding holding of a valid
licence by the driver or his qualification to drive during the relevant
period, the insurer would not be allowed to avoid its liability towards
insured unless the said breach or breaches on the condition of driving
licence is/are so fundamental as are found to have contributed to the cause
of the accident. The Tribunals in interpreting the policy conditions would
apply "the rule of main purpose" and the concept of "fundamental breach" to
allow defences available to the insured under Section 149(2) of the Act.


(vii) The question as to whether the owner has taken reasonable care to
find out as to whether the driving licence produced by the driver, (a fake
one or otherwise), does not fulfil the requirements of law or not will have
to be determined in each case.


(viii) If a vehicle at the time of accident was driven by a person having a
learner's licence, the insurance companies would be liable to satisfy the
decree.


(ix) The claims tribunal constituted under Section 165 read with Section
168 is empowered to adjudicate all claims in respect of the accidents
involving death or of bodily injury or damage to property of third party
arising in use of motor vehicle. The said power of the tribunal is not
restricted to decide the claims inter se between claimant or claimants on
one side and insured, insurer and driver on the other. In the course of
adjudicating the claim for compensation and to decide the availability of
defence or defences to the insurer, the Tribunal has necessarily the power
and jurisdiction to decide disputes inter se between insurer and the
insured. The decision rendered on the claims and disputes inter se between
the insurer and insured in the course of adjudication of claim for
compensation by the claimants and the award made thereon is enforceable and
executable in the same manner as provided in Section 174 of the Act for
enforcement and execution of the award in favour of the claimants.


(x) Where on adjudication of the claim under the Act the tribunal arrives
at a conclusion that the insurer has satisfactorily proved its defence in
accordance with the provisions of Sections 149(2) read with sub-section
(7), as interpreted by this Court above, the Tribunal can direct that the
insurer is liable to be reimbursed by the insured for the compensation and
other amounts which it has been compelled to pay to the third party under
the award of the tribunal. Such determination of claim by the Tribunal will
be enforceable and the money found due to the insurer from the insured will
be recoverable on a certificate issued by the tribunal to the Collector in
the same manner under Section 174 of the Act as arrears as land revenue.
The certificate will be issued for the recovery as arrears of land revenue
only if, as required by sub-section (3) of Section 168 of the Act the
insured fails to deposit the amount awarded in favour of the insurer within
thirty days from the date of announcement of the award by the tribunal.


   1. The provisions contained in sub-section (4) with proviso thereunder
      and sub-section (5) which are intended to cover specified
      contingencies mentioned therein to enable the insurer to recover
      amount paid under the contract of insurance on behalf of the insured
      can be taken recourse of by the Tribunal and be extended to claims and
      defences of insurer against insured by relegating them to the remedy
      before regular court in cases where on given facts and circumstances
      adjudication of their claims inter se might delay the adjudication of
      the claims of the victims”.


8.2 Bare reading of above referred observations makes it clear that mere
absence, fake or invalid driving licence or disqualification of the driver
for driving at the relevant time, are not in themselves defences available
to the insurer against either the insured or the third parties. To avoid
its liability towards insured, the insurer has to prove that the insured
was guilty of negligence and failed to exercise reasonable care in the
matter of fulfilling the condition of the policy regarding use of vehicles
by duly licensed driver or one who was not disqualified to drive at the
relevant time. The insurance companies are, however, with a view to avoid
their liability must not only establish the available defence(s) raised in
the said proceedings but must also establish 'breach' on the part of the
owner of the vehicle; the burden of proof wherefore would be on them. Even
where the insurer is able to prove breach on the part of the insured
concerning the policy condition regarding holding of a valid licence by the
driver or his qualification to drive during the relevant period, the
insurer would not be allowed to avoid its liability towards insured unless
the said breach or breaches on the condition of driving licence is/are so
fundamental as are found to have contributed to the cause of the accident.
The Tribunals in interpreting the policy conditions would apply "the rule
of main purpose" and the concept of "fundamental breach" to allow defences
available to the insured under Section 149(2) of the Act. If a vehicle at
the time of accident was driven by a person having a learner's licence, the
insurance companies would be liable to satisfy the decree.


8.3 It is also held in Para 105 (ix) and (x) that Tribunal is empowered to
pass and order to “Pay and Recover” against the insurer.


8.4 As far as, defence of insurer qua the qualification/badge of the
licence is concern, same can be decided by relying upon para Nos.42, 43 &
84 of the Swaran Singh's case. Paras 42, 43 & 84 reads as under:-


“42. If a person has been given a licence for a particular type of vehicle
as specified therein, he cannot be said to have no licence for driving
another type of vehicle which is of the same category but of different
type. As for example when a person is granted a licence for driving a light
motor vehicle he can drive either a car or a jeep and it is not necessary
that he must have driving licence both for car and jeep separately.


43. Furthermore, the insurance company with a view to avoid its liabilities
is not only required to show that the conditions laid down under Section
149(2)(a) or (b) are satisfied but is further required to establish that
there has been a breach on the part of the insured. By reason of the
provisions contained in the 1988 Act, a more extensive remedy has been
conferred upon those who have obtained judgment against the user of a
vehicle and after a certificate of insurance is delivered in terms of
Section 147(3) a third party has obtained a judgment against any person
insured by the policy in respect of a liability required to be covered by
Section 145, the same must be satisfied by the insurer, notwithstanding
that the insurer may be entitled to avoid or to cancel the policy or may in
fact have done so. The same obligation applies in respect of a judgment
against a person not insured by the policy in respect of such a liability,
but who would have been covered if the policy had covered the liability of
all persons, except that in respect of liability for death or bodily
injury.


   1. Section 3 of the Act casts an obligation on a driver to hold an
      effective driving licence for the type of vehicle which he intends to
      drive. Section 10 of the Act enables Central Government to prescribe
      forms of driving licences for various categories of vehicles mentioned
      in sub-section (2) of said section. The various types of vehicles
      described for which a driver may obtain a licence for one or more of
      them are: (a) Motorcycle without gear, (b) motorcycle with gear, (c)
      invalid carriage, (d) light motor vehicle, (e) transport vehicle, (f)
      road roller, and (g) motor vehicle of other specified description. The
      definition clause in Section 2 of the Act defines various categories
      of vehicles which are covered in broad types mentioned in sub-section
      (2) of Section 10. They are 'goods carriage', 'heavy-goods vehicle',
      'heavy passenger motor-vehicle', 'invalid carriage', 'light motor-
      vehicle', 'maxi-cab', 'medium goods vehicle', 'medium passenger motor-
      vehicle', 'motor-cab', 'motorcycle', 'omnibus', 'private service
      vehicle', 'semi-trailer', 'tourist vehicle', 'tractor', 'trailer', and
      'transport vehicle'. In claims for compensation for accidents, various
      kinds of breaches with regard to the conditions of driving licences
      arise for consideration before the Tribunal. A person possessing a
      driving licence for 'motorcycle without gear', for which he has no
      licence. Cases may also arise where a holder of driving licence for
      'light motor vehicle' is found to be driving a 'maxi-cab', 'motor-cab'
      or 'omnibus' for which he has no licence.In each case on evidence led
      before the Tribunal, a decision has to be taken whether the fact of
      the driver possessing licence for one type of vehicle but found
      driving another type of vehicle, was the main or contributory cause of
      accident. If on facts, it is found that accident was caused solely
      because of some other unforeseen or intervening causes like mechanical
      failures and similar other causes having no nexus with driver not
      possessing requisite type of licence, the insurer will not be allowed
      to avoid its liability merely for technical breach of conditions
      concerning driving licence”.


8.4 Meaning thereby, even if driver of offending vehicle was not qualified
to ply the offending vehicle or was not having the required badge to ply
such vehicle then also insurer is liable to pay amount of compensation.
Before passing any order, Tribunal has to decide whether the fact of the
driver possessing licence for one type of vehicle but found driving another
type of vehicle, was the main or contributory cause of accident. If on
facts, it is found that accident was caused solely because of some other
unforeseen or intervening causes like mechanical failures and similar other
causes having no nexus with driver not possessing requisite type of
licence, the insurer will not be allowed to avoid its liability merely for
technical breach of conditions concerning driving licence.


8.5 Reference is also required to be made to the recent decision of Hon'ble
Apex Court in the case of S. Iyyapan v/s United India Insurance Com. Ltd.,
dated 01.07.2013. Wherein, after referring several ratios of Hon'ble Apex
Court, it has been held in Para No.19 that:-


“In the instant case, admittedly the driver was holding
a valid driving licence to drive light motor vehicle. There is no
dispute that the motor vehicle in question, by which accident took
place, was Mahindra Maxi Cab. Merely because the driver did not get
any endorsement in the driving licence to drive Mahindra Maxi Cab,
which is a light motor vehicle, the High Court has committed grave
error of law in holding that the insurer is not liable to pay
compensation because the driver was not holding the licence to drive
the commercial vehicle. The impugned judgment is, therefore, liable
to be set aside”.


8.6 Even in the case of New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Roshanben
Rahemansha Fakir, reported in AIR 2008 SC 2266, it has been held that when
driver of offending vehicle was holder of licence of three wheeler i.e.
auto rickshaw delivery van and his licence was not meant for driving
'transport vehicle' but for goods carrying public carrier, in such case
Insurer is not liable but directed the insurer to first pay entire amount
of compensation with a further direction to recover the same from the
insured (these directions were issued under Article 142 of Constitution of
India).


9. In which circumstances, Insurer is liable to pay compensation when
injured claimant or deceased was travelling in the goods vehicle:-


9.1 It is the duty of the insurer to prove that injured claimant or
deceased was travelling in the goods vehicle and, therefore, it is not
liable to pay amount of compensation, unless, same has been prove, insurer
is liable to pay amount of compensation.


9.2 To decide whether, injured claimant or deceased was travelling in the
goods vehicle or not, Panchnama of scene of accident plays very vital role.
If, after reading Panchnama, it appears that there were goods loaded in the
vehicle or were found lying at the sight of accident then it can be
presumed that vehicle was used for carrying goods. However, there are some
points, which are required to be considered before fastening liability on
insurer, which are:-


9.2.1 Whether injured claimant or deceased was travelling in the cabin of
the goods vehicle or not. If, injured claimant or deceased was travelling
in the cabin of the goods, insurer is liable otherwise not. Reference be
made to ratio laid down by Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of National
Insurance Co. Ltd. v/s Cholleti Bharatamma, reported in AIR 2008 SC 484.


9.2.2 Whether the insurer is liable in a case where the injured claimant or
deceased was travelling in the goods vehicle as the labourer of the owner
or the hirer:-


                    1. If it is proved that injured claimant or deceased was
                       travelling in the goods vehicle as the labourer of
                       the owner of the goods then insurer is liable to pay
                       amount of compensation, provided additional premium
                       of labourer/collie is paid by the owner but insurer
                       is not liable in the such cases where injured
                       claimant or deceased was travelling in the goods
                       vehicle as the labourer of the hirer. Reference be
                       made to the ratio laid down in the case of Sanjeev
                       Kumar Samrat v/s National Insurance Co. Ltd, reported
                       in AIR 2013 SCW 301, wherein it is held that:-


“the Act policy does not cover all kinds of employees. Thus, on a
contextual reading of the provision, schematic analysis of the Act and the
Workmen's Compensation Act, 1923 it is quite limpid that the statutory
policy only covers the employees of the insured, either employed or engaged
by him in a goods carriage. It does not cover any other kind of employee
and therefore, someone who travels not being an authorized agent in place
of the owner of goods, and claims to be an employee of the owner of goods,
cannot be covered by the statutory policy”.


9.3 Whether insurer is liable in the case where injured claimant or
deceased was travelling in the goods vehicle as the owner or representative
of the goods:-


              1. If it is proved that the injured claimant or deceased was
                 travelling in the goods vehicle as the owner or
                 representative of the goods, insurer is liable to pay
                 amount of compensation otherwise not. Reference be made to
                 ratio laid own in the case of New India Insurance Company
                 v/s Darshana Devi, reported in AIR 2008 (Supp) SC 1639.


9.4 Whether injured claimant or deceased was travelling in Tractor-/trolley
is entitled to get amount of compensation:-


              1. Normally, Tractor-trailer/trolley is used for agricultural
                 purpose and if it found that same was used for agricultural
                 purpose and same is covered by the 'Farmer Comprehensive
                 Policy' or the 'Farmer Package Policy', in such situation,
                 insurer is liable to pay compensation. If the above
                 referred two conditions are not fulfilled, insurer can not
                 be held responsible to pay amount of compensation.


              1. It is also to be noted that in the Annexure of Indian Motor
                 Tariff, list of Miscellaneous and Special types of vehicles
                 is given. As per the said list tractors can be used for
                 Agricultural and if Trolley is attached to such Tractor,
                 same may be used for carrying goods. As per the said list
                 there is one another kind of Tractor, which is 'Traction
                 Engine Tractor'. If is found that tractor is not used for
                 the purpose of agricultural work and if it used for
                 carrying goods, such tractor-trolley must be insured for
                 such purpose and if is not insured as such, insurer is not
                 liable to pay any amount of compensation.


        1. It to be noted that when insurance policy contains 'Avoidance
           Clause', then in such situation, insurer is liable to pay
           compensation under the principle of 'Pay and Recover'. Reference
           may be made to the ratio laid down in the case of New India
           Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Vimal, Devi, reported in 2010 ACJ 2878 and
           ratio laid down by the Hon'ble Full Bench of Hon'ble Gujarat
           High Court in the case of Shantaben Vankar v/s Yakubbhai Patel,
           reported in 2012 ACJ 2715.


9.6. However, it is to be noted that the issue with respect to passing an
order of 'Pay and Recover' is pending for consideration before the Full
Bench of Hon'ble Apex Court. Reference be made to judgment delivered in the
case of National Insurance com. Ltd. v/s Parvathneni, reprted in 2009 (3)
GLH 377 (SC).


10. Liability of insurer to pay compensation in the cases where injured
claimant or deceased was travelling in the private car as occupants or
travelling on two wheeler as pillion rider:-


10.1. In the recent decision, Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of National
Insurance Company Ltd. v. Balakrishnan, reported in AIR 2013 SC 473 has
held in para No.21 that:-


“comprehensive/package policy" would cover the liability of the insurer for
payment of compensation for the occupant in a car. There is no cavil that
an "Act Policy" stands on a different footing from a "Comprehensive/Package
Policy". As the circulars have made the position very clear and the IRDA,
which is presently the statutory authority, has commanded the insurance
companies stating that a "Comprehensive/Package Policy" covers the
liability, there cannot be any dispute in that regard. We may hasten to
clarify that the earlier pronouncements were rendered in respect of the
"Act Policy" which admittedly cannot cover a third party risk of an
occupant in a car. But, if the policy is a "Comprehensive/Package Policy",
the liability would be covered”.


10.1.1. In view of the observations made by Hon'ble Apex Court in the case
of Balakrishnan (supra), occupant of private car or the pillion rider of
two wheeler is entitled to recover amount of compensation from insurer,
provided the offending vehicle is covered with the 'Comprehensive/ Package
Policy'. Reference may also be made to ratio laid down in the case of
Oriental Insurance Company Ltd. v. Surendra Nath Loomba, reported in AIR
2013 SC 483.


11. How to decide a claim petition preferred under section 163-A of the
Act:-


        1. As per the ratio laid down in the case of Deepal Girishbhai Soni
           and Ors. v. United India Insurance Co. Ltd., Baroda (2004) 5 SCC
           385 = AIR 2004 SC 2107, Hon'ble Full Bench of Apex Court has
           held that claim petition preferred u/s 163-A is under 'No Fault
           Liability'. Whereas, in the case of National Insurance Company
           Ltd. v. Sinitha, reported in AIR 2012 SC 797, Hon'ble Supreme
           Court has held that claim petition preferred u/s 163-A is under
           'Fault Liability'.


        1. It does not become clear from the facts of the of Deepal
           Girishbhai Soni's (supra) case as to whether, more than one
           vehicles were involved in the said accident or not but from the
           reading of the Sinitha's (supra) case, it becomes clear that
           there was only one vehicle involved and question which was
           required to be decided by Hon'ble Apex Court as to whether,
           insurer has succeeded in proving that claimant himself was
           negligent in causing the accident or not.


        1. From the reading of both the above referred ratios, it appears
           that there are conflicting views and, therefore, each claim
           petition may be decided on the basis of it's facts. That is to
           say, if only one vehicle is involved, point of negligence must
           be decided.


        1. It is to be noted that in a claim petition, preferred u/s 163A
           of the Act, income of the injured claimant or the deceased
           should not be more that Rs.40,000/- per annum. If, the income of
           the injured claimant or the deceased is more that Rs.40,000/-
           per annum, in such cases, claimant/s may be given an option to
           convert the same under Section 166 of the Act. If claim petition
           is not converted, even after the order/direction, same be
           dismissed. In this regards reference many be made to ratio laid
           down in the case of Deepal Girishbhai Soni (supra).


        1. It also required to be noted that in the Fatal injury cases,
           multiplier cannot be applied as same is applied only in the
           cases where claim petition is preferred by the injured.
           Reference be made to ratio laid down in the case of National
           Company Ltd. Versus Gurumallamma, reported in AIR 2009 SCW 7434,
           para No.8. Similar kind of observations are made by Hon'ble Apex
           Court in the case of Sarla Verma (supra), at Para No.17 (page
           No.3112 in AIR), which reads under:-


“... Therefore, where the application is under section 163-A of the Act, it
is possible to calculate the compensation on the structured formula basis,
even where compensation is not specified with reference to the annual
income of the deceased, or is more than Rs. 40,000/- by applying the
formula : (2/3 x A1 x M), that is two-thirds of the annual income
multiplied by the multiplier applicable to the age of the deceased would be
the compensation”.


        1. From the above referred ratios, laid down by Hon'ble Apex Court,
           it becomes amply clear that Tribunal is not required to make
           calculation of compensation on the basis of application of
           multiplier. But Tribunal is only required to grant compensation
           as per Schedule-II of the Motor Vehicle Act, taking into
           considering the age and income of the deceased and figure shown
           against the age and income of the deceased. For an example, if,
           monthly income of the deceased who was aged about 48 years at
           the time of accident, is assessed as Rs.2,500/- per month
           (Rs.30,000/- per annum), how the compensation should be
           calculated. Since Rs.30,000/- per annum is not shown anywhere in
           column of “ANNUAL INCOME” of the Second Schedule of the Act,
           now, the question, is how the amount of compensation to be
           calculated. In such cases, average of figures in the income
           group of Rs.24,000/- per annum and Rs.36,000/- per annum i.e
           Rs.2,86,000/- and Rs.4,32,000, respectively are required to be
           taken into consideration. Average of Rs.2,86,000/- and
           Rs.4,32,000, comes to Rs.3,59,000. Out of the said amount of
           3,59,000, 1/3 is required to be deducted in consideration of
           expenses incurred by deceased towards maintaining himself and,
           therefore, net amount of future income loss comes to
           approximately Rs.2,40,000/-. [Reference:- National Insurance
           Com. Ltd. v/s P.C. Chacko, reported in 2012 ACJ 1065 (Devision
           Bench of Hon'ble Kerala High Court, Ernakulan Bench)]


        1. It is to be remembered that in every claim petition preferred
           u/s 163-A of the Act, whether the deceased is married or not,
           unlike as claim petition preferred u/s 166 of the Act, one-third
           (1/3rd) amount from the actual income of the deceased should be
           deducted towards personal and living expenditures of the
           deceased.


        1. Over and above the future income loss, claimant/s is/are
           entitled to such amount, specified under the Second Schedule of
           the Act. However, in the case of Sapan v/s United India
           Insurance Com. Ltd., reported in AIR 2008 SC 2281, held that
           when claim petition preferred u/s 163A and claimant would remain
           crippled throughout life and would have no enjoyment for life,
           Tribunal can award further sum of Rs. 75,000/- for future
           medical treatment.


12. What if the cheque given for payment of premium of insurance policy is
dishonoured:-


        1. Reference may be made to the ratios laid down in the cases of
           Deddappa v/s National Insurance Com. Ltd., reported in (2008) 2
           SCC 595 = AIR 2008 SC 767 = 2007 AIR SCW 7948 and United India
           Insurance Com. Ltd v/s Laxmamma, reported in 2012 ACJ 1307 (SC).
           In both these judgments, it has been held that when cheque given
           for payment of premium of policy, is dishonoured and on that
           count Insurance Company cancels the policy by intimating the
           insured of such dishonour of cheque before the date of accident,
           then in such situation Insurance Company cannot be held liable
           to pay amount of compensation but if insurer fails to intimate
           the insured about such dishonour and cancellation of policy
           before the date of accident, then in such situation insurer is
           held liable to pay amount of compensation and Insurance Company
           may prosecute its remedy to recover the amount paid to the
           claimants from the insurer.


13. What is the meaning of “Arising out of use of Motor Vehicle”:-


        1. Legislature has advisedly used the expression 'arising out of
           the use of motor vehicle' and not 'connected with the use of
           motor vehicle' under Sections 140, 163-A and 166 of the Act and,
           therefore, there must be more direct and pronounced linkage or
           nexus between the use of motor vehicle and the accident which
           has resulted. A mere casual connection is not sufficient.


        1. To decide the such issue one may advantageously refer to the
           judgment delivered by Hon'ble Apex Court, reported as Shivaji
           Dayanu Patil and Anr. v. Vatschala Uttam More, (1991) 3 SCC 530
           = AIR 1991 Sc 1769. In the said case, Hon'ble Apex Court
           considered at length, the questions whether the fire and
           explosion of the petrol tanker in which deceased lost his life
           could be said to have resulted from an accident arising out of
           the use of a motor vehicle, namely the petrol tanker. The court
           answered the question in the affirmative, that is to say, in
           favour of the claimant and against the insurance company.


        1. It is true that the case Shivaji Dayanu Patil (supra) arose from
           the claim for no-fault compensation under section 92A of the
           1939 Act (u/s 163-A of the New Act). All the material facts were
           considered at length by Hon'ble Apex Court in above referred
           case and, therefore, said principle is also applicable in the
           claim petition preferred u/s 166 of the Act.


        1. Ratio laid down by Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Shivaji
           Dayanu Patil (supra) is also relied upon by Hon'ble Apex Court
           in several decisions, namely, Samir Chanda, v/s Managing
           Director, Assam State Transport Corporation, reported in AIR
           1999 SC 136 and Smt. Rita Devi v/s New India Assurance Co. Ltd.,
           reported in AIR 2000 SC 1930 and New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v.
           Yadu Sambhaji More, reported in AIR 2011 SC 666.


14. Whether Finance Company, which has advanced loan for the purpose of
purchase of vehicle under the 'Hire Purchase Agreement' can be said to be
the owner of the Vehicle:-


        1. Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Godavari Finance v/s Degala
           Satyanarayananamma, reported in 2008 ACJ 1612 has held in para
           13 as under:-


“13. In case of a motor vehicle which is subjected to a Hire-Purchase
Agreement, the financier cannot ordinarily be treated to be the owner. The
person who is in possession of the vehicle, and not the financier being the
owner would be liable to pay damages for the motor accident”.


        1. Reference may also be made ratio laid down in the case of Anup
           Sarmah v/s Bhola Nath Sharma, reported in IV (2012) CPJ 3 (SC),
           para No.8 & 9.


15. When an accident, involving two vehicles and driver of one of the
unknown vehicle sped away after the accident, whether in such situation,
claim petition is maintainable against the other tortfeasor, in view of the
provisions contained under Sections 161 & 163 of the Act:-


        1. Hon'ble Division Bench of Gujarat High Court in First Appeal
           No.3354 of 2000 with Civil Application No.746 of 2005 dated
           13.7.2005 has held in such situation claim petition is not
           maintainable. But Hon'ble Gujarat High Court in the case of
           Bhanuben P. Joshi V/s. Kantilal B. Parmar, reported in 1994 ACJ
           714 (DB) has held otherwise. Facts of the Bhanuben P. Joshi
           (supra) as under:-


              1. In the said case accident occurred because one unknown
                 truck dashed the motor cycle from behind and after the
                 accident, truck driver sped away with the truck and
                 remained unidentified and pillion rider sustained fatal
                 injuries. Claimants of the said claim petition averred that
                 motor cycle was being driven by its rider at excessive
                 speed and in rash and negligent manner. Tribunal dismissed
                 the claim petition by holding that there was no rashness on
                 the part of the motor cyclist. After noting the said facts
                 Hon'ble Gujarat High Court has observed that motor cycle
                 was being driven in rash and negligent manner and in
                 flagrant violation of traffic rules and regulations and
                 finally reversed the finding of Tribunal.


              1. It is also held in para No.9 of the above referred ratio,
                 namely Bhanuben P. Joshi (supra) that victims of road
                 accident are entitled to claim compensation from all or any
                 of the joint tortfeasors, it would not be necessary to
                 apportion the extent of contribution of each driver of
                 happening of unfortunate accident.


        1. From the above referred ratios it becomes clear that even if
           driver and owner of the unknown vehicle is not joined as parties
           opponents, claim petition is maintainable against any one of the
           tortfeasors.


16. Whether all the joint tortfeasors are required to be joined as party
opponents in the claim petition:-


        1. Hon'ble Gujarat Court in the case of O.I.Com.Ltd. v/s Zubedaben
           Pathan, in F.A. No.651 of 2012 and judgment dated 18.02.2010,
           delivered by Hon'ble Kerala Court in the case of U.I.Com.Ltd.
           v/s Mariamma George, in M.A.C.A. No.744 of 2005 have held that
           the claimant/s is/are not entitled to recover amount of
           compensation, jointly and severally from the insurance
           company/companies, if all the tortfeasors are not joined.


        1. But Hon'ble Gujarat High Court in the case of Amarsing Jugabhai
           v/s Vijyaben Dhuliya, reported in 1996(3) GLR 493 has held in
           para No.23 that:-


“Where a person is injured in a motor accident which occurs not on account
of his negligence, but because the drivers of collided vehicles were
negligent, the claimants are entitled to damage jointly and severally from
the negligent respondents. Every wrong-doer is liable for the whole damage
and it does not matter whether they acted between themselves as equals. A
decree passed against two or more tortfeasors can be executed against any
one of the defendants and such defendant can be compelled to pay the entire
amount of damages decreed. It is further clear that the defendant who is
compelled to pay the entire amount of damages decreed has a right to
contribution from the other wrong-doer. The liability in the case of
composite negligence, unless must normally should not be apportioned
because the claimant is able to recover the whole amount of compensation
from owner or driver of either vehicles. In case of composite negligence,
liability for compensation in normal circumstances, should not be
apportioned, as both wrong-doers are jointly and severally liable for the
whole loss. Rule of apportionment of liability applies in a case of
contributory negligence, i.e., where the injured himself is also guilty of
negligence.”


        1. Hon'ble Gujarat High Court in the case of Kusumben Vipinchandra
           Shah v. Arvindbhai Narmadashankar Raval, reported in AIR 2007
           Guj. 121. Wherein it is held that:-


“As held in Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation v. Gurunath Shahu
(supra), the finding given by the Tribunal in such a case regarding
apportionment of liability would be tentative for the purpose of subsequent
proceeding which might be filed by the defendant tortfeasor against the
other joint tortfeasor who was not a party to the first proceeding. But
such tentativeness for the purpose of contribution between two joint
tortfeasors did not at all affect the right of the plaintiff-claimant to
recover full damages from the defendant tortfeasor against whom the first
proceeding was filed”.


        1. From the above referred ratios it becomes clear that claimant/s
           is/are not required to join all the tortfeasors as party
           opponent/s.


17. Whether the point of negligence and liability of insurer, decided by
the co-ordinate Tribunal is binding on the other co-ordinate Tribunal, if
the claim petition has arisen from the same accident:-


        1. Hon'ble the Privy Council in its decision rendered in the case
           of Syed Mohamamd Saadat Ali Khan v. Mirza Wiquar Ali Beg,
           reported in AIR (30) 1943 PC 115 has observed as under :-


"In order that a decision should operate as res judicata between co-
defendants, three conditions must exist : (1) There must be a conflict of
interest between those co-defendants, (2) it must be necessary to decide
the conflict in order to give the plaintiff the relief he claims, and (3)
the question between the co-defendants must have been finally decided."


        1. Thus, the Privy Council has laid down that if the aforesaid
           three conditions stand satisfied, res judicata can operate
           between the co-defendants also. Said principle is also followed
           by Hon'ble Gujarat High Court in the case of United India
           Insurance Com. ltd. v/s. Laljibhai Hamirbhai, reported in 2007
           (1) GLR 633.


18. Whether a claim petition preferred by the a claimant (also the owner of
the offending vehicle, without involving another vehicle) alleging therein
that accident occurred because of the rash and negligent driving of the
driver of the vehicle owned by him, is maintainable:-


        1. Hon'ble Apex Court in the cases of Dhanraj v/s N.I.A.Com. Ltd.,
           reported in 2005 ACJ No.1, Oriental Insurance Com. Ltd. v/s
           Jhuma Saha, reported in 2007 ACJ 818 and N.I.A. Com. Ltd. v/s
           Meera Bai, reported in 2007 ACJ 821 has interpreted Section 147
           and it has been held that Section 147 does not require an
           Insurance Company to assume risk for death or bodily injury to
           the owner of the vehicle.


        1. To decide such point, fact of each case is required to be taken
           into consideration. Facts of Dhanraj (supra) are:- Appellant
           (owner of jeep) along with certain other persons were travelling
           in his own Jeep and said Jeep met with an accident. In the
           accident, the Appellant as well as other passengers received
           injuries. In the claims petitions, Tribunal held the Driver of
           the Jeep responsible for the accident. In all the Claim
           Petitions filed by the other passengers, Tribunal directed that
           the Appellant (as the owner) as well as the Driver and Insurance
           Company were liable to pay compensation. In the Claim Petition
           filed by the appellant-owner of the jeep, the Tribunal directed
           the Driver and the Insurance Company to pay compensation to the
           appellant. Insurance Company filed an Appeal before the Hon'ble
           Madhya Pradesh High Court. That Appeal was allowed and held that
           as the appellant was the owner of the jeep and, therefore, the
           Insurance Company is not liable to pay him any compensation.
           Against the said order of Hon'ble Madhya Pradesh High Court,
           appeal was preferred by appellant-owner. In the said appeal,
           after incorporating Section 147 of the Act, Hon'ble Apex Court
           has held that comprehensive policy covers the liability incurred
           by the insured in respect of death of or bodily injury to any
           person (including an owner of the goods or his authorized
           representative) carried in the vehicle or damage to any property
           of a third party caused by or arising out of the use of the
           vehicle. Section 147 does not require an Insurance Company to
           assume risk for death or bodily injury to the owner of the
           vehicle.


        1. Relying upon Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Sunita Rathi and
           Ors. 1998 ACJ 121, it is further held in para No.9 that the
           liability of an Insurance Company is only for the purpose of
           indemnifying the insured against liabilities incurred towards
           third person or in respect of damages to property.


        1. Thus, where the insured i.e. an owner of the vehicle has no
           liability to a third party the Insurance Company has no
           liability also.


        1. From the ratio laid down by Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of
           Dhanraj (supra), it becomes amply clear that comprehensive
           policy covers the liability incurred by the insured in respect
           of death of or bodily injury to any person (including an owner
           of the goods or his authorized representative) carried in the
           vehicle or damage to any property of a third party caused by or
           arising out of the use of the vehicle. Section 147 does not
           require an Insurance Company to assume risk for death or bodily
           injury to the owner of the vehicle.


19. What is the meaning of “Public Place”, as defined u/s 2(34) of the Act:-



        1. Definition of 'Public Place', reads as under:-


"2(34) "Public place" means, a road, street, way or other place, whether a
thoroughfare or not, to which the public have a right of access, and
includes any place or stand at which passengers are picked up or set down
by a stage carriage."


        1. The definition of 'public place' under the M. V. Act is,
           therefore, wide enough to include any place which members of
           public use and to which they have a right of access. The right
           of access may be permissive, limited, restricted or regulated by
           oral or written permission, by tickets, passes or badges or on
           payment of fee. The use may be restricted generally or to
           particular purpose or purposes. What is necessary is that the
           place must be accessible to the members of public and be
           available for their use, enjoyment, avocation or other purpose.


        1. Vary question came up for consideration before the Full Bench of
           Bombay High Court in Pandurang Chimaji Agale and another v. New
           India Life Insurance Co. Ltd., Pune and others, AIR 1988 Bom
           248, wherein the Hon'ble Court after taking note of the
           divergent views of different High Courts with regard to the
           meaning and import of the term 'public place', as defined under
           Section 2(24) of the 1939 Act (corresponding to Section 2(34) of
           the M. V. Act), proceeded to hold that for the purpose of
           Chapter VIII of the said Act, the expression 'public place' will
           cover all places including those of private ownership where
           members of the public have an access whether free or controlled
           in any manner whatsoever.


        1. Relying on the Full Bench decision of the Bombay High Court
           (cited supra), a Full Bench of Madras High Court in the case of
           United India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Parvathi Devi and others,
           1999 ACJ 1520 (Madras) has held as follows:-


"16. The definition of 'public place' is very wide. A perusal of the same
reveals that the public at large has a right to access though that right is
regulated or restricted. It is also seen that this Act is beneficial
legislation, so also the law of interpretation has to be construed in the
benefit of public. In the overall legal position and the fact that if the
language is simple and unambiguous, it has to be construed in the benefit
of the public, we are of the view that the word 'public place' wherever
used as a right or controlled in any manner whatsoever, would attract
section 2(24) of the Act. In view of this, as stated, the private place
used with permission or without permission would amount to be a 'public
place'”.


        1. Division Bench decision of the Kerala High Court in the case of
           Rajan v. John, 2009 (2) TAC 260 (Ker) : (AIR 2009 Ker 136), the
           Hon'ble Court while considering the definition of 'public place'
           for the purpose of Section 2(34) of the Act, proceeded to hold
           that the term 'public place' cannot be given a restricted
           meaning in- as much as, it is not to be taken as a place where
           public have uncontrolled access at all times. 'Public place' for
           the purpose of the Act has to be understood with reference to
           the places to which a vehicle has access. Accordingly, the
           Hon'ble Court proceeded to hold that the private premises of a
           house where goods vehicle is allowed entry, is a 'public place'
           for the purpose of Section 2(34) of the Act and therefore the
           insurer is liable to pay the compensatioon.


        1. From the above referred ratios, it becomes clear that in any
           private premises, where goods vehicle is allowed entry, is a
           'public place' for the purpose of Section 2(34) of the Act.


20. What if, the vehicle which met with an accident was sold of by its
registered owner before the date of accident and name of the transferee
owner (purchaser) is not entered into the R.C. Book:-


        1. Hon'ble Madhya Pradesh High Court and Hon'ble Kerala High Court,
           in the cases reported in 2011 ACJ 577 & 1997 ACJ 260,
           respectively, it has been held that when registered owner denies
           his liability to pay amount of compensation on the ground that
           he had sold the vehicle in question and received the
           consideration thereof and handed over the possession of the
           vehicle along with R.C. Book and relevant transfer Forms for
           getting the vehicle transferred in the name of transferee much
           prior to the accident, then in that circumstances transferee
           owner cannot be allowed to evade his liability to pay amount of
           compensation on the ground that he is not registered owner.


        1. But Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Pushpa alias Leela v/s.
           Shakuntala, reported in 2011 ACJ 705(SC) = AIR 2011 SC 682 in
           the above referred judgment Hon'bel Apex Court, in paragraphs
           Nos.12 to 16 has held as under:-


“12. The question of the liability of the recorded owner of a vehicle after
its sale to another person was considered by this Court in Dr. T.V. Jose v.
Chacko P.M., (2001) 8 SCC 748 : (AIR 2001 SC 3939). In paragraphs 9 and 10
of the decision, the Court observed and held as follows:


"9. Mr. Iyer appearing for the Appellant submitted that the High Court was
wrong in ignoring the oral evidence on record. He submitted that the oral
evidence clearly showed that the Appellant was not the owner of the car on
the date of the accident. Mr. Iyer submitted that merely because the name
had not been changed in the records of R.T.O. did not mean that the
ownership of the vehicle had not been transferred. Mr. Iyer submitted that
the real owner of the car was Mr. Roy Thomas. Mr. Iyer submitted that Mr.
Roy Thomas had been made party-Respondent No.9 to these Appeals. He pointed
out that an Advocate had filed appearance on behalf of Mr. Roy Thomas but
had then applied for and was permitted to withdraw the appearance. He
pointed out that Mr. Roy Thomas had been duly served and a public notice
had also been issued. He pointed out that Mr. Roy Thomas had chosen not to
appear in these Appeals. He submitted that the liability, if any, was of
Mr. Roy Thomas.


10. We agree with Mr. Iyer that the High Court was not right in holding
that the Appellant continued to be the owner as the name had not been
changed in the records of R.T.O. There can be transfer of title by payment
of consideration and delivery of the car. The evidence on record shows that
ownership of the car had been transferred. However the Appellant still
continued to remain liable to third parties as his name continued in the
records of R.T.O. as. the owner. The Appellant could not escape that
liability by merely joining Mr. Roy Thomas in these Appeals. Mr. Roy Thomas
was not a party either before MACT or the High Court. In these Appeals we
cannot and will not go into the question of inter se liability between the
Appellant and Mr. Roy Thomas. It will be for the Appellant to adopt
appropriate proceedings against Mr. Roy Thomas if, in law, he is entitled
to do so."


(Emphasis added)


13. Again, in P.P. Mohammed v. K. Rajappan and Ors., (2008) 17 SCC 624,
this Court examined the same issue under somewhat similar set of facts as
in the present case. In paragraph 4 of the decision, this Court observed
and held as follows:


"4. These appeals are filed by the appellants. The Insurance Company has
chosen not to file any appeal. The question before this Court is whether by
reason of the fact that the vehicle has been transferred to Respondent 4
and thereafter to Respondent 5, the appellant got absolved from liability
to the third person who was injured. This question has been answered by
this Court in T.V. Jose (Dr.) v. Chacko P.M. (reported in 2001 (8) SCC 748)
wherein it is held that even though in law there would be a transfer of
ownership of the vehicle, that, by itself, would not absolve the party, in
whose name the vehicle stands in RTO records, from liability to a third
person. We are in agreement with the view expressed therein. Merely because
the vehicle was transferred does not mean that the appellant stands
absolved of his liability to a third person. So long as his name continues
in RTO records, he remains liable to a third person."


(Emphasis added)


14. The decision in Dr. T.V. Jose was rendered under the Motor Vehicles
Act, 1939. But having regard to the provisions of section 2(30) and section
50 of the Act, as noted above, the ratio of the decision shall apply with
equal force to the facts of the case arising under the 1988 Act.On the
basis of these decisions, the inescapable conclusion is that Jitender
Gupta, whose name continued in the records of the registering authority as
the owner of the truck was equally liable for payment of the compensation
amount. Further, since an insurance policy in respect of the truck was
taken out in his name he was indemnified and the claim will be shifted to
the insurer, Oriental Insurance Company Ltd.


15. Learned counsel for the Insurance Company submitted that even though
the registered owner of the vehicle was Jitender Gupta, after the sale of
the truck he had no control over it and the possession and control of the
truck were in the hands of the transferee, Salig Ram. No liability can,
therefore, be fastened on Jitender Gupta, the transferor of the truck. In
support of this submission he relied upon a decision of this Court in
National Insurance Company Ltd. v. Deepa Devi and Ors., (2008) 1 SCC 414 :
(AIR 2008 SC 735). The facts of the case in Deepa Devi are entirely
different. In that case the vehicle was requisitioned by the District
Magistrate in exercise of the powers conferred upon him under the
Representation of the People Act, 1951. In that circumstance, this Court
observed that the owner of the vehicle cannot refuse to abide by the order
of requisition of the vehicle by the Deputy Commissioner. While the vehicle
remained under requisition, the owner did not exercise any control over it:
the driver might still be the employee of the owner of the vehicle but he
had to drive the vehicle according to the direction of the officer of the
State, in whose charge the vehicle was given. Save and except the legal
ownership, the registered owner of the vehicle had lost all control over
the vehicle. The decision in Deepa Devi was rendered on the special facts
of that case and it has no application to the facts of the case in hand.


16. In light of the discussion made above it is held that the compensation
amount is equally realisable from respondent No. 3, Oriental Insurance
Company Ltd. and it is directed to make full payment of the compensation
amount as determined by the Claims Tribunal to the appellants within two
months from the date of this judgment”.


        1. From the above referred ratio of Hon'ble Apex Court, it can be
           held that, as on the date of accident, transferor owner was the
           registered owner of offending vehicle, he must be deemed to
           continue as owner of the offending vehicle for the purpose of
           the Motor Vehicles Act, even though under the Civil Law, he
           ceased to be its owner after its sale and Transferor Owner and
           Transferee Owner (both) are equally liable to pay the amount of
           compensation in favour of the claimant.


21. Whether a claim petition can be dismissed for want of prosecution or
non-appearance of the claimant and/or his Advocate:-


        1. Hon'ble Gujarat High Court in the case of Bharatbhai Narsingbhai
           Chaudhry v/s Malek Rafik Malek Himantbhai Malek, reported in
           2012 ACJ 1262 = AIR 2011 Gujarat 150 has held in Para No.5.14
           and 6.1 that Claims Tribunals are not empowered to dismiss claim
           application for default of claimant after framing of issues. It
           is further held that Tribunals are required to decide claim
           petitions on merits with a view to provide substantial justice
           to the victim of accident, keeping in mind the object of
           benevolent legislation, instead of entering into niceties and
           technicalities.


        1. However, Full Benches of Hon'ble Kerala High Court in the case
           of Jacob Thomas v. C. Pandian, reported in AIR 2006 Kerala 77
           and Jammu & Kashmir High Court in the case of Mohammad Yousuf
           Wani v/s Abdul Rehman Gujri, reported in AIR 1982 Kerala 146
           have taken a view that when O. 9 of CPC is specifically made
           applicable to proceedings before claims Tribunal, it cannot be
           said that Tribunal has no power to dismiss application for
           default when the case is posted for hearing if claimant is
           absent and respondents are present. But, S. 168 did not insist
           that in all cases award should be passed but only directed that
           Tribunal "may make an award", once it makes a judgement or
           award, mandates of Rules framed under the Act has to be complied
           with.


22. Whether a claim petition can be dismissed for non production of
documents mentioned under Rule 211 of the Gujarat Motor Vehicles
Rules,1989:-


        1. There is no judgment on this point but Rule 211, sub-rule 5
           provides that:- with all claim petition, preferred u/s 166 of
           the Act, FIR, Injury Certificate or Postmortem Report and
           details of owner and insurance policy of offending vehicle,
           supplied either by police or regional transport authority should
           be furnished.


              1. Above referred provisions are mandatory provision and
                 deviation therefrom, would lead to dismissal of the claim
                 petition. However, it is to be noted that along with claim
                 petition, original documents are not required to be
                 furnished and only photo copy of such documents will do.
                 Original documents may be produced when the stage of
                 evidence comes.


23. How to decide a claim petition, where insurer has taken a defence of
violation of 'Permit':-


        1. In some claim petitions, insurer takes defence of violation
           and/or breach of 'Permit'. To understand legal position, some
           examples with the case law are required to be taken into
           consideration. Some examples and findings of the Hon'ble High
           Courts are as under:-


              1. Insurer seeks to avoid its liability on the ground that
                 offending vehicle was being plied without valid permit. It
                 has come on record that insurer had insured the said
                 vehicle without there being valid permit. Therefore, it is
                 held that it is the duty of Insurer to verify the fact that
                 permit of vehicle was valid or not at the time of insuring
                 the vehicle and, as insurer having insured the vehicle
                 without valid permit, it cannot seek exemption from
                 liability. This has been held by Hon'ble Uttarakhand High
                 Court in the case of U.I.I.Com. v/s Prakashi Devi, reported
                 in 2011 ACJ 1683.


              1. Insurer seeks to avoid its liability on the ground that
                 owner of ‘Taxi’, which hit the pedestrians had violated
                 terms of policy, as ‘Taxi’ could not have been used in a
                 public place after expiry of permit. It has come on record
                 that policy was valid. Even it was not the case of Insurer
                 that passengers were being carried for hire and reward and
                 policy did not cover the case of Third Party. It was
                 therefore, held that victim did not suffer injuries while
                 travelling in the ‘Taxi’ for hire or reward and mere expiry
                 of permit would not absolve Insurer to pay compensation, as
                 no provision of the Act is shown by Insurer to point out
                 that owner of ‘Taxi’ was under legal obligation, not to ply
                 ‘Taxi’ after the expiry of permit. This has been held by
                 Hon'ble Kerala High Court in the case of Sethunath v/s John
                 Varghese, reported in 2011 ACJ 2242.


              1. Truck was loaded with coal and carrying 12 passengers,
                 capsized. Truck was insured covering driver, cleaner and 6
                 coolies. Insurer contended that truck was over loaded as it
                 was carrying more that 8 persons and further contended that
                 there is breach of policy. It is held that Insurer has
                 failed to show that carrying more number of coolies would
                 be treated as breach of policy and, it has been further
                 held that if at all there is any breach of policy, it is
                 not so fundamental as to put end to the contract totally.
                 Finally Insurer was directed to satisfy the highest six
                 awards of coolies. This has been held by Hon'ble Bombay
                 High Court in the case of Sanjay v/s Sukhiyabai, reported
                 in 2012 ACJ 287.


              1. Truck hit a person standing on roadside and he sustained
                 grievous injuries. Tribunal found that Truck was being
                 plied without valid permit and owner of the Truck has
                 committed breach of the terms and condition of policy.
                 After holding this, Tribunal directed insurer to pay
                 compensation and then recover from the owner. This award of
                 Tribunal was challenged before the Hon'ble High Court.
                 Hon'ble High Court, after relying upon the several
                 Judgments of Hon'ble Apex Court, has held that award of
                 Tribunal is just and proper and directions of Tribunal
                 against insurer to 'pay and rocover' is just and proper.
                 This has been held by Hon'ble Allahabad High Court (DB) in
                 the case of N.I. Com. v/s Radhey Shyam, reported in 2013
                 ACJ 788.


              1. Mini bus being plied on the route for which it had no
                 permit. It is also found that in the said bus 13 passengers
                 travelling against the permit of 12 passengers. Held that
                 there is violation of insurance policy and Insurer held not
                 responsible but order of 'pay and recover' is passed. This
                 has been held by Hon'ble Himachal Pradesh High Court in the
                 case of N.I. Com. v/s Balbir Singh, reported in 2013 ACJ
                 1008.


        1. From the above referred ratios, it becomes clear that it is for
           the insurer to verify before insuring the vehicle, as to whether
           vehicle is having valid permit or not and, if insurer having
           insured the vehicle without valid permit, it cannot seek
           exemption from liability afterwards.


        1. If it is found that owner has violated terms of the policy,
           Tribunal can pass an order exonerating insurer but may also pass
           and order of 'pay and recover'.


24.Whether an award passed by the Tribunal can be reviewed:-


        1. Many time claimant or opponent/s including insurer prefer/s an
           application for review of award passed by the Tribunal on the
           ground that the award on a question on which the judgment of the
           Tribunal is based has been reversed or modified by the
           subsequent decision of Superior Court. To deal with such kind of
           application, reference may be made to Explanation of Order XLVII
           (47) Rule – 1 of C.P.C., 1908, which reads as under:-


Explanation of Order XLVII (47) Rule – 1 of C.P.C.:-


“The fact that the decision on a question of law on which the judgment of
the Court is based has been reversed or modified by the subsequent decision
of a superior Court in any other case, shall not be a ground for the review
of such judgment”.


              1. From the above referred provision, it becomes clear that
                 when an application for review of award, passed by the
                 Tribunal is moved on the ground that the award on a
                 question on which the judgment of the Tribunal is based has
                 been reversed or modified by the subsequent decision of
                 Superior Court, such application can not be entertained.


        1. Various High Courts have taken a view that Tribunal does not
           have powers to modify, alter, recall and revers it's earlier
           award. And if such an order is passed in review
           petition/application, it is nullity, non est and void. Relying
           upon the several decisions, Hon'ble Allahabad High Court in the
           case of N.I.Com. v.s Rajbir Sing, reported in 2012 AAC 3007 that
           tribunal does not have powers to review.


        1. Reference may also be made to the ratio laid down by Hon'ble
           Apex Court in the case of CTO v/s Makkad Plastic Agencies,
           reported in AIR 2011 SCW 2154, wherein it is observed in para
           No.17 as under:-


“… It is also now an established proposition of law that review is a
creature of the statute and such an order of review could be passed only
when an express power of review is provided in the statute. In the absence
of any statutory provision for review, exercise of power of review under
the garb of clarification/modification/correction is not permissible...”.


        1. Bare reading of above referred observations of Hon'ble Apex
           Court reveals the fact that review is a creature of the statute
           and such an order of review could be passed only when an express
           power of review is provided in the statute. As, there is no
           provision for review in the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, award of
           the tribunal is not review-able.


        1. On the above referred issue, reference may also be made to
           ratios laid down by Hon'ble Clacutta High Court in the case
           reported in 2008 ACJ 1248 (DB) and N.I.Com. v/s Chhabirani,
           reported in 2013 ACJ 1130 and ratio laid down by Hon'ble Gauhati
           High Court in the case reported in 2008 ACJ 1248 (DB) and
           N.I.Com. v/s Nani Gopal Debnath, reported in 2012 ACJ 2720.

hire and reward and policy did not cover the case of TP- victim did not
suffer injuries while travelling in the ‘taxi’ for hire or reward-mere
expiry of permit would not absolve IC to pay compensation, as no provision
of MV Act is shown by IC to point out that owner of ‘taxi’ was under legal
obligation, not to ply ‘taxi’ after the expiry of permit

2009 (3) GLH 377 (SC) - N.I. Com v/s Parvathneni


75- New India Assurance Company Limited vs. Sadanand Mukhi and Others
reported in (2009) 2 SCC 417, wherein, the son of the owner was driving the
vehicle, who died in the accident, was not regarded as third party. In the
said case the court held that neither Section 163-A nor Section 166 would
be applicable.


76- The deceased was traveling on Motor Cycle, which he borrowed from its
real owner for going from Ilkal to his native place Gudur. When the said
motor cycle was proceeding on Ilkal-Kustagl, National Highway, a bullock
cart proceeding ahead of the said motor cycle carrying iron-sheet,which
suddenly stopped and consequently deceased who was proceeding on the said
motor cycle dashed bullock cart. Consequent to the aforesaid incident, he
sustained fatal injuries over his vital part of body and on the way to
Govt. Hospital, Ilkal, he died.


It was forcefully argued by the counsel appearing for the respondent that
the claimants are not the `third party', and therefore, they are not
entitled to claim any benefit under Section 163-A of the MVA. In support of
the said contention, the counsel relied on the decision of this Court in
the case of Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Rajni Devi, (2008) 5 SCC 736;
and New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. Sadanand Mukhi and Ors., (2009) 2 SCC
417.


In the case of Oriental Insurance Company Ltd. v. Rajni Devi and Others,
(2008) 5 SCC 736, wherein, it has been categorically held that in a case
where third party is involved, the liability of the insurance company would
be unlimited. It was also held in the said decision that where, however,
compensation is claimed for the death of the owner or another passenger of
the vehicle, the contract of insurance being governed by the contract qua
IP, the claim of the claimant against the insurance company would depend
upon the terms thereof. It was held in the said decision that Section 163-A
of the MVA cannot be said to have any application in respect of an accident
wherein the owner of the motor vehicle himself is involved. The decision
further held that the question is no longer res integra. The liability
under section 163-A of the MVA is on the owner of the vehicle. So a person
cannot be both, a claimant as also a recipient, with respect to claim.
Therefore, the heirs of the deceased could not have maintained a claim in
terms of Section 163-A of the MVA. Apex Court held - “the ratio of the
aforesaid decision is clearly applicable to the facts of the present case.
In the present case, the deceased was not the owner of the motorbike in
question. He borrowed the said motorbike from its real owner. The deceased
cannot be held to be employee of the owner of the motorbike although he was
authorised to drive the said vehicle by its owner, and therefore, he would
step into the shoes of the owner of the motorbike.”


2009 (13) SCC 710 – Ningmma v/s United India


77- One of the grounds which is available to the Insurance Company for
denying its statutory liability is that the policy is void having been
obtained by reason of non-disclosure of a material fact or by a
representation of fact which was false in some material particular - once a
valid contract is entered into, only because of a mistake, the name of
original owner not been mentioned in the certificates of registration, it
cannot be said that the contract itself is void - unless it was shown that
in obtaining the said contract, a fraud has been practiced - no particulars
of fraud pleaded- IC held liable


2009 (1) SCC 58


78-Insured tendered cheque to Insurer on 23/1/1995, towards premium - Cover
note was issued by the insurer - On 27/1/1995 accident took place & third
party, suffered severe injuries - The cheque given for insurance,
dishonored - After the date of accident Insurance Policy was cancelled -
However, on 30/1/1995, insured paid cash to insurer - Insurer contended
that a contract of insurance would be valid only when cheque paid for
premium is honoured - On the dishonor of the cheque the contract being
without consideration, need not be performed - Held, cover-note was issued
and cover-note would come within the purview of definition of "Certificate
of Insurance" and also an "insurance policy" - It remains valid till it is
cancelled.

79- Motor accident - insurance claim - deceased was travelling as a pillion
rider - fell down from the scooter and succumbed to the injuries - claim
repudiated by insurance company on ground that deceased being a gratuitous
passenger and insurance policy did not cover risk of injury or death of
such passenger - whether pillion rider on a scooter would be a third party
within the meaning of S. 147 of the Act - held, liability of the insurance
company in a case of this nature is not extended to a pillion rider of the
motor vehicle unless the requisite amount of premium is paid for covering
his/her risk (ii) the legal obligation arising u/s. 147 of the Act cannot
be extended to an injury or death of the owner of vehicle or the pillion
rider (iii) the pillion rider in a two wheeler was not to be treated as a
third party when the accident has taken place owing to rash and negligent
riding of the scooter and not on the part of the driver of another vehicle


2008(7) SCC 428


80- Respondent No.2 was the owner of a Mini Bus. An insurance policy in
respect of the said vehicle was sought to be taken by him. For the said
purpose, the second respondent issued a third party cheque towards payment
of insurance premium. The Development Officer of the appellant by
inadvertence issued a cover note. However, when the said mistake came to
his notice, the respondent No.2 was contacted by the Development Officer.
He was asked to pay the amount of premium. It was not tendered and in stead
the respondent No.2 is said to have returned the original cover note and
took back the cheque. The original cover note as also all the duplicate
copies thereof was cancelled. The said insurance cover was issued for the
period 3.9.1991 to 2.9.1992. On or about 12.9.1991, the said vehicle met
with an accident. First respondent who suffered an injury therein filed a
claim petition in terms of the provisions contained in Sec. 166-effect -
liability of insurer when vehicle met with accident within the period under
cover note - held, no premium could be said to have been paid - no privity
of contract between insurer and insured - Supreme Court in jurisdiction
under Art. 142 of Constitution, directed insurer to recover the paid
compensation from insured-owner - appeal allowed.


2008(7) SCC 526


81- S. 163A - liability under - liability u/s. 163A is on the owner of the
vehicle as a person cannot be both, a claimant as also a recipient - for
the said purpose only the terms of the contract of insurance could be taken
recourse to - liability of insurance company was confined to Rs. 1,00,000 -
appeal partly allowed.


2008(5) SCC 736 Rajni Devi


82-Whether a person who hired a goods carriage vehicle would come within
purview of Sub-sec. 1 of S. 147 of the Act although no goods of his as such
were carried in the vehicle - claimant-respondent hired an auto rickshaw
which was goods carriage vehicle and he was sitting by the side of the
driver - held, if a person has been traveling in a capacity other than the
owner of goods, the insurer would not be liable - it is well settled that
term 'any person' envisaged under the said provision shall not include any
gratuitous passenger - in a three wheeler goods carriage, driver could not
have allowed anybody else to share his seat - Tribunal and High Court
should have held that owner of vehicle is guilty of breach of conditions of
policy

petition filed by respondent, a labourer, slipped down from trolley of
tractor, allegedly was being driven rashly and negligently by its driver,
came under the wheels thereof injuring his gallbladder and left thigh, as a
result where of he suffered grievous injuries – tractor was supposed to be
used for agricultural purpose - held, no insurance cover in respect of
trolley - tractor was insured only for agricultural work, excluding digging
of earth and brick-kiln purpose - thus, claim, not maintainable as
respondent was mere a gratuitous passenger, not covered under S. 147 -
however, considering empowrish condition and disability, insurer directed
to satisfy the award with right to realize same from owner of tractor -
appeal allowed.


2007 (7) SCC 56


85- Following principles/guideline laid down by Full Bench of SC in Para
no. 108 in the case of N.I. Com. v/s Swaran Singh, reported in 2004 (1) JT
109 = 2004 (1) GLH 691 (SC)- (also see Point No- 103)


(i) Chapter XI of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 providing compulsory
insurance of vehicles against third-party risks is a social welfare
legislation to extend relief by compensation to victims of accidents caused
by use of motor vehicles. The provisions of compulsory insurance coverage
of all vehicles are with this paramount object and the provisions of the
Act have to be so interpreted as to effectuate the said object.


(ii) An insurer is entitled to raise a defence in a claim petition filed
u/s. 163A or Sec. 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 , inter alia, in
terms of Sec. 149(2)(a)(ii) of the said Act.


(iii) The breach of policy condition e.g. disqualification of the driver or
invalid driving licence of the driver, as contained in sub-sec. (2)(a)(ii)
of Sec. 149, has to be proved to have been committed by the insured for
avoiding liability by the insurer. Mere absence, fake or invalid driving
licence or disqualification of the driver for driving at the relevant time,
are not in themselves defences available to the insurer against either the
insured or the third parties. To avoid its liability towards the insured,
the insurer has to prove that the insured was guilty of negligence and
failed to exercise reasonable care in the matter of fulfilling the
condition of the policy regarding use of vehicles by a duly licensed driver
or one who was not disqualified to drive at the relevant time.


(iv) Insurance companies, however, with a view to avoid their liability
must not only establish the available defence(s) raised in the said
proceedings but must also establish "breach" on the part of the owner of
the vehicle; the burden of proof wherefore would be on them.


(v) The court cannot lay down any criteria as to how the said burden would
be discharged, inasmuch as the same would depend upon the facts and
circumstances of each case.


(vi) Even where the insurer is able to prove breach on the part of the
insured concerning the policy condition regarding holding of a valid
licence by the driver or his qualification to drive during the relevant
period, the insurer would not be allowed to avoid its liability towards the
insured unless the said breach or breaches on the condition of driving
licence is/are so fundamental as are found to have contributed to the cause
of the accident. The Tribunals in interpreting the policy conditions would
apply "the rule of main purpose" and the concept of "fundamental breach" to
allow defences available to the insurer u/s. 149(2) of the Act.


(vii) The question, as to whether the owner has taken reasonable care to
find out as to whether the driving licence produced by the driver (a fake
one or otherwise), does not fulfill the requirements of law or not will
have to be determined in each case.


(viii) If a vehicle at the time of accident was driven by a person having a
learner's licence, the insurance companies would be liable to satisfy the
decree.


(ix) The Claims Tribunal constituted u/s. 165 read with Sec. 168 is
empowered to adjudicate all claims in respect of the accidents involving
death or of bodily injury or damage to property of third party arising in
use of motor vehicle. The said power of the Tribunal is not restricted to
decide the claims inter se between claimant or claimants on one side and
insured, insurer and driver on the other (this view is followed in the case
of KUSUM- see point no- 101). In the course of adjudicating the claim for
compensation and to decide the availability of defence or defences to the
insurer, the Tribunal has necessarily the power and jurisdiction to decide
disputes inter se between the insurer and the insured. The decision
rendered on the claims and disputes inter se between the insurer and
insured in the course of adjudication of claim for compensation by the
claimants and the award made thereon is enforceable and executable in the
same manner as provided in Sec. 174 of the Act for enforcement and
execution of the award in favour of the claimants.


(x) Where on adjudication of the claim under the Act the Tribunal arrives
at a conclusion that the insurer has satisfactorily proved its defence in
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 149(2) read with sub-sec. (7), as
interpreted by this Court above, the Tribunal can direct that the insurer
is liable to be reimbursed by the insured for the compensation and other
amounts which it has been compelled to pay to the third party under the
award of the Tribunal. Such determination of claim by the Tribunal will be
enforceable and the money found due to the insurer from the insured will be
recoverable on a certificate issued by the Tribunal to the Collector in the
same manner u/s. 174 of the Act as arrears of land revenue. The certificate
will be issued for the recovery as arrears of land revenue only if, as
required by sub-sec. (3) of Sec. 168 of the Act the insured fails to
deposit the amount awarded in favour of the insurer within thirty days from
the date of announcement of the award by the Tribunal.


(xi) The provisions contained in sub-sec. (4) with the proviso thereunder
and sub-sec. (5) which are intended to cover specified contingencies
mentioned therein to enable the insurer to recover the amount paid under
the contract of insurance on behalf of the insured can be taken recourse to
by the Tribunal and be extended to claims and defences of the insurer
against the insured by relegating them to the remedy before regular Court
in cases where on given facts and circumstances adjudication of their
claims inter se might delay the adjudication of the claims of the victims".



86- The effect of fake license has to be considered in the light of what
has been stated by the Hon’ Supreme Court in New India Assurance Co.,
Shimla V/s. Kamla and Ors., 2001 4 JT 235. Once the license is a fake one
the renewal cannot take away the effect of fake license. It was observed in
Kamla's case (supra) as follows:


"12. As a point of law we have no manner of doubt that a fake licence
cannot get its forgery outfit stripped off merely on account of some
officer renewing the same with or without knowing it to be forged. Section
15 of the Act only empowers any Licensing Authority to "renew a driving
licence issued under the provisions of this Act with effect from the date
of its expiry". No Licensing Authority has the power to renew a fake
licence and, therefore, a renewal if at all made cannot transform a fake
licence as genuine. Any counterfeit document showing that it contains a
purported order of a statutory authority would ever remain counterfeit
albeit the fact that other persons including some statutory authorities
would have acted on the document unwittingly on the assumption that it is
genuine".


87-S. 147, 166 - motor accident - owner himself involved in accident,
resulting in his death - he himself was negligent - accident did not
involve any other motor vehicle - liability of Insurance Company - claim
petition under S. 166 - maintainability of - held, liability of insurer-
company is to the extent of indemnification of insured against injured
persons, a third person or in respect of damages of property - if insured
cannot be fastened with any liability, question not arise - additional
premium under the insurance policy was not paid in respect of entire risk
of death or bodily injury of owner of vehicle - present case did not fall
under S. 147(b) as it covers a risk of a third party only -2007(9) SCC 263
– Jumma Shaha


88-Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 - S. 147, 157, 217 - motor accident - liability
of the Insurance Company towards third party - two wheeler of respondent
no. 5 was insured with the appellant company - however, an endorsement
regarding pillion rider was not included in the Insurance Contract - two
wheeler was sold to respondent no. 1 during the period of availability of
insurance cover - sale was not intimated to the Insurance Company - as a
result of an accident, the pillion rider died - compensation awarded by
Tribunal - held, the Act of 1988 is applicable to the case as the accident
took place after the commencement of the Act, 1988 - the statutory
insurance policy did not cover the risk of death of or bodily injury to
gratuitous passenger - therefore, the Insurance Company is not liable to
pay compensation for the death of the pillion rider - further, failure to
intimation for the transfer of the vehicle would not effect third parties
claim for compensation

decided - applicability of Workmen's Compensation Act - accident of truck -
driver died on the spot - heirs of deceased contended that truck was 15
years old and was not in good condition and was not well maintained - claim
for compensation - truck owner denied his fault on the ground that driver
was drunk at the time of the accident - Tribunal dismissed claim petition
holding fault of driver for the accident - claimants preferred appeal
before High Court - High Court observed that accident took place because
the arm bolt of the truck broke and not due to the fault of driver -
awarded Rs. 2,10,000/- with 10% interest as a compensation and directed
appellant to satisfy whole award - appellant company defended itself on the
ground that as per S. 147 and 149 of the Motor Vehicles Act is concerned,
liability of the insurer is restricted up to the limit provided by W.C. Act
- insurer-appellant preferred this leave petition - whether appellant
insurance company is liable to pay the entire compensation to claimant or
its liability is restricted to the limit prescribed in W.C. Act – held -yes-
 further held that the insurance policy was for 'Act Liability' and so the
liability of appellant would not be unlimited but would be limited as per
W.C. Act - appellant directed to pay claim amount up to the extent
prescribed in W.C. Act and owner of truck is directed to pay remaining
claim amount

whether comprehensive policy would cover risk of injury to owner of vehicle
also - Tribunal directed driver and insurance company to pay compensation
to appellant-owner of vehicle - appellant challenged order whereby it was
held that as appellant was owner of vehicle insurance company is not liable
to pay him any compensation - insurance policy covers liability incurred by
insured in respect of death of or bodily injury to any person carried in
vehicle or damage to any property of third party - whether premium paid
under heading 'Own damage' is for covering liability towards personal
injury - held, S. 147 does not require insurance company to assume risk for
death or bodily injury to owner of vehicle - where owner of vehicle has no
liability to third party, insurance company also has no liability also - it
has not been shown that policy covered any risk for injury to owner himself
- premium paid under heading 'Own damage' does not cover liability towards
personal injury - premium is towards damage to vehicle and not for injury
to person of owner - appeal dismissed.

to appellant-owner of vehicle - appellant challenged order whereby it was
held that as appellant was owner of vehicle insurance company is not liable
to pay him any compensation - insurance policy covers liability incurred by
insured in respect of death of or bodily injury to any person carried in
vehicle or damage to any property of third party - whether premium paid
under heading 'Own damage' is for covering liability towards personal
injury - held, S. 147 does not require insurance company to assume risk for
death or bodily injury to owner of vehicle - where owner of vehicle has no
liability to third party insurance company has no liability also - it has
not been shown that policy covered any risk for injury to owner himself -
premium paid under heading 'Own damage' does not cover liability towards
personal injury - premium is towards damage to vehicle and not for injury

application for grant of compensation against the widow of the deceased and
the appellant-Insurance Company - Workmen's Compensation Commissioner
directed payment of compensation to widow of truck driver - High Court

available to the Insurance Company for denying its statutory liability is
that the policy is void having been obtained by reason of non-disclosure of
a material fact or by a representation of fact which was false in some
material particular - once a valid contract is entered into, only because
of a mistake, the name of original owner not been mentioned in the
certificates of registration, it cannot be said that the contract itself is
void - unless it was shown that in obtaining the said contract, a fraud has

due to rash and negligent driving of the scooter by driver and granted Rs.
3,01,500 as compensation with interest at 9% per annum in favour of the

appellant-insurance company - whether insurance company could be held
liable to pay the amount of compensation for the default of the scooterist
who was not holding licence for driving two wheeler scooter but had driving
licence of different class of vehicle in terms of S. 10 of the Act - held,
where the insurers relying upon the provisions of violation of law by the
assured, take an exception to pay the assured or a third party, they must
prove a willful violation of the law by the assured - provisions of sub-
sec. (4) and (5) of S. 149 of the Act may be considered as to the liability

extent of liability of insurer - motor vehicle accident caused by driver
possessing fake license at relevant time - Tribunal rejecting the insurer's
liability - validity - driver, brother of owner of said vehicle - held,
holding of fake license not by itself absolves insurer of its liability -
but insurer has to prove that owner of vehicle was aware of fact that
license was fake and still permitted driver to drive - on facts, insurer
liability to pay compensation contradicted - thus, balance amount of
claimant and amount already paid by insurer to claimants to be recovered
from owner and driver of vehicle

97- Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 - S. 149(2)(a)(ii) - motor accident -
liability of insurer - in claim petition, Tribunal held that Insurance
Company is liable to pay compensation - licence of driver was not issued by
a competent authority - contention of insurer that by employing a driver
with invalid driving licence owner insured has breached the condition of S.

licence and was driving completely there was no breach of S. 149(2)(a)(ii)
- if the driver produces a driving licence, which on the fact of it looks
genuine, owner is not expected to find out whether the licence has in fact
been issued by a competent authority or not - therefore, insurance company
would not be absolved of its liability - in order to avoid its liability,
insurer has to prove that the insured was guilty of negligence and failed
to exercise reasonable case in the matter of fulfilling the condition of
the policy regarding use of vehicles by a duly licensed driver or one who
was not disqualified to drive at the relevant time

2011 ACJ 2878 (SC), Santaben Vankar 2011 (3) GCD 2101 (GUJ)= 2012 AAC 2528


100- In this case since the person riding the motorcycle at the time of
accident was a minor, the responsibility for paying the compensation
awarded fell on the owner of the motorcycle. In fact, in the case of Ishwar
Chandra V/s. Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. [(2007) 3 AD (SC) 753], it was
held by this Court that in case the driver of the vehicle did not have a
licence at all, the liability to make payment of compensation fell on the
owner since it was his obligation to take adequate care to see that the
driver had an appropriate licence to drive the vehicle. Before the Tribunal
reliance was also placed on the decision in the case of National Insurance
Co. Ltd. V/s. G. Mohd. Vani & Ors. [2004 ACJ 1424] and National Insurance
Co. Ltd. V/s. Candingeddawa & Ors. [2005 ACJ 40], wherein it was held that
if the driver of the offending vehicle did not have a valid driving
licence, then the Insurance Company after paying the compensation amount
would be entitled to recover the same from the owner of the vehicle- Motor
Accident Claims Tribunal quite rightly saddled the liability for payment of
compensation on the Petitioner and, accordingly, directed the Insurance
Company to pay the awarded amount to the awardees and, thereafter, to
recover the same from the Petitioner. The said question has been duly
considered by the Tribunal and was correctly decided. The High Court
rightly chose not to interfere with the same.


2011(6) SCC 425 – Jawahar Singh v/s Bala Jain

compensation of Rs. 2,68,800 awarded - respondent no. 3 and 4 were driver
and owner of bus - respondent no. 3 and 4 were liable to make payment -
direction issued to appellant/IC to deposit amount and that it can recover
the same from respondents – appellant/IC deposited necessary amount -
recovery of amount - Execution Petition(EP) filed by IC- whether civil suit
was required to be filed instead of filing execution petition – held- no
-when such direction to file suit instead of filling EP issued by Tribunal
same is not sustainable- EP is held to be maintainable- whenever order of
‘pay and recover’ is passed by Tribunal, then it must be held to have been
done in exercise of inherent power of Tribunal- Section 168 of the Motor
Vehicles Act, 1988, in terms whereof, it is not only entitled to determine
the amount of claim as put forth by the claimant for recovery thereof from
the insurer, owner or driver of the vehicle jointly or severally but also
the dispute between the insurer on the one hand and the owner or driver of
the vehicle involved in the accident inasmuch as can be resolved by the
Tribunal in such a proceeding-many SC ratios considered.

condition of insurance contract - Absence, fake or invalid driving licence
of driver - Disqualification of driver - Case Law analyzed - Principles
stated - Held that provisions of compulsory insurance against third party
risks is a social welfare legislation to extend relief of compensation to
victims of accidents - Mere absence, fake or invalid driving licence or
disqualification of the driver are not in themselves the defences available
to the insurer - The insurer has to prove negligence and breach of policy
conditions - The burden of proof would be on the insurer - Even when the
insurer proves such breach of policy conditions in above circumstances,
insurer will have to prove that such breach was so fundamental that it was
responsible for cause of accident, otherwise, insurer will be liable - If
the driver has Learner's licence, insurer would be liable.


(B) Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 - u/s. 165, 149(2), 168, 174 - The Tribunal in
interpreting the policy conditions would apply "the rule of main purpose"
and concept of "fundamental breach" to allow the defences available to the
insurer - Further held that powers of Tribunal are not restricted to only
decide claims between claimants and insured or insurer and/or driver, it
has also powers to decide the disputes between insured and insurer and when
such dispute is decided, it would be executable u/S. 174 as it applies to
claimants - No separate proceedings are required - Even when insurer is
held not liable, it will satisfy the award in favour of claimants and can
recover from the insured u/S. 174 of the Act.- 2004(1) GLH 691(SC)- N.I.A.

Muljibhal Ajarambhai Harijan v. United India Insurance Co. Ltd., 1982 (1)

"(i) The Claims Tribunal should, in the case of minors, invariably order
the amount of compensation awarded to the minor invested in long term fixed
deposits at least till the date of the minor attaining majority. The
expenses incurred by the guardian or next friend may however be allowed to
be withdrawn;


(ii) In the case of illiterate claimants also the Claims Tribunal should
follow the procedure set out in (1) above, but if lump sum payment is
required for effecting purchases of any movable or immovable property, such
as, agricultural implements, rickshaw etc., to earn a living, the Tribunal
may consider such a request after making sure that the amount is actually
spent for the purpose and the demand is not a rouge to withdraw money;


(iii) In the case of semi-literate persons the Tribunal should ordinarily
resort to the procedure set out at (i) above unless it is satisfied, for
reasons to be stated in writing, that the whole or part of the amount is
required for expanding and existing business or for purchasing some
property as mentioned in (ii) above for earning his livelihood, in which
case the Tribunal will ensure that the amount is invested for the purpose
for which it is demanded and paid;


(iv) In the case of literate persons also the Tribunal may resort to the
procedure indicated in (1) above, subject to the relaxation set out in (ii)
and (iii) above, if having regard to the age, fiscal background and strata
of society to which the claimant belongs and such other considerations, the
Tribunal in the larger interest of the claimant and with a view to ensuring
the safety of the compensation awarded to him thinks it necessary to do
order;


(v) In the case of widows the Claims Tribunal should invariably follow the
procedure set out in (i) above;


(vi) In personal injury cases if further treatment is necessary the Claims
Tribunal on being satisfied about the same, which shall be recorded in
writing, permit withdrawal of such amount as is necessary for incurring the
expenses for such treatment;


(vii) In all cases in which Investment in long term fixed deposits is made
it should be on condition that the Bank- will not permit any loan or
advance on the fixed deposit and interest on the amount invested is paid
monthly directly to the claimant or his guardian, as the case may be;


(viii) In all cases Tribunal should grant to the claimants liberty to apply
for withdrawal in case of an emergency. To meet with such a contingency, if
the amount awarded is substantial, the Claims Tribunal may invest it in
more than one Fixed Deposit so that if need be one such F.D.R. can be
liquidated."


These guidelines should be borne in mind by the Tribunals in the cases of
compensation in accident cases.
