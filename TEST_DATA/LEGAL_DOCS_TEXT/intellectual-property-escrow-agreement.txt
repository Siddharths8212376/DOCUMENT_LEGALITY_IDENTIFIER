documentation not commercially available  to  Company  on  reasonable  terms

B. Each Exhibit B will be held and maintained separately within  the  escrow
account. An independent record will  be  created  which  will  document  the
activity for each Exhibit B. The processing of all deposit updates shall  be
in accordance with Sections 1.2  and  1.3  above.  All  references  in  this

of Company's request for verification. Depositor shall have the right to  be
present at the verification. A verification determines, in different  levels
of detail, the  accuracy,  completeness,  sufficiency  and  quality  of  the
Deposit Materials as well as to confirm that it compiles  to  the  pertinent
object code of the licensed software. If a  verification  is  elected  after
the Deposit Materials have been delivered to Custodian, then  Custodian,  or
at Company's election, an independent person or company selected by  Company
who is reasonably acceptable to Depositor  will  perform  the  verification.
The Company  shall  be  responsible  for  all  costs  of  the  verification,
including, without limitation, DSI's fees associated with the  verification,
the costs incurred by Depositor relating to  such  verification  (including,

personnel, at Depositor's standard daily rates, as applicable).
