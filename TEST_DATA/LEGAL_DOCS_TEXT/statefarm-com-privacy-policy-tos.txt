We value your privacy. This policy describes how we handle personal
information. You can review our policy the first time we do business with
you and every year you are a State Farm customer.


         o We do not sell customer information.
         o We do not allow those who are doing business on our behalf to
           use our customer information for their own marketing purposes.
         o We contractually require any person or organization providing
           products or services on our behalf to protect State Farm
           customer information.
         o We do not share customer medical information with anyone within
           the State Farm family of companies unless:
               ▪ You expressly authorize it; or
               ▪ It is permitted or required by law; or
               ▪ Your insurance policy contract with us permits us to do
                 so.
         o We afford our prospective and former customers the same
           protections as existing customers with respect to the use of
           personal information.

    • We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to guard
      nonpublic personal information and to comply with federal and state
      laws. In addition, we regularly review our policies and practices,
      monitor our computer networks, and test the strength of our security.


    • Types of information we collect and how we gather it may include:

         o From your applications and other forms related to our products
           and through your conversations with State Farm representatives,
           including our agents
         o When you visit statefarm.com®, our mobile sites and
           applications, our social media sites and applications, and your
           interactions with our online advertisements
         o From your transactions or experiences with us, such as payments,
           underwriting, and claims
         o From within the State Farm family of companies
         o From non-State Farm parties, including consumer reporting
           agencies that provide us with driving records, claim histories,
           and credit information

    • We use customer information, sometimes including consumer report
      information, to:

         o Underwrite and rate your policies and accounts
         o Process your claims
         o Ensure proper billing
         o Service your policies and accounts
         o Enhance your customer experience
         o Offer you other insurance and financial services products that
           may suit your needs

    • We share information about you, including information about our
      transactions (such as payments) and experiences (such as an auto
      claim) with you, within our State Farm family of companies and with
      State Farm agents to help meet your current product and service needs.
      We share information about you with persons or organizations inside or
      outside our family of companies for our everyday business purposes and
      as permitted or required by law. We share information about you with
      companies that perform marketing or other services for us or with whom
      we have joint marketing agreements. These agreements allow us to
      provide a broader selection of insurance and financial products to
      you.


      We share information with consumer reporting agencies and with other
      entities as needed to handle your claim and to protect against fraud
      and unauthorized transactions. For example, we might share name,
      address, and coverage information with an auto body shop to speed up
      repairs on auto damage claims.


    • We share information within our State Farm family of companies so, for
      example, we do not have to ask you for the same information again. If
      you prefer to limit sharing information such as your driving record,
      claim history with other companies, and credit information, call your
      State Farm agent or 1-800-865-6035.

         o If you are an existing customer and have already told us your
           information sharing preferences, no action is needed unless you
           want to change your preference.
         o Your choice will apply to your joint
           policyholders/accountholders on shared policies/accounts.
         o Your choice does not limit State Farm from sharing certain
           information about your transactions with us or your experiences
           with us for everyday business purposes.
         o This sharing option does not apply to our Canadian customers if
           the policy was purchased or the account was set up in Canada.

      Residents of Vermont: State Farm will not share personal information
      across our State Farm family of companies unless authorized by you.
      This does not limit State Farm from sharing certain information about
      your transactions with us (such as your payment history) or your
      experience with us (such as your claim history) as permitted by law.
