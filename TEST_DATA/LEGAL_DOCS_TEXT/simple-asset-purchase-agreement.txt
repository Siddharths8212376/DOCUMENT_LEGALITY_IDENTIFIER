20[___], is by and between [________], a [Delaware]  corporation  ("Seller")
and [________] Inc., a [Delaware] corporation ("Buyer").  Buyer  desires  to
purchase, and Seller wishes to  sell  to  Buyer  the  Purchased  Assets  (as
defined herein), subject to  the  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  below.
Accordingly, Buyer and Seller agree as follows:


                                  Article I
                              Purchase and Sale


Section 1.01  Purchase  and  Sale  of  Assets.  Subject  to  the  terms  and
conditions set forth herein, Seller shall  sell,  assign,  transfer,  convey
and deliver to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase from Seller, all of  Seller's
right,  title  and  interest  in  the  assets  related   to   the   Seller’s
[______________] business (such  business,  the  “Purchased  Business,”  and
such assets, the “Purchased  Assets”),  free  and  clear  of  any  mortgage,
pledge,  lien,  charge,  security  interest,  claim  or  other   encumbrance
("Encumbrance").  The  Purchased  Assets  constitute  all  of   the   assets
necessary  to  conduct  the  Purchased  Business  in  the  manner  currently
conducted  by  Seller.  The  Purchased   Assets   shall   include,   without
limitation, the following relating to the Purchased Business:


      (a) all proprietary software, firmware and hardware together with  any
works in progress, updates, upgrades and improvements;


      (b) all assets, rights, tangible and intangible property  used  in  or
relating to the  Purchased  Business,  including  specifically  but  without
limitation, all patents,  patent  applications,  patents  pending,  and  any
rights related thereto;


      (c) licenses;


      (d) computer equipment, software, data, email addresses  and  accounts
used in the Purchased Business;


      (e) such books and records as are necessary to conduct the business of
the Purchased Business exactly as it is now being conducted;


      (f) internet protocol addresses, trade names, trademarks  and  service
marks, mark registrations and applications, domain name  registrations,  web
sites and related content, images and designs, copyrights, material that  is
subject   to   non-copyright   protections,   trade   secrets,   proprietary
information, know how, technology, technical data,  customer  lists,  client
information and related client or user data,  intellectual  property  rights
acquired by  license  or  agreement,  telephone  numbers,  and  all  related
goodwill and other rights; and


      (g) all documentation related to any of the above.


Section 1.02  No  Liabilities.  Seller  represents  below  that  it  has  no
liabilities. Buyer shall  not  assume  any  liabilities  or  obligations  of
Seller of any  kind,  whether  known  or  unknown,  contingent,  matured  or
otherwise, whether currently existing or  hereinafter  created.  [See  above
note re “no liabilities”.]


Section 1.03 Purchase Price. The aggregate purchase price for the  Purchased
Assets shall be $[__________] (the "Purchase Price"). The  Buyer  shall  pay
the Purchase Price to Seller at the Closing (as defined below) in  cash,  by
wire transfer of immediately available funds in  accordance  with  the  wire
transfer instructions provided by the Seller in writing to Buyer. [Note:  If
stock is going to be used  as  part  of  the  Purchase  Price,  this  raises
significant securities law issues that will  need  to  be  addressed  early.
Compliance with some requirements  may  be  cost-prohibitive,  steering  the
transaction back to a cash purchase price.]


Section 1.04 Allocation  of  Purchase  Price.  Seller  and  Buyer  agree  to
allocate the Purchase Price among the Purchased Assets for all  purposes  as
agreed by their respective accountants, negotiating in good faith and  agree
file all tax returns and information reports in  a  manner  consistent  with
such allocation. [Note: talk with your accountant on  everything  about  the
purchase/sale, and work with him/her to obtain assistance with this.]


Section 1.05  Withholding  Tax.  Buyer  shall  be  entitled  to  deduct  and
withhold from the Purchase Price all taxes that Buyer  may  be  required  to
deduct and withhold under any applicable tax law. All such withheld  amounts
shall be  treated  as  delivered  to  Seller.  [See  counsel/accountant  for
assistance with potentially applicable taxes.]


                                 Article II
                                   Closing
