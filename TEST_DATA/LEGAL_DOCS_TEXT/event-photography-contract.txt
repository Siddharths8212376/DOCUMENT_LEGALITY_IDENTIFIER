The Client agree to provide a meal for the Photographer if the length of

Entire Agreement: This agreement contains the entire understanding between
the Client and the Photographer.


Confirmation: A signed “Contract for Event Photography Services” and
payment of the booking fee are necessary to confirm the stated wedding
services from the Photographer.

Cooperation: The Clients and the Photographer consent to happily
cooperating and communicating with each other to achieve the best possible
result within the understanding of this contract. We recommend that the
Photographer be provided with a helper (someone who knows most of the
guests) who will point out key individuals to be photographed. The
Photographer may also require assistance in organizing family groups. The
Clients also agree to give the Photographer sufficient warning of key
events to give the Photographer time to prepare e.g. cutting the cake,
speeches etc. Please note that not all guests like having their photo
taken. In such cases the Photographer will use his discretion but cannot be
held responsible for a lack of photos of these people.


The Schedule: Our shooting schedule, style of working and experience are
designed to achieve a great set of Event photos for the Clients,
accomplished with good humour and enjoyed by all concerned. Both the
Clients and the Photographers therefore agree that punctuality and cheerful
cooperation are essential to producing outstanding photographic results. In
cases where the Event does not run on time (for example, extreme lateness
by one of the Clients guests) we cannot guarantee to take our normal set of
photos although in such circumstances we will do our absolute best to
compensate.


Paparazzi Event Guests: All your guests will have digital cameras and all
your guests will want to take photographs at Key times. In the spirit of
cheerful cooperation the Clients agree to give the Photographers precedence
over the guests in order to take the photographs required for theEvent
services described above. I cannot be held liable for a lack of Event
photos if guests taking their own photos of the Key moments continually
interrupt the Photographer's work.


Copyright Law: The copyright of photographs remains with the Photographer.
The images taken by the Photographer are for personal use by the Clients
and their friends and relatives. Sale, Publication or any Commercial use of
the photographs is not allowed without prior written permission from the
Photographer.


Model Release: The Client grant the Photographer and its legal
representatives, heirs and assigns, the irrevocable and unlimited consent
to use the photographs of the Clients for editorial, competition,
advertising and any other purpose and in any manner, to alter the
photographs without restriction; and to copyright the images. The Clients
hereby release the Photographer and its legal representatives, heirs and
assigns from all liability and claims in connection with the images.


Limit of Liability: If a photographer is too ill or becomes injured and
cannot supply the wedding services specified above the Photographer will
try to book a replacement wedding photographer. Under normal circumstances
a second photographer from the Photographer is there for the day anyway and
this photographer will then shoot the day on his/her own. If both
photographers are unavailable and a replacement photographer cannot be
found then liability is limited to a refund of any payments received. The
Photographers have working methods in place to prevent loss or damage to
your images. However, there is the unlikely possibility that images may be
lost, stolen or destroyed for reasons in or beyond our control. In these
circumstances liability is limited to the return of fees paid for the
service or part thereof according to the percentage of images supplied.


Booking Fee/Deposit: In the event of the Clients cancelling the Event for
whatever reason the booking fee is non-refundable your deposit becomes a
"studio credit" and may be used toward a future session or event.


We have understood the contents of this contract and agree to the terms
therein.
