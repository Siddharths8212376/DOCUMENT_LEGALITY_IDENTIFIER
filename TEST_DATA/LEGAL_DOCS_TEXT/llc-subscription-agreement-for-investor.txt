of [[DATE]]. All capitalized terms used but  not  otherwise  defined  herein
shall have the meanings ascribed to  in  the  Operating  Agreement  provided
herewith by and among the Managers and the Members identified  therein  (the
“Operating Agreement”).


      WHEREAS, the Company has been formed as a  limited  liability  company

the Operating Agreement their  respective  rights,  obligations  and  duties
with respect to the Company and its assets; and


      WHEREAS, Subscriber wishes to  purchase  from  the  Company,  and  the
Company wishes to issue to Subscriber, a membership interest in the  Company

      NOW, THEREFORE, in  consideration  of  the  premises  and  the  mutual
covenants contained in this Agreement, the parties agree as follows:


      1. Subscription for Units.

and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

Purchased  Units,  Subscriber  agrees  to  make  (a)  an   Initial   Capital
Contribution to the Company in the manner set  forth  in  Section  [[SECTION

incorporated herein by reference) and (b) a commitment  to  make  additional
capital  contributions  to  the  Company  as  described  in  the   Operating
Agreement.


      2. Closing.


      2.1 Closing Date. The Closing of the purchase and sale  of  the  Units
shall occur at a time, date, and place designated by the Company;  provided,
however, that in no event shall the Closing occur more than  30  days  after
the execution of this Agreement.


      2.2 Rejection of Subscription. At or before the Closing,  the  Company
may, in its sole discretion and for any reason,  elect  not  to  accept  the
subscription of Subscriber, in whole or in  part.  If  the  Company  rejects
such  subscription,  the  Company  shall  refund  to  Subscriber  all  funds
submitted by Subscriber to the Company  in  connection  with  such  rejected
subscription.


      2.3 Default. If Subscriber fails to perform his obligations  hereunder
within five days after receipt of notice by the  Company  to  Subscriber  of
such failure, the Company may, at its  sole  option:  (a)  if  such  failure
occurs prior to  the  Closing,  refuse  to  issue  the  Purchased  Units  to
Subscriber; or (b) if such failure occurs after the Closing, result  in  the
reversion of all rights, title and interest in the Units to the Company  and
a rescission of the transactions contemplated hereby.


      2.4 Failure of Closing to Occur. The Company shall have  no  liability
to Subscriber for (a) the failure  of  the  Closing  to  occur  or  (b)  its
failure to issue the Purchased Units to Subscriber.


      2.5 Obligations  of  Subscriber.  At  the  Closing,  Subscriber  shall
execute the Operating Agreement and such other documents as  are  deemed  by
the Company to be appropriate, advisable  or  necessary  to  consummate  the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.


      2.6 Subscription Irrevocable.  Except  as  provided  under  applicable
state securities laws, this subscription is and shall be irrevocable on  the
part of Subscriber.


      3. Representation and Warranties of Subscriber.


      Subscriber hereby represents and warrants to the Company as follows:


      3.1 No Conflicts. The execution and delivery of this Agreement do not,
and the consummation of  the  transactions  contemplated  hereby  will  not,
violate any terms of any material contractual restriction or  commitment  of
any kind or character to which Subscriber is a party or by which  Subscriber
is bound.


      3.2 Risk of Loss. Subscriber is able to bear the substantial  economic
risks of an investment in the Company and to  sustain  a  complete  loss  of
such  investment.  Subscriber  recognizes  that  the  acquisition   of   the
Purchased Units involves a high degree of risk. Subscriber is  cognizant  of
and understands all of the risks related  to  the  purchase  of  the  Units,
including those set forth inSection 3.7 (Restrictions on Transfer)  of  this
Agreement pertaining to transferability. Subscriber has adequate  net  worth
and  means  of  providing  for  his  current  needs  and  possible  personal
contingencies  and  has  no  need  for   liquidity   in   this   investment.
Subscriber’s commitment to investments which are not readily  marketable  is
not disproportionate to his net worth and his acquisition of  the  Purchased
Units will not cause his overall commitment to such  investments  to  become
excessive.


      3.3 Access. Subscriber acknowledges that all  documents,  records  and
books pertaining to this investment have been made available for  inspection
by him, his counsel,  and  his  accountants.  Counsel  and  accountants  for
Subscriber, and Subscriber himself, have had the opportunity to  obtain  any
additional information necessary to verify the accuracy of the  contents  of
the documents presented to them, and to confer with  and  to  ask  questions
of, and receive answers from, representatives  of  the  Company  or  persons
authorized to act on its behalf concerning the terms and conditions of  this
investment and any additional information requested  by  Subscriber  or  his
representatives. In evaluating the suitability of  this  investment  in  the
Company, Subscriber  has  not  relied  upon  any  representations  or  other
information (whether oral or  written)  other  than  as  set  forth  in  any
documents or answers to questions furnished by the  Company.  Subscriber  is
making this investment  without  being  furnished  any  offering  literature
other than the documents or answers to questions described above.


      3.4 Investment Intent. The  Purchased  Units  are  being  acquired  by
Subscriber for the account of Subscriber, for investment purposes only,  and
not with a view to, or  in  connection  with,  any  resale  or  distribution
thereof. Subscriber has no contract, undertaking,  understanding,  agreement
or arrangement, formal or informal  with  any  person  or  entity  to  sell,
transfer or pledge to any person or entity all or any part of the  Purchased
Units, any interest therein or any rights thereto,  and  Subscriber  has  no
present plans to enter into any such  contract,  undertaking,  agreement  or
arrangement.


      3.5 Reliance on Representations. Subscriber understandsthat no federal
or state agency has passed on or made any recommendation or  endorsement  of
the Units. Subscriber further understands that the Company, in offering  the
Purchased Units for  sale  to  Subscriber,  is  relying  on  the  truth  and
accuracy of  the  representations,  declarations,  and  warranties  made  by
Subscriber herein and in the investor suitability  questionnaire  completed,
executed and  delivered  by  Subscriber  to  the  Company  contemporaneously
herewith.


      3.6 No Registration. Subscriber acknowledges that, because  the  Units
have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933  (the  “Securities
Act”),  and  because  the  Company  has  no  obligation   to   effect   such
registration, Subscriber shall continue to bear the  economic  risk  of  his
investment in the Purchased Units for an indefinite period.


      3.7 Restrictions on Transfer. Subscriber agrees that he will not  sell
or otherwise transfer the Purchased Units other than in accordance with  the
terms and conditions of the Operating Agreement. It is understood  that  the
Units cannot be liquidated easily, that no public  or  other  market  exists
for the Units, and that no suchmarket is expected to develop. Subscriber  is
aware that, because the Purchased Units have not been registered  under  the
Securities Act or applicable state securities laws, any resale  inconsistent
with the Securities Act or  applicable  state  securities  laws  may  create
liability on Subscriber’s part or the part of the Company,  and  agrees  not
to assign, sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of the  Units  unless
they  are  registered  under  the  Securities  Act  and   applicable   state
securities laws, or an opinion of counsel satisfactory  to  the  Company  is
given to the Company that such registration is not required.  Subscriber  is
aware that  the  Company  will  impress  on  the  back  of  any  certificate
representing Units a legend substantially as follows:


    • These Units have not been registered under the Securities Act of  1933
      or applicable state securities  laws.  They  may  not  be  offered  or
      transferred by sale, assignment, pledge  or  otherwise  unless  (i)  a
      registration statement for the Units  under  the  Securities  Act  and
      applicable state securities laws is in effect or (ii) the Company  has
      received an opinion of counsel satisfactory  to  the  Company  to  the
      effect that such registration is not required.


      3.8  Sophistication.  Subscriber  possesses  a  sufficient  degree  of
sophistication, knowledge, and experience in financial and business  matters
such that he is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of acquiring  the
Purchased Units.


      3.9 No Oral Representations. No person  representing  the  Company  or
purporting to do  so  has  made  any  oral  representation  or  warranty  to
Subscriber which is inconsistent with the information  provided  in  writing
to him. Subscriber agrees that he has not relied and shall not rely  on  any
such representation or warranty in connection with any decision  to  acquire
the Purchased Units.


      3.10 Execution on Behalf of Certain Entities.  If  this  Agreement  is
executed on behalf of a partnership, trust,  corporation  or  other  entity,
the undersigned has  been  duly  authorized  to  execute  and  deliver  this
Agreement and all other documents and  instruments  (if  any)  executed  and
delivered on behalf of such entity in connection with this subscription  for
the Purchased Units.


      3.11 Brokers. No broker, finder or intermediary has been  paid  or  is
entitled to a fee or commission from or by  Subscriber  in  connection  with
the purchase of the Purchased Units nor is Subscriber entitled  to  or  will
accept any such fee or commission.


      3.12  Indemnification.   Subscriber   acknowledges   that   Subscriber
understands the meaning and legal consequences of  the  representations  and
warranties contained in this Agreement, and hereby agrees to  indemnify  and
hold harmless the  Company  and  any  affiliate  of  the  Company,  and  the
officers,  members,  managers,  associates,  agents  and  employees  of  the
Company and their affiliates, and any professional advisers to  any  of  the
above parties, from and against  any  and  all  loss,  damage  or  liability
(including costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees) due to or arising out of  a
breach of any representation, warranty or acknowledgement of  Subscriber  or
failure to fulfill any obligation of Subscriber, whether contained  in  this
Agreement or in any other document completed as part  of  the  sale  of  the
Purchased Units to Subscriber, or arising out of the  sale  or  distribution
by Subscriber of any securities in violation of the Securities  Act  or  any
applicable   state   securities   laws.   Notwithstanding   any    of    the
representations, warranties, acknowledgements or agreements made  herein  by
Subscriber, Subscriber does not hereby or in  any  other  manner  waive  any
rights granted to him under federal or state securities laws.


      3.13 Subject to Operating Agreement. The Units subscribed  for  herein
shall at all times be subject to the terms of the Operating Agreement.

times any nonpublic information which such persons  may  acquire  concerning
the Company pursuant  to  this  Agreement  or  otherwise.  Nothing  in  this
Section  3.14   (Confidentiality)   shall   be   construed   to   impose   a
confidentiality obligation on  such  persons  in  connection  with  (a)  any
information already possessed by such persons which  such  persons  acquired
from sources other than the Company, or (b) any matter which is at the  date
of this Agreement, or thereafter becomes, public knowledge  through  no  act
or failure to act  by  the  undersigned  or  designated  representatives  of
Subscriber.


      3.15  Survival.The  foregoing  representations   and   warranties   of
Subscriber shall survive the Closing.  Subscriber  represents  and  warrants
that the representations, warranties and acknowledgements  set  forth  above
are true and accurate as of the date hereof and as of  the  Closing.  If  in
