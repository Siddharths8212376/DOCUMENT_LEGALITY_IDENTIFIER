Statement of Work for Web Development


This Agreement ("Agreement") is made as of [MAR 28, 2017], by [PROVIDER]
located at [PROVIDER ADDRESS], and [CLIENT] ("Client"), located at [CLIENT
ADDRESS].


Summary


This project involves the design and development of a web site for use by
[CLIENT]. This project will follow the timeline outlined below and does not
include ongoing maintenance of the site outside of what may be stated in
the scope.


Project Scope


This SOW covers the following activities and deliverables.


    • Theme Design and Development: At the onset of this project, a maximum
      of 4 hours of time will be included in order to collaborate with you
      on the design and theme of the site, often including wireframing,
      choosing a color palette, and exchanging your media that will be used
      for the site. The theme decided on during the onset of this project
      will be the basis for the design of the website. The theme will be
      built with the Bootstrap v4 alpha6 frontend framework. There will be a
      period of revisions, and development will start once you have signed
      off on the design. Once development has started, only minor changes
      can be made without affecting the scope of the project.
    • Integrations Discovery: [PROVIDER] will consult with you to discover
      various means for achieving the integrations requested, and will spend
      time researching and developing the integrations requested with best
      practices and modern security standards.
    • Host and Domain Setup: If hosting is required, [PROVIDER] will source
      and set up hosting for the requested domain. Maintenance and ownership
      of the account will fall to [CLIENT] at the conclusion of the project,
      and [CLIENT] will maintain ownership of the registered domain name
      used for the project.
    • SSL Certificates: With your security in mind, all projects developed
      by [PROVIDER] will require the use of a modern SSL Certificate
      authorized by a recognized Certificate Authority. All pages and
      traffic on your site will be encrypted with this SSL Certificate. You
      can purchase one, if you don’t already have one, through your domain
      name registrar or other similar service, or we can purchase one for
      you and include it in your quote. Just like a domain name, SSL
      Certificates must be renewed and updated annually. It is your
      responsibility to renew and update your SSL certificate unless we
      agree otherwise in an ongoing Service Agreement.
    • Installation and Setup: [PROVIDER] will install and set up the project
      on the host mentioned above so that [CLIENT] is able to maintain the
      site.
    • The pages for the site will include:
         o [LIST AND DESCRIPTION OF WEB APP PAGES]
    • The features of the site will include:
         o [LIST AND DESCRIPTION OF WEB APP FEATURES]
    • Browser Testing: [PROVIDER] will test the site to make sure it works
      with modern desktop web browsers. [PROVIDER] will also test to make
      sure that the site does not break when viewed on mobile devices.
