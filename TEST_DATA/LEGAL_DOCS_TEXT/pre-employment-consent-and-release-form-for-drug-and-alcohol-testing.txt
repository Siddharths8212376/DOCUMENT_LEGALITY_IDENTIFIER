                  CONSENT AND RELEASE FOR DRUG AND ALCOHOL
                           TESTING PRE-EMPLOYMENT


I, [APPLICANT], understand that pursuant to [COMPANY NAME]'s Policy for a
Drug and Alcohol-Free Workplace, I am being required to drug screening
test.


I hereby consent to submit to urinalysis, breath, blood, and/or other tests
as shall be determined by [COMPANY NAME] for the purpose of determining the
use of illegal drugs.


I agree that [TESTING LABORATORY], or an alternate company selected
facility, may collect these specimens for these tests and may test them or
forward them to a testing laboratory designated by the Company for
analysis. I further agree to and hereby authorize the release of the
results of said tests to the Company.


I understand that it is the current illegal use of drugs and/or abuse of
alcohol that prohibits me from obtaining employment with the Company.


I am unaware of any medical condition that would indicate that either the
screen or physical examination might endanger my physical health.


I agree to hold harmless the Company and its agents (including the above
named physician or clinic) from any liability arising in whole or part out
of the collection of specimens, testing, and use of the information from
said testing in connection with the Company's consideration of my
continuing employment.


I agree that a reproduced copy of this consent and release form shall have
the same force and effect as the original.


I have carefully read the foregoing and fully understand its contents. I
acknowledge that my signing of this consent and release form is a voluntary
act on my part and that I have not been coerced into signing this document
by anyone.
