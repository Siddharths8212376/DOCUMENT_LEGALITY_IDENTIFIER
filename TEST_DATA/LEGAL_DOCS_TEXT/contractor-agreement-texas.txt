                            CONTRACTOR AGREEMENT


      This CONTRACTOR AGREEMENT is between ________________ (“Company”)  and
________________ (“Contractor”) and is effective as of the date of the  last
signature below (the “Effective Date”).


   1. Engagement. During the term of this agreement, Contractor will provide
      services  to  the  Company  as  described  onExhibit  A  hereto   (the
      “Services”). Contractor represents that Contractor  is  duly  licensed
      (as applicable) and has the qualifications,  the  experience  and  the
      ability  to  properly  perform  the  Services.  Contractor  shall  use
      Contractor’s best efforts  to  perform  the  Services  such  that  the
      results are satisfactory to the Company. Consultant shall  devote  [at
      least]  [_____%  of  Consultant’s  time/_____  hours  per   week]   to
      performance of the Services.


      Contractor shall be solely responsible  for  determining  the  method,
details  and  means  of  performing  the  Services.   Contractor   may,   at
Contractor’s own expense, employ or engage the services of  such  employees,
subcontractors,  partners  or  agents,  as  Contractor  deems  necessary  to
perform the Services (collectively, the “Assistants”).  The  Assistants  are
not and shall not be employees of  the  Company,  and  Contractor  shall  be
wholly responsible for the professional performance of the Services  by  the
Assistants such that the results are satisfactory to the Company.


      All of the services to be performed by Contractor, including  but  not
limited to the Services, will  be  as  agreed  between  Contractor  and  the
Company’s  representative  designated  to   Contractor   in   writing   (the
“Representative”).   Contractor   will   be   required    to    report    to
theRepresentative concerning the Services performed  under  this  Agreement.
The nature and frequency of these reports will be left to the discretion  of
the Representative.


      However, Consultant’s relationship with the Company will be that of an
independent contractor and not that of an employee.


   1. Fees and Expenses. As consideration for the Services to be provided by
      Consultant and other obligations, the Company shall pay to  Consultant
      the amounts specified  inExhibit  B  hereto  at  the  times  specified
      therein.


      Contractor shall not be authorized to incur on behalf of  the  Company
any expenses and  will  be  responsible  for  all  expenses  incurred  while
performing  the  Services  unless  otherwise  agreed  to  by  the  Company’s
Representative,  which  consent  shall  be  evidenced  in  writing  for  any
expenses in excess of $100.00. As a condition to receipt  of  reimbursement,
Contractor shall be required to submit to the  Company  reasonable  evidence
that the amount involved was both reasonable and necessary to  the  Services
provided under this agreement.


   1. Confidentiality. Contractor will not (a)  use  Company’s  Confidential
      Information except as needed to perform the Services or  (b)  disclose
      Company’s Confidential Information to any third party except (x) under
      an identical confidentiality  restriction  to  the  receiving  party’s
      employees  or  consultants  who  have  a  need  to  know  Confidential
      Information in connection with the Services; or (y) when compelled  by
      a court or other government agency (with as much advance notice to the
      disclosing  party  as  reasonably  possible).  Contractor  will  treat
      Confidential Information in the same manner as  its  own  confidential
      information, but with a  minimum  of  a  reasonable  degree  of  care.
      “Confidential Information” means information that Company discloses to
      Contractor under this agreement and that is marked as confidential  or
      would  normally  be  considered  confidential  information  under  the
      circumstances, but does not include information that is  independently
      developed by Contractor, is rightfully given to Contractor by a  third
      party without restriction as to disclosure, or becomes public  through
      no fault of Contractor.
   2. Term and Termination. Contractor shall serve as a  contractor  to  the
      Company for a periodcommencing on the specified date (or if no date is
      specified, the Effective Date) and terminating on the date  Contractor
      completes the provision of the Services  to  the  Company  under  this
      agreement.


      Notwithstanding the above, either party may terminate  this  Agreement
at any time upon 30 days’ written notice. In the event of such  termination,
Contractor shall be paid for any portion of  the  Services  that  have  been
performed prior to the termination.


      Should either party default in the performance of  this  Agreement  or
materially breach any of its obligations  under  this  Agreement,  the  non-
breaching party may terminate this Agreement immediately  if  the  breaching
party fails to cure the breach within 30 days after having received  written
notice by the non-breaching party of the breach or default.


      Any provision of this agreement which, by its sense and  context,  was
intended to survive termination of this agreement shall so survive.


   1. Defense and Indemnity; Limitation of Liability.Contractor  agrees,  to
      the fullest extent allowed by law, to defend and indemnify Company and
      any of its employees, officers, directors, and agents from and against
      any and all claims, demands, damages, or other liabilities,  including
      reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising out of or related to  Contractor’s
      negligence or willful misconduct or violation of applicable law.

delay in performance to  the  extent  caused  by  circumstances  beyond  its
reasonable control.

agreement or any Purchase Order, except that either party may  transfer  all
or any part of this agreement or a Purchase Order to (a)  an  Affiliate;  or

the party’s assets. An “Affiliate” is an entity that is  controlled  by,  in

agreement, together with thePurchase Order, sets out all  the  terms  agreed
between the parties and supersedes all other agreements between the  parties
relating to its subject matter. In entering  into  this  agreement,  neither
party has relied on, and neither party will have any right or  remedy  based
on, any statement, representation, or warranty except  those  expressly  set
out in this agreement. Any amendment must be  in  writing,  signed  by  both
parties, and expressly  state  that  it  is  amending  this  agreement,  and

(or delaying the exercise of) any rights under this agreement. If  any  term
(or part of a term) of this agreement is invalid, illegal or  unenforceable,
the rest of this agreement will remain in effect.


           (d) Order of Precedence. The terms  of  thePurchase  Order  will
