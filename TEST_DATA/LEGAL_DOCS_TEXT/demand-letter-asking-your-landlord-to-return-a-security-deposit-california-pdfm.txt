Re: Return of Security Deposit



I am writing to request that you return my security deposit as required
under Cal. Civ. Code
ยง1950.5.



I vacated the premises at on [VACATE DATE]. Pursuant to Cal. Civ. Code
ยง1950.5, you were
required, by [DEADLINE DATE], to refund my security deposit and/or provide
an itemized statement
listing any amounts you have withheld.



As of today, I have not received my security deposit or an itemized
statement.



If you do not return my security deposit by [DEMAND DATE], I will proceed
with a small claims
action to recover the entire amount of my deposit.



You may also be responsible for damages up to two (2) times the amount of
the security
deposit for illegally withholding my security deposit. I retain the right
to seek additional
damages up to the amount allowed by law in a small claims proceeding.



If you wish to discuss this matter, I can be reached at the address and
telephone listed below.



Sincerely,
[YOUR NAME]
