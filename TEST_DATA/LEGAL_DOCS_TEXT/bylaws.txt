These are the bylaws of EPICODUS, INC., an Oregon corporation.


                     Article I: Meetings of Shareholders


1. The annual meeting of shareholders will be held  at  the  office  of  the
Corporation or at such other place as shall be determined by  the  Board  of
Directors, and shall be held on such date which shall  be  selected  by  the
Board of Directors for each fiscal year of the Corporation.


2. At the annual meeting, the shareholders will elect a board  of  not  less
than one (1) and no more than three (3) directors and  may  take  any  other
shareholder action permitted by state law.


3. A special meeting of the shareholders may be called at any time by the
President or one or more directors.


4. At least 10 but no  more  than  60  days  before  an  annual  or  special
meeting,  the  Secretary  will  send  a  notice  of  the  meeting  to   each
shareholder. The notice must be sent by first-class mail and must state  the
time and place of the meeting. For a special meeting, the notice  must  also
include the purposes of the meeting; no action can be  taken  at  a  special
meeting except as stated in the notice, unless all shareholders consent.


5. Shareholders may attend a meeting either in person or by proxy. A  quorum
of shareholders at any shareholders’ meeting will consist of the  owners  of
a  majority  of  the  shares  outstanding.  If  a  quorum  is  present,  the
shareholders may adjourn from day to day as they see fit, and no  notice  of
such  adjournment  need  be  given.  If  a  quorum  is  not   present,   the
shareholders present in person or by proxy may adjourn to such  future  time
as they agree upon; notice of  such  adjournment  must  be  mailed  to  each
shareholder at least 10 but no more  than  60  days  before  such  adjourned
meeting.


6. Each shareholder, whether represented in person or by proxy, is  entitled
to one vote for each share of stock standing in  his  or  her  name  on  the
books of the company.


7. Proxies must be in writing.


8. All shareholders’ actions  require  the  assent  of  a  majority  of  the
corporate shares that have been issued, but if state law requires a  greater
number of votes, that law will prevail.


9. Shareholders may,  by  written  consent,  take  any  action  required  or
permitted to be taken at an annual or special meeting of shareholders.  Such
action may be taken  without  prior  notice  to  shareholders.  The  written
consent must:


    • state the action taken, and
    • be signed and dated by all of the shareholders.


                              Article II: Stock


1. Stock certificates must be signed by the President and Secretary of the
Corporation.

the number of shares owned, and the date of issue will be entered in the

for cancellation. New certificates will be issued to the purchaser or

the statutes of the State of Oregon, the Articles of Incorporation,  or  the
corporate Bylaws.


2. A vacancy on the Board of Directors by reason of death,  resignation,  or
other causes may be filled by the remaining  directors,  or  the  board  may
leave the position unfilled, in which case it will be filled by  a  vote  of
the shareholders at a special meeting or at the next annual meeting.  During
periods when there is  an  unfilled  vacancy  on  the  board  of  directors,
actions taken by the remaining directors  will  constitute  actions  of  the
board.


3. The board of directors will  meet  annually,  immediately  following  the
annual meeting of shareholders. The Board of Directors may also  hold  other
regular meetings, at times and places to be fixed by unanimous agreement  of
the board. At annual or regular meetings, the board  may  take  any  actions
allowed by law or these bylaws.


Special meetings may be called by the President or 1 or  more  directors  by
giving at least 2 days’ written notice to all directors.


A notice of a special meeting must be sent  by  first-class  mail  and  must
state the time, place, and purposes of the meeting; no action can  be  taken
at a special meeting of directors except as stated  in  the  notice,  unless
all directors consent.


4. A quorum for a meeting will consist of a majority of the directors.


5. Directors will act only by unanimous assent of the directors.


6. The directors will not be compensated for serving  as  such.  A  director
may, however, serve in other capacities with  the  Corporation  and  receive
compensation for such service.


7. Directors may, by written consent, take any action required or  permitted
to be taken at a directors’ meeting. Such action may be taken without  prior
notice to the directors. The written consent must:


    • state the action taken, and
    • be signed and dated by at least the number of  directors  whose  votes
      would be needed to take such action at a meeting.


If the written consent is not signed by all directors,  the  Secretary  will
within three days send a copy of the written consent to  the  directors  who
did not sign it.


8. Directors may meet or participate in meetings by telephone or other
electronic means as long as all directors are continuously able to
communicate with one another.


                            Article IV: Officers


1. The officers of the Corporation will consist of a President, Secretary
and Treasurer, and such other officers as the Board of Directors may
appoint.

received or disbursed, and will deposit all  moneys  and  valuables  in  the
name of the Corporation in the banks and  depositories  that  the  directors
designate. Checks against company accounts will be  signed  as  directed  by
the board of directors.


6. The salaries of all officers will be fixed by the board of directors and
may be changed from time to time by the board of directors.

The books of the Corporation will be closed at a date to be selected by  the
directors prior to the filing of the first income tax return  due  from  the

                           Article VI: Amendments
