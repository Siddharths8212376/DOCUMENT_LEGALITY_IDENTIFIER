L351718 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ You know it doesn't include the amp.
L351717 +++$+++ u6313 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ And that does include the amp?
L351716 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ You know how much it is, Nick.
L351715 +++$+++ u6313 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ How much did you say it was, Tom?
L351712 +++$+++ u6313 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Of course you are. All right, Ed.
L351711 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ What are you talking about? I am bloody skinny, pal.
L352159 +++$+++ u6314 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ So I've just got to put you in, and I am off.
L352158 +++$+++ u6319 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TRAFFIC WARDEN +++$+++ So?

L352153 +++$+++ u6314 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I'll only be a minute.
L352152 +++$+++ u6319 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TRAFFIC WARDEN +++$+++ You got a ticket already and, if you don't move it now, sir, we will move it for you.
L352293 +++$+++ u6317 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ SOAP +++$+++ OK, don't panic; let's think about this.
L352292 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses.
L352291 +++$+++ u6317 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ SOAP +++$+++ The money, the gear!
L352289 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ How come you know so much about black cocks and so little about white pussy?]
L352288 +++$+++ u6317 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ SOAP +++$+++ How the fuck should I know?
L352287 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ That's right. So how many whiskers has the little white kitten got?
L352286 +++$+++ u6317 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ SOAP +++$+++ Er, well, twelve.
L352285 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ How many feet?

L352283 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ How many wings have they got between them?
L352282 +++$+++ u6317 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ SOAP +++$+++ Six.
L352281 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ There's six black cocks sitting on the side of the road. How many beaks have they got between them?
L352249 +++$+++ u6317 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ SOAP +++$+++ Tom, the fatter you get, the sadder you get.
L352248 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ You would take a pain ín the arse full stop.
L352247 +++$+++ u6317 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ SOAP +++$+++ I would take a pain in the arse for half a million.
L352246 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ This guy Rory Breaker can afford to do the deal at the price we are selling. It's not worth him giving us trouble; he knows we would be a pain in the arse, and who wants a pain in the arse?
L352213 +++$+++ u6317 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ SOAP +++$+++ What about all the gear?
L352212 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.

L352066 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Nick the Greek.
L352065 +++$+++ u6317 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ SOAP +++$+++ Where did you get those from, a museum?
L352012 +++$+++ u6317 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ SOAP +++$+++ Well, excuse me, brother, mother or any other sucker, doesn't make any difference, they are still fucking guns, and they still fire fucking bullets!
L352011 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ It's the mother of fuck-ups, stupid!
L352010 +++$+++ u6317 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ SOAP +++$+++ Oh, you assume, do ya? What do they say about assumption being the brother of all fuck-ups?
L351801 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Listen cooky, you want to make sure that man rests before he plays; it's in all our interests.
L351800 +++$+++ u6317 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ SOAP +++$+++ Tom, you're all heart.
L351799 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ What you telling us for? The only thing I care about is whether you get your rest in.
L351760 +++$+++ u6317 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ SOAP +++$+++ You're not funny Tom; you're fat and look as though you should be funny, but you're not.
L351759 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Whatever it's going on, it's still enough to send you on a cooking course.
L351758 +++$+++ u6317 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ SOAP +++$+++ That's going on optimism.
L351757 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ So, a reasonable return should be in the region of one hundred and twenty, for twenty-five grand invested. That's going on previous experiences.
L351722 +++$+++ u6317 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ SOAP +++$+++ Get your fingers out of my soup!
L351721 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ If you will order stuff that comes from Kat-Man-Fucking-Du don't be surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route. ~ Never mind that, what about the money?
L351720 +++$+++ u6317 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ SOAP +++$+++ Cupid stupid! That's the last time I am getting any more fruit off you Tom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher's, not a grocer's.
L351719 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ What have you come as?
L351819 +++$+++ u6321 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ I mean we grow copious amounts of ganja, and you don't look like your average hort-er-fucking-culturalist, that's what I mean, Willy.
L351818 +++$+++ u6320 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ WILLY +++$+++ What do you mean?
L351817 +++$+++ u6321 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ We also need a fucking money counter, William! We have to get the money out by Thursday and I'll be buggered if I am counting it . . . and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more subtle?
L351816 +++$+++ u6320 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ WILLY +++$+++ We need fertilizer, Winston.
L351815 +++$+++ u6321 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ You went out six hours ago to buy a money counter and you come back carrying two bags of fertilizer. Alarm bells are ringing, Willy.
L351814 +++$+++ u6320 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ WILLY +++$+++ Er, fertilizer.
L351813 +++$+++ u6321 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ What are you carrying, Willy?
L351812 +++$+++ u6321 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ The problem is, Willy, that Charlie and yourself are not the quickest of cats in the alley at the best of times, so just do as I say and keep the fucking cage locked.
L351811 +++$+++ u6320 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ WILLY +++$+++ Chill, Winston, it's me and Charlie can see it's me, so what's the problem?
L354056 +++$+++ u6345 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PALOMA +++$+++ It's pathetic. You can't be desperately in love when you're 14 years old.
L354055 +++$+++ u6322 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ AMADO +++$+++ So?
L354054 +++$+++ u6345 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PALOMA +++$+++ Joanie Orozco's telling the whole school she's like desperately in love with Santo Guerra.
L354053 +++$+++ u6322 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ AMADO +++$+++ Just shut up.
L354052 +++$+++ u6345 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PALOMA +++$+++ And those stupid girls who hang out with them--
L354051 +++$+++ u6322 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ AMADO +++$+++ I don't pretend I came over on the Mayflower--
L354050 +++$+++ u6345 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PALOMA +++$+++ Who'd want to be friends with that bunch of pachuco wannabes?
L354049 +++$+++ u6322 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ AMADO +++$+++ I'm not talking to you. You don't have any friends.
L354048 +++$+++ u6345 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PALOMA +++$+++ You jerk--
L354425 +++$+++ u6322 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ AMADO +++$+++ Catholic school, nasty.
L354424 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ Two years at hard labor, Our Lady of Perpetual Help.
L354423 +++$+++ u6322 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ AMADO +++$+++ And what did she do?
L354422 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ I said pretty much the same thing to my mother when I was your age.
L354421 +++$+++ u6322 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ AMADO +++$+++ It's my life. If I want to fuck it up, that's my business.
L354420 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ If you grew up to he anywhere near as good a man as your father was, I would be happy! I would be thrilled.
L354419 +++$+++ u6322 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ AMADO +++$+++ Oh, come on--you and Grandma think anybody who works with their hands is a peasant. When Dad--
L354418 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ That isn't true.
L354417 +++$+++ u6322 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ AMADO +++$+++ I'm not settling for anything. I like cars, it's just not a move up the ladder to you, so you think it's a waste.
L354416 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ I think you can learn whatever you want to. I just don't see you doing it. If you want to settle for--
L354415 +++$+++ u6322 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ AMADO +++$+++ You think I can't learn that?
L354414 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ You can fix old cars. Mr. Washburn told me that the cars they're making now are all computerized--
L354413 +++$+++ u6322 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ AMADO +++$+++ I can fix cars.
L354412 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ How do you think you're going to make a living?
L354411 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ Save your breath. That line doesn't cut it with me.
L354410 +++$+++ u6322 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ AMADO +++$+++ They stole our land--
L354409 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ That makes it okay?
L354408 +++$+++ u6322 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ AMADO +++$+++ Just some rich Anglo out on the lake. Don't even live here all year.
L354407 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ Don't try to con me, Amado. You knew how they got all those things.
L354406 +++$+++ u6322 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ AMADO +++$+++ They're not going to jail.
L354405 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends.
L354404 +++$+++ u6322 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ AMADO +++$+++ So?
L354403 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ --you're going to be on your own.
L354402 +++$+++ u6322 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ AMADO +++$+++ I can't take any more school.
L354401 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ I'm only going to have you for two more years. If you decide not to go on to college--
L354047 +++$+++ u6322 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ AMADO +++$+++ You and all of the teachers in this dump--your story's over, so you don't want anybody else to have fun.
L354046 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ Leave your sister out of it.
L354045 +++$+++ u6322 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ AMADO +++$+++ Just 'cause I'm not like Little Miss Honor Roll here--
L354044 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ Oh, come on, Amado--
L354043 +++$+++ u6322 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ AMADO +++$+++ If you had your way I wouldn't have any friends.
L353854 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ You'll find out when I get you home. Thanks, Sam.
L353853 +++$+++ u6322 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ AMADO +++$+++ I don't know what the big deal is.

L354644 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post?
L354643 +++$+++ u6323 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ ATHENA +++$+++ They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us.
L354642 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Why do you think they let us in on the "deal"?
L354641 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Chaos.
L354640 +++$+++ u6323 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ ATHENA +++$+++ Outside it's--it's such a mess--it's--
L354639 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Because it's a job?

L354637 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ With your attitude, Private, I'm surprised you want to stay in the service.

L354633 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ How do you think I got to be a colonel?
L354632 +++$+++ u6323 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ ATHENA +++$+++ It's their country. This is one of the best deals they offer.
L354631 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Please.
L354630 +++$+++ u6323 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ ATHENA +++$+++ You really want to know, sir?
L354629 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Well?
L354627 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ And that's the job? Nothing about serving your country?

L354617 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ When you were given the opportunity to enlist, a kind of contract was agreed upon. I think the Army has honored its part of that agreement.
L354616 +++$+++ u6323 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ ATHENA +++$+++ I'm sorry, sir.
L354615 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Then how would you explain the fact that out of one hundred twenty people we tested, you're the only one who came up positive for drugs?

L353959 +++$+++ u6323 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ ATHENA +++$+++ Will this go on my record?
L353958 +++$+++ u6330 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ He's going to lose a lung. This is not good news for Athena--
L353957 +++$+++ u6323 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ ATHENA +++$+++ Out of the Army?
L353954 +++$+++ u6330 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ He'll live.
L353953 +++$+++ u6323 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ ATHENA +++$+++ Sergeant Major? How is Richie doing? Private Graves?
L353952 +++$+++ u6323 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ ATHENA +++$+++ I'm sorry, Sergeant Major. There wasn't anything I could do. Shadow gets crazy--
L353951 +++$+++ u6330 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ It's not our job to get involved in your personal life, but when it interferes with the training here--
L353944 +++$+++ u6323 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ ATHENA +++$+++ From back in Houston. We both come up on Fifth Street.
L353943 +++$+++ u6330 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ So you knew this young man before?

L353950 +++$+++ u6323 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ ATHENA +++$+++ I know that, Sergeant. We were just dancing. There was a bunch of us there. Shadow just come down looking for trouble.
L353949 +++$+++ u6348 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PRISCILLA +++$+++ We're not running a dating service here.
L353948 +++$+++ u6323 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ ATHENA +++$+++ We were just dancing--

L353906 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Yeah, it's a pretty cold trail.
L353905 +++$+++ u6324 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ What I will do is keep names out of it till we got some answers or hit a dead end. You know how the press is with a murder story--even if it's forty years old.
L353904 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You got to investigate. No question about it.
L353903 +++$+++ u6324 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen.
L353902 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ So is Buddy on your short list?
L353901 +++$+++ u6324 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Just wondering.
L353900 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ He swore by it.  What?
L353899 +++$+++ u6324 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ A .45--
L353898 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Colt Peacemaker.
L353897 +++$+++ u6324 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ You uhm--you remember what old Buddy carried for a side arm?
L353896 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ So he could have gone out to the base, hopped the fence, dug down into the dirt on the old rifle range and had a heart attack.
L353895 +++$+++ u6324 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Skull was intact, no soft tissue left--not much to go on.
L353894 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You got a cause of death?
