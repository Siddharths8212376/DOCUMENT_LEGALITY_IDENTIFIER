L552395 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ No, sir.  I'm sure we wouldn't.
L552394 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ Do you think we'd cheat?
L552393 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ General, what's good enough for the President and all the experts he's got working on the thing, is good enough for me.
L552392 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ And you'd like to see that?
L552391 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ If they gave us what we think we need, yes, I guess we would.
L552390 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ But if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want, we'd agree, wouldn't we?
L552389 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ But, General, we're on our toes.  We haven't agreed to anything for years.  Inffact, a a lot of people say we never will.
L552388 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ I'll tell you what I do think.  If they say they're for disarmament, I say anyone who says they're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool.
L552387 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
L552386 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ Don't be offended, Major.  Our President holds the same views.
L552385 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Well, I'm not, sir.  Honestly, sir.
L552384 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ Major, you're talking like one of them!
L552383 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Gee, sir, that last remark doesn't exactly make all the sense in the world.
L552382 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ No, Major, I don't.  They have no regard for human life.  They wouldn't care if they lost their whole country as long as they won.
L552381 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Well, for the same reasons we do, sir. Don't you see?
L552380 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ I still ask, why do they want disarmament?
L552379 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Well, sir, I remember an example that pointed out that if a system was safe on 99.99% of the days of the year, given average luck it would fail in thirty years.
L552378 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ Go on, Major.  You fascinate me.
L552377 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ That's right, sir.  And don't forget in a few years a lot of other countries will have the bomb.  What if they start something?
L552376 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ I've heard the arguments.  Like Napoleon's quote, "There's one thing you can't do with a bayonet, and that's - sit on it."
L552375 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ I was just going to say, as long as the weapons exist, sooner or later something's going to happen -- and that'll be it for both countries.
L552374 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ Go on, Major.
L552373 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Well, sir, like I said, for the same reasons we do.  I mean, all the experts say the most likely way for War to start nowadays is by an accident, or a mistake, or by some mentally unbalanced person -- 
L552372 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ Then don't you realize the Bomb gives us Peace not War?  And, if that's the case, I ask you again: Why do they want disarmament?
L552371 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Right.
L552370 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ But war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right?
L552369 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ I don't know, sir.  But they're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are. War just doesn't make sense any more, for anybody.
L552368 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ But we mean it because we are a peace- loving country.  Are they a peace-loving country, Major.
L552367 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Yes, sir.  But so do we.
L552366 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ You're very naive, Major.  Don't they say they want disarmament?
L552365 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ And I guess they won't until they agree to let us inspect inside their country.
L552364 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ Not yet, Major.  Not yet.
L552363 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Well, I know they've been going on for years, and they haven't gotten any place.
L552362 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ Where?  Everywhere, Major.  Everywhere.
L552361 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Where, sir?
L552360 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ Major Mandrake, I guess you don't follow what's going on too closely, do you?
L552359 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ But if you just let things alone, we wouldn't lose anyone.
L552358 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ You're absolutely right.  You forgot to mention their nuclear subs.  But it wouldn't matter. Sure we wouldn't get off without getting our hair mussed, but we'd prevail.  I don't think we'd lose more than fifty million people, tops.
L552357 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ But even then, we wouldn't get everything.  I mean some missiles would abort, or they'd miss their targets, or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we don't know about.
L552356 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ I know so, Major.  I know so.  And add to that, the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.
L552355 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ I guess so.
L552354 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ Our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy, wouldn't they?
L552353 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ I suppose we might catch them off their guard.
L552352 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ You're being dense, Major.  I certainly don't
L552351 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ But then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people, sir?
L552350 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ That's close enough, Major.
L552349 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Well, I think I remember reading the report on that.  Wasn't it something like a hundred and sixty million?
L552348 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ If we haven't taken any further action, they certainly will.  Doyyourhappen to remember the statistics on our casualties in the event of a full-scale enemy attack?
L552347 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ But when they do, sir, won't they hit back with everything they've got?
L552346 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ You see, Major, at this very moment, while we sit and chat, a decision is being made by the President in the War Room.  He knows that the enemy will pick up our planes on their radar in about twenty minutes.
L552345 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ I'm trying to, sir.
L552344 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ When he said it, fifty years ago, he might have been right.  But today, war is too important to be left to the politicians. Do you follow me, Major?
L552343 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ I see.
L552342 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ He said war was too important a matter to be left to Generals.
L552341 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ I don't think so, sir.
L552340 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ Do you remember what Clemenceau once said about war?
L552339 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ No, sir.  I mean I didn't think you hadn't given it a lot of thought.
L552338 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ I've given it alot of thought, Major.  Don't think I haven't.
L552337 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Well, General -- I was wondering, why are you doing this?  I mean why do you want to start the war?
L552336 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ Ask away, Major.
L552335 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ General Ripper, can I ask another question?
L552334 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ To peace on earth.
L552333 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ What shall we drink to, sir?
L552332 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ Perfect.  Thank you, Major.  And now let's drink a toast.
L552331 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ That about right?
L552330 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ Just a squirt.
L552329 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ How much soda, sir.
L552328 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ You're damned right they are.
L552327 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ I suppose they are, sir.
L552326 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ We've come a long way since World War II, Major.  And the lessons we've learned are all in Plan-R.
L552325 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ I know that, sir.
L552324 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ Don't fret about it, Major.  There's nothing anyone can do about it now.  I'm the only one who knows the three-letter code group for the CRM-114.
L552323 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ Perhaps, Major.  Perhaps.  Pour me a scotch and soda, please.  And help yourself to whatever you like.
L552322 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ But -- why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir.
L552321 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ Suppose that were the case?
L552319 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ Because I thought it proper, Major.  Why else would you think I'd do it?
L552318 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ But then, sir, why have you issued the order: Wing attack, Plan-R?
L552317 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ And if that were true?
L552316 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Well, I was thinking, maybe an enemy attack is not in progress?
L552315 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ That's a good question, Major.  Maybe if you think hard, you can think of the answer yourself.
L552314 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Well, sir, I was thinking, if an enemy attack is in progress, how come the radio's still playing music?  It's supposed to go off, and all we should hear are Civil Defense broadcasts.
L552313 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ You know the regulations well, Major.
L552312 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ And a condition red means enemy attack in progress, doesn't it?
L552311 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ That is correct, Major.
L552310 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Well, General Ripper, sir -- I was thinking -- we're on a condition red, aren't we?
L552309 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ Certainly, Major Mandrake.  You're a good officer, and you can ask me a question any time you want to.
L552308 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Yes, sir.  General, can I ask a question?
L552307 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ I didn't mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either, Major.
L552306 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Oh, it's not my radio, sir.  I picked it up in the communications center.
L552305 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ I see you're playing your radio, Major. Isn't that contrary to my instructions for the personnel of this base?
L552304 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ That's right, Major.
L552303 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ Sort of like a new hobby, huh, General?
L552302 +++$+++ u7920 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL RIPPER +++$+++ Please don't take any notice of this weapon, Major.  I love all weapons, and as of late, I've just taken to keeping a loaded weapon nearby at all times.
L552301 +++$+++ u7927 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR MANDRAKE +++$+++ What's the gun for, General Ripper?
L552938 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ Zlat, make sure the secret service boys care- fully search his seven body orifices.
L552937 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ You've lied to me twice - I'm sorry, but it will be strictly routine.  These men are experts.
L552750 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ Well, sir, if the A/C's a really good man, I mean really sharp, why he can barrel that plane along so low - well you just have to see it some time.  A real big plane, like a Sting Ray, zig-zagging in, its jet exhaust frying chickens in the barnyard ---  Has he a chance?.....Hell, yes!  He has one hell of a chance.
L552749 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ General, stick to the point, please.
L552748 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ If I can speak freely, sir -- look, these guys talk big, but frankly, we think they're short of know-how.  You can't just take a bunch of ignorant peasants and expect them to understand a machine like one of our boys, and I don't mean that as an insult, Mister Ambassador.  Hell, we all know what kind of guts your people have.  Why just look how many millions of 'em those Nazis  killed and, hell, they still wouldn't quit.
L552747 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ Is there any chance a single aircraft can penetrate the entire enemy Air Defense, when its course and target are known?
L552746 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ Well, the Premier doped it out pretty well. Its primary is their missile base at Laputa.
L552745 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ What's the target.
L552744 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ Yes, sir.  We're still sending it.  But it's a funny thing we don't seem to be able to make any contact with the aircraft at all.
L552743 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ Have you tried the recall again?
L552742 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ Well, sir, it looks like one aircraft, the "Leper Colony", failed to receive the recall.
L552741 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ Yes?
L552725 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ Well, just common sense, sir.  Thirty from thirty-four equals four, or my name's not "Buck" Schmuck!
L552724 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ How do you know they were shot down, Buck?
L552723 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ Hello, are you still there?...Uh-huh...I'll be right back.  We're still working this thing out.
L552722 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ Mister President, there were thirty-four aircraft involved.  Thirty acknowledged the recall.  That makes four shot down.
L552721 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ Look, he's there, and you're here.
L552720 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ Well, if you choose to take his word over mine ---
L552719 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ He says they've only shot down three planes.
L552718 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ Naturally I am, sir.
L552717 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ General Schmuck, are you positive of your figures?
L552675 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ General Faceman, what was the name of the officer who called me from Burpelson?
L552674 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ I'm not certain, Mister President.  But I believe it was four.
L552673 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ How many planes did we lose?
L552672 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ I believe it will be just a few minutes, at the most.
L552670 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ I'm not certain, Mister President.  The boys in CONCOM do the pencil work.
L552669 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ How long will it take to receive them all?
L552668 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ They're coming in now.
L552667 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ Have you received acknowledgements from every plane?
L552532 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ Knock it off will you, General?  Crudley, find out what's holding up that call!
L552531 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ We don't operate like you KGB boys.
L552421 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ That's the idea, General Schmuck.  Zlat!
L552420 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ But he'll hear everything we're saying.  And if he just looks out of that window, he'll see everything we're doing. 
L552409 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ Admiral Buldike?
L552408 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ I don't think that's a fair analogy, sir.
L552255 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ But we can't communicate with the base.
L552254 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ I want to talk to General Ripper.
L552253 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ General Jack D. Ripper, sir.
L552247 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ I should say practically none, though we have our communications center plowing through every possible three-letter combination. The trouble is that there are about seventeen thousand permutations, and it will take us approximately four and a half days to go through them all.
L552246 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ Then there's no chance for recall?
L552245 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ Mister President, I know you think I've let you down, but we had to have a Plan-R.  If we completely centralized the command and control, all a potential aggressor would have to worry about was knock- ing out maybe half a dozen headquarters and the Capitol, and we'd be out of business. We'd have planes and missiles just sitting there while we were getting clobbered.
L552244 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ How could you let this happen, General Schmuck?
L552243 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ We estimate the planes should be entering their coastal radar cover in about twenty-five min- utes.
L552242 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ How soon until the enemy finds out what's going on?
L552241 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ Mister President, to guard against espionage, the three letter of the code group for Plan-R are always selected by the lower echelon commander himself, just before each mission.  They are sealed in the various attack plans and are known only to the lower echelon commander and his deputy.  In this case the deputy is air-borne with the Wing, and General Ripper refuses to recall the planes.
L552240 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ And I suppose you're going to tell me you don't know what the three-letter code is.
L552239 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ Once the orders have been given, Plan-R requires any new orders to be received on the CRM-114 in the aircraft.  But the CRM-114 will not receive any transmissions unless they are preceded by the proper three-letter code group.
L552238 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ Why can't you cancel it?
L552237 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ Well, sir, Plan-R is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack.
L552236 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ What the hell is Plan-R?
L552235 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ Yes, sir.  The base commander, General Ripper, selected Plan-R?
L552234 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ And I suppose there's some reason why you haven't recalled them?
L552233 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ That's right, sir.  But the planes were at their Positive Control points, ready to turn around when General Ripper issued the final Go-code.
L552232 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ Well, what about the Positive Control, the safety catch?  Don't the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order?
L552231 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ I'm afraid so, Mister Presient. Being part of the air-borne alert, each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece.
L552230 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ I presume the planes are armed?
L552229 +++$+++ u7921 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ GENERAL SCHMUCK +++$+++ It was a honest mistake, sir.
L552553 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Can't help it.  What's the wind like?
L552552 +++$+++ u7922 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. BALLMUFF +++$+++ You know what that'll do to our fuel consumption.
L552551 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Give me revs for maximum speed at sea level.
L552550 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ All right...we're still flying.  I'm taking her down to the deck.
L552478 +++$+++ u7922 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. BALLMUFF +++$+++ I don't think so.
L552477 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
L552476 +++$+++ u7922 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. BALLMUFF +++$+++ We should be crossing the coast in about six minutes.
L552283 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Lothar, take your checks now.
L552282 +++$+++ u7922 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. BALLMUFF +++$+++ Roger, maintain.
L552172 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Roger. One-three-eight.
L552171 +++$+++ u7922 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. BALLMUFF +++$+++ I've got the heading, Major.  One-three-eight.
L552167 +++$+++ u7922 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. BALLMUFF +++$+++ Roughly, one-zero-five. I'll have it plotted in a minute, Major Kong.
L552166 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Give me a first rough course as soon as you can, Lieutenant Ballmuff.
L552146 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ No, they wouldn't send us in with bombs on an exercise.
L552145 +++$+++ u7922 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. BALLMUFF +++$+++ Yeah, to see if we're on our toes.
L552498 +++$+++ u7923 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. QUIFFER +++$+++ Fifteen!  Twelve o' clock.
L552497 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ Maximum ECM.
L552161 +++$+++ u7923 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. QUIFFER +++$+++ The dirty, stinking, rotten, sons of B's!! They might have clobbered Marge and the
L552160 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ He's right.  They must have clobbered some of our cities already.
L552159 +++$+++ u7923 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. QUIFFER +++$+++ They must have clobbered some of our cities already!
L552158 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ He's right.  We wouldn't have started it.
L552144 +++$+++ u7923 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. QUIFFER +++$+++ Maybe it's an exercise.
L552143 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ What else could it be?
L552871 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Sure, I'll take her up right now.
L552870 +++$+++ u7923 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. QUIFFER +++$+++ Could you take her up right now, King?  Other- wise we'll get kind of close to the fireball.
L552869 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Sure, I'll take her up to eight hundred.
L552868 +++$+++ u7923 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. QUIFFER +++$+++ Well, listen, King.  Could you take her up to about eight hundred?  That'll help you come in at a nice down-angle, and it'll give us a chance for our chutes to open.
L552759 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Hey, Terry, I'm hit.
L552758 +++$+++ u7923 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. QUIFFER +++$+++ Sorry, King.  My leg's stiff as a board.
L552754 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Hang on, boys.
L552753 +++$+++ u7923 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. QUIFFER +++$+++ I think they mean business.
L552752 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ If they come down low enough to make a firing pass, they'll never be able to pull up in time.
L552739 +++$+++ u7923 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. QUIFFER +++$+++ They're moving apart.
L552738 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ They can't touch us at this height.
L552737 +++$+++ u7923 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. QUIFFER +++$+++ Must be Mach two-five stuff.  Altitude fifteen thousand.
L552736 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ They must have made a visual contact.
L552735 +++$+++ u7923 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. QUIFFER +++$+++ Fighters closing fast - range fifty miles.
L552734 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Roger.
L552711 +++$+++ u7923 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. QUIFFER +++$+++ Look, can't someone help me?
L552710 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Lieutenant Quiffer, we're all sorry you were hit, and we'll help you stick it together as soon as we get squared away.
L552709 +++$+++ u7923 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. QUIFFER +++$+++ Look, I'm shot - it hurts.
L552708 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Come on, Quentin, isn't that pretty selfish, putting yourself ahead of the mission?
L552707 +++$+++ u7923 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. QUIFFER +++$+++ Why can't he help me now?  He's sitting two feet away from me!
L552704 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Lieutenant Toejam, why don't you help him?
L552703 +++$+++ u7923 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. QUIFFER +++$+++ Yeah, I got it in the thigh.
L552555 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ We'll worry about that later.  Okay, I'll take damage reports.
L552554 +++$+++ u7923 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. QUIFFER +++$+++ Shouldn't be bad.  Might even help.  But my guess is we're going to have to paddle our way back.
L552496 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Maximum ECM!
L552495 +++$+++ u7923 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. QUIFFER +++$+++ Twenty!  Twelve o' clock.
