L56602 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
L56601 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ It seems the tables have turned again, Dr. Evil.
L56597 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Really, there's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster.
L56596 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.
L56595 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.
L56594 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  It's freedom, man.
L56593 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.
L56592 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ I've got you, Dr. Evil!
L56483 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma.  All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism.
L56482 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?
L56453 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Oh forget it. As a fellow player on the international stage, Mr.  Powers, I'm sure you'll enjoy watching the curtain fall on the third and final act.
L56452 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ I'm sorry, baby, I'm just not grocking your head space.
L56451 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Don't try to suck up to me! It's a little late for that. I'm a freak! Look at it, it's been rendered useless.
L56450 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ What's wrong with your hand?
L56621 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Behave!
L56620 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Kiss me.
L56619 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.
L56618 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I love you, Austin.
L56617 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Lay it on me.
L56616 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I have something to tell you.
L56572 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I'll secure the perimeter.
L56571 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.
L56570 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Austin, I'm coming with you.
L56568 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Don't worry!
L56567 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Are you crazy?
L56566 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Follow me! We're going to have to jump over the rail!
L56562 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Hold on a tick, let me put on my togs.
L56561 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I believe you, Austin. Let's go.
L56560 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they... and I...
L56559 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Likewise.
L56558 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ It's not what it looks like, Vanessa.  At ease, boys.
L56539 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Oh, behave!
L56538 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.
L56537 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Austin, what's your point?
L56536 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I just want you to know that I feel bad about shagging that Italian girl. I had a sip of sake and all of the sudden, I don't know what happened. The whole time I was shagging her-- I mean really shagging her, I mean it was crazy, I was like a huge mechanical piston, in and out, IN and OUT!--
L56535 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I'll hurry back.
L56534 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.
L56533 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
L56532 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag.  You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.
L56531 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ What do we do now?
L56518 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Fair enough.
L56517 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Shut up.
L56516 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.
L56515 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Yes.
L56514 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ That's not the way to get ahead in life.
L56513 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Indeed.
L56512 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Not a good time to lose one's head.
L56507 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Smashing idea! Give it to me.
L56506 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.
L56505 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ All right, I get it. I have bad teeth. You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
L56504 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Sadly, no. Hold on! I always keep this on me just in case.
L56503 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ First, I plan to soil myself. Then, I plan to regroup and think about the next move. Any thoughts?
L56456 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Not now, Austin.
L56455 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Does that make you horny?
L56438 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa.
L56437 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Thank God, Austin, we made it.
L56405 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Don't worry, baby. I picked up a mind control technique during my travels to India. I learned it from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis.  Just watch me. Watch me, now.
L56404 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges.
L56399 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I'm looking at you, and the whole time I can't help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie-kooch.
L56398 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy.
L56397 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ You know who.
L56396 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Who?
L56395 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Do you think she's prettier than I?
L56394 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a rancid taste in my mouth. Do you have a piece of gum?
L56360 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I'll tell him. By the way, I've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional.
L56359 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Out and about, doing odds and sods.
L56358 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.
L56357 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't see that one coming.
L56356 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.
L56355 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Hello, luv.
L56354 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ You just don't get it, do you, Austin? Good night. Welcome to the Nineties, you're going to be very lonely.
L56353 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.
L56352 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.
L56351 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.
L56350 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Not in the Nineties.
L56349 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Only sailors use condoms, man.
L56348 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ No, did you use a condom?
L56347 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
L56346 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
L56345 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.
L56344 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.
L56343 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Of course, luv.
L56342 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Austin, may I have a word with you?
L56335 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Look at her hands, baby! Those are carpenter's hands.
L56334 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Really, Austin!
L56228 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ She was very groovy. She was so in love with your Dad. If there was one other cat in this world that could have loved your Mum and treated her as well as you Dad did, it was me. But, unfortunately for yours truly, that train has sailed.
L56227 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about.  What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know.
L56226 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ I can't. You're drunk.
L56225 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver.
L56224 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Oh, yes you are.
L56223 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I am not.
L56222 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ You're smashed, Vanessa.
L56220 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ No, this is me in a nutshell.
L56219 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell.
L56218 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.
L56217 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Why?
L56216 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L56215 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I haven't had fun like that since college.
L56210 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Go! Just go!
L56209 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Sorry. Move your hand to the left. There you go. Gorgeous.
L56208 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Watch out, you're on my hair!
L56207 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I couldn't have another bite.
L56206 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Fancy a nibble?
L56198 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa.
L56197 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I hate having my picture taken.
L56195 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ No worries, luv. We'll just give Basil a tinkle on the telling bone...
L56194 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
L56193 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Well, you know... cows, and shagging.
L56192 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I don't get it.
L56191 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Let me tell you a story. There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'
L56190 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ We can't just sit here, Austin.
L56189 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ He's too well-protected right now.
L56188 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Let's go get him!
L56187 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ I never forget a pussy... cat.
L56186 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ How do you know?
L56185 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat.
L56184 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Let me see.
L56183 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ A limousine has just pulled up.
L56182 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ We've got a doctor's appointment-- an evil doctor's appointment.
L56181 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Why?
L56180 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear.
L56176 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Do you want to talk to him?
L56175 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with?
L56142 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ That cat Number Two has an X-ray eyepatch. I get bad vibes from him, man. Listen, we should go back to the room, but first I have to go to the naughty chair and see a man about a dog.
L56141 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Why did you leave so soon?
L56126 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Oh, I forgot to tell you, they're prescription X-ray glasses. I have very bad astigmatism.
L56125 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ I can't see a bloody thing.
L56112 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ I'm going to use a cover name. It's important that it be a generic name so that we don't draw attention to ourselves.
L56111 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Here, use mine.
L56110 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses.
L56107 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ I think I'll give that stew a ding-a- ling.
L56106 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I'm sure.
L56105 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Hey, who put this in here? Someone's playing a prank on me!  Honestly, this isn't mine.
L56098 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Why? What's wrong with my teeth?
L56097 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.
L56096 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Let me guess. The floss is garotte wire, the toothpaste contains plastic explosives, and the toothbrush is the detonation device.
L56095 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone, an on-board computer, and a Global Geosynchronous Positioning Device. Oh, and finally, this.
L56094 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ You've preserved my Jag! Smashing!
L56029 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I understand that, Mr. Powers, but let me be perfectly clear with you, perhaps to the point of being insulting. I will never have sex with you, ever.  If you were the last man on Earth and I was the last woman on Earth, and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation, I still would not have sex with you.
L56028 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.
L56027 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.
L56026 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
L56025 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ What?
L56024 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Do I make you horny?
L56023 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Sure.
L56022 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!  They're shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest.
L56014 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ That's right. You're supposed to say 'colored' now, right?  Here's the stewardesses! Bring on the sexy stews!
L56013 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
L56012 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.
L56011 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ A Chigro?
L56010 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Have you ever made love to a Chigro?
L56009 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.
L56008 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ My meat and two veg.
L56007 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I'm sorry?
L56006 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ My wedding tackle.
L56005 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Excuse me?
L56004 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.
L56003 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I beg your pardon?
L56002 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?
L56001 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
L56000 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?
L55999 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ My jumbo jet? Smashing baby.
L55998 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.
L55997 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ OK, OK, man, don't get heavy, I'll sign. Just to get things moving, baby.
L55978 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ My mother's doing quite well, thank you very much.
L55977 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?
L55976 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ My mother's told me all about you.
L55975 +++$+++ u362 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ AUSTIN +++$+++ Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.
L55974 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967.
