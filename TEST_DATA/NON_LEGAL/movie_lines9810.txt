L204468 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us <u>worse</u>, maybe even kill us.
L204467 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Same old Reed.  All analysis, no action.  Wasn't that the problem with you two?
L204466 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ He's working round the clock.  But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
L204464 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Susan.  What are you doing?
L204463 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Victor, wait, slow down a second.  I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
L204462 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ It is.  There's something we need to talk about.  Something I need to ask you...
L204461 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ You said it was urgent.
L204326 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Please, no apologies.  I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos.  You'll have round-the clock care.
L204325 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
L204324 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I told you, I'm fine.  It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
L204323 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Victor, your scar --
L204214 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Just <u>find</u> him.
L204213 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Victor, I'm sorry I --
L204207 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Victor, are you feeling alright?
L204206 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ What's going on?
L204070 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ You can't leave them out there.
L204069 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Raising the shields.
L204068 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ What are you doing?
L204050 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps.  And this is the biggest step yet.  If it helps, think of this as a <u>promotion</u>.  A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
L204049 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
L204048 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
L204047 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
L204042 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Well, when you're looking at your future, it never hurts to find closure about the past.
L204041 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ I understand the <i>business</i> reasons.
L204040 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
L203936 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
L203935 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ It's just business.
L204641 +++$+++ u5219 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ THE THING +++$+++ Skeptical...?
L204640 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
L204639 +++$+++ u5219 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ THE THING +++$+++ Reed's gonna fix me up --
L204638 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love.  To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.
L204637 +++$+++ u5219 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ THE THING +++$+++ If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
L204636 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I know it can't be easy.  Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny.  At least they can go out in public.  But for you?  People staring. Whispering behind your back...
L204635 +++$+++ u5219 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ THE THING +++$+++ 'Scuse me.
L205491 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Well, how about hypnosis? That can't hurt him!
L205490 +++$+++ u5230 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ REID +++$+++ I'd hold that off awhile.
L205489 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Now how soon can we try Sodium Pentathol?
L205464 +++$+++ u5230 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ REID +++$+++ Along the Optic Nerve to the Eye.
L205463 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ If I were in their place and I'd run out of time, I'd abandon the ship before I grew to dangerous size... and use the few extra minutes to get out the quickest way possible, on my own...
L205462 +++$+++ u5230 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ REID +++$+++ What're you getting at?
L205461 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ That blip we're picking up might only be the radio-active particle. The Proteus may already be destroyed...
L205460 +++$+++ u5230 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ REID +++$+++ What is it?
L205432 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ It means killing Benes...  And for all we know, they may have completed the operation!  Damn it to hell!
L205431 +++$+++ u5230 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ REID +++$+++ Time's up... We'll have to take them out immediately.
L205197 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I can't help it. I'm just weak, I guess.
L205196 +++$+++ u5230 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ REID +++$+++ I told you to cut down on the sugar.
L205194 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Let's find what the devil's holding them up!  Contact the Proteus!
L205193 +++$+++ u5230 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ REID +++$+++ It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
L205192 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Another delay... With only forty-two minutes left.
L205133 +++$+++ u5230 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ REID +++$+++ They'll make up some time, once they get through that and reach the Pleural Cavity.  Respiration Post...
L205132 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ They're in the Pulmonary Artery.
L205102 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Message to Proteus.
L205101 +++$+++ u5230 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ REID +++$+++ <Cardiac Red Alert> we're stopping the Heart.
L205098 +++$+++ u5230 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ REID +++$+++ Nothing -- compared to starting it up again.
L205097 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ What are the problems in stopping the Heart?
L205096 +++$+++ u5230 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ REID +++$+++ That would give us only three seconds to revive him...
L205095 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ At topspeed...and adjusting distance for Degree of Miniaturization --  The sub should get through the Heart in fifty-seven seconds.
L205094 +++$+++ u5230 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ REID +++$+++ In his comatose state...and everything slowed down...no more than sixty seconds.
L205093 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I know that. But what's the maximum?
L205092 +++$+++ u5230 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ REID +++$+++ The less time, the better.
L205091 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Doctor...without killing him -- how long could we stop his heart?
L205088 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Not until the very last second. We must think of something... Something to save the situation.
L205087 +++$+++ u5230 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ REID +++$+++ But it's hopeless! They can't go back and they can't go on. I tell you there's nothing else we can do but remove them!
L205086 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ We still have fifty-one minutes. Leave them in.
L205085 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ No...
L205084 +++$+++ u5230 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ REID +++$+++ But we have no choice! We've got, to take them out!
L205064 +++$+++ u5230 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ REID +++$+++ Normally not. Unless it's an Arterio-Venous Fistula --
L205063 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ That can't be -- there's no direct connection between the two --
L205062 +++$+++ u5230 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ REID +++$+++ They've crossed over into the Jugular Vein!
L205013 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Phase Two.
L205012 +++$+++ u5230 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ REID +++$+++ Okay to proceed.
L204949 +++$+++ u5230 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ REID +++$+++ Medical's ready.
L204948 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Where do we stand?
L204931 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ We understand your concern, but we've made our decision, Doctor. Any questions? Anybody?
L204930 +++$+++ u5230 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ REID +++$+++ Benes' natural defenses. White Corpuscles -- Antibodies. Once you begin to grow -- and become a menace to the body -- you'll trigger them off... MICHAELS With all the unknown factors in the body, I still say risking five lives for one is something we should reconsider --
L204908 +++$+++ u5230 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ REID +++$+++ Here's the overall Target Area...
L204907 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Grant's uniquely qualified for this mission. He's a Communications Expert and was a Frogman during the War. Besides, he brought Benes into this country, and the fewer people who know about him, the better. At any rate, you'll find Grant invaluable, should anything go wrong once you're under way.  Okay, Don.
L205487 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Why don't you go on. We'll meet you at the Clearance Desk in a few minutes.
L205486 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Yes, we'd like to get moving.
L205479 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ He's blanked out on that one particular point.
L205478 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Can't remember?... What do you mean?
L205477 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Oh yes, great. The only problem is, he can't remember what he came to tell us.
L204934 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Where can I get a cab back to town?
L204933 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Yes?
L204932 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Just one, General...
L204929 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Attack? Who -- or should I say what from?
L204928 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ There'll be a team of Surgeons standing by. We're prepared to remove you immediately, should anything go wrong. In any event, you must be out within sixty minutes. After that, you'll be in danger of attack.
L204900 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Oh yes, I've heard of you, Doctor.
L204899 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ This is Dr. Duval, our Head Surgeon.
L204889 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Not even for a minute! General Carter, sir, I'd like you to reconsider your choice. I'm just not the right man for a mission of this kind.
L204888 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ It's only for an hour --
L204887 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ But I don't want to be Miniaturized -- !
L204886 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.
L204885 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Wait a minute! They can't shrink <me>!
L204884 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ As part of the Crew.
L204883 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ You mean <I'm> going along?
L204882 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Well, the only way to reach that clot is from inside the Brain. So we've decided to put a Surgical Team and a Crew into a submarine -- reduce it way down in size, and inject it into an Artery --
L204881 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Trip? Where to?
L204880 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ And take a little trip with them...
L204879 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ They're bound to try again. No wonder they want me to stand by during the operation.
L204878 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ That's right. He wanted us to have the secret, and not them. Which is why they tried to kill him.
L204877 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ I assume Benes knows how to control it.
L204876 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ They have...  But we've both got the same problem -- lack or control. We can only keep things Miniaturized for exactly sixty minutes. Arter that, everything starts growing back to its original size.
L204875 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ If the Other Side ever gets hold of a thing like that...
L204874 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ We can shrink an Army -- with all its equipment -- and put it in a bottle cap. That's why we call it <Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
L204873 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ General, I've heard some wild ones. But this takes it.
L204870 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Say that again?
L204869 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ <Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
L204868 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ I don't mean to be inquisitive. But this <CMDF> -- for all I know it could stand for <Consolidated Mobilization of Female Delinquents>?
L204867 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ No question of her loyalty.
L204866 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ His technician okay? In addition to the Looks Department?
L204864 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Come along, they'll be operating shortly.  See you later, Mike.
L204863 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Right, sir.
L204860 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ I wouldn't know if he's trying to save him or kill him.
L204859 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ We have no choice. Duval's the most skillful brain surgeon in the country, and he's right here, at hand.
L204858 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ But why take the chance, when there must be other doctors?
L204849 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Tell him where he fits in, will you? I've got a few things to check out.
L204848 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Wish I knew why.
L204843 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ What can I do? Except maybe pass out?
L204842 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --
L204841 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Sorry, but I'm rusty on surgeons. Who's the girl?
L204840 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Duval. Dr. Peter Duval. Top brain man in the country. Ever hear of him?
L204839 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Here's the Surgeon.
L204838 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ I can't even put a Band-Aid on my finger.
L204836 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ <Me>?
L204835 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ -- and why we need you.
L204834 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Before he could breathe a word. He's the only scientist who knows the answer to what we're after. That's why we have to operate --
L204833 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Before or after what he wanted to tell you?
L204832 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Brain injury.
L204831 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ How bad off is he?
L204830 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ The Other Side got to him.
L204829 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Benes... What the devil happened?
L204828 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ The Pentagon, wasn't it, General? Only you weren't in that uniform...
L204827 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Hello, Grant. Good to see you again.
L204862 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ And no matter what happens, you're to take orders <only> from Dr. Michaels, understand?
L204861 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ I'll be standing by. <I'll> know.
L204857 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ That's no reason to suspect him of disloyalty.
L204856 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Difficult? He's impossible!
L204855 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ I don't agree. Just because he's often difficult --
L204854 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ [LINE OF DIALOGUE CUT OFF]
L204847 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ Glad to have you with us, Mr. Grant.
L204846 +++$+++ u5221 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels, Chief of the Medical Section.
L204845 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ Yes, Alan.
L205305 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ Yes, there's no time to spare. And those fibers can be quite tenacious.
L205304 +++$+++ u5222 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ Wouldn't it be quicker if we all helped?
L205298 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ No danger of attack, as long as you don't trigger them off by any injury to the System.
L205297 +++$+++ u5222 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ You're going out there? With those Antibodies --
L205228 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ With no laser --
L205227 +++$+++ u5222 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ We must!
L205226 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ That's beside the point now.  I don't see the sense of going on.
L205219 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ We'll know -- in the next breath...
L205218 +++$+++ u5222 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ But we just can't leave him in there! What'll happen to him?
L205189 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ It must have been jarred loose during the whirlpool.
L205188 +++$+++ u5222 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ I can't imagine how it possibly could have come loose. I distinctly recall fastening it with all four bolts --
L205115 +++$+++ u5226 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ MICHAELS +++$+++ Yes...slowed down agreat deal.
L205114 +++$+++ u5222 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ Listen...the Heart.
L205475 +++$+++ u5222 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ He certainly is. He should be up and about in no time.
L205474 +++$+++ u5223 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ DUVAL +++$+++ He's making a fine recovery.
L205186 +++$+++ u5222 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ I don't know yet, Doctor. And I won't know until I test it.
L205185 +++$+++ u5223 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ DUVAL +++$+++ Cora, is something wrong with the laser?
L205161 +++$+++ u5223 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ DUVAL +++$+++ No danger of an embolism. At our reduced scale, they're much too minute to prove fatal to Benes.
L205160 +++$+++ u5222 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ Air bubbles!... Doctor --
L205080 +++$+++ u5223 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ DUVAL +++$+++ Dr. Michaels is right. We have no choice.
L205079 +++$+++ u5222 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ Doctor...you can't mean that! Not when we've come this far. And if we give up, there'll be no way of saving Mr. Benes --
L205068 +++$+++ u5222 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ But big enough for us...
L205067 +++$+++ u5223 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ DUVAL +++$+++ Yes, a fistula too small to show up on the X-rays.
L205046 +++$+++ u5222 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ They're much smaller than bacteria...
L205045 +++$+++ u5223 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ DUVAL +++$+++ Never saw <that>. Not even under an electron-mrcroscope.
L205003 +++$+++ u5223 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ DUVAL +++$+++ Thank you for volunteering.
L205002 +++$+++ u5222 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ I just wanted to thank you for taking me along.
L205001 +++$+++ u5223 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ DUVAL +++$+++ What is it?  Anything wrong?
L205000 +++$+++ u5222 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ I -- I want to say...
L204999 +++$+++ u5223 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ DUVAL +++$+++ Yes, Cora.
L204998 +++$+++ u5222 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ Doctor...
L205425 +++$+++ u5222 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ Look! They follow the direction of her glance, are startled to see:
L205424 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ We better get back to the sub. Every second counts now.
L205356 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Well, if you happen to be very fond of him -- even in love with him -- it would certainly affect your point of view.
L205355 +++$+++ u5222 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ What do you mean?
L205354 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Depends on which end of the telescope you look through.
L205353 +++$+++ u5222 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.
L205352 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Under a cloud without cause, I take it.
L205351 +++$+++ u5222 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ You're not the first, but he's much too innocent, much too involved with his work, to realize what's going on around him.
L205350 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ As obvious as that? Our Security people will jump for joy.  I suppose Duval's onto me, too?
L205349 +++$+++ u5222 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ That's why you're really here. I knew it from the start.
L205348 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ What gives you that idea?
L205347 +++$+++ u5222 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...
L205346 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Such as?
L205345 +++$+++ u5222 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ A great deal more than that, I believe...
L205344 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ That's what they pay me for.
L205343 +++$+++ u5222 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ Thank you for saving my life.
L205341 +++$+++ u5222 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ I feel much better now...
L205340 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ No need to get up --
L205323 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ I can't till the hatch is flooded!
L205322 +++$+++ u5222 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ Open it! Open it before they get here!
L205235 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ I've got a source. All I have to do is tap it.
L205234 +++$+++ u5222 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ Oh yes, I'm sure Dr. Duval could. If we had the parts.
L205233 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ A surgeon might...
L205232 +++$+++ u5222 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ No, it requires such absolute precision --
L205231 +++$+++ u5224 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ If you had a transistor about this size and power output, and a thin enough wire --  -- could you piece it together?
L205225 +++$+++ u5222 +++$+++ m346 +++$+++ CORA +++$+++ Not anything built into the chassis.  If it hadn't come loose --
