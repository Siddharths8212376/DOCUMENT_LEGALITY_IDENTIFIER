L550641 +++$+++ u7893 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ I think Scooby's like a lot of kids. He just hit a…a speed bump. Now he's gonna find his way, his path is gonna be cleared, and I think he's gonna continue his education at a good college. And everybody else is gonna be happy.
L550610 +++$+++ u7893 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ I have a cousin. Very big giver to the alumni fund.
L550609 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ But what kind of pull did you have?
L550408 +++$+++ u7893 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Yeah...How do we know we won't be exploited?
L550407 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Oh, I know, I know that. Well, sharing your story, your ups and downs, and so forth, can I hope, be an illuminating experience.
L550402 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ 'Cause Scooby does have a quality that I've been looking for, a quality that is emblematic of American today. It's part disillusionment, part hope...
L550401 +++$+++ u7893 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Reconceive.
L550395 +++$+++ u7893 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Oh, well, I don't have them yet, but –
L550394 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.
L550393 +++$+++ u7893 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ And you want Scooby to be the focus of all this?
L550392 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ You're absolutely right. The focus is on the college admissions process today.
L550391 +++$+++ u7893 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Which is it? You gotta keep your focus straight.
L550443 +++$+++ u7893 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Tired of this shit...
L550442 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ OK.
L550441 +++$+++ u7893 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Don't screw around with me. You know what I'm talking about.  You're taking those SATs. You're taking those SATs or your CD collection is history. You're taking those SATs and you're going to college. You're taking those SATs if I have to strap your ass to a chair, but buddy your taking them.
L550440 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ Whaddya wanna talk about?
L550439 +++$+++ u7893 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ We have to talk.
L550438 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ Yeah?
L550437 +++$+++ u7893 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Scooby?
L550367 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ Man, it's just, like, conversation.
L550366 +++$+++ u7893 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Get the hell outta here!
L550348 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ Just the same.
L550347 +++$+++ u7893 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ The same. Same as what?
L550346 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ The same.
L550345 +++$+++ u7893 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ So? How was school today?
L550325 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ Dad, I'm trying to figure things out right now, OK? It's like, really hard, and I'm just listening to some old Elton John and...
L550324 +++$+++ u7893 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ What DO you know?
L550318 +++$+++ u7893 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Whaddya mean you don't know? You either got a lot or you don't. What's not to know?
L550317 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ I dunno.
L550311 +++$+++ u7893 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ I'm going in there.
L550310 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ Fuck!
L550627 +++$+++ u7894 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ Sure, Dad.
L550626 +++$+++ u7893 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Yeah, uh, listen. Why don't you go upstairs and keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit? I need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment.
L550625 +++$+++ u7894 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ Gee, you're home early!
L550624 +++$+++ u7893 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Come here, give me a hug!
L550623 +++$+++ u7894 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ Hi, Dad!
L550622 +++$+++ u7893 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Hey, Mikey!
L550601 +++$+++ u7894 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ OK!
L550600 +++$+++ u7893 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Hey, Mikey. You wanna get some ice cream?
L550595 +++$+++ u7894 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ OK. Stay there. I'll be right back.
L550594 +++$+++ u7893 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.
L550593 +++$+++ u7894 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ You're welcome.  Dad?…Would you let me try hypnotizing you now?
L550592 +++$+++ u7893 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Thanks.
L550591 +++$+++ u7894 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ I don't think there's any hope, either. I was just trying to make you feel better.
L550590 +++$+++ u7893 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Mikey, there's optimism, and then there's stupidity. It's a very fine line.
L550589 +++$+++ u7894 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ Maybe he's that one in a million!
L550588 +++$+++ u7893 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ One in a million recover.
L550587 +++$+++ u7894 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ Dad?…Do you think that Brady will ever get better?
L550331 +++$+++ u7893 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Yeah, well, Mikey, listen up. Cause here's a lesson: life's not fair.
L550330 +++$+++ u7894 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ Mom, it's not fair if Brady can say the f-word and I can't.
L550307 +++$+++ u7894 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ Maybe he's building a bomb...just like-!
L550306 +++$+++ u7893 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ I just want to know what the hell he's doing in his room that's so interesting he doesn't come down for dinner.
L550201 +++$+++ u7901 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ VI +++$+++ NIGGER, FUCK ME HARD!!!...
L550200 +++$+++ u7895 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MR SCOTT +++$+++ Again!!

L550187 +++$+++ u7901 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ VI +++$+++ Oh, bu...uh...I can't say that.
L550183 +++$+++ u7895 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MR SCOTT +++$+++ Take off your top.
L550182 +++$+++ u7901 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ VI +++$+++ It's a really nice place you have. Is the rent high?
L550180 +++$+++ u7901 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ VI +++$+++ Thanks.
L550179 +++$+++ u7895 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MR SCOTT +++$+++ It's over there.
L550176 +++$+++ u7901 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ VI +++$+++ Thank you for being honest.
L550175 +++$+++ u7895 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MR SCOTT +++$+++ No.
L550174 +++$+++ u7901 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ VI +++$+++ Oh.  Do you think I have a potential as a writer?
L550173 +++$+++ u7895 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MR SCOTT +++$+++ I'm not 'going out' with Catherine.
L550172 +++$+++ u7901 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ VI +++$+++ Aren't you going out with Catherine?  I'm sorry. It's none of my business. I didn't mean...
L550171 +++$+++ u7895 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MR SCOTT +++$+++ Maybe. She's OK.
L550170 +++$+++ u7901 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ VI +++$+++ Thank you.  So Catherine seems like she might become a really good writer.
L550169 +++$+++ u7895 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MR SCOTT +++$+++ You have beautiful skin.
L550168 +++$+++ u7901 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ VI +++$+++ And I also agreed with what you said today about Marcus's story. It is a piece of shit.
L550167 +++$+++ u7895 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MR SCOTT +++$+++ That's good.
L550166 +++$+++ u7901 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ VI +++$+++ Good.  'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...
L550165 +++$+++ u7895 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MR SCOTT +++$+++ You're not.
L550164 +++$+++ u7901 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ VI +++$+++ Can I join you?
L550163 +++$+++ u7895 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MR SCOTT +++$+++ Uh huh.
L550162 +++$+++ u7901 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ VI +++$+++ Yeah, um, then...are you alone?
L550161 +++$+++ u7895 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MR SCOTT +++$+++ Well, now you have.
L550160 +++$+++ u7901 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ VI +++$+++ I'm sorry. I didn't mean, I just didn't expect to run into you here, that's all.
L550159 +++$+++ u7895 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MR SCOTT +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L550158 +++$+++ u7901 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ VI +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L550157 +++$+++ u7895 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MR SCOTT +++$+++ Hello, Vi.
L550288 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ I dunno. See if I have any connections.
L550287 +++$+++ u7896 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MR. DEMARCO +++$+++ Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
L550286 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman.
L550285 +++$+++ u7896 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MR. DEMARCO +++$+++ C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking.
L550284 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ I dunno...
L550283 +++$+++ u7896 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MR. DEMARCO +++$+++ 'OK.' So you just don't care.  Let me ask you, not as your guidance counselor, but...as a friend: what do you want to do with your life? I mean, what kind of long-term goals can you possibly have?
L550282 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ OK.
L550281 +++$+++ u7896 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MR. DEMARCO +++$+++ All right, Scooby, let's not beat around the bush. With your attitude, you're not going to get in anywhere.
L550280 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ I hate reading.
L550279 +++$+++ u7896 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MR. DEMARCO +++$+++ None at all? How about those 'underground' comics?
L550278 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ No.
L550277 +++$+++ u7896 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MR. DEMARCO +++$+++ Any books you like to read for fun?
L550276 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ No, not really.
L550274 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Maybe she has caller ID.
L550273 +++$+++ u7897 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ PAM +++$+++ OK. Bye.
L550272 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Yeah, sure.
L550271 +++$+++ u7897 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ PAM +++$+++ Listen, Toby, I can't really talk right now. Do you mind if I call you back?
L550270 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Wow, that really is great. In a few years, who knows, maybe they'll want to be in my documentary!
L550269 +++$+++ u7897 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ PAM +++$+++ Eight, six, and four.
L550268 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Great. How old are they?
L550267 +++$+++ u7897 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ PAM +++$+++ Three.
L550266 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ How many?
L550265 +++$+++ u7897 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ PAM +++$+++ Yeah.
L550264 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Huh. Kids?
L550263 +++$+++ u7897 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ PAM +++$+++ Yeah.
L550262 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Yeah...So you're um...you're married?
L550261 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Oh. Tired of 'life in the fast lane'?
L550260 +++$+++ u7897 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ PAM +++$+++ Yeah. But not any more.
L550259 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Yeah...um...so anyway, tell me. What about you? I'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies.
L550258 +++$+++ u7897 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ PAM +++$+++ That's good.
L550257 +++$+++ u7897 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ PAM +++$+++ Hunh.
L550256 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Uh, well, anyway, so I'm looking for subjects for this documentary on teenage life in suburbia. Kind of an exploration of the mental psyche of its mythology. I wrote to Derrida to see if he'd like to do the narration. But everything's still kind of in development at this point.
L550255 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Well, but it was so long ago. We were so different back then...
L550254 +++$+++ u7897 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ PAM +++$+++ I do.
L550253 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Oh, I don't remember that...
L550252 +++$+++ u7897 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ PAM +++$+++ Yeah. You didn't wanna take me to the prom.
L550251 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ N-not yet. I'm hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers. Geez, remember when we were teenagers?
L550250 +++$+++ u7897 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ PAM +++$+++ Oh? Anything I might have seen?
L550249 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ I'm a documentary filmmaker.
L550248 +++$+++ u7897 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ PAM +++$+++ That's good. So then what do you do now?
L550247 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ I worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, I mean, that was like - I mean, I have some dignity.
L550246 +++$+++ u7897 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ PAM +++$+++ That's too bad.
L550245 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Well, um, I kind of let things go on this novel I'd been really into - I mean, the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt. I mean, really, it's finished.
L550244 +++$+++ u7897 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ PAM +++$+++ Anything I might know about?
L550243 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Yeah, well, then it got me writing, so that was a good thing.
L550242 +++$+++ u7897 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ PAM +++$+++ Oh, that's too bad.
L550241 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Yeah, well, it was really all kind of a joke - and a rip-off, so, uh...so I dropped out.
L550240 +++$+++ u7897 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ PAM +++$+++ I believe it.
L550239 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Well, I went to law school, if you can believe that.
L550238 +++$+++ u7897 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ PAM +++$+++ Oh. So what did you do after you gave up on acting?
L550237 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Oh, no, not any more. No, um, I kind of came to terms with myself, I realized I had done what I had to do. And it was time to move on.
L550236 +++$+++ u7897 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ PAM +++$+++ Um, well, yeah.  So are you still acting?
L550235 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ So. Look at where we are: the year 2000! Can you believe it? I mean, did you ever think we would actually make it?
L550234 +++$+++ u7897 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ PAM +++$+++ Yeah.
L550233 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Oh, yeah, well...um...I was just calling because, well, I was wondering if you still remembered me, which I guess you do...
L550232 +++$+++ u7897 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ PAM +++$+++ But...you called.
L550231 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ That's what I was gonna ask you.
L550230 +++$+++ u7897 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ PAM +++$+++ So what's going on?
L550229 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Great!
L550228 +++$+++ u7897 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ PAM +++$+++ Great!
L550227 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Oh, fine. How are you?
L550226 +++$+++ u7897 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ PAM +++$+++ Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?
L550225 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Toby Oxman.
L550224 +++$+++ u7897 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ PAM +++$+++ Who is this?
L550223 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Hello, is this Pam?
L550222 +++$+++ u7897 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ PAM +++$+++ Hello?
L550476 +++$+++ u7899 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ No, thanks.
L550475 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ You want some?
L550471 +++$+++ u7899 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ I mean...
L550470 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ Yeah. I know.
L550469 +++$+++ u7899 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ You know...I like you.
L550468 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ Yeah?
L550467 +++$+++ u7899 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ Scooby?
L550465 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ You should be.
L550464 +++$+++ u7899 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ I Know. I'm sorry. I'm just...a little nervous, I don't know why.
L550463 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ I'm not an idiot, man. I watch TV.
L550462 +++$+++ u7899 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ Scooby, don't! Be careful!
L550461 +++$+++ u7899 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ No, I don't think so...
L550460 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ Is it loaded?
L550459 +++$+++ u7899 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ I know.
L550458 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ Gee, your Dad's smart.
L550457 +++$+++ u7899 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ It's my Dad's He hides it under some old TV Guides in his closet.
L550456 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ How'd you get it?
L550455 +++$+++ u7899 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ Thanks.
L550454 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ Pretty cool, Stanley.
L550657 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ Don't be. Your movie's a hit.
L550656 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Oh, my God, Scooby! I'm so sorry...I'm so, so sorry...
L550651 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ Oh.
L550650 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Yeah. He went to Harward.
L550649 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ He did?
L550648 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Uh, Scooby, now I understand how you want to be a TV talk-show host and all, like Conan O'Brien, but did you know even he went to college?
L550646 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ I dunno. I'd like to be good at something. It doesn't have to be TV. I mean, it could be movies...Anything. I'd be willing to direct.
L550645 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ What is most important to you?
L550620 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ Thanks man.
