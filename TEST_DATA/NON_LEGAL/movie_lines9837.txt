L224495 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ H-hi.
L224494 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ John, say hello to my wife...Julia.
L224490 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You there?
L224489 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Hang on a sec, John.
L224488 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Wow.
L224487 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Well, game five was the big one.  It turned in the bottom of the 6th.  We were down 3-0.  Cleon Jones gets hit on the foot - left a scuff mark on the ball. Clendenon comes up.  The count goes to 2 2.  High fastball.  He nailed it.  Weis slammed a solo shot in the 7th to tie. Jones and Swoboda scored in the 8th.  We won, Pop.
L224486 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Yeah, you betcha.
L224485 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You really wanna know?
L224484 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Hey, what about the Amazin's?  They pull it off?
L224483 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ We're okay...we're good, Dad.
L224482 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What are we like in...1998?
L224481 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Didn't happen, we got enough problems down here.
L224480 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What else, John.  It must be different, huh?  Are people living on the moon?
L224479 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Well they found out cigarettes give you lung cancer.
L224478 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Tell me something good, Chief.  Tell me about the future.
L224477 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ All right, I'm with you.  I just hope we know what the hell we're doing.
L224476 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Coupla days ago they dug up a body in Washington Heights - Mary Finelli.  Girl disappeared in '68.  Turns out she was his first kill.  Which means he probably knew her.  Most serials know their first victim.  I'm gonna do some checking - see if I can put any of this together...
L224475 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ How?
L224474 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Dad, I think I may be able to get you enough information to make sure the DA can nail this bastard.
L224473 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Got it.
L224472 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Sissy Clark, 190 Riverside Dr., apartment 3C.  Tomorrow.  She's a nursing student.  Paying her way as a cocktail waitress at the Peppermint Lounge, on west 63rd.  Left work at two A M...killed in her apartment, between two thirty and five.
L224471 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Whatta we do now?
L224470 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ It's okay.  This is working.  This is gonna work.
L224469 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ No.  I just kept talking to her.  There was a lot of guys in that bar - could'a been any of 'em.
L224468 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Did you see him?  Do you know who he is?
L224467 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I'll be damned.
L224423 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Tell 'em there's a homicide in progress... cause by the time they show up there will be.
L224422 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What do I tell them?
L224421 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ They'll question her.  Whatever they tell her could change what happens.  No, I want you to follow her.  See if anybody's watching her, hittin' on her. I'm betting somebody's gonna walk outta that bar with her.  When they do, you call the cops.
L224420 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Why not just get the cops to watch the bar?
L224417 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Then you get Mom the hell out.  But Dad, those other women weren't supposed to die.  We don't try to stop this guy, we're gonna live with that for the rest of our lives.
L224416 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What if the radio stops working?  Christ, what if I can't reach you again?
L224415 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You ever talk to a victim's family?  The one's left behind?  They don't act like what you'd think.  There's panic and fear.  But mostly, it's like there's this logic problem.  And if they could only solve it, everything would be okay.  But if you look real close - look at their eyes - you can see it.  Just a glimmer.  But somewhere they know.  They know their world is never gonna be the same.
L224414 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I do know.  I'm a cop.  This is what I do.
L224413 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I don't know, John.  I'm a fire fighter. This is...this is different.
L224412 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ They will if they catch him in the act. You can make that happen, Dad.  You can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment.
L224411 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ So what should I do?  Call the police? You think they'll believe me?
L224410 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ No.  Nobody got...  Wait a minute.  I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be.  I got the case file.  We know what he's gonna do before he does it.
L224409 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What can we do?  You don't even know who this guy is.
L224408 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ That'll never work.  They'll just think you're crazy.
L224407 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I'll warn them.
L224406 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I don't know...  What about the other women?
L224405 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I gotta take her away, John.  I'm gonna take your mother away.  He can't hurt her if I take her away.
L224404 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Something we did changed the case...changed history.  Mom wasn't dead.  But then after you didn't die in the fire something must have happened.  And this guy, this Nightingale guy, he kept on killing...it was like a spree...seven more women.
L224403 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L224402 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ He didn't just kill three women anymore. He killed ten.
L224401 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Whatta you mean...
L224400 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Dad, we did something.  Something to make it worse.
L224399 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What kinda twisted animal.
L224398 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ There was this case.  A serial.  He murdered three women, all nurses, between '68 and '69.  The papers called them the Nightingale Murders.  They never caught him.  But the killings just stopped.
L224397 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Murdered?  Why?
L224394 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Jesus Christ...that's...ten days from now.  How?
L224393 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ October 22, 1969.
L224392 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ When?
L224391 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ No Dad, it happened a long time ago, a long time ago for me.
L224390 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ She just died, your mother just died?
L224389 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ She...she died.  It's like it just happened.
L224388 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Whatta you mean she's not here?
L224387 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ She's not here.
L224386 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What?  What is it?
L224385 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ It's Mom.
L224384 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What?  Johnny, what's wrong?
L224383 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Something happened, something...
L224382 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Are you alright"?
L224381 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Dad...Dad... There's... I need to...
L224380 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Right here, Chief.  Sorry I lost you last night.  Damn thing keeps cutting out.
L224326 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What it was like when you died in the fire...
L224325 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What, Johnny?  What is it?
L224324 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Dad, I gotta tell you this...cause you should know.  Cause I still remember.
L224323 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I'm glad.
L224322 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ It's hard to explain.  Something happened today.  It was like a dream.  And when I woke up I had all these new memories. Good times.  Times we never had before.
L224321 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Tell me.
L224320 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ We're doing all right, Dad.  We're doing good.
L224319 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Yeah.  I'm okay.  What about you?  I want to know.  About you.  And your mom.
L224318 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Dad, you there?  You okay?
L224317 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You're the voice of an angel, Johnny.  If you hadn't told me, no way I would'a ever made it.
L224316 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Yeah, it's me.
L224315 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Chief?!  Is that you?
L224314 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Dad...?
L224221 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I don't understand.
L224220 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Don't go.  Don't go in that warehouse...
L224219 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Tomorrow.  Jesus...it hasn't happened. It doesn't have to happen.
L224218 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ But that's tomorrow.
L224217 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ October 12, 1969.
L224216 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ When?
L224215 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ It did, Pop.  It did.
L224214 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ That can't be...that's not gonna happen.
L224213 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ It was an abandoned warehouse - hit by lightening.  Butch told Ma it was just one wrong turn. Said it wasn't your fault.  You went with the training, with your instincts.  If you'd just gone left instead of right, you would've made it.
L224212 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ On the job?
L224211 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Fire.
L224210 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Why?
L224209 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I never knew you, Dad.
L224208 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What?
L224207 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I lost you.
L224206 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L224205 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ But you're not...you're not still here.
L224204 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It's okay.  I'm still here, Chief.
L224203 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ No wait, don't go!
L224202 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I think I'm losing you.
L224201 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What's that?
L224200 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I'm trying to be, Dad.  I'm tyrin'.  It's good to hear your voice.  I missed you...so much.
L224199 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You're still my Little Chief, right?
L224197 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Nah, I gave it up.
L224196 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Too busy playin' ball, huh?
L224195 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ No, not yet.
L224193 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Yeah...I think so.
L224192 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It's really you, isn't it?
L224191 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I'm not doing anything.  Look, I don't know what's going on.  But I swear on my life, I"m here at your old desk, on your Ham, in our house, right now...in 1998.
L224190 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ 1998...?  This is wrong.  Who are you? Why are you doing this?
L224189 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ 1998.
L224188 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Thirty-five?  That would make it...
L224187 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I'm thirty-five years old.
L224186 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You sound...ground up...?
L224185 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Wait a sec...there was something on the news.  Something about this space anomaly.  I think they said it was connected to some storm in '69.
L224184 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Yeah, that's how Hams work.
L224183 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Sun spot?
L224182 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ We gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time.
L224181 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I don't know.
L224180 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ How could this be happening?
L224179 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Johnny...?
L224178 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Dad...?
L224177 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What if it's not...
L224176 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ That's impossible.
L224174 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What's happening?
L224173 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You just burned the desk.
L224172 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What?
L224171 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Oh my god.
L224170 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Nothing...I just spilled something.
L224169 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What's going on?
L224166 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I'm not dreaming.
L224165 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I'm dreaming this.  Shit, this is a dream.
L224164 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What the hell...
L224163 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ My dad's name was Frank Patrick Sullivan, he was a fire fighter and a die-hard Mets fan.  And every night when I went to bed he sang to me...  Take me out to the ball game, take me out with the crowd...
L224162 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ 29 years...?
L224161 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ 29-years ago.
L224160 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What?
L224159 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Now you listen to me.  My name is John Francis Sullivan, I live at 1060 41st, where I've lived my whole life.  And I saw the first game of the '69 Series at my Uncle Butch's house with my father...
L224158 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ W...B...2...YXB.
L224157 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What'd you say your station...uh, your call letters were?
L224156 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What the hell does Gordy have to do with it?
L224155 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Gordo, if this is you, so help me...
L224154 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Right...and I'm asking how you called the game.
L224153 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You're telling me your name is Frank Sullivan, you live in Queens and you just saw the first game of the '69 Series...live?
L224152 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Look pal, I'm just askin' how you...
L224151 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Is this some kind of joke?  Gordo is that you?  Are you fucking with me?
L224150 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Frank...Frank Sullivan.
L224149 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What'd you say your name was?
L224148 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Uh huh...
L224147 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You call your son Little Chief?
L224146 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Oh, that was my kid.
L224145 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What'd you just say?
L224144 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Sorry 'bout that.
L224141 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ This afternoon?
L224140 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What are you talking about?  I'm talking about this afternoon.
L224139 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Wasn't too tough, buddy.  Game happened almost thirty years ago.
L224138 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ The World Series.  You called Buford's homer.
L224137 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Huh?
L224136 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I been Q-ing you all night.  How the hell did you do it?
L224135 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Hello?
L224134 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ ...WB2YXB calling unidentified station, Queens.  CQ 15.
L224092 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Yeah.  It was all over after Buford nailed Seaver's first pitch outta the park.
L224091 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I'm right with you, man.  He's got the heart of a lion.  Hey, how 'bout the first game of the Series?
L224088 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Fed up?  Lemme tell you something, in a 1000 years, when school kids study America, they're gonna learn about three things: the Constitution, Rock 'n' Roll, and Baseball.
L224087 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I got fed up with all the bullshit.
L224086 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What?
L224085 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I don't really follow baseball anymore.
L224084 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Sorry 'bout that.  So Queens, you psyched for the Series?
L224082 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I can't believe people are still using these things.
L224081 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ 15-band closes down at night.  During the day you can chew the band with China if you want.
L224080 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I thought these things were for talkin' around the world.
L224079 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Whatta ya know.  Bayside, born and raised.
L224078 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Queens, New York.
L224077 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Where are you transmitting from?
L224076 +++$+++ u5397 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Pal, my whole life's an emergency.
L224075 +++$+++ u5394 +++$+++ m358 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Listen, you can't broadcast without a license.  Unless this is an emergency, you gotta get off the band.
