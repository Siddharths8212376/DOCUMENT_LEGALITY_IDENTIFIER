L296557 +++$+++ u1422 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Do you still want me to stay?
L296556 +++$+++ u1424 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ NEVILLE +++$+++ Yes.
L296555 +++$+++ u1422 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ You want me to stay?
L296550 +++$+++ u1422 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Before... when I was one of them. I would look at this and it was just strangers.  Now I... remember.
L296549 +++$+++ u1424 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ NEVILLE +++$+++ That's who you are too, Emma.
L296547 +++$+++ u1422 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ I don't know.
L296546 +++$+++ u1424 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ NEVILLE +++$+++ Who?
L296545 +++$+++ u1422 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Humans.
L296544 +++$+++ u1424 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ NEVILLE +++$+++ What's inside?
L296543 +++$+++ u1422 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Yes.
L296542 +++$+++ u1424 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ NEVILLE +++$+++ Have you looked inside?
L296541 +++$+++ u1422 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ I don't know.
L296540 +++$+++ u1424 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ NEVILLE +++$+++ Have you always had it?
L296539 +++$+++ u1422 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Mine.
L296535 +++$+++ u1422 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ I know it.  What do you want, Robert?
L296534 +++$+++ u1424 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ NEVILLE +++$+++ We don't know that --
L296533 +++$+++ u1422 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Will you keep feeding me?  How long can you live like that?  Until it kills you?  Until I kill you? Without your blood I'll go back.
L296531 +++$+++ u1422 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ You know what I mean.
L296530 +++$+++ u1424 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ NEVILLE +++$+++ What do you mean?
L296529 +++$+++ u1422 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ What do you want?
L296528 +++$+++ u1424 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ NEVILLE +++$+++ If I'm a hunter it's because you taught me to be!
L296527 +++$+++ u1422 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ You are The Human.  The Hunter.  The thing that comes in the day and kills --
L296526 +++$+++ u1424 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ NEVILLE +++$+++ I only protect myself -- !
L296525 +++$+++ u1422 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ You hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered?!
L296524 +++$+++ u1424 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ NEVILLE +++$+++ What choice did I have -- ?!
L296522 +++$+++ u1424 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ NEVILLE +++$+++ You're not them.
L296521 +++$+++ u1422 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Why don't you start with me?
L296520 +++$+++ u1422 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ You want to kill them.
L296519 +++$+++ u1424 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ NEVILLE +++$+++ Yes.
L296518 +++$+++ u1422 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ You want to find them.
L296516 +++$+++ u1424 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ NEVILLE +++$+++ Where you lived with them.
L296515 +++$+++ u1422 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ What?
L296514 +++$+++ u1424 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ NEVILLE +++$+++ Do you remember where it is?
L296513 +++$+++ u1424 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ NEVILLE +++$+++ Yes.
L296512 +++$+++ u1422 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Was this -- "beautiful?"  Before?
L296511 +++$+++ u1424 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ NEVILLE +++$+++ My wife.
L296510 +++$+++ u1422 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Who is this?
L296509 +++$+++ u1422 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Dark and large.  With vines -- no, not vines.  Not alive.
L296508 +++$+++ u1424 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ NEVILLE +++$+++ When you're here, in the city, where do you live?
L296507 +++$+++ u1422 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ We move.  Place to place.
L296506 +++$+++ u1424 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ NEVILLE +++$+++ Yes.
L296505 +++$+++ u1422 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ With them?
L296504 +++$+++ u1424 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ NEVILLE +++$+++ What about... now?
L296503 +++$+++ u1422 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ It was warm.  I was outside.  The ocean?
L296502 +++$+++ u1424 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ NEVILLE +++$+++ Do you remember where you lived?
L296501 +++$+++ u1422 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ It comes back.  Flashes.  My name.
L296500 +++$+++ u1424 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ NEVILLE +++$+++ How much do you remember?
L296498 +++$+++ u1424 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ NEVILLE +++$+++ Do you want to go on?
L296497 +++$+++ u1422 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Yes.
L296496 +++$+++ u1424 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ NEVILLE +++$+++ Are you all right?
L296492 +++$+++ u1424 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ NEVILLE +++$+++ Listen to me, my blood somehow... helped you.  It could help all of you.  We could find some way to --
L296491 +++$+++ u1422 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ It is not arguing to speak the truth.
L296489 +++$+++ u1424 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ NEVILLE +++$+++ My name is Robert.
L296488 +++$+++ u1422 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ That is not now, human!
L296487 +++$+++ u1424 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ NEVILLE +++$+++ You lived like this once.
L296486 +++$+++ u1422 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ I can't live like you do -- all your machines and -- cold metal and sharp corners --
L296484 +++$+++ u1424 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ NEVILLE +++$+++ No.
L296483 +++$+++ u1422 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ You -- think I am -- I'm --  -- an animal.
L296451 +++$+++ u1424 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ NEVILLE +++$+++ Stay alive.
L296450 +++$+++ u1423 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ FRENCH VOICE +++$+++ That sounds charming.  What are you planning to do tomorrow?
L296449 +++$+++ u1424 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ NEVILLE +++$+++ They are... sinister.  They want to kill me.
L296448 +++$+++ u1423 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ FRENCH VOICE +++$+++ Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?
L296447 +++$+++ u1424 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ NEVILLE +++$+++ Yesterday.  They're back.  Haven't seen them for a few months.  I have to be careful.
L296446 +++$+++ u1423 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ FRENCH VOICE +++$+++ That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today?
L296445 +++$+++ u1424 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ NEVILLE +++$+++ Busy.  I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle.  A big vehicle.
L296444 +++$+++ u1423 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ FRENCH VOICE +++$+++ Good evening.  Did you have a pleasant day today?
L296592 +++$+++ u1426 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ VIRGINIA +++$+++ What?
L296591 +++$+++ u1424 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ NEVILLE +++$+++ Virginia...?
L296590 +++$+++ u1426 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ VIRGINIA +++$+++ The more we plant, the more that'll grow, and the happier --
L296588 +++$+++ u1426 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ VIRGINIA +++$+++ Well, it's not supposed to be done anyway.
L296587 +++$+++ u1424 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ NEVILLE +++$+++ It's never gonna be done.  You love puttering out there too much.
L296586 +++$+++ u1426 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ VIRGINIA +++$+++ Besides, if we get a lot of work done this summer it'll be done.
L296585 +++$+++ u1424 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ NEVILLE +++$+++ I surrender --
L296584 +++$+++ u1426 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ VIRGINIA +++$+++ Yeah, but when your mother came what's the first thing you showed her?
L296583 +++$+++ u1424 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ NEVILLE +++$+++ You and that damned garden.
L296455 +++$+++ u1426 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ VIRGINIA +++$+++ It was at Diane's party in Malibu and I had just broken up with Todd and I was loaded for bear, any man who had the nerve to come at me -- watch out.  So you come sauntering in -- you know that saunter you do. That watch out, baby, here comes Mr. Smooth thing.
L296454 +++$+++ u1424 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ NEVILLE +++$+++ Yes.
L296453 +++$+++ u1426 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ VIRGINIA +++$+++ I remember the first time we met. Do you remember that?
L296413 +++$+++ u1425 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ Round back.
L296412 +++$+++ u1424 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ NEVILLE +++$+++ Bathroom?
L296411 +++$+++ u1424 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ NEVILLE +++$+++ I guess you could say that.
L296410 +++$+++ u1425 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ You built things.
L296409 +++$+++ u1424 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ NEVILLE +++$+++ I'm am architect.  I'm working on a site back in --
L296408 +++$+++ u1425 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ So, what do you do?
L296407 +++$+++ u1425 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ You got that right.
L296406 +++$+++ u1424 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ NEVILLE +++$+++ Hell of a night.
L296405 +++$+++ u1424 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ NEVILLE +++$+++ That's fine.
L296404 +++$+++ u1425 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ Only got one kind.
L296403 +++$+++ u1424 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ NEVILLE +++$+++ Please.
L296402 +++$+++ u1425 +++$+++ m95 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ Need some gas?
L307676 +++$+++ u1427 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Better now, son?
L307675 +++$+++ u1429 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I was so scared.
L307674 +++$+++ u1427 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ I know, Ellen.  We'll settle down soon.
L307670 +++$+++ u1427 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ It was all made of stuff that's happened to you in the last few days.  The sand pit in back of the house, and the meteor shower, and meeting your teacher and the colonel at school, and being afraid of the new kids because you don't know them ...
L307669 +++$+++ u1429 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ It was so real, Dad.
L307668 +++$+++ u1427 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ That's a doozy of a dream, son.
L307667 +++$+++ u1429 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ ... And then everything blew up. And then I woke up.
L307664 +++$+++ u1429 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ First lemme look at your necks.
L307663 +++$+++ u1427 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ What, Jim, what?
L307662 +++$+++ u1429 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I had an awful dream.
L307298 +++$+++ u1429 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Was there anything over the hill?
L307297 +++$+++ u1427 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ I lost it.  It's kind of muddy out there.
L307294 +++$+++ u1427 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Sure ... fine.
L307293 +++$+++ u1429 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Are you all right, Dad?
L307288 +++$+++ u1427 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ I'll go take a look when the rain lets off.
L307287 +++$+++ u1429 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
L307286 +++$+++ u1427 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Are you sure you saw that?  In the rain -- it may have <u>looked</u> like it changed shape --
L307285 +++$+++ u1429 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ It was -- it was -- it changed shape. First it was big and round, then it was flat, then it was long and thin.
L307284 +++$+++ u1427 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ What did it look like?
L307283 +++$+++ u1429 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ It was big -- and it glowed -- and it went down over there -- behind the hill.
L307282 +++$+++ u1429 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ You've got to come see -- a big thing went down over the hill!
L307281 +++$+++ u1427 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Jim -- what's wrong?!
L307277 +++$+++ u1429 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Okay.
L307276 +++$+++ u1427 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Well, son?  Should we call it a night?  I for one have had a long day.
L307271 +++$+++ u1427 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ That's Mars.  The closest planet to us, now.  That's why it's more than just a point in the sky.
L307270 +++$+++ u1429 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Which one's that?  The dull, red one.
L307268 +++$+++ u1427 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ And that one -- to the right of Rigel?
L307267 +++$+++ u1429 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ ... and Rigel.
L307266 +++$+++ u1429 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ There's Cassius ...
L307265 +++$+++ u1427 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
L307264 +++$+++ u1429 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ There are more this year than last.
L307244 +++$+++ u1427 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Because the sky is so clear out here.
L307243 +++$+++ u1429 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Why, Dad?
L307242 +++$+++ u1427 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ It's that time of year again. We should get a pretty good show out here.
L307241 +++$+++ u1429 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ A meteorite, Dad, look!
L307236 +++$+++ u1429 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Let's see what's on the other side. Maybe we'll find some copper.
L307235 +++$+++ u1427 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ It's got a name.  Copper Ridge. There used to be a copper mine near here.
L307234 +++$+++ u1429 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Wow.  There's the town.  And there's the air base.  This is a great hill.
L307233 +++$+++ u1429 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Let's check it out, Dad.
L307232 +++$+++ u1427 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ If we want it, it is.
L307231 +++$+++ u1429 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Is the hill ours too?
L307230 +++$+++ u1427 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ This can be your room if you want it. What do you say?
L307229 +++$+++ u1429 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Wow.  Look at the mountains.
L307221 +++$+++ u1427 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ That's the Air Force Base.
L307220 +++$+++ u1429 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ What's that, Dad?
L307218 +++$+++ u1427 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ You'll meet new friends.  I know ... it's rough.  But I have to move, son.
L307217 +++$+++ u1429 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I'll have to go to a new school -- again.
L307216 +++$+++ u1427 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ I know, son.  But you'll like it where we're going.  I'm getting a good job.  It's a pretty part of the country.
L307215 +++$+++ u1429 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Do we have to?
L307214 +++$+++ u1427 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ We're going to be moving, son.
L307213 +++$+++ u1429 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Yes.
L307212 +++$+++ u1427 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Son ... are you awake?
L307678 +++$+++ u1431 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Good night.
L307677 +++$+++ u1427 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Better get some sleep, son, or you'll be pretty tired at school tomorrow.
L307384 +++$+++ u1431 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ It's his nightmare.  He still hasn't gotten over it ... about the other side of the hill.
L307383 +++$+++ u1427 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ What's wrong, Ellen?
L307377 +++$+++ u1431 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ George, you're acting very strangely.
L307376 +++$+++ u1427 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ You know, it really is beautiful up there.  Let me show you.  We'll take a walk after dinner.
L307374 +++$+++ u1431 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Yes -- but ...
L307373 +++$+++ u1427 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ I'm home now.
L307371 +++$+++ u1431 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ You did?  Why? Where were you? They said you left hours ago. We were worried.
L307370 +++$+++ u1427 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ I left it at work.
L307369 +++$+++ u1431 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Where's your car?
L307368 +++$+++ u1427 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ That's Ed.  Ed works with the Bell Telephone switching division.
L307367 +++$+++ u1431 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ What happened to you?  Who was that?
L307313 +++$+++ u1431 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ I will.  But isn't that odd -- about my dream ... ?
L307312 +++$+++ u1427 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ It's probably the solenoid.  Take it back to Gleason's, they said they'd fix it if we found anything wrong.
L307308 +++$+++ u1431 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ You don't have to.  The school bus stops right outside here, at 7:30. I've got to run.
L307307 +++$+++ u1427 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ I'll take you to school.
L307306 +++$+++ u1431 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ I have to go over to the town this morning and do a lot of shopping. This house needs just <u>everything</u>. I'll probably be gone all day. Jimmy, hurry up and eat or you'll be late.
L307451 +++$+++ u1430 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Why, yes.  Why?
L307450 +++$+++ u1427 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Is that all he said?
L307449 +++$+++ u1430 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ He was upset with moving, I believe.
L307448 +++$+++ u1427 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ What did he talk to you about?
L307447 +++$+++ u1430 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I'm sorry, Mr. Gardner.  I was out of my office for a minute and when I got back -- he was gone.
L307446 +++$+++ u1427 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ What do you mean -- gone?  What the hell kind of a nurse are you, anyway?
L307437 +++$+++ u1430 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Yes, Mr. Gardner.
L307436 +++$+++ u1427 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ We'll be by to pick him up in ten minutes.
L307435 +++$+++ u1430 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Of course.
L307434 +++$+++ u1428 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ DAD'S VOICE +++$+++ I'm not particularly interested, <u>Ms.</u> Magnuson, in what you think is correct. My wife and I are going away on a business trip this afternoon and we want Jimmy with us.  Keep him in your office until we arrive.
L307433 +++$+++ u1430 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Mr. Gardner, I don't think this is the place to discuss this matter.
L307432 +++$+++ u1428 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ DAD'S VOICE +++$+++ You people have a lot of nerve, taking it on yourselves to encourage young children to speak out of turn. I'm of a mind to pull him out of school if this is your idea of how to handle ... What sort of training do you have anyway?
L307431 +++$+++ u1430 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Mr. Gardner, I --
L307430 +++$+++ u1428 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ DAD'S VOICE +++$+++ I don't know what he's told you --  What <u>has</u> he told you?  Would you like to tell <u>me</u> -- ?
L307429 +++$+++ u1430 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Children often have trouble adjusting to a new school.
L307428 +++$+++ u1428 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ DAD'S VOICE +++$+++ About what?
L307427 +++$+++ u1430 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ We were having a little talk.
L307426 +++$+++ u1428 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ DAD'S VOICE +++$+++ May I ask why?
L307425 +++$+++ u1430 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Yes, I do, Mr. Gardner.
L307424 +++$+++ u1428 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ DAD'S VOICE +++$+++ I understand, Miss, that you have my son in your office.
L307423 +++$+++ u1430 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Hello, this is Ms. Magnuson speaking.
L307534 +++$+++ u1429 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ They didn't find any signs of life on the Viking missions.
L307533 +++$+++ u1430 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ You're looking for life?
L307506 +++$+++ u1430 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Let's try.
L307505 +++$+++ u1429 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ There was a man named Colonel Wilson, from the Air Force Base.  He was talking in our class.  He said we could visit him any time we wanted.  I'll bet he could do something.
L307504 +++$+++ u1430 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ We can't do this alone.  We've got to get help.
L307503 +++$+++ u1429 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town.
L307502 +++$+++ u1430 +++$+++ m96 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Don't go in.
