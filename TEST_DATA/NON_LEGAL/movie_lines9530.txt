L29595 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Kalmbach--Nixon's personal lawyer.
L29594 +++$+++ u3633 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ I will not talk about the other two.
L29593 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ But they both worked at the White House?
L29579 +++$+++ u3633 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Well, they sure didn't ask us to come forward and tell the truth.
L29578 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ To cover up?
L29577 +++$+++ u3633 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ We were never told flat out "Don't talk." But the message was clear.
L29576 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Because people at the Committee were told to lie to the prosecutors?
L29575 +++$+++ u3633 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ That's another of the things I'm not so sure of.
L29574 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Do you think the truth will come out at the trial?
L29573 +++$+++ u3633 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Try and understand this. I'm a decent Republican. I believe in Richard Nixon. I worked in the White House four years--so did my wife. What happened on June 17 I don't think the President knew anything about. Some of his men I'm not so sure of.
L29572 +++$+++ u3633 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ --they're worse. That's why I quit.
L29571 +++$+++ u3611 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ --then again, maybe things are even worse than we've written--
L29934 +++$+++ u3613 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BRADLEE +++$+++ My non-denial denial.
L29933 +++$+++ u3632 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SIMONS +++$+++ What's this?
L29898 +++$+++ u3632 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SIMONS +++$+++ --you double-checked both sources?--
L29897 +++$+++ u3613 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BRADLEE +++$+++ --well shit, we oughtta be tense-- we're about to accuse Mr. Haldeman who only happens to be the second most important man in America of conducting a criminal conspiracy from inside the White House--  --it would be nice if we were right--
L29889 +++$+++ u3632 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SIMONS +++$+++ --Christ, I wish I knew if we should print this--
L29888 +++$+++ u3613 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BRADLEE +++$+++ --I don't know, I don't know, it feels thin--
L29655 +++$+++ u3613 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BRADLEE +++$+++ --all non-denial denials--we're dirty guys and they doubt we were ever virgins but they don't say the story is inaccurate.
L29654 +++$+++ u3632 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SIMONS +++$+++ Same kind of crap--
L29391 +++$+++ u3632 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ SIMONS +++$+++ And we'll all have to go to work for a living.
L29390 +++$+++ u3613 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BRADLEE +++$+++ Then it's our asses, isn't it?
L29401 +++$+++ u3619 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ FOREIGN EDITOR +++$+++ The FBI thinks it's possible--the Democrats need a campaign issue, corruption's always a good one.  Get off the story, Ben--or put some people on McGovern's finances; fair is fair, even in our business.
L29400 +++$+++ u3613 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BRADLEE +++$+++ You saying the Democrats bugged themselves?
L29399 +++$+++ u3619 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ FOREIGN EDITOR +++$+++ Look--why would the Republicans do it? --my God, McGovern is self- destructing before our eyes--just like Muskie did, Humphrey, the bunch of 'em.  Why would the burglars have put the tape around the door instead of up and down unless they wanted to get caught? Why did they take a walkie- talkie and then turn it off, unless they wanted to get caught? Why would they use McCord--the only direct contact to the Republicans?
L29398 +++$+++ u3619 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ FOREIGN EDITOR +++$+++ Ben, Jesus, there are over two thousand reporters in this town, are there five on Watergate? Where did we suddenly get all this wisdom?
L29397 +++$+++ u3613 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BRADLEE +++$+++ It will, it just hasn't bottomed out yet, give it time.
L29394 +++$+++ u3619 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ FOREIGN EDITOR +++$+++ It's not that we're using unnamed sources that bothers me, or that everything we print the White House denies, or that almost no other papers are reprinting our stuff.
L29393 +++$+++ u3613 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BRADLEE +++$+++ Go on.
L29392 +++$+++ u3619 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ FOREIGN EDITOR +++$+++ I don't think either Metropolitan or National should cover the story.  I don't think we should cover the story, period.
L29958 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Mitchell started the cover-up early, everyone is involved in the cover- up, all the way to the top. The whole U.S. intelligence community is mixed in with the covert activities. The extent of it is incredible.  And people's lives are in danger, maybe including ours.
L29957 +++$+++ u3613 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BRADLEE +++$+++ Anything else from Mr. Throat?
L29954 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Electronic surveillance.
L29953 +++$+++ u3613 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BRADLEE +++$+++ We can't talk inside either?
L29903 +++$+++ u3613 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BRADLEE +++$+++ --I'm not sure, it still feels thin-- 
L29902 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ --I'm sure--
L29817 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ --he went to her apartment and he told her--
L29816 +++$+++ u3613 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BRADLEE +++$+++ --what do you think?--
L29815 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ --his dialing finger must be falling off--
L29814 +++$+++ u3613 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BRADLEE +++$+++ I got Clawsen on hold--
L29625 +++$+++ u3613 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BRADLEE +++$+++ OK.  You're about to write a story that says that the former Attorney General-- the man who represented law in America-- is a crook.  Just be right, huh?
L29624 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ --I saw him. He verifies.
L29611 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ He approved the payments to Liddy while he was still Attorney General--
L29610 +++$+++ u3613 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BRADLEE +++$+++ This is a daily paper, we'll explain it tomorrow.  You're certain on Mitchell?
L29249 +++$+++ u3613 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BRADLEE +++$+++ Is he on the level of Assistant to the President or not?
L29248 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ I don't know titles.
L29247 +++$+++ u3613 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BRADLEE +++$+++ Just tell me his title.
L29246 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ You asking me to disclose my source?
L29245 +++$+++ u3613 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ BRADLEE +++$+++ How senior?
L29244 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ I was told by this guy at the White House that Hunt was investigating Teddy Kennedy.
L29078 +++$+++ u3614 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ CADDY +++$+++ You don't mind getting on people's nerves, do you?
L29077 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ I have nothing more to say.
L29076 +++$+++ u3614 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ CADDY +++$+++ Are you implying you don't believe me?
L29075 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ It was really nice of you to come, since you'd only met him once.
L29074 +++$+++ u3614 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ CADDY +++$+++ Barker's wife called me at three this morning; her husband apparently had told her to call if he hadn't called her by then.
L29073 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ A Miami social occasion?  Mr. Rafferty told me the Cubans were from Miami.
L29072 +++$+++ u3614 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ CADDY +++$+++ --I met one of the defendants, Mr. Barker, at a social occasion once--  --I have nothing more to say.
L29071 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ You're a lawyer and you're here--
L29070 +++$+++ u3614 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ CADDY +++$+++ They are not my clients.
L29069 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Your clients were arrested with a walkie-talkie; they didn't need that to talk among themselves.
L29068 +++$+++ u3614 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ CADDY +++$+++ There is no reason to assume other people were involved.
L29067 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Did you know to come because one of the other men involved in the break- in called you?
L29066 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Well, they never would have been assigned if anyone had known the burglars had arranged for their own counsel. And that could only mean the burglars didn't arrange for their own counsel--they never even made a phone call.  So if they didn't ask for you to be here, how did you know to come?
L29065 +++$+++ u3614 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ CADDY +++$+++ So?
L29064 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Probably you're right, but a little while ago, I was talking to a couple of lawyers who'd been assigned to represent the burglars.
L29063 +++$+++ u3614 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ CADDY +++$+++ I assure you, there's nothing mysterious involved.
L29062 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ What I don't understand is how you got here.
L29061 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ --you have nothing more to say, I understand that.
L29060 +++$+++ u3614 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ CADDY +++$+++ Look, I told you inside--
L29059 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Mr. Rafferty was very helpful. Four Cuban-Americans and this other man, James McCord.
L29058 +++$+++ u3614 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ CADDY +++$+++ Clearly, I am here, but only as an individual, I'm not the attorney of record.  Mr. Rafferty has that position. Whatever you want, you'll have to get from him, I have nothing more to say.
L29057 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Douglas Caddy, the attorney of record, when questioned about his presence in the courtroom, denied he was in the courtroom, "I'm not here," Mr. Caddy said.
L29056 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ OK.
L29055 +++$+++ u3614 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ CADDY +++$+++ --I'm not here.
L29054 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Mr. Caddy? My name's Bob Woodward, I'm from the Post and I wanted to ask about how you happened to come on this case--
L29807 +++$+++ u3615 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ CLAWSEN +++$+++ --I've completely forgotten where it was, except I know it wasn't her apartment.
L29806 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant--
L29805 +++$+++ u3615 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ CLAWSEN +++$+++ Where?  What do you mean, where?
L29804 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen?
L29803 +++$+++ u3615 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ CLAWSEN +++$+++ That's a bullshit question, that's a question straight out of Wichita, Kansas.
L29802 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ She's an awfully good reporter--I can't remember her getting too much wrong before, can you?
L29801 +++$+++ u3615 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ CLAWSEN +++$+++ Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it totally wrong--
L29800 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ You claiming it was all a misunderstanding, Ken?
L29372 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ That checks out with our finding, thank you, Mr. Dahlberg.
L29371 +++$+++ u3616 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ DAHLBERG +++$+++ I don't know; I really don't. The last time I saw it was when I was in Washington. I gave it to the Finance department of the Committee to Re- Elect the President. How it got to that burglar, your guess is as good as mine.
L29370 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ I see. And how do you think it reached Miami?
L29369 +++$+++ u3616 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ DAHLBERG +++$+++ That twenty-five thousand dollars is money I collected for Nixon in this year's campaign.
L29368 +++$+++ u3616 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ DAHLBERG +++$+++ I'm a proper citizen, I'm a decent man, I don't do anything that isn't decent or proper.  I know I shouldn't tell you this...
L29367 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L29366 +++$+++ u3616 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ DAHLBERG +++$+++ ...you're definitely doing a story...?
L29365 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ The twenty-five thousand dollar one.  The one with your name on it.  In Bernard Barker's Florida account.  Bernard Barker, the Watergate burglar--
L29364 +++$+++ u3616 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ DAHLBERG +++$+++ ...check...?
L29363 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ --this should take only a minute, Mr. Dahlberg, but we're doing a follow- up on the break-in--  --and I was kind of curious about your check.
L29946 +++$+++ u3618 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ DEEP THROAT +++$+++ You'll have to find that out, won't you?--
L29945 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ We know that--and if we were wrong, we're resigning--were we wrong?
L29944 +++$+++ u3618 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ DEEP THROAT +++$+++ --you've done worse than let Haldeman slip away, you've got people feeling sorry for him--I didn't think that was possible. A conspiracy like this-- the rope has to tighten slowly around everyone's neck. You build from the outer edges and you go step by step. If you shoot too high and miss, then everybody feels more secure. You've put the investigation back months.
L29943 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ --I know, I know, the pressure's off the White House and it's all back on the Post--
L29790 +++$+++ u3618 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ DEEP THROAT +++$+++ I was being cautious.  You can safely say more then fifty...
L29789 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?
L29788 +++$+++ u3618 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ DEEP THROAT +++$+++ Yes, yes, everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck-- some of what they did is beyond belief.
L29787 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ And Justice and FBI know all this?
L29786 +++$+++ u3618 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ DEEP THROAT +++$+++ Nationwide--my God, they were frightened of Muskie and look who got destroyed--they wanted to run against McGovern, and look who they're running against. They bugged, they followed people, false press leaks, fake letters, they canceled Democratic campaign rallies, they investigated Democratic private lives, they planted spies, stole documents, on and on-- don't tell me you think this was all the work of little Don Segretti.
L29785 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ How grand?
L29784 +++$+++ u3618 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ DEEP THROAT +++$+++ --don't you miss the grand scheme too.
L29783 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ --the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation--
L29782 +++$+++ u3618 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ DEEP THROAT +++$+++ Follow every lead--every lead goes somewhere--
L29781 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ There were more then.
L29780 +++$+++ u3618 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ DEEP THROAT +++$+++ --don't concentrate on Segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too.
L29779 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Talk about Segretti--
L29778 +++$+++ u3618 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ DEEP THROAT +++$+++ Total manipulation. I suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the Constitution, but they don't think along philosophical lines.
L29777 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Why did they do all this for Chrissakes?--what were they after?
L29776 +++$+++ u3618 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ DEEP THROAT +++$+++ You get nothing from me about Haldeman?
L29775 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Haldeman too?
L29774 +++$+++ u3618 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ DEEP THROAT +++$+++ Of course--my God, you think something this big just happens? The break-in and the cover up, of course Mitchell knew, but no more than Ehrlichman.
L29773 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Mitchell knew then.
L29772 +++$+++ u3618 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ DEEP THROAT +++$+++ Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you?  Don't you know what you're onto? Come on.
L29771 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Why didn't they?--who told them not to?
L29770 +++$+++ u3618 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ DEEP THROAT +++$+++ They know, but they focused on the burglary--if it didn't deal with the break-in, they didn't pursue it.
L29769 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Do Justice and the FBI know what we know, and why the hell haven't they done anything about it?
L29768 +++$+++ u3618 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ DEEP THROAT +++$+++ I hope you noticed how coolly I behaved under the threat of discovery.
L29765 +++$+++ u3618 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ DEEP THROAT +++$+++ Did you change cabs?  It didn't work, something moved there--
L29764 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ What?
L29763 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ The slush fund at CREEP financed the ratfucking, we've almost got that nailed down, so--
L29762 +++$+++ u3618 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ DEEP THROAT +++$+++ You'll have to find that out, won't you.
L29761 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Who?--be specific. How high up?
L29760 +++$+++ u3618 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ DEEP THROAT +++$+++ Yes, the little ratfuckers are now running our government.
L29759 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ I know what it means--Segretti wouldn't go on the record, but if he would, we know he'd implicate Chapin. And that would put us inside the White House.
L29758 +++$+++ u3618 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ DEEP THROAT +++$+++ In my day, it was simply called the double cross. I believe the CIA refers to it as Mindfuck. In our context, it simply means infiltration of the Democrats.
L29757 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Ratfucking.
L29756 +++$+++ u3618 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ DEEP THROAT +++$+++ My turn to keep you waiting.  What's the topic for tonight?
L29269 +++$+++ u3618 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ DEEP THROAT +++$+++ Talk? Once, at a gathering, he put his hand over a candle. And he kept it there. He kept it right in the flame until his flesh seared. A woman who was watching asked, "What's the trick?" And he replied. "The trick is not minding."
L29268 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Liddy--you think there's a chance he'll talk?
L29267 +++$+++ u3618 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ DEEP THROAT +++$+++ What I know, you'll have to find out on your own.
L29266 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ What's the whole thing about--do you know?
L29265 +++$+++ u3618 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ DEEP THROAT +++$+++ --melodramatic?  Things are past that--remember, these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were Dodge City.
L29264 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ I did everything you said, but it all seemed--
L29263 +++$+++ u3618 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ DEEP THROAT +++$+++ You changed cabs? You're sure no one followed you?
L29262 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ This man Gordon Liddy--he's going to be tried along with Hunt and the five burglars--we know he knows a lot, we just don't know what.
L29261 +++$+++ u3618 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ DEEP THROAT +++$+++ Go on.
L29260 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ To where?
L29259 +++$+++ u3618 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ DEEP THROAT +++$+++ Follow the money. Always follow the money.
L29258 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ John Mitchell resigned as head of CREEP to spend more time with his family. That doesn't exactly have the ring of truth.  Howard Hunt's been found--there was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag.
L29257 +++$+++ u3618 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ DEEP THROAT +++$+++ Because the press stinks too--history on the run, that's all you're interested in.  You come up with anything?
L29256 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me?
L29255 +++$+++ u3618 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ DEEP THROAT +++$+++ Then there must be something, mustn't there. Look, forget the myths the media's created about the White House-- the truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.
L29254 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ I don't know maybe sixteen, eighteen hours a day--we've got sources at Justice, the FBI, but it's still drying up.
L29253 +++$+++ u3618 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ DEEP THROAT +++$+++ You thought I'd help out on specifics?  I'll confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but that's all.  Are you guys really working?  How much?
L29252 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.
L29251 +++$+++ u3618 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ DEEP THROAT +++$+++ I saw the flag signal--what's up?
L29146 +++$+++ u3621 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ HUNT +++$+++ Good God!
L29145 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ I was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at Watergate?
L29144 +++$+++ u3621 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ HUNT +++$+++ --yes, yes, what is it?
L29143 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and--
L29142 +++$+++ u3621 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ HUNT +++$+++ Howard Hunt here.
L29141 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Hello, I'm Bob Woodward of the Washing Post and...  Mullen and Company Public Relations? Could you tell me when you expect Mr. Hunt?  He is?
L29093 +++$+++ u3625 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ MCCORD +++$+++ The C.I.A.
L29092 +++$+++ u3624 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Where?
L29091 +++$+++ u3625 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ MCCORD +++$+++ ...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
L29090 +++$+++ u3624 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Where in government?
L29089 +++$+++ u3625 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ MCCORD +++$+++ Government. Recently retired.
L29088 +++$+++ u3624 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Where?

L29083 +++$+++ u3624 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Your name, please.
L29683 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Nobody ever had too much.
L29682 +++$+++ u3627 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ MRS. GRAHAM +++$+++ We're going to need lots of good luck, aren't we?
L29680 +++$+++ u3627 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ MRS. GRAHAM +++$+++ I really want to know.
L29679 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ I would, if you really ever wanted to know.
L29678 +++$+++ u3627 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ MRS. GRAHAM +++$+++ You've never told anyone who he is?  But you'd have to tell me if I asked you.  Tell me.
L29677 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ It is.
L29676 +++$+++ u3627 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ MRS. GRAHAM +++$+++ But it's possible.
L29675 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ I couldn't say.
L29674 +++$+++ u3627 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ MRS. GRAHAM +++$+++ And the underground garage one.  Would I know him?
L29673 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Some Justice Department lawyers and an FBI man, and some people from the Committee to Re-Elect, yes ma'am.
L29672 +++$+++ u3627 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ MRS. GRAHAM +++$+++ Never? Please don't tell me never.  Ben says you've found some wonderful sources.
L29671 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ It may never come out.
L29670 +++$+++ u3627 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ MRS. GRAHAM +++$+++ When will you be, do you think?-- when are we going to know it all?
L29669 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ No.
L29668 +++$+++ u3627 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ MRS. GRAHAM +++$+++ Are you sure?
L29667 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ I think so.
L29666 +++$+++ u3627 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ MRS. GRAHAM +++$+++ You know, the paper was my father's and my husband's when they were alive and I was thinking back a year or two ago when Ben called me and said he wanted to publish the Pentagon Papers the next day. The Times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said "don't, don't" and I was frightened but I knew if I said no, I'd lose the whole fifth floor. So we published, and that night, after I'd told Ben to go ahead, I woke up in the darkness and I thought, "Oh my Lord, what am I doing to this newspaper?"  I woke up again last night with that same question.  Are we right on this story?
L29665 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ --I'm Woodward.
L29664 +++$+++ u3627 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ MRS. GRAHAM +++$+++ I'm so glad you could come, Mr.--
L29389 +++$+++ u3628 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ NATIONAL EDITOR +++$+++ --well, what if your boys get it wrong--
L29388 +++$+++ u3629 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ ROSENFELD +++$+++ --absolutely--and that's all they do, sit sit sit--every once in a while, they call up a Senator, some reporting--
L29387 +++$+++ u3628 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ NATIONAL EDITOR +++$+++ --well, I've got some pretty experienced fellas sitting around, wouldn't you say so?--
L29386 +++$+++ u3629 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ ROSENFELD +++$+++ Ask him what he's really saying--he means take the story away from Woodstein and give it to his people at the National Desk--
L29385 +++$+++ u3628 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ NATIONAL EDITOR +++$+++ --this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?
L29384 +++$+++ u3629 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ ROSENFELD +++$+++ --correction--when you were drinking your lunch at the bar of the Sans Souci--
L29381 +++$+++ u3629 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ ROSENFELD +++$+++ --quit equivocating, say what you mean--  --our story got Government Accounting to start an audit on CREEP's finances--
L29380 +++$+++ u3628 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ NATIONAL EDITOR +++$+++ --nobody gives a shit about the Dahlberg repercussions--
L29379 +++$+++ u3629 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ ROSENFELD +++$+++ --you are ignoring the importance of the Dahlberg repercussions--
L29621 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ --well, Sloan--
L29620 +++$+++ u3629 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ ROSENFELD +++$+++ --who you got?--
L29160 +++$+++ u3629 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ ROSENFELD +++$+++ I think we got a White House consultant linked to the bugging.
L29159 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ I never asked them about Watergate. I only said what were Hunt's duties at the White House. They volunteered that he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty.
L29158 +++$+++ u3629 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ ROSENFELD +++$+++ So?
L29153 +++$+++ u3635 +++$+++ m239 +++$+++ WOODWARD +++$+++ Hunt is Colson's man--  --that's Charles Colson, Nixon's special counsel--  --they both went to Brown University--  --Hunt worked for the C.I.A. till '70, and this is on deep background, the FBI thinks he's involved with the break-in.
