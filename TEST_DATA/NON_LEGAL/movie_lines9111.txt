L257666 +++$+++ u1223 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ KERI +++$+++ Okay, tell you what... you can still be the school R.A., but no dance tomorrow night.
L257665 +++$+++ u1225 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ I know.  I'm really, really sorry, Miss Tate.  Please let me keep the job... it's the only way I can afford to stay here.
L257664 +++$+++ u1223 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ KERI +++$+++ Molly, of all the people... if I can't trust my resident assistant, then what?
L257818 +++$+++ u1228 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I'll make sure there's no kids left in the dorms...
L257817 +++$+++ u1223 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ KERI +++$+++ We've got to get these kids out of here...
L257816 +++$+++ u1228 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Keri, you all right?
L257794 +++$+++ u1228 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Can't it wait till Monday?  I thought maybe we could dance...  I'm very light of my feet.
L257793 +++$+++ u1223 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ KERI +++$+++ I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things.
L257792 +++$+++ u1228 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Oh, right.  Sorry.
L257791 +++$+++ u1223 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ KERI +++$+++ Not a real fan of Halloween humor, Will.
L257756 +++$+++ u1228 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Do we have to invite him to the wedding?
L257755 +++$+++ u1223 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ KERI +++$+++ Yeah.
L257754 +++$+++ u1228 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ So you're really Michael Meyers' sister?
L257753 +++$+++ u1228 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Never.
L257752 +++$+++ u1223 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ KERI +++$+++ Are you going to leave, too?
L257751 +++$+++ u1228 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You just dropped a shitload on him... give him some time to digest it.
L257742 +++$+++ u1223 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ KERI +++$+++ Shit happens.
L257741 +++$+++ u1228 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I can't believe this is happening.
L257740 +++$+++ u1223 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ KERI +++$+++ No, Will, this isn't the alcohol talking.  It's the truth.
L257736 +++$+++ u1223 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ KERI +++$+++ He's my brother.
L257735 +++$+++ u1228 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ The serial killer?
L257734 +++$+++ u1223 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ KERI +++$+++ Michael Meyers.
L257733 +++$+++ u1228 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Who?
L257730 +++$+++ u1228 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You're right.  It does sound strange.
L257729 +++$+++ u1223 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ KERI +++$+++ My name hasn't always been Keri Tate.  It was once Laurie Strode.
L257728 +++$+++ u1228 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ What?
L257727 +++$+++ u1223 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ KERI +++$+++ There's something I have to tell you both.  It's going to sound strange...
L257619 +++$+++ u1223 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ KERI +++$+++ I'm fine.  I just need to lie down...
L257618 +++$+++ u1228 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ What are you looking at?
L257617 +++$+++ u1223 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ KERI +++$+++ What?
L257616 +++$+++ u1228 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Hey, you alright?
L257544 +++$+++ u1223 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ KERI +++$+++ Bye Will.
L257543 +++$+++ u1228 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ A box of fortune cookies... I'm running out of advice.
L257542 +++$+++ u1223 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ KERI +++$+++ I'm going into town... run a few errands before dark.  Need anything?
L257540 +++$+++ u1228 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Doesn't make it bad advice.
L257539 +++$+++ u1223 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ KERI +++$+++ Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?
L257538 +++$+++ u1228 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ The tighter you squeeze, the harder he'll try to break free.
L257537 +++$+++ u1223 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ KERI +++$+++ It's not going to happen.
L257536 +++$+++ u1228 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ This kid just wants his freedom.
L257535 +++$+++ u1223 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ KERI +++$+++ He's been living out of moving boxes for three months.
L257534 +++$+++ u1228 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Still wants to move out?
L257533 +++$+++ u1223 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ KERI +++$+++ It's always John.
L257532 +++$+++ u1228 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ It's John, isn't it?
L257530 +++$+++ u1223 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ KERI +++$+++ Nothing a good stiff drink can't fix.
L257529 +++$+++ u1228 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You okay?  You seem a little off.
L257528 +++$+++ u1223 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ KERI +++$+++ Looks great.  It does.
L257527 +++$+++ u1228 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Aren't they doing a terrific job this year?
L257785 +++$+++ u1224 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Can't you?
L257784 +++$+++ u1227 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ SHANE +++$+++ Can't you hold it?
L257783 +++$+++ u1224 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I have to pee.
L257782 +++$+++ u1227 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ SHANE +++$+++ What is it?
L257781 +++$+++ u1224 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Wait.
L257624 +++$+++ u1227 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ SHANE +++$+++ You think your mom knows we snuck out last night?
L257623 +++$+++ u1224 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Look, they're staring right at us.
L257776 +++$+++ u1224 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Oh, don't be such a victim.
L257775 +++$+++ u1225 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Have enough fun for the both of us.
L257774 +++$+++ u1224 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Let the party begin.
L257773 +++$+++ u1224 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Very insightful.
L257772 +++$+++ u1225 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ But the dance is in the gymnasium.
L257771 +++$+++ u1224 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Condom Boy is waiting for me in the cafeteria.
L257770 +++$+++ u1225 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Where's Shane?
L257769 +++$+++ u1224 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Thanks!
L257768 +++$+++ u1225 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus.
L257767 +++$+++ u1224 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Nope.  Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?
L257766 +++$+++ u1225 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough?!
L257765 +++$+++ u1224 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ You're so easy...

L257714 +++$+++ u1224 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Oh, they're so stupid... I'll just tell them he's going as a sausage casing.
L257713 +++$+++ u1225 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ You think they'll let him in dressed like that?
L257712 +++$+++ u1224 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I'll pop a Benadryl.
L257711 +++$+++ u1225 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ I thought you were allergic to latex.
L257710 +++$+++ u1224 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Shane's going as a condom.
L257679 +++$+++ u1225 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Big time.  And news travels fast. Wouldn't be surprised if the whole school knows about this one by tonight.
L257678 +++$+++ u1224 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Ooooh, busted.
L257628 +++$+++ u1225 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ You're unbelievable.

L257507 +++$+++ u1224 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ You say, "The key to my heart," and I'm gonna hurl.
L257506 +++$+++ u1225 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ What's this?
L257494 +++$+++ u1225 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ He gave me a fuckin' A?  Wow.

L257492 +++$+++ u1225 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ I did alright.
L257491 +++$+++ u1224 +++$+++ m80 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ You aced it, didn't you?
L261202 +++$+++ u1229 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ He's in the bathroom.
L261201 +++$+++ u1235 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ KARA +++$+++ Is Tim there?
L261200 +++$+++ u1229 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ We were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were --
L261199 +++$+++ u1235 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ KARA +++$+++ What are you doing there?  Where's my mother?
L261198 +++$+++ u1229 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Kara? ... No, this is Beth.
L261197 +++$+++ u1235 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ KARA +++$+++ Mom -- Who is this?
L260951 +++$+++ u1229 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ You mean Tommy.  Yeah, on the weirdness scale he's about an eleven.  Supposedly some scary shit happened to him when he was a kid.  Messed up his head.  He's harmless, though.  Probably just lonely.
L260950 +++$+++ u1235 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ KARA +++$+++ No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.
L260949 +++$+++ u1229 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Why?  You interested?
L260948 +++$+++ u1235 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ KARA +++$+++ Beth, who's that guy that lives across the hall from you?
L260939 +++$+++ u1229 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Pig.  What the hell happened this time?
L260938 +++$+++ u1235 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ KARA +++$+++ Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the Strode house.
L260937 +++$+++ u1229 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ He do that to you?
L261194 +++$+++ u1229 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ What if it's Kara?
L261193 +++$+++ u1237 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Answer what?
L261192 +++$+++ u1229 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Aren't you gonna answer that?
L261191 +++$+++ u1237 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Then they can watch.
L261190 +++$+++ u1229 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ What if your parents come home?
L261189 +++$+++ u1237 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Guess so ...
L261188 +++$+++ u1229 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Guess they -- went to the fair after all.
L261167 +++$+++ u1229 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ We can light our own tree at home.
L261166 +++$+++ u1237 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --
L261165 +++$+++ u1229 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd better go home and check on them. There's nothing else for us to do here.
L261164 +++$+++ u1237 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my sister?
L261163 +++$+++ u1229 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Jesus, that's my neighbor.  Tommy.
L261083 +++$+++ u1237 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Relax.  Everything's cool.  Didn't I tell you Harry would be here?
L261082 +++$+++ u1229 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Seven-thirty is the costume pageant ... Carving jack-o'-lanterns at eight ... Photos for the school paper at nine ... Then Harry lights the tree at nine- thirty ... I just know I'm forgetting something!
L260959 +++$+++ u1229 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Someone's trying to scare us out of having this fair ... and it's not gonna work.
L260958 +++$+++ u1237 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Happy fuckin' Halloween.
L260946 +++$+++ u1229 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Reality check, dillweed.  This is 1995.
L260945 +++$+++ u1237 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Whatever happened to women in back?
L260941 +++$+++ u1237 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Shit, Beth, why do we have to be the ones to organnize this friggin' fair? It's only Halloween.
L260940 +++$+++ u1229 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Hold on, hot lips.  We got work to do.
L261274 +++$+++ u1235 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ KARA +++$+++ Danny!!!

L261185 +++$+++ u1230 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Promise?
L261184 +++$+++ u1235 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ KARA +++$+++ No one's coming to get you.  Not while I'm around.
L261183 +++$+++ u1230 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I can't.  The voice man is coming to get me.
L261182 +++$+++ u1235 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ KARA +++$+++ There's nothing to be scared of, baby. It's just another storm.  Try to get some sleep.
L261181 +++$+++ u1230 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Mommy, I'm scared.
L261102 +++$+++ u1235 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ KARA +++$+++ Danny, you're just going to have to wait!
L261101 +++$+++ u1230 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Come on, Mom.  We're gonna miss all the fun stuff!
L261097 +++$+++ u1235 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ KARA +++$+++ You can't expect us to stay here --
L261096 +++$+++ u1230 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Mom, I want to go to the fair ...
L260835 +++$+++ u1235 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ KARA +++$+++ Okay ... But just for tonight.
L260834 +++$+++ u1230 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ No, Mom -- keep it on!
L260832 +++$+++ u1235 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ KARA +++$+++ Like what?
L260831 +++$+++ u1230 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ He says things.  Bad things.
L260830 +++$+++ u1235 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ KARA +++$+++ You've been watching too much TV.
L260829 +++$+++ u1230 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ But I've seen him!
L260828 +++$+++ u1235 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ KARA +++$+++ They did, did they?  Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?
L260827 +++$+++ u1230 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here.
L260826 +++$+++ u1235 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ KARA +++$+++ Home is here in Grandma and Grandpa's new house.  At least while I'm in college. Remember our deal.
L260819 +++$+++ u1230 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ The voice man!  He's here!
L260818 +++$+++ u1235 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ KARA +++$+++ Shh.  Mommy's here.  What is it?
L261057 +++$+++ u1231 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ DEBRA +++$+++ You knew, didn't you, John?  You knew.
L261056 +++$+++ u1234 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Debra, you're fuckin' insane.
L261055 +++$+++ u1231 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ DEBRA +++$+++ I'm getting the children out of here. At least until we know what we're dealing with.  John, I want you to come with us.
L261054 +++$+++ u1234 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What in God's name are you talking about, woman?  When are you gonna stop listening to those damned talk shows?
L261053 +++$+++ u1231 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ DEBRA +++$+++ John, they sound Jamie Lloyd this morning! Someone tried to kill her!
L261052 +++$+++ u1234 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
L261051 +++$+++ u1231 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ DEBRA +++$+++ He told me about the terrible things that happened here.  In our house.
L261050 +++$+++ u1231 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ DEBRA +++$+++ A man came by the house.  A psychiatrist by the name of Loomis.
L261049 +++$+++ u1234 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What is it this time?
L260917 +++$+++ u1231 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ DEBRA +++$+++ You'll never pass that exam on an empty stomach, Kara.
L260916 +++$+++ u1234 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ See what I'm talkin' about?
L260915 +++$+++ u1234 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Kids are what's ruining this country. Everywhere you go, it's the same.  No goddamn respect.
L260914 +++$+++ u1231 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ DEBRA +++$+++ Relax, John.  They were just kids.
L260913 +++$+++ u1234 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Shitheads ... Defacing my property.  I showed them ...
L261044 +++$+++ u1236 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ Mrs. Strode, Michael Myers is here to kill his family.  And he won't stop until you are all destroyed.  I only thank God that I found you before he did.
L261043 +++$+++ u1231 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ DEBRA +++$+++ God ... this can't be true.
L261042 +++$+++ u1236 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield as possible.
L261041 +++$+++ u1231 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ DEBRA +++$+++ What should I do?
L261035 +++$+++ u1236 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ Found this morning.  In a field outside Haddonfield.  Stabbed.
L261034 +++$+++ u1231 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ DEBRA +++$+++ Jamie?  But I thought she was --
L261033 +++$+++ u1236 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ This house is sacred to him.  It's the source of his memories -- his rage.  Mrs. Strode, I beg you.  Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her daughter.
L261032 +++$+++ u1231 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ DEBRA +++$+++ What makes you think he'll come here again?
L261031 +++$+++ u1236 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ He crept up these stairs and made his way into this room.  His sister's room. Right here. Where it all began.
L261024 +++$+++ u1236 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ I've come to help your family.
L261023 +++$+++ u1231 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ DEBRA +++$+++ Who are you?
L261022 +++$+++ u1236 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ I've been knocking.  The door was open. Is everything all right in here?
L260963 +++$+++ u1233 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ JAMIE +++$+++ It's ... Michael ... Michael Myers!
L260962 +++$+++ u1232 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ HARRY SIMMS +++$+++ Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
L260961 +++$+++ u1233 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ JAMIE +++$+++ No, please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
L260960 +++$+++ u1232 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ HARRY SIMMS +++$+++ So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be Rosemary.
L260891 +++$+++ u1233 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ JAMIE +++$+++ It's ... Michael ...  ... Michael Myers!
L260890 +++$+++ u1232 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ HARRY SIMMS +++$+++ Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
L260889 +++$+++ u1233 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ JAMIE +++$+++ No -- please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
L260888 +++$+++ u1232 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ HARRY SIMMS +++$+++ So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be Rosemary.
L261280 +++$+++ u1238 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ It's not working!
L261279 +++$+++ u1235 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ KARA +++$+++ Come on!
L261278 +++$+++ u1238 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Wait a minute ...
L261277 +++$+++ u1235 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ KARA +++$+++ What now?!
L261232 +++$+++ u1238 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Kara, no!
L261231 +++$+++ u1235 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ KARA +++$+++ Danny!  Danny, where are you?!
L261222 +++$+++ u1238 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ He's gone.
L261221 +++$+++ u1235 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ KARA +++$+++ Where's the baby?!
L261132 +++$+++ u1238 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Mrs. Blankenship, have you seen the little boy who came in with me and --
L261131 +++$+++ u1235 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ KARA +++$+++ Danny?!  Danny!
L261129 +++$+++ u1238 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ To find the rest of your family before Michael Myers does -- or whoever's been controlling him.
L261128 +++$+++ u1235 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ KARA +++$+++ Where are you going?
L261127 +++$+++ u1238 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ 'When applied directly to another person, Thorn could be used to call upon them confusion and destruction -- to literally visit them with the Devil.'
L261126 +++$+++ u1235 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ KARA +++$+++ Halloween.
L261125 +++$+++ u1238 +++$+++ m81 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Black magic ...  'In ancient times, Thorn was believed to cause sickness, famine and death. Translated literally, it was the name of a demon spirit that delivered human sacrifices ... on the Celtic celebration of Samhain.'
