L488310 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ This is all too familiar.
L488309 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Let's find out.
L488308 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Ssshh! What was that?
L488292 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Hallie?
L488291 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Shit! It's both of them. The first murders were to throw us - using the same names as Woodsboro. But they've moved on- -they're getting closer to Sidney. They're not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They're looking for the new Tatum.
L488290 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
L488289 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ And Joel's pre-med.
L488288 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ They're roomates.
L488286 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ We'd break some furniture.
L488285 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ ..and as lonely as I am...
L488284 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am...
L488283 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Dewey, you and I would never make it.
L488282 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ And it's sexier in the dark.
L488281 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ That's not the way it's done.
L488280 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Can we turn the light on?
L488279 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
L488278 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ What are we looking for?
L488277 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ You broke my heart.
L488271 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Billy had alibis too.
L488270 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Solid alibis. He was with Sidney when she was attacked.
L488269 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ He's already gotta be a part of Sid's life. What do you know about this Derek?
L488268 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Meaning?
L488267 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ If you were truly a copycat, wouldn't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could?
L488194 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Not good.
L488193 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Not good. How you doin?
L488135 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ I also know that you're an aging TV reporter slash writer who, despite huge tabloid success, has some self worth issues regarding your personal life which directly effects your professional life in a non-positive manner. A coupla failed relationships with--I'm guessing balding, older men--have turned you into this bitch with a cell phone. But I bet sometimes, late at night, when you're all alone a sadness seeps to the surface and in a moment of clarity you know that all you really want is to be touched and held and fondled.
L488134 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Yeah?
L488133 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ I know that.
L488132 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ And deep down I'm a good person? Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.
L488131 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ I think you're all an act.
L488130 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ You're a hard one to figure out. GALE It's that complex yet shallow quality. It's deliberate.
L488129 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.
L488128 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ So what made you change your mind about Sidney?
L487751 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ No, I'm the one who's sorry. I misjudged you. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some oozing to do.
L487750 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say except I'm sorry.
L487749 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ How do you know my dim-witted inexperience isn't merely a subtle form of manipulation used to lower people's expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation?
L487748 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ I never meant to imply...
L487747 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience."
L487746 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ You have every right to be upset.
L487745 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ No, what you are is a money hungry, fame- seeking liar and--forgive me for saying-- mediocre writer who has a cold storage shed where her heart should be.
L487744 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.
L487743 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Page 32. "Deputy Dewey filled the room with his dim-witted Barney Fifish presence." I think you've explained yourself.
L487742 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
L487741 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
L487740 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ I see you read the book.
L487739 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Yes, Miss Weathers, your name is embedded clearly between my ears.
L487737 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ I'm on crowd patrol, Miss Weathers, excuse me.
L487736 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned...
L487735 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Miss Weathers.
L487734 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Hello, Dwight.
L488273 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Whatever.
L488272 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Hey, I got stuff to do. But I'll find you later, okay.
L488249 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Humor me, Sid.
L488248 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Dewey, there's no such place.
L488247 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ The police are waiting outside. They're going to take you somewhere safe.
L487654 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ No. This is nothing, Dewey. I'll be okay. Go back to work and let me get back to my quasi pseudo-happy existence.
L487653 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Just in case...
L487652 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Dewey, I'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat...
L487651 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Don't worry...
L487650 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ You go, it's all stairs, I can take it from here.
L487647 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ No. I will not crawl under a rock. This is a fucked-up world and people kill people all the time. I'll just get used to it.
L487646 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Look, Sid, why don't you take off? Disappear for a few days. I'll come with you.
L487645 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Yeah, right.
L487644 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ As of now, they don't see any relation. But they're checking it out. The state, Special Task Force, FBI--they're all here. They'll find the guy.
L487643 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ It's a copycat killer I knew this would happen. That fucking movie.
L487642 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ They don't know. It was carefully planned. Earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie.
L487641 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Oh my God. How could it happen?
L487640 +++$+++ u7469 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ They thought it was a publicity stunt.
L487639 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Three hundred people watched? Nobody did anything?
L487998 +++$+++ u7476 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ Watch your back.
L487997 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ No, wait...

L487983 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ I don't play games.
L487982 +++$+++ u7476 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ That's not the way we play the game.
L487981 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Who are you?
L487980 +++$+++ u7476 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ I'll give you one guess.
L487979 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Who is this?

L487761 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas.
L487760 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ It seems to be causing a stir. What's with the toilet paper?
L487759 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Yeah, well...you are the definition of mixed emotions. I really should hate you... I see your movie's getting good reviews.

L488448 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ Oh, Sid, you’re sounding desparate. I guess fearing death makes one anxious.
L488258 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ It's not a good idea, Hallie.
L488257 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ I'm the only one who can cut him down.

L487614 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Hello?  Hello?
L487613 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ Knock yourself out.
L487604 +++$+++ u7473 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ IN THE THEATER +++$+++ The knife slices into Maureen again...then again. The theatre audience is starting to take note as the Ghost keeps slashing at her repeatedly with the knife. A horrifying, sickening sight.
L487603 +++$+++ u7480 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ ON SCREEN +++$+++ The young girl is slashed again.
L487602 +++$+++ u7473 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ IN THE THEATER +++$+++ Popcorn flies as Maureen falls forward, into the aisle, clutching her bloody stomach. She's speechless, unable to SCREAM. She holds her bloody hand out for all to see, begging for help. She stumbles down the aisle. Someone YELLS "Sit down." Maureen turns to several PEOPLE who begin to react. She turns behind her to see the Ghost Face coming at her again...knife raised.
L487601 +++$+++ u7480 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ ON SCREEN +++$+++ The young girl, clutching her bloody chest...drags herself, crawling across wet grass...the killer behind her...raising his knife again.
L487598 +++$+++ u7473 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ IN THE THEATER +++$+++ Maureen looks at Phil, confused...as if seeing for the first time...IT'S NOT PHIL. She pulls away when, the Ghost-masked Figure grabs her with one hand, the other one clutching the hunting knife. Maureen sees it, her mouth billowing forth a LOUD SCREAM That is matched by the entire audience as they SCREAM at the screen.
L487597 +++$+++ u7480 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ ON SCREEN +++$+++ The Ghost advances on the young girl, grabbing her, pulling her to him, raising high a long, hunting knife. The young girl is helpless...
L487591 +++$+++ u7473 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ IN THE THEATER +++$+++ Everyone in the theater is SCREAMING. Maureen tries her best to detach herself from the movie. She eats her popcorn.
L487590 +++$+++ u7480 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ ON SCREEN +++$+++ The young girl runs by a window. She looks in. A GHOST MASKED KILLER stares back. The Figure CRASHES through the window attacking her. She fights him off, getting away, running...
L487584 +++$+++ u7473 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ IN THE THEATER +++$+++ The crowd is really with the movie. Some even talk to the screen. "You dumb bitch. Get out of the house." etc.
L487583 +++$+++ u7480 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ ON SCREEN +++$+++ A patio chair comes flying through a glass door. The young girl in the movie tears off running, SCREAMING, flying through the room.
L488066 +++$+++ u7474 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ It's documented. Most serial killers are attractive--slightly off white males in their twenties.
L488065 +++$+++ u7478 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Easy black boy.
L488064 +++$+++ u7474 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ And white.

L488053 +++$+++ u7478 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Her old boyfriend?
L488052 +++$+++ u7474 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Randy Meeks.  He was with Sid that night in Woodsboro.
L488048 +++$+++ u7474 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Is that cool? Just to leave her like that?
L488047 +++$+++ u7478 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I've been waiting for you, baby.
L487945 +++$+++ u7478 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I counted four.
