L636562 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.
L636561 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ Then why didn't you help him?
L636560 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ I don't understand what you're saying. I saw Keaton get shot, I swear to you.
L636559 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ YOU KNOW. YOU'VE KNOWN THIS WHOLE FUCKING TIME. GIVE IT TO ME.
L636558 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about.
L636557 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ TRY TO REEF LYING TO ME NOW. I KNOW EVERYTHING .
L636556 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ YES YOU DO. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GETTING AT. THE TRUTH. TRY TO TELL ME YOU DIDN'T KNOW. TRY TO TELL ME YOU SAW SOMEONE KILL KEATON .
L636555 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ I don't.
L636554 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ Don't shine me, Verbal. No more stalling. You know what I'm getting at.
L636552 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ I don't have a minute. Are you saying it was Keyser Soze? You told the D.A. you didn't know who it was.
L636551 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ Wait a minute.
L636550 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ A man in a suit with a slim build. Tall.
L636469 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ I tried, believe me, but Keaton wouldn't have it. It was too far-fetched for him. Keaton was a grounded guy. An ex-cop. To a cop, the explanation is never that complicated. It's always simple. There's
L636468 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ Why didn't you say anything?
L636467 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ I wanted to. I thought we could make it.
L636450 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster.
L636449 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ What call?
L636448 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.
L636447 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ Then what?
L636445 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ What happened?
L636444 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ Give a guy a break, huh?
L636443 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ You're stalling, Verbal.
L636442 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ The quartet is part of the bit about Kobayashi. The quartet was in my file, along with every other thing I had done since high school, see? Aliases, middle- men. They knew me better than I did. They knew all of us.
L636441 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ Can we just get back to Kobayashi?
L636440 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ Oh, but it's not. If I hadn't been nailed in Illinois for running a three card monte in between sets, I never would have took off for New York. I never would have met Keaton, see. That barber shop quartet was the reason for everything.
L636439 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ This is totally irrelevant.
L636438 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ That was how I ended up in a barber shop quartet in Skokie, Illinois.
L636430 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ Gee, thanks, Dave. Bang-up job so far. Extortion, coercion. You'll pardon me if I ask you to kiss my pucker. The same fuckers that rounded us up and sank us into this mess are telling me They'll bail me out? Fuck you. You think you can catch Keyser Soze? You think a guy like that comes this close to getting fingered and sticks his head out? If he comes up for anything, it will be to get rid of me.  After that, my guess is you'll never hear from him again.
L636429 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ So why play into his hands? We can protect you.
L636428 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ Where's your head, Agent Kujan? Where do you think the pressure's coming from? Keyser Soze - or whatever you want to call him - knows where I am right now. He's got the front burner under' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later. Immunity was just to deal with you assholes. I got a whole new problem when I post bail.
L636427 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ If there is a Keyser Soze he'll be looking for you.
L636426 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ I've got immunity now. What can you possibly offer me?
L636425 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ Turn state's evidence. Take the stand on this and we'll hear it out.
L636424 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ You tell me, Agent Kujan. If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?
L636423 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ And this is why you never told the D.A.
L636422 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ I came clean. I told it like it happened on the boat. So what if I left out how I got there? It's got so many holes in it, the D.A. would've told me to blow amnesty out my ass. So you got what you wanted out of me. Big fucking deal.
L636415 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ Keaton always said: &quot;I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him.&quot; Well I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser SOZE.
L636414 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ Do you believe in him, Verbal?
L636346 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ And why leave this out when you talked to the D.A.?
L636345 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ Right.
L636344 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ Came from Redfoot.
L636343 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ Kobayashi.
L636342 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ So this lawyer...
L636248 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ Convince me. Tell me every last detail. 52    SCENE DELETED                                                              52 53    INT. HOSPITAL - DAY                                                  53                         + Kovash's room is now filled with people. Jack Baer stands next to DANIEL METZHEISER, a balding man in his forties. Next to him is Doctor Plumber. Across from her is Ridgly Waiters.
L636247 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ No. But I'm sure Keaton's dead.
L636246 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ Is he the one that killed Keaton?
L636245 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ There was a lawyer. Kobayashi.
L636244 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ NOT FROM ME, YOU PIECE OF SHIT. THERE IS NO IMMUNITY FROM ME. You atone with me or the world you live in becomes the hell you fear in the back of your tiny mind. Every criminal I have put in prison,
L636243 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ The D.A. gave me immunity.
L636242 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ You think I don't know you held out on the D.A.? What did you leave out of that testimony? I can be on the phone to Ruby Deemer in ten minutes.
L636239 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ What lawyer?
L636238 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ He wasn't behind anything. It was the lawyer.
L636237 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ I don't think you do. But you say you saw Keaton die. I think you're covering his ass and he's still out there somewhere. I think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor. My bet is he's using you because you're stupid and you think he's your friend. You tell me he's dead, so be it. I want to make sure he's dead before I go back to New York.
L636236 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ I don't know about that.
L636232 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ Do I? Keaton was under indictment a total                 + of seven times when he was on the force.                  + In every case, witnesses either reversed                  + their testimony to the grand jury or died                 + before they could testify. When they                      t finally did nail him for fraud, he spent                  + five years in Sing Sing. He killed three prisoners inside - one with a knife in the tailbone while he strangled him to death. Of course I can't prove this but I can't prove the best part either.
L636231 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ You got him wrong.
L636230 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ Let me tell you something. I know Dean Keaton. I've been investigating him for three years. The guy I know is a cold-                    + blooded bastard. L.A.P.D. indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force, so don't sell me the hooker with the heart of gold.                        +
L636229 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ You keep trying to lay this whole ride on                 t Keaton. It wasn't like that. Sure he knew, but Edie had him all turned around.                 r I'm telling you straight, I swear.                        +
L636228 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ Come on. Keaton was a cop for four years. Who else would know the Taxi Service
L636227 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ That was all Fenster and McManus.
L636226 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ Sure. And I'm supposed to believe that hitting the Taxi Service wasn't his idea
L636225 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ He loved her.
L636224 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ Oh come on, Verbal. Who do you think you're talking to? You really expect me to believe he retired? For a woman? Bullshit. He was using her.
L636223 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ You wanted to know what happened after the line-up, I'm telling you.
L636222 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ Heartwarming. Really, I feel weepy.
L636107 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ I'm not a rat.
L636106 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ I'11 get right to the point. I'm smarter than you. I'11 find out what I want to know and I'11 get it from you whether you like it or not.
L636105 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ No.
L636104 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ The first thing I learned on the job, know what it was? How to spot a murderer. Let's say you arrest three guys for the same killing. Put them all in jail overnight. The next morning, whoever is sleeping is your man. If you're guilty, you know you're caught, you get some rest - let your guard down, you follow?
L636103 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ I'11 be sure to mention that to him.
L636102 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ There's nothing in there about Ruby.
L636100 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ I know Ruby. He's very big on respect. Likes me very much.
L636099 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ He didn't have my lawyer.
L636098 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ You know Ruby is in Attica?
L636097 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ You know a religious guy named John Paul?
L636096 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer, Verbal?
L636095 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ Well I do have the weapons charge. I'm looking at six whole months hard time.
L636094 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ Oh, I know. Sweet deal you have. Total immunity .
L636093 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ That's been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible.
L636092 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ According to your statement you are a short-con operator. Run of the mill seams. Everything you do, you learned from somebody else.
L636090 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ I just want to hear your story.
L636089 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ You trying to get a rise out of me, Agent Kujan?
L636088 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ Keaton was a piece of shit.
L636087 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ Sure. Fifteen years ago, but he was a good thief Anyway, the cops wouldn't let him go legit.
L636086 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ He was a corrupt cop, Verbal.
L636085 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ I know he was good.
L636084 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ I know you liked Keaton I know you think he was a good man.
L636083 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ I told the D.A. everything I know.
L636082 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ Verbal, I know you know something. I know you're not telling us everything.
L636081 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ Sure. And I appreciate that. And I want to help you, Agent Kujan. I like cops. I would have liked to have been a Fed myself but my C.P. was -
L636080 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ Verbal, you know we're trying to help you.
L636029 +++$+++ u8734 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VOICE #1 +++$+++ Counselor, you're bluffing. Shall I push for misdemeanor two?
L636028 +++$+++ u8735 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VOICE #2 +++$+++ Counselor, you're insulting me.
L636027 +++$+++ u8734 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VOICE #1 +++$+++ Weapons. Misdemeanor one.
L636026 +++$+++ u8735 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VOICE #2 +++$+++ You're joking.
L636025 +++$+++ u8734 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VOICE #1 +++$+++ Mr. Kint will plead guilty to weapons possession.
L636024 +++$+++ u8735 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VOICE #2 +++$+++ I'11 take my chances then. I'11 feel safer without a job if a man like Mr. Kint is behind bars.
L636021 +++$+++ u8734 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VOICE #1 +++$+++ Then prosecute. I will be very impressed to see if the District Attorney manages to bring in twenty-seven simultaneous counts of murder against one man with cerebral palsy. I would think a man with your job would agree with these alleged &quot;faceless people in City Hall&quot; you mention.
L636020 +++$+++ u8735 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VOICE #2 +++$+++ Counselor, I will prosecute your client.
L636019 +++$+++ u8734 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VOICE #1 +++$+++ Immunity.
L636018 +++$+++ u8735 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VOICE #2 +++$+++ May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it. I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't care. The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here.
L636017 +++$+++ u8734 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VOICE #1 +++$+++ No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity.
L636016 +++$+++ u8735 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VOICE #2 +++$+++ The district attorney's office will comply provided -
L636015 +++$+++ u8734 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VOICE #1 +++$+++ My client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings. In exchange, his testimony is to be sealed and all matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible.
L637820 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Ah.  How did they treat you?
L637819 +++$+++ u8736 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ ABRAMS +++$+++ Yes.
L637818 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Good.    You ever been inside a hospital?
L637817 +++$+++ u8736 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ ABRAMS +++$+++ I'm fine.
L637816 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Abrams.  Yes.  How are you today?
L637815 +++$+++ u8736 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ ABRAMS +++$+++ Abrams...
L637814 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Mr. Abraham...
L638093 +++$+++ u8757 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ YOUNG LAWYER +++$+++ As far as we know, nothing.
L638092 +++$+++ u8737 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
L638091 +++$+++ u8757 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ YOUNG LAWYER +++$+++ Very good.
L638090 +++$+++ u8737 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ How good's your intelligence?
L638089 +++$+++ u8757 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ YOUNG LAWYER +++$+++ Nothing.
L638088 +++$+++ u8737 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ What did he find?
L638087 +++$+++ u8757 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ YOUNG LAWYER +++$+++ She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
L638086 +++$+++ u8737 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
L637615 +++$+++ u8737 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ Yes.
L637614 +++$+++ u8738 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ I know that answer.  If we went to trial would we win?
L637613 +++$+++ u8737 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ Well, of course, it's always dangerous ...
L637612 +++$+++ u8738 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
L637611 +++$+++ u8737 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ All right.  But let's keep the price down.  I've called Ed Concannon.  He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
L637610 +++$+++ u8738 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ So what I want to do is stop it here.  I'm going to make him an offer.  I want to do it myself.  I want it to come from me.
L637609 +++$+++ u8737 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ No.  Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
L637608 +++$+++ u8738 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ I want to settle this thing and be done with it.  I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
L637607 +++$+++ u8737 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ Neither does he.  That's where he loses.  This man's scared to death to go to court.  We only have to call his bluff.
L637606 +++$+++ u8738 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ No -- we don't want this case in court.
L637605 +++$+++ u8737 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ This is a nuisance suit.  He's looking for small change.  He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
L637604 +++$+++ u8738 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ ... tell me about this case.
L637603 +++$+++ u8737 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ The man's an ambulance chaser ...
L637602 +++$+++ u8738 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ Four cases in three years ...
L637601 +++$+++ u8737 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ Accused.  Not indicted.  He resigned the firm.  Divorced nineteen seventy.  Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy-eight.  Since then he's been on his own.  Four cases before the Circuit Court.  He lost them all.  He drinks.
L637600 +++$+++ u8738 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ He was accused of jury tampering.
L637709 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone.  She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends --and the people who should care for her:  her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way.  We have been paid to look the other way.  I came in here to take your money.   I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money.   I can't take it.  If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser.    I can't do it. I can't take it.
L637708 +++$+++ u8738 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ What is the truth?
L637707 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ And no one will know the truth.
L637706 +++$+++ u8738 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.
L637705 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Yes.  It would be.
L637704 +++$+++ u8738 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ That was our insurance company's recommendation.
L637703 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount.  Two Hundred Ten Thousand.  That would mean I keep seventy.
L637702 +++$+++ u8738 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ Yes.
L637701 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ You thought it was just.
L637700 +++$+++ u8738 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ We thought it was just.
L637699 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ How did you settle on the amount?
