L514247 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Same here. But I had a long talk with my accountant this afternoon. You know, to see how a move like this would affect my tax picture, and he said it would be okay.
L514246 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I didn't expect to see you again.
L514176 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Suit yourself. But if you change your mind, here's the address. 
L514175 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ I can take care of myself. Don't worry.
L514174 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ In case you're wondering, I like women, not little boys. And I'm not offering you a long-term lease -- just a place to crash for a couple of nights.
L514173 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Thanks, but I'll manage.
L514172 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I'm not "people." I'm just me. And I do whatever I goddamn want to do. Got it?
L514171 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ People don't do that kind of thing. Not in New York.
L514170 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ But your body is in the world, isn't it?  If someone offered you a place to stay, you wouldn't necessarily refuse, would you?
L514169 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ The material world is an illusion. It doesn't matter if they're there or not. The world is in my head.
L514168 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Except that there's no bed, is there? And no breakfast either.
L514167 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Yeah, that's right.
L514166 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places, probably.
L514165 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Here and there. Around.
L514164 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You can't be more specific than that?
L514163 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ The what.  I've kind of run away from home, you see.  It has nothing to do with my parents or money. I saw something I wasn't supposed to see, and for the time being it's best that I keep myself out of sight.
L514162 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ The what?
L514161 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ That's where the what comes in.
L514160 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Then what are you doing in Park Slope? It's a little far from home, isn't it?
L514159 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Of course. Where else?
L514158 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ In Manhattan?
L514157 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ East Seventy-fourth Street.
L514156 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ And where do Momsie and Popsie live?
L514155 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles.
L514154 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ That's true. But I also owe you something, and I'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job.  What is it? Family problems? Money problems?
L514153 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ You don't know me from a hole in the wall.
L514152 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I might be able to help.
L514151 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Mostly what.
L514136 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Cocktail hour is over. The young man would like to order a hamburger.
L514135 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Well, maybe just one. To be polite.
L514134 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Look, kid, it's okay with me. You don't have to play games. If you want a hamburger or something, go ahead and order it.
L514133 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Just one bottle. I believe in moderation.
L514132 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Yeah, sure, and I bet you had lobster last night. Along with two bottles of champagne.
L514131 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ I mean breakfast.
L514130 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You must eat lunch pretty early. It's only eleven o'clock.
L514129 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ That's okay. I've already had lunch.
L514128 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Are you sure you don't want some food to go along with it? It might help to absorb some of that liquid. You don't want to slosh around too much when you stand up.
L514127 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Rashid. Rashid Cole. 
L514126 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Good. Lemonade it is.  I'm Paul.
L514125 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ I don't drink coffee.  On the other hand, since you insist, if you offered me a cold lemonade. I wouldn't say no.
L514124 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Come on. At least let me buy you a cup of coffee.
L514123 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you.
L514122 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance.
L514121 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Well, if you put it that way...
L514120 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Yes it is. It's a law of the universe. If I let you walk away, the moon will spin out of orbit ... pestilence will reign over the city for a hundred years.
L514119 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ It's okay, mister. No big deal.
L514118 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I owe you something.
L514117 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ I just happened to be there.  The right place at the right time.
L514116 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ No, wait. You can't just walk off.  You saved my life.
L514115 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ No harm done. Everything's okay now.  I've got to be going.
L514114 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
L514113 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Watch out, man. You'll get yourself killed like that.
L514150 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I don't mean to pry, but I see a kid walking around with a big knapsack on his back, and I begin to wonder if all his worldly possessions aren't stowed in there. Are you in some kind of trouble or what?
L514149 +++$+++ u7688 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ WAITRESS +++$+++ If you're lucky.  Then again, it depends on what you call living. 
L514148 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I'll take the iced coffee.  You only live once, right?
L514147 +++$+++ u7688 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ WAITRESS +++$+++ Everything is real in here, honey.  As real as the color of my hair.
L514146 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Do you have real iced coffee, or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes?
L514145 +++$+++ u7688 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ WAITRESS +++$+++ Hot coffee or iced coffee?
L514144 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Yeah, give him another one. And I'll take a cup of coffee while you're at it.
L514143 +++$+++ u7688 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ WAITRESS +++$+++ You want another one of these, too?
L514142 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Yes, please.
L514141 +++$+++ u7688 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ WAITRESS +++$+++ Lettuce and tomato?
L514140 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Yes, please.
L514139 +++$+++ u7688 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ WAITRESS +++$+++ Fries?
L514138 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Medium rare, please.
L514137 +++$+++ u7688 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ WAITRESS +++$+++ How do you want that cooked?
L517126 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ Didn't say I was buyin' did I? What you want down?  Just bein' curious, is all.
L517125 +++$+++ u7690 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ $1200 an acre, that's what I paid Ole, won't take a dime less.  You got no choice on that.
L517124 +++$+++ u7690 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Hid it from my mom.  Caught a mess a sea runs.  Damn thing's still in my closet.
L517123 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ Oh, yeh?
L517122 +++$+++ u7690 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ I am a bastard.  I'm a big Hun Nazi son of a bitch.  And I still got your bamboo fishing rod.
L517118 +++$+++ u7690 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ ...<u>might</u> do the same.  I have to warn you 'bout that, chief.  I'm not screwed together like I used to be.
L517117 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ The battery's in, that's done with.  Besides, you'd do the same for m...
L517114 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ What are you sellin' 'em for? Why don't we start there.
L517113 +++$+++ u7690 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Seven acres.  I'm wonderin' what you'd pay for 'em.  Just curious, is all.
L517112 +++$+++ u7698 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ KABUO +++$+++ Keep it tonight.  We'll catch fish. I'll see ya back on the docks...
L517111 +++$+++ u7690 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Don't know how long it's take to get a charge...
L516851 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ ...or from the cut on his hand. Which is more probable?
L516850 +++$+++ u7691 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ DR. WHITMAN +++$+++ I'm a hemotologist, not a detective.
L516849 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ With no bone or scalp or hair present.  Would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man's skull...
L516846 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ You don't.
L516845 +++$+++ u7691 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ DR. WHITMAN +++$+++ I don't know.
L516844 +++$+++ u7691 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ DR. WHITMAN +++$+++ I'm a hemotologist, sir, I was asked only t...
L516843 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Well, if the blood got <u>onto</u> the gaff by crushing a man's skull...
L516842 +++$+++ u7691 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ DR. WHITMAN +++$+++ None.
L516841 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
L516840 +++$+++ u7691 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ DR. WHITMAN +++$+++ Bits of blood and wood.  What else would there be?
L516839 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ You scraped the dried blood from the <u>butt</u> of the gaff.  Where a fella's <u>hand</u> goes.  And what did you see under your microscope, besides the B positive blood and the wood scrapings...?
L516838 +++$+++ u7691 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ DR. WHITMAN +++$+++ That's obvious.
L516837 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ And the blood could <u>not</u> have belonged to defendant.  Seeing that his type is O negative.
L516836 +++$+++ u7691 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ DR. WHITMAN +++$+++ No, but as I say, the type is rare. Ten percent of Caucasian males.
L516835 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ But you can't say with any certainty that the blood was his.
L516834 +++$+++ u7691 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ DR. WHITMAN +++$+++ Carl Heine's type.
L516833 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ So the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at all.  It was <u>human</u>, yes?  Type B positive.
L516590 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Did he see some <u>danger</u> from defen...
L516589 +++$+++ u7692 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ETTA +++$+++ That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto. Watch out for him.
L516588 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ When your son came back from the war, what did he say about all this?
L516587 +++$+++ u7692 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ETTA +++$+++ Well.  Every time I see him in town or somewhere, he's starin' at me with these narrow eyes. Givin' me his mean face.
L516586 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ What do you mean by 'dirty looks'?
L516578 +++$+++ u7692 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ETTA +++$+++ Just showed up at my door, big as life and twice as mean.  Wanted to talk to my son.
L516577 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ And when he came home.  Did he write you about this?  Or phone, perhaps.
L516576 +++$+++ u7692 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ETTA +++$+++ In the war.  Europe, I believe. They could hardly send him to the Pacific, could they?
L516575 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Now defendant's father had also died by that point.  Where was the defendant?  When you sent his family their equity.
L516548 +++$+++ u7692 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ETTA +++$+++ Their kids was born here.  So when the oldest, that one there, was twenty...last payment gets made, and he could own it.
L516547 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Why?  If they could never take title.
L516546 +++$+++ u7692 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ETTA +++$+++ Carl held it <u>for</u> 'em.  Called it a lease.  They make payments every June and December...
L516545 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ But back in '34, Japanese-born could not <u>own</u> land.  So...?
L516538 +++$+++ u7692 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ETTA +++$+++ They fished t'gether.  Went to school. Carl Junior treated him like a white person.  Like any friend.
L516537 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ So the defendant knew the deceased, your son, even then.
L516536 +++$+++ u7692 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ETTA +++$+++ Him and his folks and two brothers and two sisters worked our land. Lived in a picker's cabin at first.
L516602 +++$+++ u7692 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ETTA +++$+++ You done your math right.
L516601 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ It is.
L516600 +++$+++ u7692 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ETTA +++$+++ Is that your third question?
L516599 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ So that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000, doesn't it?  If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of $2500.
L516598 +++$+++ u7692 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ETTA +++$+++ A thousand.
L516597 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Second question.  What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?
L516596 +++$+++ u7692 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ETTA +++$+++ Tried to.  Defaulted on their payments.
L516595 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Just three questions.  The Miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $4500?
L517079 +++$+++ u7693 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ GILLANDERS +++$+++ Well, it does seem mighty warm in here.  Specially for Mr. Hooks.
L517078 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Gillanders.  Thank you for coming down, in this cold weather.
L517077 +++$+++ u7693 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ GILLANDERS +++$+++ Now, how is Miyamoto gonna know in <u>advance</u>?  That Carl loses two batteries.  Must happen once ever' 20 years or so.
L517076 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Well, what if?
L517075 +++$+++ u7693 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ GILLANDERS +++$+++ You mean Miyamoto followed him out there, and sucker-punched him?
L517074 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ All right, what if the defendant <u>heard</u>?  So Carl <u>let</u> him aboard, to help.  And <u>then</u> the fishing gaff?
L517073 +++$+++ u7693 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ GILLANDERS +++$+++ Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.
L517072 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Course, if Carl lost both batteries, dead in the water, his radio wouldn't work.  So how would he signal for help?
L517071 +++$+++ u7693 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ GILLANDERS +++$+++ Boat has two batteries.  Lose one you run off the other til morning. Carl musta lost both, so Miyamoto there gave him one a his.
L517070 +++$+++ u7693 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ GILLANDERS +++$+++ No sense to have <u>any</u> at all., even the right size.  It's like having an extra battery in the trunk of your car.  Nobody does.
L517069 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Now the sheriff believed that the D-6 battery in Carl's well was Carl's own spare.  Even though it was too large f...
L517068 +++$+++ u7693 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ GILLANDERS +++$+++ Couldn't get on the boat.  I'd just <u>shoot</u> the feller.  <u>Then</u> tie up, throw him inta th' drink.  And skip bein' the first gill-netter in history to make a successful forced boarding.
L517067 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ So the fishing gaff method wouldn't make sense?
L517066 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ I'm sorry about that.  It wasn't mine in the first place.
L517065 +++$+++ u7693 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ GILLANDERS +++$+++ It's a joke.  Maneuver up to Carl's boat?  Tie your lines fast?  Come aboard?  All against Carl's will? It's the stupidest suggestion I ever heard of.
L517064 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Now if you wanted to kill a man. Think you'd try boarding against his will, and hitting him with a fishing gaff?
L517063 +++$+++ u7693 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ GILLANDERS +++$+++ Unwritten rule of the sea.  We don't bother each other, stick to ourselves. Ask anybody.
L517062 +++$+++ u7702 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ NELS +++$+++ Now, Mister Gi...
L517059 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ I said.  No further questions.
L517058 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ You're implying th...
L517057 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Question withdrawn, you may step down.
L517055 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ It seems human.  To me.
L517054 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Doesn't it seem to <u>you</u>, Mrs. Miyamoto, that your mistake was in being deceitful?  Concealing information during the course of a sheriff's investigation.
L517053 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Well, it seems to me...
L517052 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ We were afraid.  Silence seemed better.  To come forward seemed like a mistake.
L517051 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ So you hid the truth.  Deliberately.
L517050 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ Trials aren't only about truth, Mr. Hooks.  Even though they should be.  They're about what people <u>believe</u> is true.
L517049 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ But if truth was on your side, whatever were you worried about?
L517048 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ Because the facts could be misconstrued as murder.
L517047 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Why not?
L517046 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ We discussed that.  And decided not to.
L517043 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Up in the air?  Was <u>that</u> your reaction?
L517042 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ Yes, and then, what was there to call about?  Everything was up in the air.
L517041 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ And then, something did.  Carl Heine was found dead.  With his head crushed.
L517040 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ Of course not.  We're just not quick to run and boast.  In case something went wrong.
L517039 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ You thought the deceased might... break his promise?
L517037 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ So, five hours.  Plenty of time for a call.  He was 'excited', you say. In the sense of being 'overjoyed'.
L517036 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ Closer to eight.
L517035 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
L517034 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ We hear how Carl...passed away. Only a few hours later.
L517032 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ So, then, you...and your husband... must have called friends, relatives, to tell them the amazing news.  Yes?
L517031 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ Happy for him.  And relieved.
L517030 +++$+++ u7696 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HOOKS +++$+++ You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?
L517029 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ I said 'excited'.  Not agitated, he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed.
L517197 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ It's not for the.  They only get to convict him.
L517196 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ I did.  But the jury won't s...
L517195 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ Did you write that column?
L516968 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Look, I <u>want</u> to forget you, I do. I think if you hold me, just this once, I can walk away and never speak to you again.
L516967 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ You have to hear this, I can never touch you, Ishmael.  Not once, not ever.  There's no half- way.  As much as I know it hurts you, you have to let this go.
L516960 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ There's no one here, and I've <u>got</u> to talk to you.
L516959 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ I'm married, Ishmael.  It isn't right for us to be alone.  People will t...
L516939 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ The Japs did it.
L516938 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ I'm sorry about your arm.  Kabuo and I.  Are very sor...
L516937 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ I couldn't say anything.  I just stood there, hating her.
L516922 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ I don't mean everyone.  Just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them.  Or run a newspaper.
L516921 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ We all expect the world to be fair. As if we have some right t...
L516684 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ Look at my face.  It's the face of the people who did that.  My father hardly speaks English.  We're in bad trouble, you have to see that.
L516683 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ It's just Pearl Harbor.  People are a little crazy, right n...

L516667 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ I lie to my parents every day. And every night.

L516665 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Well, I don't do it for just anybody.
L516664 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ I can just feel my spirits soar.
L516531 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Why?  We're only talking.
L516530 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ My mom.  Would be the problem.
L516529 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ We're Japanese, not Mexican, Ishmael. He'll slice you up with a ceremonial sword.
L516528 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Your friends would.  Your dad would kill me with a machete.
L516527 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ The best part was that there was a 'this'.  To debate the wrongness of.
L516507 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ Easy.  Slow is best.
L516506 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ I told myself that was good.  That it made our friendship special.  And didn't mean she was ashamed of it. Necessarily.
L516505 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ At school, she kept mostly to the Japanese kids, and sort of ignored me.  As if all of our times alone together...in the hollow cedar, everywhere...were a secret.
L516504 +++$+++ u7694 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HATSUE +++$+++ He's still got a good grip.  We need to dig more.
L516994 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ ...but he found you.
L516993 +++$+++ u7695 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Your father fought at Belleau Wood, it took him years to get over it.  Nightmares, tears, b...
L516988 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Those aren't the facts that matter.
L516987 +++$+++ u7695 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ They're not his neighbor, like you are.  He is a husband, a father, he risked his <u>life</u> for <u>their</u> country. The same as you.
L516986 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Seattle boys think he's guilty.  They say the evidence is rock solid.
L516985 +++$+++ u7695 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ They only arrested that poor soul because he's Japanese.
L516984 +++$+++ u7695 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ You've been busy with that trial, I suppose.  Such a travesty...
L516983 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ I felt Milholland's report in my pocket.  And wondered why I wasn't telling her.  Telling someone. What I'd found.
L516979 +++$+++ u7697 +++$+++ m520 +++$+++ ISHMAEL +++$+++ Agnostics don't believe or disbelieve, Ma.  We just don't pretend we know.
