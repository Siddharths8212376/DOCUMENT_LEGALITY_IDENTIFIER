L208615 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ Music! Turn it up. Put that tape on.
L208614 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ You evil son of a bitch. You better hope there's some Thorazine in that bag, because if there's not, you're in bad trouble.
L208607 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Look you better put that blade away and get your head straight. I have to put the car in the lot.
L208606 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ Have you made a deal with him? Did you put him on to her?
L208591 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ They didn't have any. They don't grow in the desert.
L208590 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ What limes?
L208589 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ Room service sent it up. I wanted something to cut the limes.
L208588 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Where'd you get that knife?
L208587 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ That's right, laugh about it! You goddamn honkies are all the same!
L208586 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ That little blonde groupie with the film crew? You think he sodomized her?
L208585 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ That dirty bastard! I knew it! He's got hold of my woman!
L208584 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ He told me he was turning in early...
L208583 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ Don't kid yourself. That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous. He's watching us like a hawk.
L208582 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ No, we should leave the poor bastard alone. I get the feeling that he's avoiding us for some reason.
L208581 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ Let's go up there and blast him out of bed with the fire hose.
L208580 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ What for?
L208579 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ Yeah... I thought we might need it...
L208573 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ You drive! I think there's something wrong with me.
L208572 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Don't run. They'd like any excuse to shoot us.
L208571 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Don't go near that elevator. That's just what they want us to do... trap us in a steel box and take us down to the basement.
L208570 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ Good God! Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator?
L208569 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Probably the bartender. He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.
L208568 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ Did you see that? Some sonofabitch kicked me in the back.
L208564 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ It won't stop. It's not ever going to stop.
L208563 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ When does this thing stop?
L208560 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ Do they pay you to screw that bear?
L208559 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ OK. Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly. It's going to be a long walk. 
L208558 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ I want to leave fast.
L208557 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door.
L208556 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ Can we make it?
L208555 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ OK. I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left.
L208554 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ No. This is serious. One more hour in this town and I'll kill somebody!
L208553 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Calm down. You'll be straight in a few hours.
L208552 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ Yes. Leave the country. Tonight.
L208551 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ GO?
L208550 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ I have to go.
L208549 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Not much. Why?
L208548 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ Please, don't tell me those things... Not now.  This is my last drink. How much money can you lend me?
L208547 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear.
L208546 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ That's what gives me The Fear.
L208545 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve.
L208544 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ I hate to say this, but this place is getting to me. I think I'm getting The Fear.
L208536 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ Get sheep over side... women and children to armored car... orders from Captain Zeep.
L208535 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of mine. Watch out!... Why money? My name is Brinks; I was born... Born?
L208534 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Some angry Rotarian shoves you and you think: What's happening here? What's going on? Then you hear yourself mumbling.
L208531 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ Where's the ether? This mescaline isn't working.
L208530 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ This is the place. They'll never fuck with us here.
L208525 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ We wandered into a fucking time capsule!
L208524 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Did the mescaline just kick in? Or was that Debbie Reynolds in a silver Afro wig?!
L208523 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ Jesus creeping shit!
L208516 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ What do you expect? I'm your attorney. You owe me five bucks. I want it now.
L208515 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Holy shit! They almost had us there! That was quick thinking.
L208509 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ Why what?
L208508 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Why?
L208506 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ To do the job, of course. Here we go... a Crab Louie and quart of muscatel for twenty dollars!
L208505 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Look, what are we doing here? Are we here to entertain ourselves, or to do the job?
L208504 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ How about "Nickel Nick's Slot Arcade?" "Hot Slots," that sounds heavy. Twenty- nine cent hotdogs...
L208503 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Total control now. Tooling along the main drag on a Saturday night in Vegas, two good old boys in a fire apple red convertible... stoned, ripped, twisted... Good people!
L208453 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ They'll probably have a big net for us when we show up.
L208452 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.
L208451 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ That's good...
L208446 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ You bastard! They'll never let us back in that place. I leave you alone for three minutes and you start waving that goddamn marlin spike around -- yelling about reptiles! You scared the shit out of those people! They were ready to call the cops. Hell, the only reason they gave us press passes was to get you out of there...
L208445 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L208441 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Not yet. I want to study its habits.
L208440 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ Shoot it.
L208435 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ No, no. Don't leave me!
L208434 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ That's the press table. Where you have to sign in for our credentials. Shit, let's get it over with. You handle that, and I'll check on the room.
L208432 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ But what about our room? And the golf shoes?
L208431 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ I just went upstairs to see this man Lacerda. I told him I knew what he was up to...  He says he's a photographer! But when I mentioned Savage Henry he freaked! He knows we're onto him!
L208430 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ If you think we're in trouble now wait until you see what's happening in the elevators.
L208429 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ I was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo. And somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things! It won't be long before they tear us to shreds!
L208426 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Lacerda?
L208425 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ Two Cuba Libres with beer and mescal on the side.  Who's Lacerda, he's waiting for us in a room on the twelfth floor?
L208411 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Thirty minutes. It was going to be very close.
L208410 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ Maybe thirty more minutes. As your attorney, I advise you to drive at top speed. It'll be a goddamn miracle if we can get there before you turn into a wild animal. Are you ready for that? Checking into a Vegas hotel under a phony name with intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid.
L208409 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ How long do I have?
L208407 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ You whore!
L208406 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out here. They'll pick your bones clean before morning.
L208405 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ God didn't do that! You did it! You're a fucking narcotics agent, that was our cocaine, you pig!
L208404 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ Oh, Jesus! Did you see what god just did to us?
L208398 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ And eat them! That bastard won't get away with this! What's going on in this country when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?
L208397 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ Savage Henry has cashed his check! We're going to rip his lungs out!
L208396 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ The truth is we're going to Vegas to croak a scag baron named Savage Henry. I've known him for years but he ripped us off -- and you know what that means, right?
L208395 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine. 
L208394 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!
L208393 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch your language! You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism!
L208392 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ Turn up the fucking music! My heart feels like an alligator! Volume! Clarity! Bass! We must have bass! What's wrong with us? Are you goddamn old ladies?
L208390 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ The medicine? Yes, it's right here.
L208389 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ Where's the medicine?
L208388 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ My heart!
L208387 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ He said he understood, but I could see in his eyes that he didn't. He was lying to me.
L208386 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ My attorney understands this concept, despite his racial handicap. But do you?!
L208385 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ Damn right!
L208384 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ ...and we're chock full of that!
L208370 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ We will. You Samoans are all the same. You have no faith in the essential decency of the white man's culture.
L208369 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ We won't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit.
L208368 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Don't take any guff from these swine.  Now we need a sound store with the finest equipment. Nothing dinky. One of those new Belgian Heliowatts with a voice-activated shotgun mike, for picking up conversations in oncoming cars.
L208367 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ O.K., O.K., yes. Hang onto it. We'll be there in thirty minutes.  I finally located a car with adequate horsepower and the proper coloring.  What?! OF COURSE the gentleman has a major credit card! Do you realize who the fuck you're talking to?
L208362 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ Indeed. We must do it. What kind of story is this?
L208361 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ I tell you, my man. This is the American Dream in action! We'd be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way to the end.
L208360 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Why not? If a thing's worth doing, it's worth doing right.
L208359 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ God hell! I think I see the pattern! This one sounds like real trouble! You're going to need plenty of legal advice before this thing is over. As your attorney I must advise you that you'll need a very fast car with no top and after that, the cocaine. And then the tape recorder, for special music, and some Acapulco shirts...  This blows my weekend, because naturally I'll have to go with you -- and we'll have to arm ourselves.
L208342 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ It's okay. He's admiring the shape of your skull.
L208341 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me?
L208340 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Jesus! Did I say that?
L208339 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ If so -- well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere. Because it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose. He'd report us at once to some kind of outback Nazi law enforcement agency, and they'll run us down like dogs...
L208336 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ No more of that talk or I'll put the leeches on you.
L208335 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ We're your friends. We're not like the others.
L208330 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ One toke. You poor fool. Wait till you see those goddamn bats.
L208329 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ "One toke over the line, sweet Jesus."
L208987 +++$+++ u924 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ MAID +++$+++ I fear nothing.
L208986 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ The password is: "One Hand Washes The Other." The minute you hear that, you say "I fear nothing."
L208981 +++$+++ u924 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ MAID +++$+++ Alice. Just ring Linen Service and ask for Alice.
L208980 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ You're damn right. But the first time you say anything about this, to anybody -- you'll go straight to prison for the rest of your life. What's your name?
L208979 +++$+++ u924 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ MAID +++$+++ You'd pay me for that?
L208971 +++$+++ u924 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ MAID +++$+++ No! I swear I'm not!
L208970 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Maybe she's telling the truth. Maybe she's not part of it.
L208967 +++$+++ u924 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ MAID +++$+++ I know you're cops, but I thought you were just here for that convention. I swear! All I wanted to do was clean up the room. I don't know anything about dope!
L208966 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ The dope ring. You must know what's going on in this hotel. Why do you think we're here?
L208961 +++$+++ u924 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ MAID +++$+++ Nobody. I'm the maid!
L208960 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ What made you do it? Who paid you off?
L208958 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!
L208957 +++$+++ u924 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ MAID +++$+++ Please... please... I'm only the maid. I didn't mean nothin!...
L208715 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ I'll try. I've been wanting to go to Baker for a long time. I've heard a lot about it.
L208714 +++$+++ u922 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ HIGHWAY PATROLMAN +++$+++ Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
L208713 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ How far is Baker? I was hoping to stop there for lunch.
L208712 +++$+++ u922 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ HIGHWAY PATROLMAN +++$+++ Okay. Here's how it is. What goes into my book, as of noon, is that I apprehended you... for driving too fast, and advised you to proceed no further than the next rest area... your stated destination, right? Where you plan to take a long nap. Do I make myself clear?
L208711 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ A nap won't help. I've been awake for too long -- three or four nights. I can't even remember. If I go to sleep now, I'm dead for twenty hours.
L208710 +++$+++ u922 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ HIGHWAY PATROLMAN +++$+++ You know -- I get the feeling you could use a nap. There's a rest area up ahead. Why don't you pull over and sleep a few hours?
L208709 +++$+++ u922 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ HIGHWAY PATROLMAN +++$+++ That's a strange attitude.
L208708 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Yeah. I know. I'm guilty. I understand that. I knew it was a crime but I did it anyway. Shit, why argue? I'm a fucking criminal.
L208707 +++$+++ u922 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ HIGHWAY PATROLMAN +++$+++ You realize...
L208706 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Why not? It was getting warm anyway.
L208705 +++$+++ u922 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ HIGHWAY PATROLMAN +++$+++ Could I have that, please?
L208703 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Of course, officer.
L208702 +++$+++ u922 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ HIGHWAY PATROLMAN +++$+++ May I see your license.
L208990 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ Don't worry, it's all over now. Thank God for the decent people.
L208989 +++$+++ u924 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ MAID +++$+++ Whatever you say, gentlemen. I can't tell you how sorry I am about what happened...
L208988 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ Oh, and don't bother to make up the room. That way we won't have to risk another of these little incidents, will we?
L208985 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ You and a lot of other people.
L208984 +++$+++ u924 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ MAID +++$+++ Oh Lord! I'd do just about anything for that!
L208978 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ One phone call every day. Just tell us what you've seen. Don't worry if it doesn't add up, that's our problem.
L208977 +++$+++ u924 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ MAID +++$+++ What?
L208973 +++$+++ u924 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ MAID +++$+++ Yes! I'll help you all you need! I hate dope!
L208972 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ In that case, maybe she can help.
L208969 +++$+++ u924 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ MAID +++$+++ No! No! I swear to Jesus I never heard of that stuff!
L208968 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ Come on, baby don't try to tell us you never heard of the Grange Gorman.
L208965 +++$+++ u924 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ MAID +++$+++ Part of what?
L208964 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ Bullshit! You're just as much a part of it as they are!
L208963 +++$+++ u924 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ MAID +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about!
L208962 +++$+++ u921 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ GONZO +++$+++ You're lying! You were after the evidence. Who put you up to this -- the manager?
L211194 +++$+++ u926 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ ADULTERER +++$+++ They'll get in! We'll all die!
L211193 +++$+++ u939 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ TRAMPY +++$+++ YOU'RE KILLING HIM!
L211189 +++$+++ u926 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ ADULTERER +++$+++ They can't get in here!  You said it yourself, they'll get in!
L211188 +++$+++ u939 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ TRAMPY +++$+++ What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
L211187 +++$+++ u926 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ ADULTERER +++$+++ Stop!
L210904 +++$+++ u939 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ TRAMPY +++$+++ I figure it's karma. You wronged me and you wronged your wife and you wronged your children, so this is karma biting you on the ass, or in your case...  ...on the eye.
L210903 +++$+++ u926 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ ADULTERER +++$+++ Spare me.
L210902 +++$+++ u939 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ TRAMPY +++$+++ It serves you right. You cheatin' jerk.
L211396 +++$+++ u926 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ ADULTERER +++$+++ I don't know, I just got here. Did you find your girl?
L211395 +++$+++ u935 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ HEROINE +++$+++ Where is everyone?
L211394 +++$+++ u926 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ ADULTERER +++$+++ Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.
L211388 +++$+++ u935 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ HEROINE +++$+++ We're going to get my little girl.
L211387 +++$+++ u926 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ ADULTERER +++$+++ Where are you two going?
L211382 +++$+++ u926 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ ADULTERER +++$+++ I don't wanna go home alone... I don't wanna see what might have...
L211381 +++$+++ u935 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ HEROINE +++$+++ We'll meet in three hours?
L211380 +++$+++ u926 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ ADULTERER +++$+++ Um, yeah, thirty miles east.
