L356032 +++$+++ u1883 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Better.
L356016 +++$+++ u1888 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ WARDEN +++$+++ All right... but you see our predicament... Legally we can't hold him, but he may be able to help us... perhaps later.  For now, he's free to leave.
L356015 +++$+++ u1871 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Then he's coming home with his mother and me.
L356014 +++$+++ u1888 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ WARDEN +++$+++ No.
L356013 +++$+++ u1871 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Have you made any charges against him?
L355977 +++$+++ u1871 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Same as always. Pete takes care of himself.
L355976 +++$+++ u1888 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ WARDEN +++$+++ His physical condition.
L355975 +++$+++ u1871 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ His condition? What do you mean?
L355972 +++$+++ u1888 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ WARDEN +++$+++ Yes.
L355971 +++$+++ u1871 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ The wife killer?
L355970 +++$+++ u1888 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ WARDEN +++$+++ A cell that was supposed to be occupied by an inmate named Fred Madison.
L356245 +++$+++ u1871 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ You came home. Your friend Sheila brought you here.
L356244 +++$+++ u1873 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ We saw you that night, Pete.
L356030 +++$+++ u1873 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No... Here he comes.
L356029 +++$+++ u1871 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ You talk to him?
L356028 +++$+++ u1873 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Out in back.
L356027 +++$+++ u1871 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Where's Pete?
L356020 +++$+++ u1873 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Are you hungry, honey? I'll fix you something.
L356019 +++$+++ u1871 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Just rest easy, Pete. You're gonna be okay.
L356018 +++$+++ u1888 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ WARDEN +++$+++ We'll get a tail put on him.
L356017 +++$+++ u1872 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ CAPTAIN HENDERSON +++$+++ You just gonna let him go?
L355962 +++$+++ u1888 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ WARDEN +++$+++ What's the word on the street?
L355961 +++$+++ u1872 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ CAPTAIN HENDERSON +++$+++ One of the guards must have leaked it.
L355956 +++$+++ u1872 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ CAPTAIN HENDERSON +++$+++ Nothing, Marsh. Vanished. There's an APB out on him. His photo's been faxed nationwide.
L355955 +++$+++ u1888 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ WARDEN +++$+++ How about Madison? Have we had even a hint of his whereabouts?
L355942 +++$+++ u1872 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ CAPTAIN HENDERSON +++$+++ I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.
L355941 +++$+++ u1888 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ WARDEN +++$+++ If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
L355940 +++$+++ u1872 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ CAPTAIN HENDERSON +++$+++ He... He can't talk. it appears as if he can't talk, anyway.
L355939 +++$+++ u1888 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ WARDEN +++$+++ Did you ask him who he is?
L355938 +++$+++ u1872 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ CAPTAIN HENDERSON +++$+++ He's in the infirmary, being examined.
L355937 +++$+++ u1888 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ WARDEN +++$+++ Where is he now?
L355936 +++$+++ u1872 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ CAPTAIN HENDERSON +++$+++ I don't know. The guards say they've never seen him before.
L355935 +++$+++ u1888 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ WARDEN +++$+++ Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?
L355934 +++$+++ u1872 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ CAPTAIN HENDERSON +++$+++ Warden, it's not him. It was not Fred Madison in that cell.
L355933 +++$+++ u1888 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ WARDEN +++$+++ Repeat that, Bill.
L355932 +++$+++ u1879 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ JOHNNY MACK +++$+++ Captain... this is some spooky shit we got here.
L355931 +++$+++ u1872 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ CAPTAIN HENDERSON +++$+++ Yeah, Mack?
L355930 +++$+++ u1879 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ JOHNNY MACK +++$+++ I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson?
L355929 +++$+++ u1872 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ CAPTAIN HENDERSON +++$+++ Who is it?
L355928 +++$+++ u1879 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ JOHNNY MACK +++$+++ No, sir, it's not.
L355927 +++$+++ u1872 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ CAPTAIN HENDERSON +++$+++ That's not Fred Madison?
L355926 +++$+++ u1879 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ JOHNNY MACK +++$+++ I'm not entirely certain, Captain. You'll have to see for yourself.
L355925 +++$+++ u1872 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ CAPTAIN HENDERSON +++$+++ Now, Mack, what's the situation?
L356001 +++$+++ u1873 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Pete, what happened to you?
L356000 +++$+++ u1888 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ WARDEN +++$+++ Pete, can you tell us now, anything about this?
L355998 +++$+++ u1888 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ WARDEN +++$+++ Yes, and we need to talk to him... if we can.  Mel, let's get Peter in here.
L355997 +++$+++ u1873 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I want to see him.
L355993 +++$+++ u1873 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ He didn't come home.
L355992 +++$+++ u1888 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ WARDEN +++$+++ What about yesterday?
L355991 +++$+++ u1873 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ When he went to work, right.
L355990 +++$+++ u1888 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ WARDEN +++$+++ You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?
L355989 +++$+++ u1873 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I wouldn't know how.
L356350 +++$+++ u1873 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ He won't give his name.
L356349 +++$+++ u1883 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Who is it?
L356250 +++$+++ u1883 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Who was the man?
L356249 +++$+++ u1873 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ We know that.
L356216 +++$+++ u1883 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Nothin'.
L356215 +++$+++ u1873 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What's the matter?
L356041 +++$+++ u1883 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ No... I don't. Why?
L356040 +++$+++ u1873 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Do you remember?
L356022 +++$+++ u1873 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Coming up.
L356021 +++$+++ u1883 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ No... I don't feel so good. I would like some aspirin.
L355952 +++$+++ u1874 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ DR. ROGOFF +++$+++ I did a routine once-over, and gave him a sleeping pill. I've never seen this man before. Neither have the guards. I don't think he's in the system.
L355951 +++$+++ u1888 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ WARDEN +++$+++ A headache?
L355950 +++$+++ u1874 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ DR. ROGOFF +++$+++ I examined Madison last night, Marshall. He had a headache.
L355949 +++$+++ u1874 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ DR. ROGOFF +++$+++ Not even close.
L355948 +++$+++ u1888 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ WARDEN +++$+++ He's not Madison?
L355947 +++$+++ u1874 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ DR. ROGOFF +++$+++ He's just been fingerprinted, and I'll run these blood tests right away. We'll find out soon enough.
L355946 +++$+++ u1888 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ WARDEN +++$+++ Who is this man?
L355945 +++$+++ u1874 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ DR. ROGOFF +++$+++ I don't know yet.
L355944 +++$+++ u1888 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ WARDEN +++$+++ What is this, Rogoff?
L356143 +++$+++ u1881 +++$+++ m123 +++$+++ MR. EDDY +++$+++ FUCKIN' "A".
