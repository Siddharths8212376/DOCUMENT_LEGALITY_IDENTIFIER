L83016 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ Shut up!  Sorry, dear, I lost control for a minute.
L83010 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Oh, Craiggy, that's brilliant!
L83009 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ Wait a minute! What if everybody knew? What if we presented Malkovich as the world's most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor with the Great Mantini!
L83008 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ No one would ever have to know its not him.
L83007 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ No! Please!  Shut up, will you? We're trying to think here.  It is sort of like being a puppeteer. I like that about it.
L83006 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.
L83005 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ No!  But how will we make a living, my love, if our clientele doesn't have access to our product?
L83004 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Stay in him forever?
L83003 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ You're right, my darling, it's so much more. It's playing with people!
L83002 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls.
L83001 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ That was incredible. You're brilliant!
L82999 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ Really? Yeah. Okay.
L82998 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ I'd love to see your work.
L82997 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ You mean with Malkovich?
L82996 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Wow.  Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.
L82995 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ Yeah. I've figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough, it's all in the wrists.
L82994 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ You still there, sweets?
L82979 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ No... damn... you...  Oh shut up, you overrated sack of shit.
L82978 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.
L82977 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ I'm getting better all the time.
L82976 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
L82975 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ Oh, so the bitch escaped.
L82974 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Lotte called me.
L82973 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ Yes. How did you know it was me?
L82972 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Oh shut up.  Craig, darling are you in there?
L82971 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I just let you up here to tell you that, and to tell you that I'm taking you and Schwartz to court.
L82970 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ I can explain about the portal, darling.
L82969 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ Come on in.
L82913 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ What the fuck is going on?
L82912 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Darling!
L82888 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ No, Dollface, I know what my passion taking hold feels like. I gotta go.
L82887 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.
L82886 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ Something was making me talk. Some Goddamn thing was making me move. I gotta get out of here.
L82885 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Oh, Lotte...
L82884 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!  What the fuck is going on? I'm not talking. This is not me!
L82818 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ Yes, Maxine, yes.
L82817 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte.
L82816 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ No, I guess not. I'm an actor.
L82815 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Do you mind?
L82814 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ I'm sorry, did you just call me "Lotte"?
L82810 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ Oh sure. It's very rewarding...
L82809 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ So, do you enjoy being an actor?
L82808 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ Oh, I'm really glad you called.
L82807 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Thanks so much for coming over.
L82736 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Whatever you're having.
L82735 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ Can I get you a drink?
L82715 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ It's just that I fantasize about you and, well, speaking to you now has gotten me sort of excited and...
L82714 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ How'd you get this number?
L82713 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ You don't know me, but I'm a great admirer of yours.
L82712 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ Who's calling?
L82711 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Mr. Malkovich?
L82710 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ Yeah?
L82453 +++$+++ u4034 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ TINY WOMAN +++$+++ Captain Mertin, surely I am a God-fearing Christian woman like yourself, but alas, I am afraid that the world was not built with me in mind. Door knobs are too high, chairs are unwieldy, high-ceilinged rooms mock my stature. Nor am I a marrie lady, Captain. after all, who would marry a person of my diminutiveness? So I am forced to work for my few pennies a week as an optometrist. Why cannot there be a place for me to work safe and comfortable?
L82452 +++$+++ u4033 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MERTIN +++$+++ Aye. Speak then if ye must.
L82451 +++$+++ u4034 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ TINY WOMAN +++$+++ I am not asking for alms, but rather the ear of a kind man with a noble heart.
L82450 +++$+++ u4033 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MERTIN +++$+++ I see. Well, it is not my fault that thou art tiny. So if it is charity yer after, then be gone with ye, ye foul demon.
L82449 +++$+++ u4034 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ TINY WOMAN +++$+++ I am not a child, Captain Mertin, but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions.
L82448 +++$+++ u4033 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MERTIN +++$+++ What want ye, girl child?
L82447 +++$+++ u4034 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ TINY WOMAN +++$+++ Captain Mertin?
L83522 +++$+++ u4037 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ BABY SUGGS +++$+++ Know it, and go on out the yard. Go on.
L83521 +++$+++ u4039 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ DENVER +++$+++ Then what do I do?
L83520 +++$+++ u4037 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ BABY SUGGS +++$+++ There ain't.
L83519 +++$+++ u4039 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ DENVER +++$+++ But you said...you said out there, there ain't no...what was that word?..no..de- fense. No de-fense.
L83518 +++$+++ u4037 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ BABY SUGGS +++$+++ You got to go sometime. You got to go out there by yourself sometime.
L83516 +++$+++ u4039 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ DENVER +++$+++ There was a boy there...said mama was a jailbird...said he could prove it..
L83515 +++$+++ u4037 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ BABY SUGGS +++$+++ Why you never go back to Lady Jone's and learn your letters? You liked going there I remember. Seeing the other children. Then all a sudden, you stop.
L83336 +++$+++ u4037 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ BABY SUGGS +++$+++ No. I'm looking for what I was put here to look for: the back door.
L83335 +++$+++ u4046 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ STAMP PAID +++$+++ We have to be steady. "These things too will pass". What you looking for? A miracle?
L83334 +++$+++ u4046 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ STAMP PAID +++$+++ Aw, Baby.
L83333 +++$+++ u4037 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ BABY SUGGS +++$+++ What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.
L83332 +++$+++ u4046 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ STAMP PAID +++$+++ You still know.
L83331 +++$+++ u4037 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ BABY SUGGS +++$+++ Was a time I knew what was.
L83330 +++$+++ u4046 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ STAMP PAID +++$+++ You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.
L83329 +++$+++ u4037 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ BABY SUGGS +++$+++ Not like He punished me.

L83324 +++$+++ u4046 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ STAMP PAID +++$+++ You saying nothing counts?
L83323 +++$+++ u4037 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ BABY SUGGS +++$+++ Those white things have taken all I had or dreamed. I'm saying ain't no bad luck in this world 'cept for white folks..They just don't know when to stop.
L83322 +++$+++ u4046 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ STAMP PAID +++$+++ You saying whitefolks won. That what you saying?
L83321 +++$+++ u4037 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ BABY SUGGS +++$+++ No, Stamp. I ain't.
L83320 +++$+++ u4046 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ STAMP PAID +++$+++ You blaming God. That what you're doing?
L83319 +++$+++ u4037 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ BABY SUGGS +++$+++ Can't say. It's something can't be planned.
L83318 +++$+++ u4046 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ STAMP PAID +++$+++ Then what? When you get through with blue and yellow, then what?
L83317 +++$+++ u4037 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ BABY SUGGS +++$+++ I likes yellow.
L83316 +++$+++ u4046 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ STAMP PAID +++$+++ You getting into bed to think about yellow?
L83315 +++$+++ u4037 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ BABY SUGGS +++$+++ Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither.
L83314 +++$+++ u4046 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ STAMP PAID +++$+++ What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here.
L83313 +++$+++ u4037 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ BABY SUGGS +++$+++ What I have to do is get in my bed and lay down. I want to fix on something harmless in this world.
L83312 +++$+++ u4046 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ STAMP PAID +++$+++ But you got to do it. You got to. Can't nobody Call like you. You have to be there.
L83311 +++$+++ u4037 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ BABY SUGGS +++$+++ That's the last thing they took from me.
L83310 +++$+++ u4046 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ STAMP PAID +++$+++ The Word. What you was put here to speak.
L83309 +++$+++ u4046 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ STAMP PAID +++$+++ Say the Word!
L83308 +++$+++ u4037 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ BABY SUGGS +++$+++ If I call them, and they come what on earth am I going to say to them.

L83285 +++$+++ u4045 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ SETHE +++$+++ ..."Here. Look here. See this mark? If you can't tell me by my face, look here."
L83284 +++$+++ u4037 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ BABY SUGGS +++$+++ ...All I remember is how she loved the bottom of burned bread. Her little hands...I wouldn't know 'em if they slapped me".
L83269 +++$+++ u4037 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ BABY SUGGS +++$+++ Those boys didn't even know him. You had six whole years of marriage to my Halle Fathered every one of your children. A blessing. I learned hard that a man's just a man, but a son like that...like Halle..now that's somebody.
L83268 +++$+++ u4045 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ SETHE +++$+++ The boys wouldn't have left if Halle were here.
L83267 +++$+++ u4037 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ BABY SUGGS +++$+++ Oh, I remember bits and pieces of all of'em I guess..Halle, of course..I had Halle a lifetime. Almost twenty years... My two girls, sold and gone before I could even a heard about it, and them without their grown up teeth yet. My third child, my son after Halle...I let that straw boss have me for four months so's I could keep that boy. Next year, he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child. I couldn't love that child. I wouldn't. Not any of the rest either. God take what He would....and He did...
L83266 +++$+++ u4045 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ SETHE +++$+++ You remember Halle.
L83265 +++$+++ u4037 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ BABY SUGGS +++$+++ What'd be the point? Not a house in the country ain't packed to the rafters with some dead Negro's grief. We lucky our ghost is a baby. My husband spirit come back? Or yours? Don't talk to me! Ha..You lucky. You got one child left, still pullin at your skirts. Be thankful. I had eight. Eight with six fathers. Every one of them gone from me. Four taken, four chased and all, I expect, worrying somebody's house into evil. My first born - alls I can remember of her now is how she loved the burned bottom of bread. Her little hands..I wouldn't know'em if they slapped me. Can you beat that? Eight children and that's all I remember.
L83264 +++$+++ u4045 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ SETHE +++$+++ I don't know. Maybe we should have moved.
L83263 +++$+++ u4037 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ BABY SUGGS +++$+++ They'll be all right. I'm surprised they lasted here this long.
L83260 +++$+++ u4037 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ BABY SUGGS +++$+++ Ah, winter in Ohio is especially rough if you've got an appetite for color.
L83259 +++$+++ u4045 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ SETHE +++$+++ No. Sorry.
L83486 +++$+++ u4039 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ DENVER +++$+++ You best leave that quilt alone. That was grandma's quilt.
L83485 +++$+++ u4038 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ BELOVED +++$+++ What do you know about it? I sleep where I want.
L83426 +++$+++ u4039 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ DENVER +++$+++ THE WHITEFOLK?

L83405 +++$+++ u4039 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ DENVER +++$+++ ..I swallowed her blood right along with my mother's milk. She played with me and always came to be with me whenever I needed her. Me and her waited for our daddy. I love her. I do. She never hurt me. I love my mother but I know she killed one of her own, and tender as she is with me, I'm scared of her because of it. All the time, I'm afraid the thing that happened that made it all right to kill her own, could happen again. Whatever it is, it comes from outside this house, outside the yard. So I never leave this house and I watch over the yard so it can't happen again ... I have to keep it away from my sister...I'll protect Beloved...'Cause She's mine...
L83512 +++$+++ u4045 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ SETHE +++$+++ No. Since mama lost her job, we don't have no more pies..

L83502 +++$+++ u4045 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ SETHE +++$+++ That's not true. I told you, I had to get you out, make you safe...so's you and me could be together on the other side, forever..
L83501 +++$+++ u4038 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ BELOVED +++$+++ You're weren't nice to me..you didn't smile at me..
L83500 +++$+++ u4045 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ SETHE +++$+++ Mama told you - I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing!
L83499 +++$+++ u4038 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ BELOVED +++$+++ You gave me the bad dreams. You left me behind...
L83498 +++$+++ u4045 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ SETHE +++$+++ Don't say those things. You forget about those dreams..
L83497 +++$+++ u4038 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ BELOVED +++$+++ I had another dream last night.  The dead man laying on top of me and I had nothing to eat. And the ghosts without skin stuck their fingers in me and said Beloved in the dark and bitch in the light..
L83496 +++$+++ u4045 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ SETHE +++$+++ Don't talk like that. Your mama loves you.
L83495 +++$+++ u4038 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ BELOVED +++$+++ You don't sit with me!! I don't sit with people who leave me!

L83607 +++$+++ u4039 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ DENVER +++$+++ No. Got me an afternoon job at the shirt factory. Figure between that and my night work at the Bodwins I might be able to put something away for me and mama.
L83606 +++$+++ u4043 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You on your way home?
L83605 +++$+++ u4039 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ DENVER +++$+++ Don't pay to complain.
L83604 +++$+++ u4043 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Well, is it now? How you getting along?
L83576 +++$+++ u4041 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ Oh yeah. They good. Can't say they ain't good. I wouldn't trade them for another pair, tell you that. But you come back in a few days - give me a chance to lead'em to it. All right?
L83575 +++$+++ u4039 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ DENVER +++$+++ They good whitefolks?
L83574 +++$+++ u4041 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ In case the house burn down or bad weather slops the roads so bad I can't get here on time or late guests needed cleaning up after. Anything.  Don't ask me what whitefolks need at night.
L83573 +++$+++ u4039 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ DENVER +++$+++ In case of what?
L83572 +++$+++ u4041 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ Be here. In case.
L83571 +++$+++ u4039 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ DENVER +++$+++ Fine. But what would I do at night?
L83570 +++$+++ u4041 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ They getting older now and I can't take care of 'em like I used to. More and more they keep asking me to sleep over night. Now, I don't want to quit these people but they can't have all my days and nights too. I got my own family needs me. It'll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper - take care of your mama during the day, then earn a little something at night, how's that?
L83569 +++$+++ u4039 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ DENVER +++$+++ Ya think?
L83568 +++$+++ u4041 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ Bet you do. Everybody miss her. That was a good woman...Well, I don't know whether the Bodwins think it or not but they sure could use some extra help.
L83567 +++$+++ u4039 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ DENVER +++$+++ I miss her.
L83566 +++$+++ u4041 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ I never went to those woodland services but she was always nice to me. Always. Never be another like her.
L83565 +++$+++ u4039 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ DENVER +++$+++ Yes ma'am.
L83564 +++$+++ u4041 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ You know what? I've been here since I was fourteen and I remember like yesterday when Baby Suggs, holy, came here and sat right where you are. Whiteman name of Garner brought her. He and Mr. Bodwin were good friends. That's how she got that house you all live in. Other things too.
L83563 +++$+++ u4041 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ Well, come on in. You letting in flies.
L83562 +++$+++ u4039 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ DENVER +++$+++ Yes ma'am..
L83561 +++$+++ u4041 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ I heard your mother took sick, that so?
L83560 +++$+++ u4039 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ DENVER +++$+++ Yes ma'am.
L83559 +++$+++ u4041 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ You Baby Sugg's kin, ain't you?
L83558 +++$+++ u4039 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ DENVER +++$+++ I'm looking for work. I was thinking they might know of some.
L83557 +++$+++ u4041 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ What you want'em for?
L83556 +++$+++ u4039 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ DENVER +++$+++ Oh.
L83555 +++$+++ u4041 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ Miss Bodwin. They brother and sister, darlin.
L83554 +++$+++ u4039 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ DENVER +++$+++ I want to see Mr. and Mrs. Bodwin.
L83553 +++$+++ u4041 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ What you want?
L83552 +++$+++ u4039 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ DENVER +++$+++ May I come in?
L83551 +++$+++ u4041 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ Yes?
L83540 +++$+++ u4039 +++$+++ m268 +++$+++ DENVER +++$+++ No..No that won't do...
