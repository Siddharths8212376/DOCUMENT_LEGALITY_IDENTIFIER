L340556 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ Are you alright?
L340546 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ I don't know.  It was like a tug. Something tugged us.
L340545 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ What was that?
L340544 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ <u>That</u> was a bust.
L340543 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ Hector, Jack, we show you with about twelve minutes of oxygen left, and you're on the last tank. Time to go home.
L340540 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Well.  He's probably rugged handsome I guess.  Yeah.
L340539 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ I'm just curious.  I can never tell what women think is handsome.  Is he handsome?
L340538 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ What is this?
L340537 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ You think Jack's handsome?
L340536 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Well Hector's a giant cracker.
L340535 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ Hector thinks you like him.
L340534 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ <u>What</u>?  I don't even <u>know</u> the guy.
L340533 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ You like Jack?
L340532 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.
L340531 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ And that's why he thinks they're Godly?
L340530 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ He may be a kook but he's also been all over the world with them.  He even swam in the Grimetti with killer Niles all around him, he never got nipped.
L340529 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I asked you to be nice to him.
L340528 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ Was that like a homo-sexual remark?
L340504 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L340503 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ Why does everybody insult my intelligence, I have intelligence, intelligent people eat Twinkies.
L340502 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ It's to make you <u>understand</u> him, with understanding comes tolerance. Too bad they don't put proverbs in Twinkies, my load would be lighter.
L340501 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ Is this 'spose to make me take him more serious?
L340496 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ <u>Apologize</u>?
L340495 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ You hurt his feelings.  I think you should go apologize.
L340423 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Thank you, it's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you, you Fucker. 
L340422 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ They don't believe her.
L340379 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Crocodiles.  He's an expert on them.  And if he's <u>here</u>... then he must think that's what's in this lake.
L340378 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ With what?
L340348 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ I just let go of it.
L340347 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ You threw it at me!!
L340346 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ Hey!!
L340345 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ It looks like a branch.
L340344 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ I thought I saw...
L340343 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ What?
L340342 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ What the hell?
L340341 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Yes, <u>camp</u>, I thought that meant Holiday Inn, I never heard "tents", will there be toilets?
L340340 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ I told you.  Two days, we'd have to camp.
L340339 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ We're staying in <u>tents</u>?
L340338 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ The tents were sent ahead, they should already be set-up.
L340337 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Gee.
L340336 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ They wanted to call it Lake Placid. But somebody said that name was taken.
L340335 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ What is with this lake?  It looks black and... there are no waves or anything.
L340324 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Sheriff.
L340323 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ Was he swallowed?
L340322 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ We don't mean to invade your privacy but... was he ill, was he sick?
L340299 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ It's just that--
L340298 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ You're sort of a rude person.
L340297 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ And you stock these things for what, to fend off Russia?
L340296 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ Lightweight Forward Area air device unit.  Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead.
L340295 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ <u>What</u> <u>is</u> <u>that</u>?
L340294 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Ever even been <u>in</u> one?
L340293 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ I got nothing against--
L340292 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ You have a thing against museums?
L340291 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here.
L340290 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ What?
L340289 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ <u>We</u>?
L340288 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ What kind of backup do we have?
L340287 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ Not yet.
L340286 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ You talk to the married couple?
L340285 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ Nobody lives within twenty-five miles, 'cept some old couple who live right on the lake.  Teenagers trek in every once in a while, none have disappeared, and none have spotted anything unusual.
L340284 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Okay.  And is there a place nearby I could go to vomit?
L340283 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ Yes.
L340282 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ And this is how he came to the boat?
L340281 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ Seconds.  Three, four.
L340280 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ This... how long did this attack go on for?
L340277 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I can look at dead things.
L340276 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ This is a little different.
L340275 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Well.  At wakes.
L340274 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms. Scott?
L340273 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I'm fine, thank you.
L340272 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ I wouldn't.
L340268 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Um.  No, no.  Let's go.
L340267 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ That's where they keep them.  You want me to bring the tooth out here?
L340266 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Is the dead guy in there?
L340265 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ Yes.
L340264 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ <u>There</u>?  That's the morgue.
L340263 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ The lake was dead calm until up he came.  The tooth is in there.
L340262 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ And you didn't see <u>anything</u>?
L340261 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ He just kinda gurgled.  He was pretty much dead.
L340260 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Did he say anything?
L340259 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ He just came up screaming.
L340258 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ <u>I</u> <u>am</u> <u>not</u> <u>going</u> <u>to</u> <u>Maine</u>.  That's ridiculous.
L340257 +++$+++ u6260 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ <u>Kelly</u>--
L340256 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I never do field work and even if I did, <u>Maine</u>, to look at a tooth of a <u>dinosaur</u> who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--
L340255 +++$+++ u6260 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ It has nothing to do with--
L340254 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ This was Myra's idea, wasn't it? Get me out of the office for a few days, until--
L340253 +++$+++ u6260 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Well on this one I'd like you to be.
L340252 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I'm not even a field person.
L340251 +++$+++ u6260 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Part of our research--
L340250 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--
L340249 +++$+++ u6260 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Kelly--
L340248 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Are you on drugs?
L340247 +++$+++ u6260 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ I'd like you to check out this lake.  See--
L340246 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ This is what we do?
L340245 +++$+++ u6260 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ I'm sure it's nothing, but you're a paleontologist, this is what we do, I--
L340244 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Sorry?
L340243 +++$+++ u6260 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ I want you to go there.
L340242 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
L340241 +++$+++ u6260 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  They say it looks prehistoric.  Like maybe a dinosaur.
L340240 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ A tooth?
L340239 +++$+++ u6260 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ This is business.  There was an accident in Maine, some guy got killed by something in a lake.  Probably a bear, but... they found a tooth.
L340238 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Kevin.  How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.
L340237 +++$+++ u6260 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Hey.
L340208 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Yes, well...  famished.
L340207 +++$+++ u6260 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ It's ten after nine.
L340206 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ <u>Oh</u>...  No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm just thrown, I'm...  I actually have an early lunch, so...
L340205 +++$+++ u6260 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ A jerk.
L340204 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Oh.  Oh.  That's okay.  Well.  This uh... this probably wasn't meant to be, y'know.  I mean, I'm... God, I gotta be ten years younger and you, <u>you</u>... you're y'know...
L340203 +++$+++ u6260 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Else.
L340202 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Yeah, that part.  There's... somebody who's um...
L340201 +++$+++ u6260 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ The somebody else part?
L340200 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Kevin, as long as we...  What was that last part?
L340199 +++$+++ u6260 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ I know and I thought I could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else, it's a dangerous mix.
L340198 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I was working for you when "us" started, what's--
L340197 +++$+++ u6260 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ You work for me.  I'm not comfortable with-- y'know, "us"...
L340196 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ That's not what you came to say.
L340195 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Me too.
L340194 +++$+++ u6260 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ I had a great time last night. Again.
L340193 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Absolutely.
L340192 +++$+++ u6260 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Hi.  Listen.  Could I steal you a second?
L340191 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Kevin, hey.
L340190 +++$+++ u6260 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Kelly.
L340234 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I really... I should get back.
L340233 +++$+++ u6261 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ OKUBO +++$+++ Shitbutt?
L340232 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Myra.
L340231 +++$+++ u6261 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ OKUBO +++$+++ Liar?
L340230 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ No.
L340229 +++$+++ u6261 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ OKUBO +++$+++ Backstabber?
L340228 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I'm not upset, Myra, okay.  I just never thought of you as a y'know...
L340227 +++$+++ u6261 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ OKUBO +++$+++ Kelly--
L340226 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ You don't know what to say, lucky for you action speaks louder than words.
L340225 +++$+++ u6261 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ OKUBO +++$+++ It wasn't suppose to happen, I don't know what to say...
L340224 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ You and Kevin.
L340223 +++$+++ u6261 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ OKUBO +++$+++ It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...
L340222 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ <u>You</u>?
L340221 +++$+++ u6261 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ OKUBO +++$+++ It started <u>before</u> you, Kelly, I never would've--
L340220 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ <u>You</u>?
L340219 +++$+++ u6261 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ OKUBO +++$+++ Well... he didn't have to tell me that part.
L340218 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Really?  I never realized he was so psychic, how could he detect that, did he tell you there's somebody else?
L340217 +++$+++ u6261 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ OKUBO +++$+++ Kevin told me you were upset.
L340216 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I don't like to be scared, Myra, I have a thing about fright, don't ever scare me.
L340215 +++$+++ u6261 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ OKUBO +++$+++ Wild guess.
L340214 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Well you <u>shouldn't</u> have.  How did you even know where I was.
L340213 +++$+++ u6261 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ OKUBO +++$+++ I <u>tapped</u> you.
L340212 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ What do you expect, mugging me from behind?
L342374 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Agent Mapp! Thank you!
L342373 +++$+++ u6262 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ ARDELIA +++$+++ Agent Starling! Telephone!
L342259 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ He knew her...!
L342258 +++$+++ u6262 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ ARDELIA +++$+++ Hot damn, Clarice.
L342257 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ "- every day."
L342255 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ But why? He didn't weight the others.
L342254 +++$+++ u6262 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ ARDELIA +++$+++ 'Cause she didn't drift. He weighted her down.
L342253 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Fredrica Bimmel, from Belvedere, Ohio. The first girl taken, but the third body found... Why?
L342252 +++$+++ u6262 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ ARDELIA +++$+++ The one that was weighted down. Where is she...? Fred something.
L342251 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ What girl?
L342250 +++$+++ u6262 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ ARDELIA +++$+++ Well, except for the one girl.
L342249 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ But there is no pattern. There's no connection at all among these places, or the computers would've nailed it! They're even found in random order.
L342248 +++$+++ u6262 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ ARDELIA +++$+++ Not random at all, maybe. Like there's some pattern here...?
L342247 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ "Desperately random." What does he mean?
L342244 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ He's here, Ardelia.
L342243 +++$+++ u6262 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ ARDELIA +++$+++ Lecter said a lot of things.
L342242 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ The worst part - the thing that's making me crazy - is that Bill is right in front of me. Only I can't see him...  Lecter said, everything I need to catch him is right here, in these pages...
L342241 +++$+++ u6262 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ ARDELIA +++$+++ Clarice - you did the best anybody could have for Catherine Martin. You stuck your neck out for her and you got your butt kicked for her and you tried. It's not your fault it ended this way.
L342240 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ It would be rude. And he wouldn't get to ask any more questions...
L342239 +++$+++ u6262 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ ARDELIA +++$+++ Why not?
L342238 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ No. He won't come after me.
L341927 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Somebody's coaching her... They're trying to make him see Catherine as a person - not just an object.
L341926 +++$+++ u6262 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ ARDELIA +++$+++ Why does she keep repeating the name?
L341925 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Boy, is that smart...
L341736 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Pleading with a crazy man, with come all over my face.
L341735 +++$+++ u6262 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ ARDELIA +++$+++ You missed Fourth Amendment law. Unlawful seizure, real juicy stuff. Where were you all afternoon?
L341734 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Thanks, Ardelia.
L341733 +++$+++ u6262 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ ARDELIA +++$+++ Phone call, Clarice. It's God.
L341634 +++$+++ u6262 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ ARDELIA +++$+++ Stay cool. Just remember to call him "God."
L341633 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ What'd I do?
L341630 +++$+++ u6262 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ ARDELIA +++$+++ I love it when you talk dirty.
L341629 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Never cock. Just squeeze.
L341628 +++$+++ u6262 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ ARDELIA +++$+++ Damn, Clarice, how'd you make me?
L341838 +++$+++ u6263 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ BRIGHAM +++$+++ Listen, I hope you never need a thing I've taught you. But you've got something... Jack sees it, I do too. If you ever need to, you can shoot.
L341837 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ I will... I promise.
L341836 +++$+++ u6263 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ BRIGHAM +++$+++ Wear it, don't ever leave it in your purse. Dry fire it whenever you get the chance. And do your exercises.
L341834 +++$+++ u6263 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ BRIGHAM +++$+++ He's got a lot on his mind besides Buffalo Bill... His wife, Bella, is real sick. Comatose... I'm tellin' you about it now, 'cause he may never.
