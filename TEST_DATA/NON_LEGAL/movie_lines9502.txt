L661377 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ I tried to call, but apparently there's something wrong...
L661376 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Sara.
L661057 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I'm sort of helping him work through some issues.
L661056 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ What's he doing out there?
L661055 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ James Leer.
L661054 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Who's that sitting in your car?
L661052 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ That... and you.
L661051 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ About the baby.
L661050 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet.
L661049 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I know that. I know what's at stake here...
L661048 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ I believe you. I believe you want to be with me. But this is not just about me anymore.
L661047 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Really, Sara, I...
L661046 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Gee, Grady, that sounded so heartfelt. I don't know whether to swoon or smirk.
L661043 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ All right.
L661042 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell you something.
L661041 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?
L661040 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...
L661039 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Are you limping? Why are you limping?
L661038 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There is something I need to tell...
L661037 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ I'm kidding. Hello?
L661036 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Really? That was fast.
L661035 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.
L661034 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Did you confess?
L661033 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning.
L661032 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ You heard? How?
L661031 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I heard.
L661030 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Walter's on campus, being the good soldier for WordFest. But he's a basket case. Someone stole Marilyn's jacket last night. And Poe's missing, too.
L661029 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Totally. I'm sorry. A lot was happening this morning. Can you talk?
L661028 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.
L660793 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ I love you, Grady.
L660792 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ You got me.
L660791 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Pow.
L660790 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Caps.
L660789 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Heavy. Smells like gunpowder.
L660788 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ It's -- it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.
L660787 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Who's gun is that?
L660785 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ No you don't. And fuck you for saying you do. And fuck you for "saying...  ...for saying there's just no way. Because there could be a way, Grady.
L660784 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Well, no, I don't see any way.  And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance.
L660783 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
L660782 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Not have it.
L660781 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ She'll come back. That's why I'm going to... to not have this baby.
L660780 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me.
L660779 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ You love Emily. I know that. And you need to stay with her.
L660778 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ No, really, Sara, I don't think you --
L660777 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Don't. I know what you're going to say.
L660776 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Well...
L660773 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Nothing. I think I twisted my --
L660772 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter?
L660771 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Is the thing -- is it over?
L660770 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ You had another one, didn't you? You have to see a doctor, Grady. First thing Monday morning. All right?
L660615 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ I guess you're going to have to chew it off then.
L660614 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Sara, my arm. I'm stuck, honey.
L660613 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Neither do I.
L660612 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do.
L660611 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ And? Are you going to tell him?
L660610 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Yes.
L660609 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Has he asked to see the book yet?
L660608 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening.
L660607 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ My God, I wear the same scent as a transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: she?
L660606 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Hm.
L660605 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Is that Cristaile?
L660604 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Simple.
L660603 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ So. I guess we just divorce our spouses, marry each other, and have this baby, right? Simple.
L660602 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ She's left the room before. She always came back.
L660601 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ She's left before...
L660600 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Emily left me this morning.
L660599 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ I think Walter would find this a little more than surprising.
L660598 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Well. This is... surprising. Does Walter...?
L660597 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ I'm sure.
L660596 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ I'm pregnant.
L660595 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ All right. This morning --
L660594 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ You go first.
L660593 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Walter just got it back from the framer today.
L660592 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ New?
L660590 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Well then. I'd better show you. Terry --
L660589 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I don't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is.
L660588 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ That's funny. I need to talk to you, too.  Perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room, Professor Tripp.
L660587 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I need to talk to you.
L660578 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ I'm sorry. It's these goddamned shoes. I don't know how anyone actually walks in these things.
L660577 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Easy there.
L660518 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I got the message you called too.
L660517 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ I got the message you called.
L660516 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Chancellor.
L660515 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Professor Tripp.
L660824 +++$+++ u3502 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ MISS SLOVIAK +++$+++ It's a bathtub. What she's standing under.
L660823 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ That's nice. All we have is a Japanese beetle trap.
L660820 +++$+++ u3502 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ MISS SLOVIAK +++$+++ He said he hasn't had a success in ten years and everyone in New York thinks he's kind of a...
L660819 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Jesus. Is that what he told you?
L660818 +++$+++ u3502 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ MISS SLOVIAK +++$+++ You mean because his career's ruined and all?
L660817 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ He'd call it habit. But now... I get the feeling he's going through the motions a bit.
L660816 +++$+++ u3502 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ MISS SLOVIAK +++$+++ That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit.
L660815 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Like most editors, he really wants to be a writer, but he's too busy living a novel to bother writing one.
L660814 +++$+++ u3502 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ MISS SLOVIAK +++$+++ What's that?
L660813 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ He's writing his name in water.
L660812 +++$+++ u3502 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ MISS SLOVIAK +++$+++ Forget it. I should've known better. Your friend is just, I don't know, into collecting weird tricks. Mind?
L660811 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight. With Terry.
L660810 +++$+++ u3502 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ MISS SLOVIAK +++$+++ Tony. Now that I'm home.
L660809 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Listen, Antonia --
L660808 +++$+++ u3502 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ MISS SLOVIAK +++$+++ Sure it is.
L660807 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I'm not sure that's possible.
L660806 +++$+++ u3502 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ MISS SLOVIAK +++$+++ Disturbed. And when your friend Crabtree gets done with him, he's going to be even more disturbed.
L660805 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ James is... I don't know...
L660804 +++$+++ u3502 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ MISS SLOVIAK +++$+++ Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing?
L660802 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I'm your man.
L660801 +++$+++ u3502 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ MISS SLOVIAK +++$+++ I need a ride.
L660585 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ He's still barking at me. He's blind.
L660584 +++$+++ u3502 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ MISS SLOVIAK +++$+++ Who's he barking at now?
L660570 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ It's Mrs. Gaskell's. Her hobby.
L660569 +++$+++ u3502 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ MISS SLOVIAK +++$+++ That's a nice greenhouse.
L660553 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Lucky guess.
L660552 +++$+++ u3502 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ MISS SLOVIAK +++$+++ Why yes. How did you know?
L660551 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ That perfume you're wearing, Antonia. It wouldn't happen to be Cristaile, would it?
L660525 +++$+++ u3502 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ MISS SLOVIAK +++$+++ Terry was telling me about you on the plane. It was all so interesting.
L660524 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ The more the merrier.
L661375 +++$+++ u3510 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ WALTER'S VOICE +++$+++ Nevertheless, I'd like to see you in my office Monday morning.
L661374 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ No.
L661372 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Sara. I'm in love with her.
L661371 +++$+++ u3510 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ WALTER'S VOICE +++$+++ Excuse me?
L661370 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I'm in love with your wife.
L661369 +++$+++ u3510 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ WALTER'S VOICE +++$+++ What is it, Grady?
L661368 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I... I...
L661367 +++$+++ u3510 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ WALTER'S VOICE +++$+++ Oh?
L661366 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ This is important.
L661365 +++$+++ u3510 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ WALTER'S VOICE +++$+++ It's three-thirty, Grady.
L661364 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I have... eight-fifteen. That's not right, is it?
L661363 +++$+++ u3510 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ WALTER'S VOICE +++$+++ I know it's you, Grady, I just... Christ, Grady, do you know what time it is?
L661362 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ GRADY Tripp. English Department.
L661361 +++$+++ u3510 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ WALTER'S VOICE +++$+++ Grady?
L661360 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ It's Grady, Walter.
L661359 +++$+++ u3510 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ WALTER'S VOICE +++$+++ Who's this ?
L661358 +++$+++ u3510 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ WALTER'S VOICE +++$+++ Yes?
L661357 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Walter?
L661595 +++$+++ u3506 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ TRAXLER +++$+++ Thanks -- Whoa, Professor Tripp, careful here...
L661594 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ As a heart attack.
L661593 +++$+++ u3506 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ TRAXLER +++$+++ Holy shit. Are you serious?
L661592 +++$+++ u3506 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ TRAXLER +++$+++ Only when I'm working.
L661591 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Do you get high, Sam?
L661590 +++$+++ u3506 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ TRAXLER +++$+++ Hey, Professor Tripp.
L661589 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Yo, Traxler.
L660936 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Taking the long way home.
L660935 +++$+++ u3506 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ TRAXLER +++$+++ What exactly are we doing here, Professor Tripp?
L660934 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Her husband.
L660933 +++$+++ u3506 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ TRAXLER +++$+++ Who's that guy?
L660930 +++$+++ u3506 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ TRAXLER +++$+++ Sick.
L660929 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Oh, right. Yeah, that's true. He used to rub all kinds of things on it. Paprika. Ground lamb.
L660928 +++$+++ u3506 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ TRAXLER +++$+++ Well, jeez, you're reading his biography, aren't you?
L660927 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know?
L660926 +++$+++ u3506 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ TRAXLER +++$+++ Say, Professor Tripp, is all that stuff true about Errol Flynn? How he used to put coke on his dick. To make himself, you know, like, last longer?
L660925 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I don't know. It might be...
L660924 +++$+++ u3506 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ TRAXLER +++$+++ Is it good?
L660922 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Oh... yeah.
L660921 +++$+++ u3506 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ TRAXLER +++$+++ No. I guess you're here for the backpack.
L661158 +++$+++ u3499 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ Give me a break, Grady.
L661157 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I -- just wanted to see her, I guess -- Emily. And to see you too -- you and Irene. And to let everyone know that, even though it may be difficult to comprehend now, this -- everything that's happening -- it's not forever. It doesn't mean "Goodbye."
L661156 +++$+++ u3499 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ Why did you come here, Grady?
L661155 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Listen, Hank, I'm sorry about all this. I didn't come here to upset you and Irene. I want you to know that.
L661154 +++$+++ u3499 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ Ah, right. The book.
L661153 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Oh. Right. Linda... I haven't been doing a lot of sleeping lately. My editor's in town and I have the book to finish and --
L661152 +++$+++ u3499 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ Nothing's wrong. They went to Wellesley together.
L661151 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?
L661150 +++$+++ u3499 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The neurologist.
L661149 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I -- just want to say I'm sorry.
L661148 +++$+++ u3499 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ Where you stand?
L661147 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I'm not going to stalk her. Hank. I just... want to know where I stand.
L661146 +++$+++ u3499 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ I don't know if she'd want me to tell you that, Grady.
L661145 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Where's Emily, Hank?
L661144 +++$+++ u3499 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ Oh, I don't think there's any danger of you aging prematurely, Grady.
L661143 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Maybe I should read it.
L661142 +++$+++ u3499 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ It's no Arsonist's Daughter, but I guess you know that. It's a young man's book. It got me remembering how it felt to be young.
L661141 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ And?
L661140 +++$+++ u3499 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ I was thinking of you.
L661139 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ What made you pull out that old thing?
L661138 +++$+++ u3499 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ Well, I'm sure with the proper guidance he'll be fine.
L661137 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed up.
L660992 +++$+++ u3503 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ OFFICER PUPCIK +++$+++ That's all right. We'll find him.
L660991 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I might have his number on campus.
L660990 +++$+++ u3503 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ OFFICER PUPCIK +++$+++ One other thing. About this kid, this student of yours -- Leer -- James Leer. You wouldn't know how I could get in touch with him, would you?
L660989 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Just kidding.
L660988 +++$+++ u3503 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ OFFICER PUPCIK +++$+++ No, the dog.
L660987 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ The perpetrator.
L660986 +++$+++ u3503 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ OFFICER PUPCIK +++$+++ We figure the perpetrator let him out. He's blind and we figure he just wandered off and got run over.
L660985 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ That's weird.
L660984 +++$+++ u3503 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ OFFICER PUPCIK +++$+++ Huh? Oh, someone pulled a B&E on Dr. Gaskell's closet. And the dog's missing.
L660983 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I could be wrong. What happened anyway?

L660699 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Pier Angeli, 1971 or '72, also pills. Charles Boyer, 1978, pills again. Charles Butterworth, 1946, I think. In a car. Supposedly it was an accident, but, you know...  He was distraught. Dorothy Dandridge, she took pills in, like, 1965. Albert Dekker, 1968, he hung himself. He wrote his suicide note in lipstick on his stomach. Alan Ladd, '64, more pills, Carole Landis, pills again, I forget when. George Reeves, Superman on TV, shot himself. Jean Seberg, pills of course, 1979. Everett Sioane -- he was good -- pills. Margaret Sullavan, pills, Lupe Velez, a lot of pills. Gig Young. He shot himself and his wife in 1978. There are more but I don't know if you would have heard of them. Ross Alexander? Clara Blandick? Maggie McNamara? Gia Scaia?
