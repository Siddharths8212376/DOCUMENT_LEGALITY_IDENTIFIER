L433704 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ How's it going?
L433697 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ He took the week off so we'd have time together.  So far he's worked on his boat every day.  Dad?  Ray Nicolet.
L433696 +++$+++ u6990 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You look great.  Your dad taking good care of you?
L433695 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Hi, Ray.
L434185 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You wanted to tussle, we tussled.
L434184 +++$+++ u6984 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KENNETH +++$+++ What's wrong with you?
L434177 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Just a minute.
L434176 +++$+++ u6984 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KENNETH +++$+++ Don't matter.  I let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants.
L434175 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You're not my type.
L434174 +++$+++ u6984 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KENNETH +++$+++ You know your divisions.  You like the fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah, I bet you do.  Like to get down and tussle a little bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle.  I say to her, "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat for you."  And I give Tuffy what every dog love best.  You know what that is? A bone.  I can give you a bone, too, girl.
L434173 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Flyweight.
L434172 +++$+++ u6984 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KENNETH +++$+++ Light to super-middleweight, as my body developed.  You go about what, bantam?
L434171 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ What'd you fight, middleweight?
L434169 +++$+++ u6984 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KENNETH +++$+++ I <i>was</i>...
L434168 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I can tell.
L434167 +++$+++ u6984 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KENNETH +++$+++ How you know that?
L434166 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You're a fighter?
L434162 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ The State Theater?
L434161 +++$+++ u6988 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MOSELLE +++$+++ I don't know -- the gym, the fights. I <i>know</i> he don't miss the fights.  Having some tomorrow night at the State Theater.  He use to take me.
L434160 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Where do you think I might find Maurice?
L434159 +++$+++ u6988 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MOSELLE +++$+++ Was a she, name Tuffy.
L434158 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ What did you call it?
L434157 +++$+++ u6988 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MOSELLE +++$+++ Got run over by a car.
L434156 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Your dog was killed?
L434155 +++$+++ u6988 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MOSELLE +++$+++ Well, <i>he</i> ain't even here that much.  I like to know where he goes, but at the same time I don't <i>want</i> to know, you understand?
L434154 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ He said he stayed with Maurice.
L434153 +++$+++ u6988 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MOSELLE +++$+++ Here?  In this house?
L434152 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ He said he stayed here last November.
L434151 +++$+++ u6988 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MOSELLE +++$+++ Glenn?  No, I don't know any Glenn.
L434150 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ No, I'm not.  Maybe you know him. Glenn Michaels?
L434149 +++$+++ u6988 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MOSELLE +++$+++ You a lawyer?
L434148 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ No.
L434147 +++$+++ u6988 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MOSELLE +++$+++ You not with probation, one of those?
L434146 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I'm looking for a friend of mine I think Maurice knows.
L434145 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Thanks.
L434144 +++$+++ u6988 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MOSELLE +++$+++ You like to sit down?
L434139 +++$+++ u6988 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MOSELLE +++$+++ That's Kenneth, my brother.  He's talking on the phone.
L434138 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ That's not Maurice?
L434133 +++$+++ u6988 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MOSELLE +++$+++ You find him, tell him the dog got run over and I'm out of grocery money.
L434132 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I'm looking for Maurice.
L434131 +++$+++ u6988 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MOSELLE +++$+++ What do you want?
L434130 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Moselle Miller?
L434592 +++$+++ u6986 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ My little girl, the tough babe.
L434591 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ He knew what he was doing.  Nobody forced him to rob banks.
L434590 +++$+++ u6986 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ I was just thinking... you could have a nice time with him on the plane -- like picking up where your interlude, or whatever you call it, left off. And then throw him in the can.
L434589 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ It's possible.  Why?
L434588 +++$+++ u6986 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ You gonna go get him?
L433949 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ None I'd like to share.
L433948 +++$+++ u6986 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.  What <i>I</i> want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long?  Any thoughts on that one?
L433947 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.
L433946 +++$+++ u6986 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ So?
L433945 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Buddy's sister Regina Mary Bragg got two calls from Buddy up in Detroit this morning, called Burdon.  She's also the one gave Burdon Buddy's address.
L433944 +++$+++ u6986 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ I imagine you would've though.
L433943 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I didn't have time.
L433942 +++$+++ u6986 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ You wave back?
L433941 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did.
L433940 +++$+++ u6986 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ He waved to you?
L433783 +++$+++ u6986 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Yeah, but you talked all the way from GCI to the turnpike.  It sounds more like a first date than a kidnapping.
L433782 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Foley <i>kid</i>napped me.
L433781 +++$+++ u6986 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.
L433780 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ My married boyfriend - setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity.  I couldn't believe it.
L433779 +++$+++ u6986 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Maybe.  But you're also curious about the man.  Twice last night you asked your married boyfriend Nicolet about him.  You were concerned, but you didn't want to show it.
L433778 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I want to bust his ass, put him in shackles.
L433777 +++$+++ u6986 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ But you know he's dirty and you still wanna see him again.
L433776 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Not at all.
L433775 +++$+++ u6986 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ He remind you of that guy, Tillman?
L433774 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ He's pretty laid back, confident.
L433773 +++$+++ u6986 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Remember, pay attention to how she talks about Foley, her tone.  Do it right, she'll tell you things she wouldn't tell Burdon.  Tell her you think he's a nice guy.  No, first tell her about being in the trunk with him, in the dark for half an hour, and see how she takes it.  If she's in on it, what does she get for all the aggravation; cops breathing on her?  I bet nothing.  So she still likes him enough to stick her neck out.  You think that's possible?  What kind of guy is he?
L433719 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Hello?
L433718 +++$+++ u6986 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Hello?  Yeah, she is.  Just a minute.  For you.
L433707 +++$+++ u6986 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Off a tip?
L433706 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Was it Foley?
L433701 +++$+++ u6986 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ I see that.
L433700 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Ray's with the F.B.I. Task Force, working on the prison break.
L433693 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ No, he looks a lot...
L433692 +++$+++ u6986 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ No?
L433691 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ He doesn't even look like that.
L433670 +++$+++ u6986 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Tell you what, you're a good girl, you might get another one for Christmas.
L433669 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday.
L433668 +++$+++ u6986 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ What are you thinking about?
L433626 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Huh.
L433625 +++$+++ u6986 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ "Hey, yourself."
L433624 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ What'd I say?
L433623 +++$+++ u6986 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ You were talking in your sleep.
L433343 +++$+++ u6986 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ I'd like that.
L433342 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?
L433341 +++$+++ u6986 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ We don't get to talk much any more.
L433340 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I really gotta go.
L433339 +++$+++ u6986 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they're divorced.  Why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife?  That's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em.
L433338 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Dad...
L433337 +++$+++ u6986 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ You used to like it.
L433336 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ No thanks.
L433335 +++$+++ u6986 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ You know you can always step in, work with me full-time as one of my investigators.
L433334 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Serving process, a Summons and Complaint.  Some con doing mandatory life doesn't like macaroni and cheese. He files suit, says he has no choice in what they serve and it violates his civil rights.
L433333 +++$+++ u6986 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ What're you doing at Glades?
L433332 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Can we change the subject?
L433331 +++$+++ u6986 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Then they're not separated, are they?
L433330 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ He's about to.
L433329 +++$+++ u6986 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Oh, he's moved out?
L433328 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Technically.  They're separated.
L433327 +++$+++ u6986 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ He's still married though, huh?
L433326 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ He was.  Ray's with the F.B.I. now, he switched over.
L433325 +++$+++ u6986 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Which one is that?  The ATF guy?
L433324 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.
L433323 +++$+++ u6986 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Happy birthday, kid.  You want another Coke?
L433322 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Thanks, Dad.
L433321 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ --Sig-Sauer .38.  I love it.
L433320 +++$+++ u6986 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ It's a --
L433319 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ It's beautiful.
L433317 +++$+++ u6986 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Something better.  Open it.
L433316 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You fit another Chanel suit in here?
L434497 +++$+++ u6985 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAID +++$+++ The combination is three-ten-forty-four.
L434496 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ A'ight, this time we gotta get the motherfuckin' trajectory right...  Okay, on three:  One... Two...
L434480 +++$+++ u6985 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAID +++$+++ Like a fag.
L434479 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ How do I look, mama?
L434446 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Let's go upstairs, have a look at the man's bedroom.  All right now, you and Mr. Buddy check the rooms down here. Look at the wall behind any pictures hanging on it.  Look at the walls in the closets.  The man has a safe, it's gonna be up there somewhere.
L434445 +++$+++ u6985 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAID +++$+++ I don't have any idea.
L434444 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Where's Ripley's safe at, he keep his valuables in.
L434443 +++$+++ u6985 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAID +++$+++ That's right, just me.
L434442 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ You here all by yourself?
L434439 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ When's he due back?
L434438 +++$+++ u6985 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAID +++$+++ He's in Florida.  Palm Beach.
L434437 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Out for the evening?
L434436 +++$+++ u6985 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAID +++$+++ I told you, he isn't here.
L434435 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Not yet.  Where's Mr. Ripley?
L433760 +++$+++ u6986 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ So the woman's married.  She goes to bed with this prison escapee because he misses his little girl and then tells the world about it.  But you don't reveal her name, you protect her.  It sounds like you're saying it's okay as long as her husband doesn't find out about it.  Like the guy who cheats on his wife, saying what she doesn't know won't hurt her.
L433759 +++$+++ u6990 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ The woman also said he stole her husband's gun, a twenty-two pistol, and some of his clothes.
L433744 +++$+++ u6986 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ That's how you score now?
L433743 +++$+++ u6990 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I spoke to her.  The guy told her he missed his little girl and she felt sorry for him.
L433742 +++$+++ u6986 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ ...She fixes him pork chops and rice, the next thing you know they're making love on the sofa.  She says he was very gentle.
L433715 +++$+++ u6990 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Yeah, as soon as we got back.
L433714 +++$+++ u6986 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Did you pay the guy the reward?
L433709 +++$+++ u6986 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ I knew it, soon as I saw they were offering a reward.
L433708 +++$+++ u6990 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Yeah, someone spotted two of 'em in this hobo camp out by the airport, called the number--
L433703 +++$+++ u6990 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ No.  Course not.
L433702 +++$+++ u6986 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ In case no one knows what he does. Tell me, Ray, you ever wear one says, "Undercover"?
L433699 +++$+++ u6986 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Likewise.
L433698 +++$+++ u6990 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Sisco.
L434541 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Where the fuck is Foley?
L434540 +++$+++ u6991 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Foley's got it.
L434539 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at.
L434538 +++$+++ u6991 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Midge.
L434519 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Where you been hiding, Dick?
L434518 +++$+++ u6991 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Are those <i>my</i> suits?
L434517 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Well, if it isn't the Ripper hisself.
L433580 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled.
L433579 +++$+++ u6991 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the fish thing?
L433561 +++$+++ u6991 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Still...
L433560 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Faux goose down.
L433551 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ ...and that extra pillow's gonna be an even three c's.
L433550 +++$+++ u6991 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Well, I need that...
L433549 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ That Bausch & Lomb Saline shit you asked for is gonna be eighty bucks.
L433547 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Whoever.  The point is, prices are goin' up, too.  Better get your little black book out, Richard.  We got some business to talk about.
L433546 +++$+++ u6991 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street.  But then, I could be wrong...
L433545 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Year ago, I come in here on credit card fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up.
L433544 +++$+++ u6991 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ What?
L433543 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Not so fast, Dick.  Starting now, there's gonna be an across the board cost a living increase.
L433542 +++$+++ u6991 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Thank you...
L434500 +++$+++ u6992 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ WHITE BOY BOB +++$+++ Are they dead?
L434499 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ ...the fuck is this...
L434459 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ White Boy, the man's not gonna hide no diamonds under the fuckin' mattress.
L434458 +++$+++ u6992 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ WHITE BOY BOB +++$+++ I found a rubber.
L434387 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ I sent these two looking for him, they come back shaking their heads.
L434386 +++$+++ u6992 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ WHITE BOY BOB +++$+++ I think he must've fell in.
L434069 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Uh-huh.  You recall, did it say dead or alive?
L434068 +++$+++ u6992 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ WHITE BOY BOB +++$+++ Ten gees.
L434067 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ White Boy, how much is the reward on the man again?
L434047 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Jack Foley, famous bank robber.
L434046 +++$+++ u6992 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ WHITE BOY BOB +++$+++ We have a problem here?
L437782 +++$+++ u6996 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ He's been like that all day.  Hey Danny, you coming?
L437781 +++$+++ u6993 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ What is it with Red?  I've never seen him this way.
L437778 +++$+++ u6993 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ If Evelyn's here, the rest are here!
L437777 +++$+++ u6996 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Are you sure they're here?
L437593 +++$+++ u6993 +++$+++ m468 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ No, numbnuts, die.  You get your nurse alone, you look her in the eye, and say, "Baby, they're training me for war, and I don't know what'll happen.  But if I die tomorrow, I wanna know that we lived all we could tonight."  I've never known it to fail.
