L548833 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Oh my God.  That is so not funny.  You're late.  You're really late.  Now get out here and have some cereal.
L550051 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ No, it isn't.  Because it isn't everything.  And we want every- thing, don't we?
L550050 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ It's not good enough.
L550049 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Always.  Always.  And you won't hear a voice.  But in <u>here</u>.  You'll know.  What I'm saying.
L550048 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Can I talk to you?  When you're there.
L550047 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Right here.  Right here.  <u>Inside</u> the magician.  Shhhh.
L550046 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ So where are you?
L550045 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ The world.  <u>Thinks</u> I'm gone.  But only the magician.  Knows better.
L550041 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Half.  Of him.
L550040 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ But you can still see him.
L550039 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ If a soldier loses his legs in a war.  Is he the same guy?  Sure he is.
L550036 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ You dying.
L550035 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ So what do you think we're gonna talk about?
L550030 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Well, don't make him disappear before I see him.
L550029 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Rache says it's from you.
L550028 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Find the bird cage?
L549808 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Rache can do that part.
L549807 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I've got a lot of medicine in me, sweetie.  And I'm a little wobbly for driving or running ar...
L549805 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I helped.
L549804 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Okay.  These are good.
L549648 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Oh.
L549647 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson. She does this twenty times a day.
L549646 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ How do you know?
L549645 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Ben.  God doesn't like visitors.
L549644 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Heaven.  I have to tell him he's made a mistake.  He should take Grammy Martha first.  Or Grandpa Norman.
L549643 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Ben where do you have to get to?
L549642 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Before you.
L549641 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Where Ben?
L549640 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ No!  I have to get there.
L549639 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Ben!  Mommy's so glad to see you -- Now stop climbing!  Ben listen to me...
L549567 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Sugar.  I was slow dancing to that song before Rachel was even born.
L549566 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ That's Rache's song!
L549565 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you...held you so ti-ight...
L549535 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I'm still sick, but I'm better.
L549534 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ So you're okay.
L549529 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Is your bad?
L549528 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Grammy had a different kind. There are lots of kinds.  Hers was very bad.
L549526 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I have cancer.  Do you know what that is?
L549525 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ You have the WORST flu since...
L549524 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Mommy's sick, guys.
L549427 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Pray.  We never find out.
L549426 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ No.
L549379 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Nope.  I got my warm t-shirt.
L549378 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ ARE YOU CRAZY, YOU COULD <u>SUFFOCATE</u> IN THERE!!!
L549372 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Thursday's fine...
L549371 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Mommy, if your real name's Jackie and I call you mommy; and Rachel's real name's Rachel...Then when I see her do I say hi Stepmommy?  And if my name's Ben, how come you don't call me son?
L549368 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Tomorrow?  Can I have one butterscotch pudding for dessert?
L549367 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I'm fine, ba...
L549366 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Mom...?
L549365 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ That I do.  Always will.
L549362 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Do me a favor?  Eat it, and then give me a secret report, okay?  Pay particular attention to whether it's chewy and if it tastes more like chocolate or soup.
L549361 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I did.  Do I have to eat lamb? Daddy didn't cook it, she did.
L549360 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Of course, you do.  Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug, and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food.  So, all the more meatballs for you.  But you know what.
L549359 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Yes.
L549358 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I'm somewhere, thinking of you.  And meatballs.  And you know what?
L549357 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Where are you, anyway?
L549356 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Not a lot, sweetie.  It's a country. Like Canada.  Only smaller.
L549355 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Is that like Luigi's?
L549354 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You'll be up to your armpits in meatballs, I'm flying them in from Sweden.
L549353 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ And many meatballs.
L549352 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.
L549351 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Rache says I have to eat <u>lamb</u>.  I told her <u>you're</u> making me <u>spaghetti</u>!
L549139 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ If you want me to hate her I will.
L549138 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ What honey?
L549137 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Mommy?
L549136 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Yes...if you like big hair...
L549135 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I think she's pretty, Mommy.
L549134 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ People like Rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money.
L549133 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Does Rachel make a lot of money?
L549132 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Ben, mommies work too.  They work very hard.  Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working.  I just don't get paid.
L549131 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Rachel's job is she works.
L549130 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ No, that's your fault.  It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority.  Which means, the most important job.
L549129 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Mommy?  It's not Rachel's fault I ran away.
L549093 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I knew where I was all the time.
L549092 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Ben!  Oh my Ben!  Are you alright?
L548941 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Thank you Ben.  Annabelle!
L548940 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Poof!  You're happy now.
L548937 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Seven of clubs.  Nobody's mad we just want to talk about it.
L548936 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Queen of diamonds.
L548863 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Lava's hateable.  I never thought of that.
L548862 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I have lava.
L548861 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I hate snails and blue cheese. Especially together.  <u>Hate</u>.
L548855 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I noticed a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washer -- perhaps Rachel's underpants are in there -- Now where are your lunches?
L548854 +++$+++ u7879 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Why does Rachel wear Daddy's underpants? Doesn't she have underpants of her own?
L549162 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Sure.  I was just doin' my nails.
L549161 +++$+++ u7880 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ COOPER +++$+++ May I remind you that Duncan has the <u>client</u> arriving at exac...
L548874 +++$+++ u7880 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ COOPER +++$+++ Actually, never.  They'll always hate you.  There's a gene for it.
L548873 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ And when did that pass?
L548872 +++$+++ u7880 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ COOPER +++$+++ I once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother's head --
L548871 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You say that like I don't know that.
L548870 +++$+++ u7880 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ COOPER +++$+++ You've got a fruit loop in your hair.
L548869 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Cooper, back the fill off I don't have enough shadow...
L549243 +++$+++ u7881 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ DR. SWEIKERT +++$+++ Sooner than later.  You really need to.
L549242 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Why would his worry?  Or my children's worry.  Or anyone's worry.  Help the sit...
L549241 +++$+++ u7881 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ DR. SWEIKERT +++$+++ Have you still never told him?
L549240 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I have to get dressed.  My ex-husband has asked me to dinner.  God knows why, he was very mysteri...
L549238 +++$+++ u7881 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ DR. SWEIKERT +++$+++ Let's take our best shot.
L549237 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ That's necessary, huh?
L549236 +++$+++ u7881 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ DR. SWEIKERT +++$+++ At first.  Then, after awhile, some chemo.
L549235 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ So we'll...radiate some more?
L549234 +++$+++ u7881 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ DR. SWEIKERT +++$+++ Every day.  More and more.
L549233 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ People beat it, don't they?  All the time.
L549764 +++$+++ u7882 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ DUNCAN +++$+++ Rachel, <u>don't</u> do this, you will <u>never</u> forgive yourself!
L549763 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ No, no, no, this is a job that's hard to <u>keep</u>, <u>not</u> a job that's hard to <u>lose</u>, can't be both.
L549762 +++$+++ u7882 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ DUNCAN +++$+++ You can't <u>do</u> that, I won't <u>let</u> you!
L549760 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Duncan.  I've got an <u>even</u> <u>better</u> idea...

L549758 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ They're losing one mother.  They can't lose two.
L549757 +++$+++ u7882 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ DUNCAN +++$+++ Look, I will <u>send</u> a P.A. to pick up the children.  There are <u>agencies</u> that supply sitters, nannies...
