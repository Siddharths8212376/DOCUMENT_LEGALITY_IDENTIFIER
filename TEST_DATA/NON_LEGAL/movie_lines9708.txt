L141892 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ You don't understand --
L141891 +++$+++ u4596 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LOWRY +++$+++ Guy's a C.I.A. shrink.  Here to I.D. Fletcher.  They knew each other somehow.
L141890 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ Wait --
L141889 +++$+++ u4596 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LOWRY +++$+++ While we walk.  D.C. police want him for assault. Secret Service for counterfeiting and we're tracking him on a string of bank robberies.  No one knows what the C.I.A. wants him for.
L141888 +++$+++ u4595 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LIZA +++$+++ Tell me about it.
L141887 +++$+++ u4596 +++$+++ m303 +++$+++ LOWRY +++$+++ We're waiting for jurisdictional problems to be cleared up.  This guy Fletcher's something else.
L143230 +++$+++ u4599 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ A.T.L. +++$+++ There is no abort procedure -- we don't know how we turned the damn thing on, let alone how to turn it off.
L143229 +++$+++ u4609 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What?
L143228 +++$+++ u4599 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ A.T.L. +++$+++ There's no plug to pull.
L143227 +++$+++ u4609 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Pull the plug.  Get her out of there.
L143226 +++$+++ u4599 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ A.T.L. +++$+++ We've lost contact.
L143224 +++$+++ u4609 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Ellie?
L143223 +++$+++ u4599 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ A.T.L. +++$+++ We have benzel activation, repeat, we have benzel activation.  Control to Arroway, you okay in there?  Repeat, Control to Arroway, come back.
L143218 +++$+++ u4609 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Anything happening in there, El?
L143217 +++$+++ u4599 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ A.T.L. +++$+++ I'm not sure.  We have no launch protocol; the entry of the passenger is supposed to initiate activation.
L143216 +++$+++ u4609 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What?
L143386 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I don't know.  Ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
L143385 +++$+++ u4600 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ CHAIRMAN +++$+++ You don't believe it to be... tell me something, Doctor.  Why do you think they would go to all this trouble... bring you tens of thousands of light years, and then send you home without a shred of proof?  Sort of bad form, wouldn't you say?  What was their intent?
L143380 +++$+++ u4600 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ CHAIRMAN +++$+++ All the elements are there.  A woman, orphaned young, under a great deal of stress.  The failure of a project she's staked her self-worth and very sense of identity on -- induces a fantasy of reuniting with her 'father in heaven' as it were. Is it possible?
L143379 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Is it possible...?
L143378 +++$+++ u4600 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ CHAIRMAN +++$+++ Dr. Arroway, do you think it's possible you had some kind of... delusional episode.
L143377 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L143376 +++$+++ u4600 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ CHAIRMAN +++$+++ He died...  ... in 1972.
L143375 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L143374 +++$+++ u4600 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ CHAIRMAN +++$+++ ... And this is how the extraterrestrial presented himself to you?  As your father?
L142805 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ -- It's extremely unlikely that they had any idea what they were looking at.
L142804 +++$+++ u4607 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ KITZ +++$+++ -- Or 'you're our kind of people --'
L142797 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ It's a hoax.  I knew it!
L142796 +++$+++ u4607 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ KITZ +++$+++ What in the hell...?
L142788 +++$+++ u4607 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ KITZ +++$+++ How is that possible?  How could all that information be encoded in --
L142787 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ Hope there's a cartoon.
L142768 +++$+++ u4607 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ KITZ +++$+++ Okay, fine, they've got the primes -- but if you're right about there being another more significant transmission still to come --
L142767 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ Mike, because of the Earth's rotation we're only in line with Vega so many hours a day; the only way to get the whole message is to cooperate with other stations.  If Dr. Arroway hadn't moved quickly we could have lost key elements.
L142760 +++$+++ u4607 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ KITZ +++$+++ Dr. Arroway, let me first say --
L142759 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.
L142758 +++$+++ u4607 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ KITZ +++$+++ Dr. Arroway --
L142677 +++$+++ u4606 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ KENT +++$+++ So... there wasn't any clothes in the machine.  She was just sitting there on the floor with her ear pressed up against the Maytag. Listening.
L142676 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ So?
L142675 +++$+++ u4606 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ KENT +++$+++ Last week, about 3 A.M., Fish -- Dr. Fisher -- was on a late shift, and he found her doing laundry.
L142674 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ Tell me.
L142673 +++$+++ u4606 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ KENT +++$+++ Nothing.  Okay.  Some of us have been a little... not concerned, exactly, but...
L142670 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ Still settling in, really.  Where's Dr. Arroway?
L142669 +++$+++ u4606 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ KENT +++$+++ Glad to have you, David.  How's the new office?
L142668 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ Now I remember why I went into theoretical work.  Kent.
L143136 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ For giving me a chance, just for a moment, to feel what it must be like to be you.
L143135 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Thank you?
L143134 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ Nothing.  I guess I just wanted to thank you.
L143133 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ What would you have me say, David?
L143132 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ Ellie... we both know that if I was any kind of a man, I never would've entered this race.  That I would have told the President straight out:  Helen, Eleanor Arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass... but she's got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together.  That more then anyone else on the planet, she's earned this.  And that she should be the one to go because she's the best we have.  But that's not who I am.  I like to think it's who I might've been if things had gone a different way; that I might have been worthy, really worthy of what I've been given...  You do what you have to do.  And in the end, as with everything, it comes down to power.  And it isn't fair...
L143131 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Good luck, David.
L143130 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ Right.  Well.
L143129 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ This... seemed best.
L143128 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ You aren't staying?
L143018 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Maybe they are.  Maybe this is all part of the package.  The building of the machine has demanded international cooperation on an unprecedented scale.  Maybe requiring us to come together in this way was, in effect, part of the plan.
L143017 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ They knew our level of development. If, as you say, they've done this many times they'd be well aware of the implications.
L143014 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ ... I can't believe they wouldn't take something as basic as our biological needs into account...
L143013 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ ... Two years is still a hell of a long time -- and as far as we can tell there aren't any provisions in the machine design for storing food, water, even air...
L142991 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ Excuse me, I'm late for a meeting.
L142990 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ You...
L142989 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ As of three o'clock this afternoon. I submitted my resignation.
L142988 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ What?
L142987 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.
L142986 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I'm asking for your help, David.  I want to go.  They'll need someone relatively young, unattached -- and probably a scientist.  As the President's Science Advisor you have enormous weight... I'm asking if you'll support my candidacy.
L142985 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ I don't understand.
L142984 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ David... I know we've had our differences... but I've always thought of you as a fair man, even when we've disagreed -- and It's in that light I'm hoping you'll consider my request...
L142983 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ It'll just take a moment.
L142982 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ Actually I'm running late --
L142981 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Do you have a minute -- ?
L142980 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ Ellie.
L142979 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ David --
L142972 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ You were right, Ellie.  You were right all along.
L142971 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ You mean --
L142970 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ We've cracked it.  Lunacharsky found it.
L142969 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ What is it?  What's happened?
L142900 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ Interesting analogy.  And how guilty would we feel if we happened to destroy some microbes on a beach in Africa?
L142899 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Ms. President, this is communist paranoia right out of War of the Worlds.  There is no reason whatsoever to believe the ETIs intentions are hostile.  We pose no threat to them -- it would be like us going out of our way to destroy microbes on a beach in Africa.
L142852 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ It's not a threat, Ellie, it's a fact -- if you're not careful, you may find yourself out in the cold very quickly.  Play ball.  Really. It's good advice.
L142851 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Are you threatening me?
L142850 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ I want you to listen to me, carefully.  The minute the implications of this message became clear, this stopped being simply a scientific matter and became a political one -- an extremely complex, extremely volatile one. There are forces at work here you don't understand; I can help you up to a point, but only up to a point.
L142849 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ Ellie --
L142848 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I'm going to convert Mr. Science-is- the-root-of-all-evil?  This is absurd, David.  We have work to do here, I don't have time to play babysitter to the God Squad.
L142847 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ Apparently he's genuinely interested in science.  This could be a chance to win him over.
L142846 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ With me.
L142845 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ The theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. She's also named Palmer Joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you.
L142844 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ What?  Why?
L142843 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ ... Arrangements also have to be made for the V.I.P.s coming in, mostly religious leaders...
L142793 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Rotate 90 degrees counterclock wise.
L142792 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ Throw a gray scale on it; standard interpolation.
L142780 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ You must have checked the signal for polarization modulation already...
L142779 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ ... could it be a nested code of some sort?
L142757 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ It's hardly yesterday; the signal's been traveling for over twenty-six years.  As for why...  I'm hoping your own expertise in decryption algorithms will help us find out -- to see if there's another message buried deeper in the signal.
L142756 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ If it's attention you want I'd say you've got it.  Just one thing:  Why Vega? Everyone's looked at Vega for years with no results, and now, yesterday, they start broadcasting primes. Why?
L142755 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Mathematics is the only truly universal language, Senator.  We think this may be a beacon -- an announcement to get our attention.
L142704 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ It was a worthy experiment -- worthy of you; I was wrong about that part. But it's over now.
L142703 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ David --
L142702 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ Then why haven't you detected any signals?  If, as you claim, there have been thousands, millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasn't one signal gotten through?  It'll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through; you're welcome to stay until then.
L142701 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Goddamnit, they are out there, David --
L142700 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ No... You're not.  But the price has just gotten too high.
L142699 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ The difference being what -- that I refuse to adopt the standard line, that I don't care about the results of my work?  Well, I do care.  Of course any discovery has to be verifiable, of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method, but I refuse to go around pretending I'm some kind of dispassionate automaton when it's obvious to anyone with a brain I'm just not.
L142698 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ The point is, this isn't just scientific inquiry anymore -- it's turned into some kind of personal obsession.
L142697 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I'm searching for patterns in the noise, that's all.  Order in the chaos.  I'm practicing listening --
L142696 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ Meaning I have to go defend a budget to the President and to Congress and you're out here listening to washing machines.
L142695 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Meaning...
L142694 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ It's not like you've given me much choice.
L142693 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ You can't just pull the plug, David.
L142692 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ Ellie, I should have done this a long time ago, certainly before I left the N.S.F., but I wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt --
L142691 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ It's not enough having my search time systematically cut down -- you know I'm down to three hours a week now.
L142690 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ You know why I'm here.
L142689 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Did I tell you we've expanded the search spectrum?  We're including several other possible magic frequencies -- not just the hydrogen line anymore.  I was trying to get inside their heads, y'know?  And I started thinking, what other constants are there in the Universe besides hydrogen, and then suddenly it was so obvious -- transcendantals, right?  So we've been trying variations of pi...
L142688 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ Ellie...
L142687 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ No doubt.
L142686 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ Now exactly.  It's... complicated.
L142685 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ 'President's Science Advisor' -- so what, you just spend all your time jetting around on Air Force One now...?
L142684 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ I'm surprised you even knew it was an election year.
L142683 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Really?  Congratulations, by the way.
L142682 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ Very well; since my appointment he's been made interim director.
L142681 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Oh?  How's he doing?
L142680 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ Peter sends his regards.
L142679 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ No, thanks.
L142678 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Pepsi?  Tequila?
L142609 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Then disagree but don't stand in my way!
L142608 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ I disagree.
L142607 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ What if you're wrong?  No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks.
L142606 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ Two:  There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time.
L142605 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ You're --
L142604 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ And only two probabilities:  One: there is intelligent life in the universe but they're so far away you'll never contact it in your lifetime --
L142603 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity.  There are over four hundred billion stars out there --
L142602 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ I'm not.  You're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense --
L142601 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I'm willing to take that risk.
L142600 +++$+++ u4601 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ DRUMLIN +++$+++ I'm sorry, Miss Arroway, not only is it too Speculative a subject for a doctoral dissertation, at this point in your career it'd be tantamount to suicide.
L142914 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Well --
L142913 +++$+++ u4610 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PRESIDENT LASKER +++$+++ What's the status of the decryption effort?
L142908 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Yes -- of course -- all I'm saying is, this message was written in the language of science -- mathematics -- and was clearly intended to be received by scientists.  If it had been religious in nature it should have taken the form of a burning bush, or a booming voice from the sky...
L142907 +++$+++ u4610 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PRESIDENT LASKER +++$+++ Mr. Rank's organization represents the point of view of tens of millions of families, Dr. Arroway. Feel free to disagree, but there won't be any suppressing of opinions here today.
L142896 +++$+++ u4610 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PRESIDENT LASKER +++$+++ A transport.  So are they coming or are we going?
L142895 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ ... And while its function remains, for the moment, a mystery, my best guess is that it represents a transport of some kind.
L142831 +++$+++ u4610 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PRESIDENT LASKER +++$+++ How soon will you be able to decode it?
L142830 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Because you cut it from the budget three years running.
L142820 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ It could be anything.  The first volume of some Encyclopedia Galactica...
L142819 +++$+++ u4610 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PRESIDENT LASKER +++$+++ What does it say?
L142859 +++$+++ u4608 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ LUNACHARSKY +++$+++ I don't know.  Maybe there is a fourth layer in there somewhere, but if there is, I sure as hell can't find it.
L142858 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ How can that be?
L142857 +++$+++ u4608 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ LUNACHARSKY +++$+++ No primer.
L142856 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ And?
L142855 +++$+++ u4608 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ LUNACHARSKY +++$+++ We've repeated.  A few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one.
L142854 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ What?
L142833 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Maybe it'll be at the end of the data when the message recycles.
L142832 +++$+++ u4608 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ LUNACHARSKY +++$+++ There's no way of knowing.  Without a key -- a primer, to help us, maybe never.
L142814 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ A third layer.
L142813 +++$+++ u4608 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ LUNACHARSKY +++$+++ In ancient times when parchment was in short supply people would write over old writing... it was called a palimpsest.
L142812 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ What...
L142782 +++$+++ u4608 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ LUNACHARSKY +++$+++ Analyzing signal polarization shifts.
L142781 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Dr. Lunacharsky...?
L142728 +++$+++ u4613 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ WILLIE +++$+++ NORAD's not tracking any spacecraft in our vector including snoops; shuttle Endeavor's in sleep mode.
L142727 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ How's the spying tonight, guys?
L142723 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I scanned it at Arecibo; negative results, always.
L142722 +++$+++ u4613 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ WILLIE +++$+++ That can't be right; it's only twenty-six light years away.
L142718 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Put it on speakers.
L142717 +++$+++ u4613 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ WILLIE +++$+++ Hydrogen times pi...  Got it.  Strong sucker.
L142713 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I'm not sure.  You mind checking right ascension 18 hours, 34 minutes; declination plus 38 degrees 41 minutes?
L142712 +++$+++ u4613 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ WILLIE +++$+++ Got a bogey, boss?
L142665 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ VB10's an M dwarf; Signa Draconis... too old.
L142664 +++$+++ u4613 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ WILLIE +++$+++ Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.
L142663 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ J39 Z186...?
L142818 +++$+++ u4606 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ KENT +++$+++ It's incredibly rich.  We've been cataloging it in frames or 'pages'; right now we're on 10,413.
L142817 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I think we just hit the cosmic jackpot.
L142774 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ It's a civilian facility.
L142773 +++$+++ u4606 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ KENT +++$+++ Can't we get rid of them?
L142736 +++$+++ u4606 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ KENT +++$+++ It can't be coming from Vega, the system's too young.
L142735 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Okay, let's just slow down.  Pull up the starfield signal origin.
L142667 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Sensitive.  I'm coming at this wrong... missing something... something...
L142666 +++$+++ u4606 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ KENT +++$+++ You've only searched -- what is it, sixteen hundred stars without a peep?  Try not to take it too personally.
L142655 +++$+++ u4606 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ KENT +++$+++ Never seen the optical sky myself, but I hear it's nice too.
L142654 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ It's beautiful.
L142653 +++$+++ u4606 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ KENT +++$+++ It's how I hear it.  The display's just a little something I programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of sight.
L142652 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ This is how you see the sky?
L142651 +++$+++ u4606 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ KENT +++$+++ Here, right around Centaurus A.
L142650 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Nice.  Where?
L142649 +++$+++ u4606 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ KENT +++$+++ 1919+21.  Found a glitch in the timing; probably a starquake.
L142648 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Ellie.  Pulsar?
L142647 +++$+++ u4606 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ KENT +++$+++ Kent, Kent for Chrissakes.  You must be Eleanor.
L142646 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Dr. Cullers?
L143391 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Because I can't.
L143390 +++$+++ u4607 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ KITZ +++$+++ So why don't you admit what by your own standards must be the truth: that this experience simply didn't happen.
L143384 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ -- but I don't believe it to be the truth.
L143383 +++$+++ u4607 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ KITZ +++$+++ Thank you, Doctor.  Now --
L143382 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Is it possible.  Yes.  But --
L143381 +++$+++ u4607 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ KITZ +++$+++ Please answer the question, Doctor.
L143373 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ By our standards... yes.
L143372 +++$+++ u4607 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ KITZ +++$+++ In fact, by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible.
L143371 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I don't have the figures in front of me, but yes, that sounds about right.
L143370 +++$+++ u4607 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ KITZ +++$+++ And current theory holds that to sustain the sort of wormholes you're talking about, even for a fraction of a second, would require more energy than our sun produces in a year, is that correct?
L143369 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ There is no direct evidence, no.
L143334 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I don't have an official response, Michael.  All I have are the same questions you have.
L143333 +++$+++ u4607 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ KITZ +++$+++ Is that your official response?
L143332 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ ... I don't understand it.  All I can think is that maybe because the video gear wasn't accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design.
L142826 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ That's terrific, but there's one problem:  we don't have the means to receive all the data on our own.
L142825 +++$+++ u4607 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ KITZ +++$+++ If at some later date the message proves harmless, we can discuss sharing it with the rest of the world, but until then --
L142824 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Pardon me, but you can't do -- !
L142777 +++$+++ u4607 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ KITZ +++$+++ And a hundred mile airspace.
