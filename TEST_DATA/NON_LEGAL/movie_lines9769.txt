L176361 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Ray, maybe this isn't ...
L176358 +++$+++ u4969 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ That's our sister.  She's got a new boyfriend.
L176357 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No. What happened?
L176356 +++$+++ u4969 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Hey, Ed. Did you hear about Marcia?

L176221 +++$+++ u4969 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ That's right. You don't know. Doors don't fly open for guys like us.
L176220 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I don't know.
L176219 +++$+++ u4969 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ How many opportunities are you going to get in your life?
L176218 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Screw off.
L176217 +++$+++ u4969 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You're gonna be a video store clerk for the rest of your life? This is your big ambition, rearranging the "Ernest" movies?
L176216 +++$+++ u4969 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Oh Yeah? What's your master plan here?
L176215 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I'm doing all right.
L176214 +++$+++ u4969 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ All right. Let me ask you something... are you happy like this?
L176213 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Whenever you ask me something why do you always say "Let me ask you something?" Why don't you just ask me?
L176212 +++$+++ u4969 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What?
L176211 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Why do you do that?
L176210 +++$+++ u4969 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ In a second! In a hot second. Let me ask you something --
L176209 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You would do this? You would actually --
L176208 +++$+++ u4969 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Oh man! They couldn't pick me! They had to pick you!
L176207 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Look -- there's a million ways to humiliate yourself - I gotta think of a new way? I mean, it's all day! Every minute. Id be like a monkey at the zoo. I just...
L176206 +++$+++ u4969 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What?
L176205 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I ... I'm not gonna do it.
L176202 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Hi, Shari.  Let's go in the stockroom.
L176201 +++$+++ u4969 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I got your message. Way to go!
L176142 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ We're excited.
L176141 +++$+++ u4969 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I'm making a tape.
L176140 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Thumbsucker!
L176139 +++$+++ u4969 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I'm not stitching Nikes in Panama! ... Bedwetter!
L176138 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ That's like... those people stitching Nikes in Panama saying they're in the NBA.
L176137 +++$+++ u4969 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Yeah. I service video equipment.
L176136 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You're in show business?
L176135 +++$+++ u4969 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Show business.
L176134 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What is?!
L176133 +++$+++ u4969 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Yeah, but let's stay on one subject. Whoever that person is is going to be famous. They'll be able to get whatever they want. They'll ... trust me, this is my business.
L176132 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What are you drunk?
L176131 +++$+++ u4969 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
L176130 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What?
L176129 +++$+++ u4969 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You know, that would be like a great thing.
L176114 +++$+++ u4969 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I know. I mean I'm sitting there and her father's asking me about my "career prospects" and I'm playing "Risk," with her kid brother, Leon and at dinner the dog's sniffing at my balls -- at least I hope it was the dog. 'Cause her mother disappeared for a while.
L176113 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What do you mean all of a sudden? You've been going with her six months.
L176110 +++$+++ u4969 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I was... having dinner with Shari and her parents.
L176109 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Where were you?
L176108 +++$+++ u4969 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What's up?
L176953 +++$+++ u4974 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ I love you! 1 want to marry you!
L176952 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No -- keep it.
L176715 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No problema.  You want a picture?
L176714 +++$+++ u4974 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Mr. Pekurny. I'm sorry to bother you. My son would just love to have your autograph.
L176455 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Who's --
L176454 +++$+++ u4974 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Who's Shari?
L176453 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Hi, Shari.
L176452 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Oh, is Shari here? Why didn't you just say so? Why are you giving me a song-and-dance about being tired?
L176451 +++$+++ u4974 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Ray, where do you keep the glasses?
L177095 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No. Ray sat on it. I'11 see you.
L177094 +++$+++ u4962 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ Do you still have it?
L177093 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ -- That we were doing "together." I finished it. It came out great! Because no one was standing over my shoulder bothering me - "That's too much glue. You're using too much glue."
L177092 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ The pirate ship.
L177091 +++$+++ u4962 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ What...
L177090 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah? That's good. Sorry is good. You know I finished that model.
L177089 +++$+++ u4962 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ Ed... I'm sorry.
L177088 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ All right... This is my father, I don't know what the hell he can do, but if anyone out there can help him -- get him a job - I'11 ... help you. I'11 ... mention your business or ... I don't know, we'11 figure it out.  I gotta go.
L177087 +++$+++ u4962 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ I need help. How many times if just one little thing that I needed would've happened, it would've changed everything. If I had a few dollars when an opportunity came along or... the tumblers just never clicked for me.
L177086 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ So you saw me on TV and you said "Hey, let me jump on this."
L177085 +++$+++ u4962 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ The last two years, I've been a limousine driver, but I don't see well anymore, so...
L177084 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Oh, man! So...
L177083 +++$+++ u4962 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ Check forging.
L177082 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What...
L177081 +++$+++ u4962 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ No. Two times.
L177080 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ The whole time? Eighteen years?
L177079 +++$+++ u4962 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ I was in jail.
L177078 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ It could be, if you fixed it up. How did you... ? I mean how does anyone ... wind up like this?
L177077 +++$+++ u4962 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ Quite a shithole, isn't it?
L177071 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ It's Ed.
L177070 +++$+++ u4962 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ Who is it?
L176828 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No. Am I supposed to?
L176827 +++$+++ u4962 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ You don't recognize me.
L176826 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Hi.
L176825 +++$+++ u4962 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ Hello.
L177050 +++$+++ u4964 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Yeah. Why?
L177049 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Ohh... do you own a cat?
L177048 +++$+++ u4964 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Ed?
L177047 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Ohhh...
L177037 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Mm.
L177036 +++$+++ u4964 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Good?
L177035 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Mm.
L177034 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What is? Oh, dinner!
L177033 +++$+++ u4964 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ No. It's going to be about a half-hour.
L177032 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Can I help with anything?
L177009 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Sure.
L177008 +++$+++ u4964 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Why don't you come over. And I'11 make dinner. And you bring a movie. And ... We'11 make a night of it ... okay?
L177007 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No.
L177006 +++$+++ u4964 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Are you busy tomorrow night?
L176994 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Hm?
L176993 +++$+++ u4964 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ We have to stop meeting like this.
L176992 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Oh!!
L176803 +++$+++ u4964 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Oh, great! Thanks. I'm just going uptown.
L176802 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Um... They gave me a limo, uh...
L176801 +++$+++ u4964 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Well, it was really nice meeting you and, uh...  I'd better get a cab.
L176800 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Oh, yeah, I love those. Yeah... those are funny...
L176796 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Thanks... That's ...
L176795 +++$+++ u4964 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ I'm Jill. I really like your show. I think you're great.
L176793 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Hi.
L176792 +++$+++ u4964 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Hi.
L176760 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What?... Why?
L176759 +++$+++ u4964 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ That girl's an idiot.
L176252 +++$+++ u4969 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ If they keep Ed on for one full month, he gets a balloon payment.
L176251 +++$+++ u4967 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ MARCIA +++$+++ What does that have to do with... ?
L176250 +++$+++ u4969 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ For instance... me and my friend Bucky are buying out my boss. His equipment, trucks, client list, the whole shmear.
L176249 +++$+++ u4967 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ MARCIA +++$+++ How?
L176248 +++$+++ u4969 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ That's the point -- this could change things.
L176247 +++$+++ u4967 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ MARCIA +++$+++ Look, my life is not so great, that I want it shown on television. And neither is yours.
L176244 +++$+++ u4967 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ MARCIA +++$+++ Everyone has foibles. Then the whole country sees them on TV and mocks them. Then we have... mocked foibles.
L176243 +++$+++ u4969 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ We don't have foibles.
L176238 +++$+++ u4967 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ MARCIA +++$+++ What happened? You described this "crazy-kooky" family who'd be a million laughs on TV?
L176237 +++$+++ u4969 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Look, can we all just sign the releases so we can get on with this?
L176661 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ By the X. That's were two lines cross -- forming an X.
L176660 +++$+++ u4974 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude.
L176659 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ What would I actually have to do to get you to sign this?
L176658 +++$+++ u4974 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Some more make-up wouldn't do you any harm. On TV you look a little washed out.
L176657 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ By the X.
L176656 +++$+++ u4974 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ That Ray was a pig. Ed is doll. You latch on to him honey.
L176655 +++$+++ u4972 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SHARI +++$+++ Sign here, please.

L179743 +++$+++ u4984 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ MS. HOY +++$+++ Yo --
L179192 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ He ended up moving back to Milwaukee to live with his parents. I haven't heard from him in a long time. Poor guy. I warned him.
L179191 +++$+++ u4976 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Sherry   Sherry  Sheerrry. ...
L179179 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I'm not talking about ethics.  I'm talking about morals.
L179178 +++$+++ u4976 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ I don't need a lecture on ethics, Jim, okay?  I know what --
L179177 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ That was just talk!  Fantasy talk! What are you, nuts?  We talk about girls all the time, but it doesn't mean anything. I would never. . . I mean, I take very seriously our strict moral code.  The line you've crossed is... it's illegal and it's immoral.
L179176 +++$+++ u4976 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ You're not just jealous, are you?  I mean, we both used to talk about her
L179175 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Dave, I'm just saying this as your friend.  What you're doing is really, really wrong, and you've got to stop.
L179174 +++$+++ u4976 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ That's the whole point. It's all in my head; it's right here.  I just got to get it out there. Tracy wants me to write it so she can read it.  It's beautiful.
L179173 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ But you haven't written your novel.
L179172 +++$+++ u4976 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Yeah, it's serious.  I mean she inspires me in ways Sherry never has. She even wants to read my novel.
L179171 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ In love?
L179170 +++$+++ u4976 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Look, Jim...  Okay.  I know it all seems crazy, and maybe it did start out, you know, for the... for the sex and the danger.  But now it's different.  Jim, what I'm trying to tell you is that Tracy and I are totally, totally in love.
L179169 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You did it at your house?  Your own house?
L179147 +++$+++ u4976 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Foxy. . . Foxy. . . You know you're a cute little heartbreaker... Foxy... You know you're a sweet little love maker...
L179146 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You could tell Dave was one of those guys who taught because they never wanted to leave high school in the first place, and that could get a little irritating sometimes, but basically he was a real good guy.
L179144 +++$+++ u4976 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ She's incredible.  Everything just gets soaked.
L179143 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Don't tell me that.  I don't want to know that.
L179142 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ A few months before the election, she'd had an affair with my best friend Dave Novotny.
L179166 +++$+++ u4976 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Here, get down.
L179165 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me, the me that nobody else knows.
L179161 +++$+++ u4976 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ And I know sometimes people like you have to pay a price for their greatness, and that price is loneliness.
L179160 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Thank you.
L179159 +++$+++ u4976 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Tracy, I've been watching you for going on two years now, and I think you are one of the most talented, hard-working, sensitive, attractive, brilliant students -- no, human beings -- I have ever met.  I mean, you're the real thing.  Special.
L179158 +++$+++ u4976 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ What kind of person?
L179157 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ What do you mean? What kind of person am I?
L179156 +++$+++ u4976 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ I know.  I know its not by choice.  I just mean, well, being the kind of person you are, it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to.
L179155 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ No, I'm not. I'm just really busy.
L179154 +++$+++ u4976 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Well, I notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard. You seem to be kind of a loner.
L179153 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ what?
L179152 +++$+++ u4976 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ You know, Tracy... I don't know how to say this, but...
L179151 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ One night he took us editors out to celebrate after a deadline. Eventually Dave and I were left alone and we got to talking - not like teacher and student, but like two adults.
L179373 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Well, Sherry's great.  But she can be a little much sometimes.
L179372 +++$+++ u4977 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ What?
L179371 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Yeah. No. I mean, you know.
L179370 +++$+++ u4977 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ You guys have fun?
