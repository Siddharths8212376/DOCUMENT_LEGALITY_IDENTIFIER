L228977 +++$+++ u1036 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ A boy comes to the door.
L228976 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ You could order something in.
L228975 +++$+++ u1036 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ I still haven't got this bloody thing off.
L228974 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ Why didn't you stop at the market?
L228973 +++$+++ u1036 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Oh good, there's nothing to eat.
L228897 +++$+++ u1036 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Oh can't I? Watch me!
L228896 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ Alex you can't -just leave.
L228871 +++$+++ u1036 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Dear God.... How did I come to this?
L228870 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ Oh Alex, get away from that thing...
L228865 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ The guy is terminally selfish!
L228864 +++$+++ u1036 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ He's a miserable twit!
L229659 +++$+++ u1037 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ We'd better get everybody online.  And Kyle, Stop downloading porn.  Your frame rate is unacceptable.
L229658 +++$+++ u1043 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ KYLE +++$+++ I have sectors 1-28.  I think Hector has the upper levels.
L229657 +++$+++ u1037 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?
L229656 +++$+++ u1043 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ KYLE +++$+++ Oh.  Okay.
L229655 +++$+++ u1037 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.
L229654 +++$+++ u1043 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ KYLE +++$+++ Hi Brandon.
L229036 +++$+++ u1037 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ He probably... Has some very important business to attend to...
L229035 +++$+++ u1043 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ KYLE +++$+++ He dissed us AGAIN, Brandon!
L229765 +++$+++ u1037 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Yeah. What's wrong? JASON ~~othIno. I -ust oncuont ot wou~o oc oomooooateo onan onat.
L229764 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ That's It?
L229763 +++$+++ u1037 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Raise the glass and push the blue button.
L229762 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ I'm at the control oaneh. What do I do?
L229730 +++$+++ u1037 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Berithium lava coming through. Use the handholds above you.
L229729 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ What?  Up?
L229728 +++$+++ u1037 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Up.
L229727 +++$+++ u1037 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Go. They're off again.
L229725 +++$+++ u1037 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ GO Commander.
L229724 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Shit! Go!
L229723 +++$+++ u1037 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Lt. Madison, GO.
L229722 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ No, wait, are you-
L229721 +++$+++ u1037 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Wait two seconds then go.
L229720 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Okay, now. But-
L229719 +++$+++ u1037 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Commander, you and Lt. Madison will have to go through the crushers one at a time in three second intervals. Tell me when the first crusher hits the bottom...
L229707 +++$+++ u1037 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Yes Commander... All right, you're almost there. Just go through the chompers and over the pit.
L229706 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ BRANDON!	TIME TO GO!
L229700 +++$+++ u1037 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ My cousin's boyfriend's sister went out with the screenwriter. His favorite movie is the Omegaman.  He's seen it 13 times...
L229699 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ How did you come to that conclusion?
L229698 +++$+++ u1037 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ No,  I am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer, but a matter REARRANGER, converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past.
L229697 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ But you don't?
L229696 +++$+++ u1037 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ It's been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years. Many believe that is a matter collapser, a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds.
L229695 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ What do you mean?
L229694 +++$+++ u1037 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Well, that's the big question, isn't it?
L229693 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ What does the Omega 13 do?
L229692 +++$+++ u1037 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Yes Commander?
L229691 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Brandon.. Just in case I die, there's something I have to know...
L229670 +++$+++ u1037 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Okay, that's where you want to be.
L229669 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Yes...?
L229668 +++$+++ u1037 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Okay, so do you see a door marked "CORE UNIT?" Should be down at the far end to your left.
L229667 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ We'd never have the budget for this.
L229666 +++$+++ u1037 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Commander, do you have a camera?  I'd die to see this in person... All they showed on T,V was a machine here, and a wall here... I don't know why they didn't show the whole thing.
L229665 +++$+++ u1037 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Now make a right, you'll see a doorway that opens on the central manufacturing facility.  The bowels of the ship.
L229664 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Okay...  Okay, now what.
L229663 +++$+++ u1037 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Okay, now left at the next turn... Past the oxygen units.  Make a right there. Then go through the antimatter vent...
L229653 +++$+++ u1037 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Okay, you can go on in... I'm going to get Kyle. He knows the utility tunnel system better than anybody alive.
L229652 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Okay, we got it.
L229642 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Brandon.. . The crew and I are in trouble and we need your help.
L229641 +++$+++ u1037 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
L229640 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.
L229639 +++$+++ u1037 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ ... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a-
L229638 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ It's okay. Listen-
L229637 +++$+++ u1037 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Yes, I know, and I want you to know I thought about what you said... I know you meant it constructively but...
L229636 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Brandon, I remember you from the convention, right?... You had a lot of little technical observations about the ship, and I spoke sharply to you...
L229635 +++$+++ u1037 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Brandon.
L229634 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ What's  your name, son?
L229633 +++$+++ u1037 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Oh... Oh, I see. Oh.
L229632 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.
L229631 +++$+++ u1037 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ ... Yes?
L228970 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ There IS no quantum flux and there Is no auxiliary... There's no goddamn ship  Do you get it?
L228969 +++$+++ u1037 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Yes but, we were wondering-
L228968 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?
L228967 +++$+++ u1037 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Commander, as I was saying... In "The Quasar Dilemma", you used the auxiliary of deck b for Gamma override. But online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix, so we were wondering where the error lies?
L228949 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Excuse me guys.
L228948 +++$+++ u1037 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Commander, please settle a dispute that my crew and I are having. In "The Quasar Dilemma", the Sentient had taken control of the ship's guidance systems, however-

L229310 +++$+++ u1038 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ COMPUTER +++$+++ Negative. The Beryllium sphere will have to be replaced.

L229305 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ Computer, what about our engines? Why don't we have power?
L229265 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ The enemy is matching velocity.

L229256 +++$+++ u1038 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ COMPUTER +++$+++ The ship is sustaining structural damage.
L229142 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ I never get tired of that joke.
L229141 +++$+++ u1038 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ COMPUTER +++$+++ There is no weather in space.
L229140 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ What's the weather like outside?
L229139 +++$+++ u1038 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ COMPUTER +++$+++ Yes?
L229138 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ I just can't believe it. Any of it!  Look at this room!.. They designed it based on the Tuaran Pleasure ship from "historical document" thirty seven.  Oh and wait, wait, listen to this!  Computer?
L228849 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ We're getting major structural damage.
L228848 +++$+++ u1038 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ COMPUTER +++$+++ Structural damage at 68 percent.
L229115 +++$+++ u1039 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ OK!
L229114 +++$+++ u1046 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ NERVOUS TECH +++$+++ So our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate! - A two molecule compound sharing a free electron - and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes!
L229113 +++$+++ u1039 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ Covalent... Right. So...
L229112 +++$+++ u1046 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ NERVOUS TECH +++$+++ What does that mean?!!!  Yes, I see! Yes... It means that perhaps... the... bonding molecules have become covalent?!...
L229111 +++$+++ u1039 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ ... What does that mean?
L229110 +++$+++ u1046 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ NERVOUS TECH +++$+++ That possibly... The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?
L229109 +++$+++ u1039 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ U.... What do you think?
L229554 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Hopkins can't drink your bathwater Fred.
L229553 +++$+++ u1039 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ As good as Hopkins?
L229549 +++$+++ u1039 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ You worked with Hopkins? I worship Hopkins.
L229548 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Fred, I worked summer stock with Hopkins. Regional theater with Hoffman. But I swear to God I have never met an actor who could hit his mark, or nail his lines with the professional consistency of a Freddy Kwan. You're Mr. Dependable... You can do this.
L229546 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Listen Fred. You did this for four years on the show. You can do it now... Put your hands on the controls..
L229545 +++$+++ u1039 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ No, I'll kill you. .
L229498 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ I'll take my chances with Gorignak.
L229497 +++$+++ u1039 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ Right.
L229496 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ The digital conveyer?  You mean I'm going to get diced into cubes and sorted up there in a thousand pieces?
L229427 +++$+++ u1039 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ No, no... I'll think on it...
L229426 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Never mind, Fred....
L229425 +++$+++ u1039 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ A hologram...
L229339 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ I...Well, uh... Yes, absolutely.
L229338 +++$+++ u1039 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ Hey Commander. Listen, we found some Beryllium on a nearby planet. We might be able to get there if we re-configure the solar matrix in parallel for endothermic propulsion. What do you think?
L229678 +++$+++ u1039 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ Maybe you're the plucky comic relief, you ever think of that?
L229677 +++$+++ u1040 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.  I'm a dead man anyway. If I'm going to die, I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.
L229676 +++$+++ u1039 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ It's suicide.
L229675 +++$+++ u1040 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ Listen, I'll go in, create a distraction. have this...  may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape.
L229674 +++$+++ u1039 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ We've got to get that valve turned off. Their oxygen Is almost gone...
L229481 +++$+++ u1040 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ Of course... We'll just zap him up with the digital conveyor!
L229480 +++$+++ u1039 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ ...The digital conveyor.
L229399 +++$+++ u1040 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ I don't like this... I don't like this at all...
L229398 +++$+++ u1039 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ You Okay, Alex?
L228930 +++$+++ u1039 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ Oh I make it up. Use lots of "k"s and "v"s.
L228929 +++$+++ u1040 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ How do you remember this stuff?
L229416 +++$+++ u1040 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ We're doing episode 31, Jason?
L229415 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?
L229408 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ Let's get out of here before one of those things kills guy.
L229407 +++$+++ u1040 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ I am SO SICK of being right.
L229401 +++$+++ u1040 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ Of course they're cute NOW. But in a second they're going to turn MEAN and UGLY somehow and then there are going to be a million MORE of them!...
L229400 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ Oh, they're so cute.
L229392 +++$+++ u1040 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ Something BAD happened here.
L229391 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ Where are the miners?
L229356 +++$+++ u1040 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ Do I? DO I?  For all you know I'm just "CREWMAN #6"!  Okay, it's FLEEGMAN! Guy FLEEGMAN! There! Now I'm a whole person! I can't die! FLEEGMAN! THEY CAN'T KILL ME NOW, CAN THEY? CAN THEY?
L229355 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ Guy, you HAVE a last name. We just don't KNOW it.
L229191 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ The lost footage. At the convention. The mysterious device in our last episo--historical document.
L229190 +++$+++ u1040 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ The Omega 13... Why does that sound so familiar?...
L229082 +++$+++ u1040 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ It's ... incredible.
L229081 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ THAT'S why you built this ship?
L229075 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ You... know us?
L229074 +++$+++ u1040 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ "Crewman #6"... Call me Guy.
L228923 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ Sure, Guy, If you can stand the excitement.
L228922 +++$+++ u1040 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ Listen, I was wondering, would you guys mind if I sit in today? See if anybody's interested in an autograph? Never know.
L229808 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ No. Keep all energy to the armor.
L229807 +++$+++ u1040 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ We~re oetting hammered, Jason.  Return fIre?

L229420 +++$+++ u1040 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ BECAUSE I DIED IN EPISODE 31!
L229419 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ It's a rough plan, Guy! What does it matter if we're doing episode 31 or not?!
L229418 +++$+++ u1040 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not?
L229417 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ It doesn't have to be a hologram... Just a diversion.
L229388 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we?
L229387 +++$+++ u1040 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ That's it, that's what's going to kill me.
L229370 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ All right, let's all settle down.  If we're going to get through this we're going to have to exercise self control.
L229369 +++$+++ u1040 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ We're screwed... We're so screwed...
L229354 +++$+++ u1040 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ No. Nobody does. Do you know WHY? Because my character Isn't IMPORTANT enough for a last name. Because I'm going to DIE five minutes in, why bother to come up with a last name for me?
L229353 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ It's... I don't know.
L229352 +++$+++ u1040 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ Yeah, what is it?
L229351 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Your last name.

L229349 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Guy, you're not going to get killed on the planet, okay?
L229261 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ We should have a turbo. I'm always saying "activate turbo boosters", right?...
L229260 +++$+++ u1040 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GUY +++$+++ They're still behind us...
L229240 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ All right. Put me back on with him.
