L172277 +++$+++ u818 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ CHICO +++$+++ Sure, we gotta have a spy.  If we no got a spy who's gonna tell the other side what we're doing?
L172276 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ By the way, are you sure we need a spy?
L172275 +++$+++ u818 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ CHICO +++$+++ Send in the next girl.

L172209 +++$+++ u818 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ CHICO +++$+++ He's-a very easy to insult --  I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.
L172208 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ You've got a brain after all - and how you get along without it is amazing to me -- Now, who can I insult?...  Who do we owe money to?...  AMBASSADOR TRENTINO!  How about him?
L172207 +++$+++ u818 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ CHICO +++$+++ That's a-no good.  If I apologize we no got a war.  Look -- I send you a scrap of paper.  You send me a scrap of paper -- and we have a scrap.
L172206 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ Then I demand an apology!

L172187 +++$+++ u818 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ CHICO +++$+++ That's no good.  I like to work on the outside.  I must have something easy.
L172186 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ Let's see -- What've I got in my cabinet besides mice --  I've got it -- how would you like to be Secretary of the Interior?
L172185 +++$+++ u818 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ CHICO +++$+++ What other job you got?
L172184 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ I don't know what's keeping me.  I should've been here a long time ago. Now how about my proposition?

L172182 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ Well, maybe he's still the vice- president.  Now if I were to offer you --
L172181 +++$+++ u818 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ CHICO +++$+++ Oh, no -- nothing doing.  I had a brother who was a vice-president once and that's the last we ever heard of him.
L172180 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ If there was an open season for fellows like you, I'd get myself a hunting license.   Anyway, I'm going to make you a sporting proposition. You give up the peanut stand and I'll make you vice-president of the country.
L172179 +++$+++ u818 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ CHICO +++$+++ No, but I shot some ducks.

L172175 +++$+++ u818 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ CHICO +++$+++ Sure.  How much does the job pay?  Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.
L172174 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ You don't want to be a public nuisance, do you?
L172173 +++$+++ u818 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ CHICO +++$+++ Oh no, I can't do it.
L172172 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ I'm sorry I'm not in.  I wanted to have a long talk with you...  Now look here, my good man, you've got to stop yelling "peanuts" in front of the House of Representatives.
L172171 +++$+++ u818 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ CHICO +++$+++ That was for you.
L172166 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ I can use you in the House of Representatives.  We need a man who understands dogs -- and that's where this country is going to.  Step inside.
