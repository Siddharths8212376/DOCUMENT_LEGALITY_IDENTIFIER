L614861 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Should I be expecting him anytime soon?
L614860 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere.
L614858 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Zat is true, I am not used to working in such 'orreeble conditions.  Hey... Monet!
L614857 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Will this light do? Don't artists need good light?
L614847 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Sssshh. Come here.
L614846 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Fabrizio said you might be up --
L614841 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I have to get back, they'll miss me. Please, Jack, for both our sakes, leave me alone.
L614840 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You're right. Only you can do that.
L614839 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ It's not up to you to save me, Jack.
L614838 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.
L614837 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really.
L614836 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No wait. Let me try to get this out. You're amazing... and I know I have nothing to offer you, Rose. I know that. But I'm involved now. You jump, I jump, remember? I can't turn away without knowin' that you're goin' to be alright.
L614835 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Jack, I --
L614834 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Rose, you're no picnic... you're a spoiled little brat even, but under that you're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girl I've ever known and --
L614785 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I like that. Aren't we supposed to wish on it?
L614784 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven.
L614783 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I did, didn't I?  Look! A shooting star.
L614782 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.
L614781 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ A mistake?
L614780 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You're not one of them. There's been a mistake.
L614768 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Just move with me. Don't think.
L614767 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I don't know the steps.
L614766 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You're still my best girl, Cora.
L614765 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ May I cut in, miss?
L614763 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin.
L614762 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Jack, must you go?
L614716 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Cal, surely you remember Mr. Dawson.
L614715 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I saw that in a nickelodeon once, and I always wanted to do it.
L614696 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ They didn't teach you that in finishing school? Here, it's easy. Watch closely.
L614695 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I think I would.  And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair.
L614694 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Sure. If you like.
L614693 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?
L614692 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
L614691 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.  Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
L614690 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.
L614689 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ A whole ten cents?!
L614688 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angeles to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.
L614687 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?
L614684 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Well, alright. There's something in me, Jack. I feel it. I don't know what it is, whether I should be an artist, or, I don't know... a dancer. Like Isadora Duncan.... a wild pagan spirit...
L614683 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'm sorry. Really... I am.
L614682 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head.
L614681 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You wouldn't last two days. There's no hot water, and hardly ever any caviar.
L614680 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You know, my dream has always been to just chuck it all and become an artist... living in a garret, poor but free!
L614670 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You wouldn'ta jumped.
L614669 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ And...?
L614668 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I see you.
L614667 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.
L614666 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No, no! Just with her hands.
L614665 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I think you must have had a love affair with her...
L614664 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ She had beautiful hands.
L614663 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You liked this woman. You used her several times.
L614662 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yup. That's one of the great things about Paris. Lots of girls willing take their clothes off.
L614661 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ And these were drawn from life?
L614657 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
L614656 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly!
L614655 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
L614654 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are.
L614653 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ May I?
L614652 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Just some sketches.
L614651 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ What's this?
L614650 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Well, I guess I will tonight.
L614649 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.
L614648 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ It is that simple.
L614647 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ If only it were that simple.
L614646 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ So don't marry him.
L614645 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yes, exactly!
L614644 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ So you feel like you're stuck on a train you can't get off 'cause you're marryin' this fella.
L614642 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Worse I'm afraid.
L614641 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Is he your boyfriend?
L614640 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.
L614639 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ That penguin last night, is he one of them?
L614638 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
L614637 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead.
L614636 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it was their whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber.  I just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then I was at the back rail and there was no more ship... even the Titanic wasn't big enough. Not enough to get away from them. And before I'd really though about it, I was over the rail. I was so furious. I'll show them. They'll be sorry!
L614635 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.
L614634 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?
L614633 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You're welcome. Rose.
L614632 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion.
L614631 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Well, here you are.
L614630 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.
L614629 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Jack.
L614628 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Mr. Dawson, I --
L614627 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ That's quite a moniker. I may hafta get you to write that down.
L614626 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.
L614625 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ So, you got a name by the way?
L614624 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Uh, yes. Of course. After you.
L614623 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Could I speak to you in private?
L614622 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Hello again.
L614557 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I've got you. I won't let go.
L614556 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ HELP! HELP!!
L614555 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson.
L614554 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'm Jack Dawson.
L614551 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ That's what everybody says. But with all due respect, I'm not the one hanging off the back of a ship.
L614550 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You're crazy.
L614549 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain.  Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here.
L614548 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I know what ice fishing is!
L614547 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father were ice- fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice- fishing's where you chop a hole in the --
L614546 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ No.
L614545 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Ever been to Wisconsin?
L614544 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.
L614543 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ How cold?
L614542 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold.
L614541 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ The fall alone would kill you.
L614539 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Don't be absurd. You'll be killed.
L614538 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you.
L614537 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You're distracting me. Go away.
L614536 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You would have done it already. Now come on, take my hand.
L614535 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ What do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do. You don't know me.
L614534 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No you won't.
L614533 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
L614532 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Take my hand. I'll pull you back in.
L614883 +++$+++ u8464 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ SMITH +++$+++ And wake me, of course, if anything becomes in the slightest degree doubtful.
L614882 +++$+++ u8457 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LIGHTOLLER +++$+++ Yes sir.
L614881 +++$+++ u8464 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ SMITH +++$+++ Mmmmm. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller.
L614880 +++$+++ u8457 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LIGHTOLLER +++$+++ It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.
L614879 +++$+++ u8464 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ SMITH +++$+++ Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.
L614878 +++$+++ u8457 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LIGHTOLLER +++$+++ I don't think I've ever seen such a flat calm, in 24 years at sea.
L615312 +++$+++ u8460 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ We were pissin' in the wind the whole time.
L615311 +++$+++ u8458 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LIZZY +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L614616 +++$+++ u8460 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm a believer. She was there.
L614615 +++$+++ u8458 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LIZZY +++$+++ You think she was really there?
L614614 +++$+++ u8460 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.
L614613 +++$+++ u8458 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LIZZY +++$+++ What past? She has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on the Titanic until two days ago.
L614612 +++$+++ u8460 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Maybe she wants to make peace with the past.
L614599 +++$+++ u8458 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LIZZY +++$+++ That's enough.
L614598 +++$+++ u8460 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Wait! Can you give us something go on, here. Like who had access to the safe. What about this Lovejoy guy? The valet. Did he have the combination?
L614418 +++$+++ u8460 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ If your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day Titanic sank.  And that makes you my new best friend. I will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery.
L614417 +++$+++ u8458 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LIZZY +++$+++ April 14, 1912.
L615316 +++$+++ u8460 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ You had it the entire time?!
L615315 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Don't come any closer.
L614597 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I'm afraid I'm feeling a little tired, Mr. Lovett.
L614596 +++$+++ u8460 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Rose, tell us more about the diamond. What did Hockley do with it after that?
L614592 +++$+++ u8460 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Well, that's the general idea, my dear.
L614591 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I can still feel its weight. If you could have felt it, not just seen it...
L614443 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ It's been 84 years... and I can still smell the fresh paint. The china had never been used. The sheets had never been slept in.
L614442 +++$+++ u8460 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Just tell us what you can --
L614441 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ It's been 84 years...
L614416 +++$+++ u8460 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Nathan Hockley, right. Pittsburgh steel tycoon. For a diamond necklace his son Caledon Hockley bought in France for his fiancee... you... a week before he sailed on Titanic. And the claim was filed right after the sinking. So the diamond had to've gone down with the ship.  See the date?
L614415 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Someone named Hockley, I should imagine.
L614414 +++$+++ u8460 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ I tracked it down through insurance records... and old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy. Do you know who the claiment was, Rose?
L614411 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ It was a dreadful, heavy thing.  I only wore it this once.
L614410 +++$+++ u8460 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Louis the Sixteenth wore a fabulous stone, called the Blue Diamond of the Crown, which disappeared in 1792, about the time Louis lost everything from the neck up. The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too... recut into a heart-like shape... and it became Le Coeur de la Mer. The Heart of the Ocean. Today it would be worth more than the Hope Diamond.
L614409 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I should like to see my drawing.
L614408 +++$+++ u8460 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Would you like anything?
L614407 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ There, that's nice. I have to have my pictures when I travel. And Freddy of course.  Isn't that right, sweetie.
L614404 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yes. Very nice. Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me.
L614403 +++$+++ u8460 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Is your stateroom alright?
L615064 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Goodbye, mother.
L615063 +++$+++ u8463 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ Rose, get in the boat!
L614806 +++$+++ u8463 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ Of course it's unfair! We're women. Our choices are never easy.
L614805 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ It's so unfair.
L614804 +++$+++ u8463 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ Do you want to se me working as a seamstress? Is that what you want? Do you want to see our fine things sold at an auction, our memories scattered to the winds? My God, Rose, how can you be so selfish?
L614803 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ How can you put this on my shoulders?
L614802 +++$+++ u8463 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ I don't understand you. It is a fine match with Hockley, and it will insure our survival.
L614801 +++$+++ u8463 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ Your father left us nothing but a legacy of bad debts hidden by a good name. And that name is the only card we have to play.
L614800 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!
L614799 +++$+++ u8463 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ Rose, this is not a game! Our situation is precarious. You know the money's gone!
L614701 +++$+++ u8463 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ Charmed, I'm sure.
L614700 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson.
L614521 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Excuse me.
L614520 +++$+++ u8463 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ My God, Rose, what's gotten into --
L616033 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ No, darling, lip rouge--all over your mouth.
L616032 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ Baloney!
L616031 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ I like touching you--poison ivy.  You'd just been kissing that girl when I came in, hadn't you?
L616030 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ Will you leave me alone?
L616029 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert.  Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you.  You're such a swine!
L616028 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ --and I can tell you where to get off.
L616027 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Oh--a hundred times--
L616026 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ I didn't ask you to come away with me--
L616025 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her.
L616024 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ You mind your own business! She's an old friend of mine and I like her--what're you going to do about it?
L616023 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?
L616022 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ Don't talk such bunk! She's one of the acts on the ship. I just ran into her by accident.
L616021 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Don't look so uncomfortable, Lee--it interferes with your good looks. Give me a cigarette.  What did you do--persuade her to come on this voyage with you?
L616017 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Sure! You're never at a loss for words.
L616016 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ I can explain--
L616015 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ So that's your little dancer that you were playing around with in New York.  Oh--there's no accounting for tastes--  Mine, too, seem to be in the gutter.
L616008 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ And <U>do</U> bring Miss Marsh--  --when she's had time to tidy up a bit.
L616007 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ I'll join you later.
L616006 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Well--shall we go into dinner?
L616005 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Yes--I met Miss Marsh. In fact, she always seems to be turning up in the most unusual circumstances.  What's the matter, Miss Marsh--aren't you feeling well?
L616004 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ This is Miss Marsh.
L616003 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Hope we're not intruding.
L615889 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ I'm sorry, but you three men can play poker or something.  Shall I see you tomorrow?
L615888 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ But, Anya, dear! Unless you play we won't have a fourth.
L615661 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ That's fine--because you're going to see a lot of me ... for the rest of your life.
L615660 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.
L615659 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Here's to Europe!  Couldn't try to look a little less glum, could you?
L615658 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ I never want to go back....
L615657 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ Sure!
L615656 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
L615655 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ How'd you ever get away with it?
L615654 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ You're a charming liar. You <U>know</U>, Herbert's too dull to be suspicious about anything--even when I suddenly decided to come to Europe at a few hours' notice--
L615653 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.
L615652 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ It would be a nice change from you.
L615651 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ Do you want the truth, Anya?
L615650 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Then why the sudden exit without even telling me?
L615649 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ I wasn't running out on you. When I got over there-- made my plans--I'd have sent for you.
L615648 +++$+++ u8465 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ ANYA +++$+++ Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.
L615647 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ Anya, I think you're crazy.
