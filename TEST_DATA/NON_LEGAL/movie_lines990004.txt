L279013 +++$+++ u5848 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ Well, these are good signs -- she's broken up with him and the two of you seem to be developing quite a rapport.
L278918 +++$+++ u5848 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ Because life isn't about playing it safe.  Life is about taking risks.
L278917 +++$+++ u5838 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HIDER +++$+++ Right.
L278916 +++$+++ u5848 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ You have to put yourself out there a bit more.
L278915 +++$+++ u5838 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HIDER +++$+++ I should.
L278914 +++$+++ u5848 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ <u>Ask</u> her how she feels.
L278913 +++$+++ u5838 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HIDER +++$+++ Yeah, maybe you're right. Everything else is just an excuse. I'm treating the situation with kid gloves because I'm afraid of losing her.
L278912 +++$+++ u5848 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ It's not going to happen unless you make it happen, my friend. You're going to have to assert yourself a little bit more.  <u>Show</u> your affection.
L278911 +++$+++ u5838 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HIDER +++$+++ Oh no -- I mean, she's genuinely made me more fulfilled in many ways -- and I hope eventually to be able to teach her a few things, too.  What I mean is, I guess I'm still waiting for just that right -- synthesis between us -- where everything will be understood between us without even the need for words.
L278910 +++$+++ u5848 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ Well, now, don't go creating some artificial environment for yourself.
L278909 +++$+++ u5838 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HIDER +++$+++ I've cultivated her interests so that now we have even more in common than ever.
L278908 +++$+++ u5848 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ Who doesn't?
L278907 +++$+++ u5838 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HIDER +++$+++ Things are beginning to come to a head.  I can feel it.  And I want everything to be perfect.
L278833 +++$+++ u5848 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ A sense of proportion.
L278832 +++$+++ u5838 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HIDER +++$+++ -- a sense of proportion.
L278831 +++$+++ u5848 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ That would be monumentally stupid. All I'm saying is --
L278830 +++$+++ u5838 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HIDER +++$+++ That would be stupid.
L278829 +++$+++ u5848 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ On the contrary -- this is tremendous.  I mean, we're all frightened to death of disapproval and we're constantly hiding behind these layers we manufacture for ourselves -- and I'm not saying we should, you know, <u>declare</u> ourselves unhesitatingly to our fellow human beings in the interests of total openness and honesty --
L278828 +++$+++ u5838 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HIDER +++$+++ No, no, no, no.
L278827 +++$+++ u5848 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ And please, don't for God's sake misinterpret that as being the voice of discouragement in any way --
L278826 +++$+++ u5838 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HIDER +++$+++ I understand that.
L278825 +++$+++ u5848 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ The whole disapproval thing.  If you allow yourself to get into a situation where someone else's potential disapproval becomes the focal point of your life -- then you're back to a life of fear, aren't you?  -- You're a prisoner to that again, and that isn't much of a life.
L278824 +++$+++ u5838 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HIDER +++$+++ Well, we talked about the whole disapproval thing.
L278823 +++$+++ u5848 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ As long as you keep remembering why.
L278822 +++$+++ u5838 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HIDER +++$+++ I am.  I'm really feeling pretty good.  I have a much stronger sense of how far I've come.
L278821 +++$+++ u5848 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ That's terrific.  Don't be afraid to be demonstrative.  You're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.
L278820 +++$+++ u5838 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HIDER +++$+++ Oh, fine.  She's gone away for a little while and when she comes back I've sort of resolved to really tell her how much I care for her.
L278819 +++$+++ u5848 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ And how are things with your lady friend, if I may call her that?
L278670 +++$+++ u5848 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ You're responsible for your own actions and you don't mean to hurt anyone.  In other words, you've done <u>your</u> best.  I'm saying don't carry the burden of <u>other</u> people's actions on your shoulders, because they're beyond your control.
L278669 +++$+++ u5838 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HIDER +++$+++ I guess so.  I mean, I know I'm responsible for my own actions. It was never because I was angry with anyone.  I didn't mean to hurt anyone ever.
L278667 +++$+++ u5838 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HIDER +++$+++ When I was a child... I got used to the closets.  The boxes.  The cabinet under the kitchen sink... with that persistent drip.  I used to the smell of the boxes. Wood.  Cardboard.  I got so I was comfortable there in the dark. Even... even that old refrigerator in the yard.  That smelled like rust and decay.  It was safe in the boxes.  It was when they took me out --
L278666 +++$+++ u5848 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ Listen, no one ever said expressing yourself to the opposite sex is easy, but when the time comes, you have to do it and you <u>hope</u> the outcome will be good for both of you. You come out of solitary and you rejoin the human race, as difficult as that sometimes can be.
L278665 +++$+++ u5838 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HIDER +++$+++ Yeah, things are moving along, but she's still involved with this other guy and it's a little tricky.
L278545 +++$+++ u5848 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ Oh, good -- well, I hope you'll have more to tell me next time.
L278544 +++$+++ u5838 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HIDER +++$+++ Actually, I have met someone. There's a woman I think I like.
L278543 +++$+++ u5848 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ Right.  So, you have a new place, you've started working a bit -- I'm sure you'll be meeting some new people.
L278542 +++$+++ u5838 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HIDER +++$+++ -- institution.
L278541 +++$+++ u5848 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ -- hospital.
L278540 +++$+++ u5838 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HIDER +++$+++ Yeah, since I was a kid.  I had a woodwork class once when I was... in school that time.  Then I learned a lot more when I was in the --
L278539 +++$+++ u5848 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ I'm happy that you're working again.  As long as it comes naturally, that's terrific. You've always liked working with your hands, haven't you?
L278538 +++$+++ u5838 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HIDER +++$+++ Well, I've been doing a little independent contracting, some carpentry here and there, y'know, do-it-yourself-type stuff.  I still find it very soothing.
L278537 +++$+++ u5848 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ And what about work?  Have you had any more thoughts about what you'd like to be doing now?
L278536 +++$+++ u5838 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HIDER +++$+++ Right.
L278535 +++$+++ u5848 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ All right then.  That's important, isn't it?  -- For you to be in an "up" environment.  I'm saying you should literally take that as your <u>base</u>, do you know what I mean? It's something positive that you've accomplished -- even if you were forced by circumstance -- something for you to build upon.
L278534 +++$+++ u5838 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HIDER +++$+++ Oh, it's nothing.  No problem. I was really lucky to find this place.
L278533 +++$+++ u5848 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ And the rent is okay?
L278532 +++$+++ u5838 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HIDER +++$+++ It's great.  It's clean and airy and quiet -- there are trees and flowers.  There's still some fixing up I have to do, but it's coming along.
L278531 +++$+++ u5848 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ How's the new place?
L279076 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Mr. Sykes, I think you should go home.
L279075 +++$+++ u5838 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HIDER +++$+++ About us.
L279074 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ About what?
L279073 +++$+++ u5838 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HIDER +++$+++ I think we should talk first.
L279072 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Yeah, right -- I really have to go to bed.
L279071 +++$+++ u5838 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HIDER +++$+++ It is tomorrow.
L279070 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Listen, I'm sorry, but it's really late -- you don't have to come tomorrow to work on the floor.
L279069 +++$+++ u5838 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HIDER +++$+++ Yeah, you know, that in life you really have to choose what you want to do.
L279068 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Uh huh.
L279067 +++$+++ u5838 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HIDER +++$+++ I was thinking about our conversation the other day -- what you said about choices.
L279052 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Can I tell you tomorrow?  I think I...
L279051 +++$+++ u5838 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HIDER +++$+++ What happened?
L279050 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Yeah, I'm okay -- it's been a long night.
L279049 +++$+++ u5838 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HIDER +++$+++ I was driving by -- I saw all the cars.  Are you all right?
L279012 +++$+++ u5838 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HIDER +++$+++ Because you <u>were</u> pretty?
L279011 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Not me, I fell for it right down the line.  Be a good girl and believe all the fairy tales.  He married me because I was pretty.
L279010 +++$+++ u5838 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HIDER +++$+++ I was alone a lot as a child.  No one to compete with.  My parents ensured that I found happiness in the smallest things.  When you're all alone it's your own world, you don't have to take orders from anybody.  You don't necessarily believe the stories people tell you.
L279009 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ It's nice that you can make that choice.
L279008 +++$+++ u5838 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HIDER +++$+++ Yeah, I've always been able to make my way in the world.  I don't like having to rely on other people.
L279007 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ You must value your independence.
L279006 +++$+++ u5838 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HIDER +++$+++ Uh, no -- I've never really found the time to settle down.
L279005 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Do you have a family?
L279004 +++$+++ u5838 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HIDER +++$+++ It's a living.
L279003 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I bet.  Going into people's homes.
L279002 +++$+++ u5838 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HIDER +++$+++ An occupational hazard, I'm afraid.
L279001 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I apologize for that scene with my husband.  You must have overheard.
L278954 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Oh, that's fine.
L278953 +++$+++ u5838 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HIDER +++$+++ -- General handyman, yeah.  I do carpentry, too, painting, almost any odd job around the house.  I do housesitting while the owners are away.  In fact, that's why I've been in the area.  I've been living very close by.  Here's the part that's giving you trouble, but I won't be able to get a replacement till the stores open tomorrow morning.
L278952 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ So, you're just kind of a roving --
L278951 +++$+++ u5838 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HIDER +++$+++ Isn't that always the way?
L278950 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Everything breaks at once.
L278949 +++$+++ u5838 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HIDER +++$+++ Just show me the way.
L278948 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Do you do washing machines, too?
L278947 +++$+++ u5838 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HIDER +++$+++ Yeah, that was easy.
L278946 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Oh, great.
L278945 +++$+++ u5838 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HIDER +++$+++ Maybe I could take a look at it now.
L278944 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Well, can I make an appointment?
L278943 +++$+++ u5838 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HIDER +++$+++ Sure.
L278942 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Oh, well, do you fix refrigerators?
L279031 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ It's okay, baby, the police are coming.
L279030 +++$+++ u5839 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Mommy!
L278959 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Well, what do you want me to do, Rita -- I can't just forget fifteen years of marriage.  Well, of course I know <u>you</u> can.  No, Rita, I -- what was that?  -- oh, I thought I heard something on the line.
L278958 +++$+++ u5839 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ "Hi. I'm Mr. Edgar!"  Look, Mommy, it doesn't even hurt him.
L278935 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Holly -- that's not so.
L278934 +++$+++ u5839 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Daddy's gone where Rudolf went and isn't coming back!
L278931 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Yes, he did, and I don't like it any more than you do.
L278930 +++$+++ u5839 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Did Daddy tease you?
L278929 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Well, that's what happens with grownups, too.
L278928 +++$+++ u5839 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Uh huh.
L278927 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ You know how sometimes Neil bugs you and you just get up and walk away from him?
L278926 +++$+++ u5839 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Why are you mad at each other?
L278925 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Your daddy and I are kind of mad at each other right now, so we have to spend some time apart.
L278741 +++$+++ u5839 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Uh huh.
L278740 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ A man?  Was it a dream?
L278739 +++$+++ u5839 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ A man scared me.
L278738 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ It's the middle of the night, sweetie.
L278737 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Aw, okay.
L278736 +++$+++ u5839 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ I'm thirsty.
L278735 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Baby, what is it?
L278655 +++$+++ u5839 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Bye, Neil!
L278654 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Hey.  Have a nice time -- it's a good school.
L278622 +++$+++ u5839 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ 'Who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf, the Big Bad Wolf...'
L278621 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ '"... or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down!" And inside their new house, the three little pigs just laughed -- '
L278584 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ "Find a penny, pick it up, all day long you'll have good luck!"
L278583 +++$+++ u5839 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ I found a cent!
L278718 +++$+++ u5845 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ He'll never appreciate it more.
L278717 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Rita, he's only twelve years old,
L278714 +++$+++ u5845 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ Don't drive yourself crazy.  It's probably nothing.
L278713 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I've tried to get him to agree to one.  I just -- I don't know... I'm getting such weird vibes lately.
L278712 +++$+++ u5845 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ I'm sure that's all it is, honey. Maybe you both just need a vacation.
L278711 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ The same thing -- his business pressures, the whole move and everything.  He's frantic about nailing this new job, worried about screwing over his present boss.
L278710 +++$+++ u5845 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ And?
L278709 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I've asked him what's wrong.
L278708 +++$+++ u5845 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ Have you just plain asked him?
L278707 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ No, I told you.  A whiff of perfume on his shirt.
L278706 +++$+++ u5845 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ So you don't have anything concrete?
L278705 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Yeah.  There's still a lot I want to do.  It's not quite... the kids aren't really settled in yet. Even the dog has been terribly high-strung and whines a lot since we've been here.  Look, he hasn't even come in for his food today.
L278704 +++$+++ u5845 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ You've done a really great job with the house.  It's great!
L279062 +++$+++ u5841 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ That's okay, Mom.
L279061 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Do you want me to come up and tuck you in?
L279060 +++$+++ u5841 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ No, thanks, Mom -- I'll go up to bed now.
L279059 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Honey, do you want some hot chocolate?
L279025 +++$+++ u5841 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Mom, I heard someone downstairs!
L279024 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Honey --
L279023 +++$+++ u5841 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Mom, <u>there's somebody in the</u> <u>house</u>!
L279022 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Neil -- what --
L278933 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ He's staying with a friend.  Hurry up now, you'll be late for school.
L278932 +++$+++ u5841 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Where'd he go?
L278890 +++$+++ u5841 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ I don't <u>know</u> how it started!
L278889 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Neil, you could have burned the house down!
L278783 +++$+++ u5841 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Thanks, Mom.
L278782 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ The pocket's a cinch -- I'll sew it up for you after dinner, okay?
L278781 +++$+++ u5841 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Whew.
L278780 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I think we got it just in time before the ink dried.
L278779 +++$+++ u5841 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Thank God.
L278766 +++$+++ u5841 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ I can't help it if my homework is torn to shreds three times a week by someone <u>much</u> bigger than me</u>.
L278765 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ He doesn't have a temperature.
L278744 +++$+++ u5841 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ RUDOLF!
L278743 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ No, honey, I haven't seen him. Didn't you feed him this morning?
L278742 +++$+++ u5841 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Has anyone seen Rudolf?  I don't think he came in last night.
L278678 +++$+++ u5841 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ But there's this <u>psycho</u>.  Really. Mom, there's a psycho I have to deal with <u>every day</u>.  I don't know why they let a psycho even go to school!
L278677 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Here, take this out to the table.
L278676 +++$+++ u5841 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ I could take a cab on the way home.
L278675 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Because you'd have to get up at five a.m., would you like that?
L278674 +++$+++ u5841 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Why can't you just drive me to my old school every morning?
L278630 +++$+++ u5841 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ "We don't want to be late for our first day of school."
L278629 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ C'mon, kids, let's go.
L279047 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ We'll talk in the morning.
L279046 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Should I come home when I'm finished there?
L279042 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Yeah -- we know him.  He's been hanging around the house.
L279041 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Oh God.
L279000 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ This is my house.
L278999 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ No, Philip, I don't want you coming back here.  And if you want to talk to me -- <u>call</u>.
L278998 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ What?
L278997 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ That's not a decision for you to make on your own.
L278996 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ I think it's time I came home now.
L278995 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ There's always an excuse, isn't there?
L278994 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ I was having a bad day -- I lost that job, I was dependent on other people, I was let down --
L278993 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Look, I think we should work things out.
L278992 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Philip, what are <u>you</u> doing here?
L278991 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ And what was that neighbor guy doing here?
L278990 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I'm having the floor fixed,
L278989 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Who was that?
L278923 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ I am so sick to death of hearing <u>your</u> opinion of my state of mind, what <u>you</u> think is for my own good. Without me you'd still be twirling a baton at U.C. Santa Barbara. <u>You're</u> the final straw on this back, baby!
L278922 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ You're even sadder and more burnt- out than I thought.
L278921 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ "Honey, I'm a zombie, I don't know whether I'm coming or going."
L278920 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ This is for the best, you know it is.  Why do my socks keep disappearing!
L278919 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Boy, you really buckle under a little pressure, don't you?
L278906 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Someone blew the whistle.  Someone hates me.
L278905 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ That's not the case.
L278904 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ I'm <u>fired</u>.  I'm unemployed.  Is that your idea of negotiating from a position of strength?  Clearly any potential employers have been warned to back off!
L278903 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Honey, it's not the end of the world.  You'll call Lowenthal tomorrow and find out it was just a mix-up.  And if he's not interested anymore, then you'll find another company to go to maybe even your own.  You are free now, you are independent.
L278899 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ There might be some extras in the garage.
L278898 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Honey -- I can't find those large- size Hefty trash bags!
L278882 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ <u>Everything</u> -- that I've been talking to other people behind his back -- that's what he called me -- a back-stabber and a deceiver. To him and to the company. He called me a traitor in front of everybody and told me if I wanted to be a VP over at Lowenthal I might as well pack up and go -- only <u>Lowenthal never</u> <u>showed up for our lunch</u>!  It's like everybody got an anonymous poison-pen letter or some --  Do you smell smoke?
L278881 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Oh, honey.
L278880 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ I get to the restaurant and he's not there. I waited for forty- five minutes.  When I called his office, his secretary said they thought I had cancelled.  I had cancelled!  Then I get back to my office and <u>Aranson</u> is waiting for me and he knows <u>everything</u>.
L278879 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ What?
L278878 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ He wasn't there.
L278877 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Honey?  How did it go?  You didn't call me.
L278865 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ C'mon.
L278864 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I think you should feel like dancing at a time like this.
L278863 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ What -- what are you doing?
L278861 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Oh baby.
L278860 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ His secretary just confirmed.
L278859 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Philip!  The senior partner?
L278858 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ He wants to see me!
L278848 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Did she water this plant?  It looks a little bent out of shape.
L278847 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ The floor has a nice shine to it.  Oh God -- we have twenty-two messages on the machine.
L278846 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Yeah -- she did a good job.  This glass looks brand-new.
L278845 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Did the cleaning woman come?
L278817 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Did you lock the garage door?
