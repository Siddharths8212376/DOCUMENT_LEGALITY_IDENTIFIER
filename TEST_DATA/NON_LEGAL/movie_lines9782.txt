L184625 +++$+++ u5055 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KIP +++$+++ Yes.  Later.
L184624 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Kip - come and dance with me
L184608 +++$+++ u5055 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KIP +++$+++ This is what I do.  I do this every day.
L184607 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Don't go.  I'm frightened.  I can love a coward, I can't love another dead man.
L184515 +++$+++ u5055 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KIP +++$+++ Don't talk.  Check again.  Lie flat and then cut.
L184514 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Kiss me.  Before I cut.  Just in case.
L184513 +++$+++ u5055 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KIP +++$+++ No. But he hands them over.
L184512 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Actually, you can't cut, can you? You'll fall over.  Give me the pliers.
L184511 +++$+++ u5055 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KIP +++$+++ You must get away.  Before I cut. I'm not cutting if you're here. He's struggling.  He's going to topple over if he cuts.
L184510 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ I'm not scared.  So many people have died around me.  But I would be a shame for us.  I don't feel like being shy.
L184509 +++$+++ u5055 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KIP +++$+++ Okay.  Get away from here.  Quick.
L184508 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ I promise you that was the right thing to do.  He's my good luck.  Now cut.  This one.  I hope we don't die.
L184507 +++$+++ u5055 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KIP +++$+++ What is this business with you and explosives?  Do you think you're immune?
L184504 +++$+++ u5055 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KIP +++$+++ I've done this.  I've had to do this.
L184503 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Why would anyone do this?
L184501 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ I follow the wires.
L184500 +++$+++ u5055 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KIP +++$+++ You get Hardy.
L184499 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ So I follow the wires?
L184498 +++$+++ u5055 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KIP +++$+++ There's a mine here, but the others are far enough away, I think at least to give me a chance.  I have to work out which one to cut before I fall over.
L184497 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ What do I do?
L184496 +++$+++ u5055 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KIP +++$+++ The mines, the wires, there's a trick. Some explode if you stretch the wires, some if you cut them.
L184495 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ It's okay - I'll help.  Please.
L184447 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ I didn't like that book either. It's all about men.  Too many men. Just like this house.
L184446 +++$+++ u5055 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KIP +++$+++ I'll get another tin. Hana and the Patient are alone.
L184434 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Yes, for your hair.
L184433 +++$+++ u5055 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KIP +++$+++ For my hair?
L184432 +++$+++ u5055 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KIP +++$+++ Thank you.
L184431 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Try this.  I found a great jar of it. Olive oil.  In Naples this was so precious it would have bought you a wife.
L184361 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ I don't think so.
L184360 +++$+++ u5055 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KIP +++$+++ I've met you before.
L184359 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ No, but, no, not at all.  I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and -  - such good manners for someone worried about mines.  That's all.
L184358 +++$+++ u5055 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KIP +++$+++ Is something funny?
L184357 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ I see.  Then may be you're safe as long as you only play Bach.  He's German. Kip is looking around the piano. Hana giggles.
L184356 +++$+++ u5055 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KIP +++$+++ The Germans were here.  The Germans were all over this area.  They left mines everywhere.  Pianos were their favorite hiding places.
L184355 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Excuse me.  Yes?  I don't have the key to that door.
L184295 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Oh God.  Oh God.
L184294 +++$+++ u5060 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ No.  He's - no.
L184293 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ He's gone, hasn't he?
L184288 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Does he know a Captain McGann? The boy hears this, whispers to Oliver.
L184287 +++$+++ u5060 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Third Canadian Fusiliers.
L184284 +++$+++ u5060 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ He's from there - edge of Lake Ontario right, Soldier?
L184283 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Why Picton?
L183882 +++$+++ u5060 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ If anything happened to you I'd never forgive myself.
L183881 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ He can't even move.
L183880 +++$+++ u5060 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ And what if he really is a spy?
L183879 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ I need morphine.  A lot.  And a pistol.
L183878 +++$+++ u5060 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ It's not safe here.  The whole country's crawling with Bandits and Germans and God knows what.  It's madness.  I can't allow it. You're not, this is natural - it's shock. For all of us.  Hana -
L183877 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ When he dies I'll catch up.
L183876 +++$+++ u5060 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ It's not over everywhere.  I didn't mean literally.
L183875 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ The war's over - you told me yourself. How can it be desertion?
L184604 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ What if you couldn't find him…?  Sergeant, not today, please. Not this morning.
L184603 +++$+++ u5052 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Pardon me?
L184602 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Does he have to go?
L184601 +++$+++ u5052 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ A bomb.  At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
L184600 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ I'll tell him.  What is it?  Is it a mine?
L184599 +++$+++ u5052 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Only we have to go to work.
L184598 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ He's sleeping.
L184597 +++$+++ u5052 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ I was looking for the Lieutenant Singh.
L184428 +++$+++ u5052 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ A toddler
L184427 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ You saved my life.  I haven't forgotten.  I thought you were very very tall. You seemed to big - a Giant - and I felt like a child who can't keep her balance.
L184426 +++$+++ u5052 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ I'll ask the Lieutenant.  But thank you.
L184425 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Since Caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear, so please.
L184424 +++$+++ u5052 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Very kind of you, we can always eat in the town with the others -
L184423 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ I was going to say - if you want to eat with us, ever… you and Lieutenant Singh…
L184422 +++$+++ u5052 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Hello miss.
L184421 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Hello.
L184132 +++$+++ u5061 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ STUART +++$+++ I'm feeling old.
L184131 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ I thought that was for when we were very very old?
L184130 +++$+++ u5061 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ STUART +++$+++ I had a hotel room.
L184129 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ I was looking forward to this evening.
L184128 +++$+++ u5061 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ STUART +++$+++ A bit of one.
L184127 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ You've got a mustache.
L184018 +++$+++ u5061 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ STUART +++$+++ We can do that when we're very, very old.
L184017 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ I'd like to spend a night with you in a bed.
L184016 +++$+++ u5061 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ STUART +++$+++ I've got a surprise.  A boat!  We can go to Capri.  It's got a cabin, it's private.
L184015 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Sorry.  I took a Benzedrine.
L184014 +++$+++ u5061 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ STUART +++$+++ Whoa - give me a chance!
L184618 +++$+++ u5055 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KIP +++$+++ This is making me incredibly angry.
L184617 +++$+++ u5052 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Yessir.
L184616 +++$+++ u5055 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KIP +++$+++ Go away.
L184615 +++$+++ u5052 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ You've got to cut, sir, that frost won't last.
L184606 +++$+++ u5052 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ I'm afraid so, sir. Kip hurries to his tent.  Hana follows him.
L184605 +++$+++ u5055 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KIP +++$+++ What's happening?  Am I needed?
L183867 +++$+++ u5052 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Don't move!  Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL! Hana stops. 
L183866 +++$+++ u5055 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KIP +++$+++ Hey!  Hey!  Stop!  Hey!
L184206 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ I insist.  There clearly isn't room for us all, I'm the least able to dig, and I'm not one of the walking wounded. Those are facts.  Besides, if I remain it's the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever he's doing and rescue us. It's hard to argue with this logic.
L184205 +++$+++ u5057 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MADOX +++$+++ Certainly not.
L184166 +++$+++ u5057 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MADOX +++$+++ Why not?
L184165 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Darling, Peter says I could stay…
L184069 +++$+++ u5057 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MADOX +++$+++ A more modest expedition, or even wait a year.  Remind our families we still exist.
L184068 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ How awful.  What will you do?
L184067 +++$+++ u5057 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MADOX +++$+++ I'm afraid we're not having much luck obtaining funds for the expedition.
L184064 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Not at all.  I was thoroughly enjoying by book.  Please.  Signor D'Agostino, Herr Bermann.
L184063 +++$+++ u5057 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MADOX +++$+++ Mrs. Clifton, you'll have to forgive us.  We're not accustomed to the company of women.
L183959 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ It doesn't matter.  Really.  I think I can muddle through.  Okay - The Story of Candaules and Gyges. King Candaules was passionately in love with his wife -  One day he said to Gyges, the son of somebody, anyway - his favorite warrior -
L183958 +++$+++ u5057 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MADOX +++$+++ Your book.  Your Herodotus! Almásy looks uncomfortable.
L184328 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ No, please.  I shall be absolutely fine. They pass Almásy, who doesn't look up from his book.
L184327 +++$+++ u5056 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ LADY HAMPTON +++$+++ I'll come with you.
L184326 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.
L184325 +++$+++ u5056 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ LADY HAMPTON +++$+++ How romantic.  With Fiona I fell over every five minutes.  Ronnie Christened me Lady Downfall.
L184324 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ I don't think so.
L184323 +++$+++ u5056 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ LADY HAMPTON +++$+++ You should sit down, darling.  She's quite all right.  Are you pregnant?
L184317 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Coming.  I can't sleep.  I woke up shouting in the middle of the night. Geoffrey thinks it's the thing in the desert, the trauma.
L184316 +++$+++ u5056 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ LADY HAMPTON +++$+++ Katharine!
L184776 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ Go on, do it.  I don't need to hear any more.
L184775 +++$+++ u5055 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KIP +++$+++ They're excited!  They're happy about destroying a whole city. Would they do that to a White Man's City?  Never!
L184767 +++$+++ u5055 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KIP +++$+++ What have I been doing all this time? Do you know how many mines I've seen? - more mines than there are soldiers, more - how many mines we've put in the ground ourselves, stuffed in corpses, dropped out of the sky.  And now this.
L184766 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L184765 +++$+++ u5055 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KIP +++$+++ I looked up to you, Uncle.  My brother always said I was a fool. Never trust the British, he said: the deal-makers, the map-makers; never shake hands with them.
L184764 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ Kip?
L184457 +++$+++ u5055 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KIP +++$+++ What's he saying?
L184456 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ This is wonderful!
L184443 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ Hana, we have discovered a shared please - the boy and I.
L184442 +++$+++ u5055 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KIP +++$+++ What I really object to, Uncle, is your finishing all my condensed milk.  And the message everywhere in your book - however slowly I read it - that the best destiny for India is to be ruled by the British.
L184441 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ So what do you really object to - the writer or what he's writing about?
L184440 +++$+++ u5055 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KIP +++$+++ It's still there, the cannon, outside the museum. It was made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household in the city as tax, then melted down. Then later they fired the cannon at my people - comma - The natives.
L184439 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ - The Wonder House comma as the natives called the Lahore Museum.
L184438 +++$+++ u5055 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KIP +++$+++ Brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gher -
L184111 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ I think so.  Although I believe that to be true of a number of Germans. Might I have a glass of water?
L184110 +++$+++ u5059 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ Then you were married?
L184109 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ Or my wife's.
L184108 +++$+++ u5059 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ This was your garden?
L184107 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ You tell me.  I remember a lot of things. I remember a garden, plunging down to the sea - the Devil's Chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom, right on the shore, nothing between you and France.
L184106 +++$+++ u5059 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ How do you know you're not German if you don't remember anything?
L184105 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ No.
L184104 +++$+++ u5059 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ Why?  Are you German?
L184103 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ Am I being interrogated?  You should be trying to trick me.  Ask me about Tottenham Hotspur.  Or Buckingham Palace. About Marmite - I was addicted.  Or make me speak German, which I can, by the way.
L184100 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ No.  I think I was a pilot.  I was found near the wreckage of a plane by the Bedouin.  I was with them for some time.
L184099 +++$+++ u5059 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ What about your rank or serial number?
L185522 +++$+++ u5064 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ GIN +++$+++ I'm going to get him, I promise you.
L185521 +++$+++ u5063 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ CRUZ +++$+++ Tell me where you are, or just leave the line open so I can trace you.
L185520 +++$+++ u5064 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ GIN +++$+++ Too late now.
L185519 +++$+++ u5063 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ CRUZ +++$+++ Listen to me. Whatever you're doing, stop. Pull out.
L185518 +++$+++ u5064 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ GIN +++$+++ He's on to something bigger.
L185517 +++$+++ u5063 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ CRUZ +++$+++ In the middle? You've got the Mask, why don't we have him?
L185516 +++$+++ u5064 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ GIN +++$+++ I'm in the middle.
L185515 +++$+++ u5063 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ CRUZ +++$+++ Gin? Where the hell are you?
L185281 +++$+++ u5064 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ GIN +++$+++ I'll send you a postcard. Got to go.
L185280 +++$+++ u5063 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ CRUZ +++$+++ Where are you at least?
L185279 +++$+++ u5064 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ GIN +++$+++ Look, trust me. I know what I'm doing.
L185278 +++$+++ u5063 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ CRUZ +++$+++ Don't overestimate yourself.
L185277 +++$+++ u5064 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ GIN +++$+++ You, want to blow the whole thing, go right ahead.
L185276 +++$+++ u5063 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ CRUZ +++$+++ This is dangerous. I'm sending backup.
L185275 +++$+++ u5064 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ GIN +++$+++ I don't know, but close.
L185274 +++$+++ u5063 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ CRUZ +++$+++ How close?
L185273 +++$+++ u5064 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ GIN +++$+++ We're getting close.
L185272 +++$+++ u5063 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ CRUZ +++$+++ Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status?
L185271 +++$+++ u5064 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ GIN +++$+++ This was my first excuse to get away. I can't exactly use my cell phone.
L185270 +++$+++ u5063 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ CRUZ +++$+++ You don't call, you don't write.
L184879 +++$+++ u5063 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ CRUZ +++$+++ Which you have in mind.
L184878 +++$+++ u5064 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ GIN +++$+++ And a target guaranteed to catch his interest.
L184877 +++$+++ u5063 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ CRUZ +++$+++ That's doable.
L184876 +++$+++ u5064 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ GIN +++$+++ I'd need an introduction. From someone he trusts. Someone who owes us a favor.
L184875 +++$+++ u5063 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ CRUZ +++$+++ How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?
L184874 +++$+++ u5064 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ GIN +++$+++ I've been following this guy for years. I'm your best shot.
L184873 +++$+++ u5063 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ CRUZ +++$+++ With that computer--nobody better. Out there...it's different. You twisted your ankle stepping over a curb on Madison Avenue.
L184872 +++$+++ u5064 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ GIN +++$+++ It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.
L184871 +++$+++ u5063 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ CRUZ +++$+++ Why didn't I think of that?
L184870 +++$+++ u5064 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ GIN +++$+++ We've got to catch him in the act.
L184869 +++$+++ u5064 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ GIN +++$+++ Yeah. Me.
L184868 +++$+++ u5063 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ CRUZ +++$+++ You got a better idea?
L184867 +++$+++ u5064 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ GIN +++$+++ They've never caught him before, what makes you think they'll catch him now?
L184858 +++$+++ u5063 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ CRUZ +++$+++ Exactly.
L184857 +++$+++ u5064 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ GIN +++$+++ You're saying the thief wants us to think it's Mac but it's really not.
L184856 +++$+++ u5063 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ CRUZ +++$+++ Give me a break. Remember Manzini? When he stole Montezuma's scepter he left a Pepto Bismal bottle. The best ones always copy Mac.
L184855 +++$+++ u5064 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ GIN +++$+++ Mac's signature.
L184849 +++$+++ u5064 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ GIN +++$+++ Put the bolts on that window under a scope, I'm betting you'll find wrench scratches on them.
L184848 +++$+++ u5063 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ CRUZ +++$+++ And the draft blew over the flowers.
L184847 +++$+++ u5064 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ GIN +++$+++ Meaning no one arranges calalilies like that. He left the window open when he came in. His only mistake.
L184846 +++$+++ u5063 +++$+++ m335 +++$+++ CRUZ +++$+++ Meaning--
