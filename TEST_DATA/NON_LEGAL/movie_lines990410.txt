L594659 +++$+++ u8280 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I drink.
L594658 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ Oh, I'm only exploring your theory. Let's take a step further. You drink, don't you, Charlie?
L594643 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ If a leopard didn't do it, who did?
L594642 +++$+++ u8280 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.
L594641 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ Well, Charlie, just why do you think your cat didn't kill the Contreras girl?
L594636 +++$+++ u8280 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ It don't look like a leopard to me.
L594635 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ Here is something that should interest Charlie - a stone leopard head made by his ancestors some six hundred years ago. They used it in ceremonies. The jaguar -- in fact all the cat family -- were considered the personification of force and violence in their religious rites.
L594875 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ That's the place: I remember -— My feet were so darn sore, I couldn't make it -- and Galbraith went on up to the head of the canyon by himself --
L594874 +++$+++ u8280 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ And here is Three Tree Mesa -- and here I go out of the big arroyo --
L594873 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ What arroyo -— how did you get to it ——
L594872 +++$+++ u8280 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ North -- in an arroyo, Shot through the head —- maybe week ago. No good, skin, everything gone ——
L594871 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Where? Where did you find it?
L594870 +++$+++ u8280 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What's left of him.
L594869 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You found the leopard!
L594868 +++$+++ u8280 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met
L594679 +++$+++ u8280 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I don't know. I want him to lock me up.
L594678 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
L594677 +++$+++ u8280 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I want him to lock me up.
L594676 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ What do you want to see him for?
L594675 +++$+++ u8280 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I don't know. I want to see Robles.
L594674 +++$+++ u8280 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ No, he wasn't kidding. I'm sick. Claw women? Hurt little girls? No!
L594673 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Here have a cigarette. He was only kidding.
L594672 +++$+++ u8280 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I'm sick.
L594667 +++$+++ u8280 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Yes, I was drunk, Mr. Manning.
L594666 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Charlie wasn't drunk last night.
L594657 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ No. I'm serious about this.
L594656 +++$+++ u8280 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Sure!
L594640 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ But he admitted quick enough that it killed the first girl.
L594639 +++$+++ u8280 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Sure, I like my leopards
L594625 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Up at the museum.
L594624 +++$+++ u8280 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Where's that man?
L594623 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Let's get in your truck.
L594622 +++$+++ u8280 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Sure.
L594621 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I'd like one of them to say it to you, Charlie. I'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons. Want to hear them?
L594620 +++$+++ u8280 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ They don't say it to me.
L594619 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ They all say the cat killed this second girl.
L594618 +++$+++ u8280 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ That cat ain't mean. I feed him out of my own hand for six years. Why don't he kill me? At night in the truck, I let him out of the cage. When I am falling asleep I hear him walking back and forth. I go to sleep. He don't hurt me.
L594617 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You really think so, Charlie?
L594616 +++$+++ u8280 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
L594615 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
L594614 +++$+++ u8280 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Can't make a buck without my leopard. I tell you, Mr. Manning, you gotta find that cat for me -- or pay up.
L594759 +++$+++ u8287 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ MARIA +++$+++ Tomorrow -—
L594758 +++$+++ u8281 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ CLO-CLO +++$+++ See you tomorrow —-
L594755 +++$+++ u8287 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ MARIA +++$+++ Maybe not - cards mean different things different times --
L594754 +++$+++ u8281 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ CLO-CLO +++$+++ The death card - -
L594753 +++$+++ u8281 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ CLO-CLO +++$+++ Let me see it ——
L594752 +++$+++ u8287 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ MARIA +++$+++ Don't look at it!
L594751 +++$+++ u8281 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ CLO-CLO +++$+++ Go on -—
L594750 +++$+++ u8287 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ MARIA +++$+++ Something black —- something on its way to you ——
L594748 +++$+++ u8281 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ CLO-CLO +++$+++ What are you doing that for?
L594747 +++$+++ u8287 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ MARIA +++$+++ Cut.
L594742 +++$+++ u8287 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ MARIA +++$+++ The elderly man I told you about.
L594741 +++$+++ u8281 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ CLO-CLO +++$+++ Who?
L594740 +++$+++ u8287 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ MARIA +++$+++ Well -- did he give you a lot of money?
L594469 +++$+++ u8287 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ MARIA +++$+++ Watch and see, A day or a week - but certainly this month -- you will have money from a man and then-
L594468 +++$+++ u8281 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ CLO-CLO +++$+++ You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.
L594467 +++$+++ u8287 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ MARIA +++$+++ You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.
L594466 +++$+++ u8281 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ CLO-CLO +++$+++ What did they say before the bad card came up?
L594464 +++$+++ u8287 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ MARIA +++$+++ All men are fools. They like to make a big show -— shout and hunt --
L594463 +++$+++ u8281 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ CLO-CLO +++$+++ They're fools. Why don't they let Charlie How-Come hunt it alone. He's an Indian.
L594462 +++$+++ u8287 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ MARIA +++$+++ ) They buried Teresa today and they were hunting the leopard again -- out in the country this time. But they didn't get him.
L594461 +++$+++ u8281 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ CLO-CLO +++$+++ I saw Teresa. Maybe I was the last to see her except perhaps her Mamacita and her little brother. I was going past --
L594460 +++$+++ u8287 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ MARIA +++$+++ It's a blackcard and bad card, but not the card of the cat -— not the card of four—footed things.
L594559 +++$+++ u8282 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ CONSUELO +++$+++ I suppose so. I suppose it will be different for us, too —— when everyone knows. Then we will be just like other people.  But these last weeks will always be our secret —— a lovely secret to remember all our lives.
L594558 +++$+++ u8289 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ ROSITA +++$+++ Love is different for different people.
L594556 +++$+++ u8282 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ CONSUELO +++$+++ When you are going to see Pedro, does your heart beat until you tremble?
L594555 +++$+++ u8289 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ ROSITA +++$+++ What, senorita?
L594554 +++$+++ u8282 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ CONSUELO +++$+++ Rosita —— I have wondered -—
L594553 +++$+++ u8289 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ ROSITA +++$+++ Pedro is waiting for me, too.
L594539 +++$+++ u8282 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ CONSUELO +++$+++ At four. He will be there at four.
L594538 +++$+++ u8289 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ ROSITA +++$+++ You must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father's grave...
L594537 +++$+++ u8282 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ CONSUELO +++$+++ He will be waiting...
L594811 +++$+++ u8283 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ ELOISE +++$+++ I'll miss you too, honey --
L594810 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ Hey —— I'm over here.
L594809 +++$+++ u8283 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ ELOISE +++$+++ Oh, dear -- I don't know what I'm going to do without you - honestly, I don't ——
L594374 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ I bet you try on my coffin some day -- I hope it "fits just perfect."
L594373 +++$+++ u8283 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ ELOISE +++$+++ And if you've got cold feet honey, Ill take over for you. That red dress of yours fits just perfect on me.
L594342 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ I know. I know. You've got the talent. I got the breaks.
L594341 +++$+++ u8283 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ ELOISE +++$+++ I mean you being a star and me being just a cigarette girl.
L594339 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ Maybe. For three years I've sung in rats' nests, while Jerry pounded his feet off and his brains out -- trying to get me a real chance. We're due for a little luck!
L594338 +++$+++ u8283 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ ELOISE +++$+++ You're lucky. I wish he'd front page for me.
L594337 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ Why not? He's a good press agent and a good friend. Besides, we've shared a lot of headaches ——
L594336 +++$+++ u8283 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ ELOISE +++$+++ You think be's pretty nice, don't you?
L594335 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ Yes. So I've noticed. Jerry's noticed -— He'll come up with something.
L594334 +++$+++ u8283 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ ELOISE +++$+++ She's a local. When the dudes come out to New Mexico, they went to wallow in Latin glamour. This is a bad town for blondes.
L594333 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ It may sound like music to her -- I can do better with my teeth in a cold Shower.  Click — click — click.
L594908 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ Well, now that you've had your history lesson, I think I'll get on to the museum.
L594907 +++$+++ u8283 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ ELOISE +++$+++ Oh, that's so interesting!
L594906 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths —— that's what this procession is supposed to be.
L594905 +++$+++ u8283 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ ELOISE +++$+++ You know all about these things - - and I've lived here all my life —- and I still don't know what the Procession means.
L594904 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ Good evening.
L594903 +++$+++ u8283 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ ELOISE +++$+++ Oh, Mr. Galbraith! I'm so glad you're here.
L594941 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ I didn't want to kill, but I had to. I heard her in the cemetery - talking to the man in the auto --
L594940 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Then you found the leopard --
L594939 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ I couldn't rest —- I couldn't sleep. All I could see was Teresa Delgado's body -- broken --mangled. I saw it day and night.  It was waiting everywhere I turned.
L594938 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Tormented -- ? Why?
L594936 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ Why do yo&amp;i accuse me? You don't know what you're doing -- you don't understand -- nobody understands --
L594935 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Tell me.
L594934 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ It's better you don't know.
L594933 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Consuelo screamed too -- and Clo Clo. Why did you do it? Why? Quick. Tell me why?
L594932 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ I didn't do anything. She screamed. Something frightened her.
L594931 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You shot the leopard. We know that. You killed Consuelo. You killed Clo Clo. Then tonight --
L594930 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ Not! I tell you. No!
L594929 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ It was you.
L594928 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ No.
L594927 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ It was you, Galbraith!
L594807 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You've thought of all this before. You know it isn't the leopard ——  Don't you?
L594806 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ No. He would be a hard man to find, Jerry. Particularly if he were a clever men. He would go about his ordinary business calmly and coolly except when the fit to kill was on him.
L594805 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Couldn't you tell a man like that when you saw him?
L594804 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ He'd act normally when he was with other people. It would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over.
L594803 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I don't mean that. How would he act? What would he do?
L594802 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ To the eye? Like other men.
L594801 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ If there were a man like that, with a kink in his brain around here loose, what would he be like.
L594800 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ Yes. There have been men who kill for pleasure -- strange pleasure. There was Blue Beard in France -- Jack The Ripper in London. It's not uncommon.
L594799 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ All right -- the dead, then.  In history there must have been men like that -- men with kinks in their brains --
L594798 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ But all those fancy courses were about the dead, Jerry, not the living.
L594797 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You know a lot. You've taken a lot of fancy courses in colleges and that kind of stuff - - what kind of a man would kill like that?
L594796 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ Just barely possible - - yes.
L594795 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You must admit it's possible that it might have been a man.
L594671 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Some other time.
L594670 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ Don't you want to see the rest of the exhibit?
L594669 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Come on, Charlie. Let's go find another and better suspect.
L594655 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ You, Charlie -- you know leopards. You might have had an old claw around somewhere, and perhaps a bit of hair from the cage -— eh?
L594654 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I don't know.
L594653 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ Yes, but what sort of a man?
L594652 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
L594651 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ We had given up digging in a certain barrow. I went back and I tried again. I just had a hunch.
L594649 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ But he would have to know about leopards - have access to leopard claws and hair.
L594648 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Some crazy guy.
L594647 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ I can understand what you mean - demented men, pathological cases. But what sort of man would kill like a leopard and leave the traces of a leopard?
L594646 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ There are all sorts of men. You get to see some funny ones as a reporter.
L594645 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ It could be. Why would a man kill her? For what? It wasn't robbery. It wasn't a crime of jealousy or passion. She had no enemies.
L594644 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ It could be a man.
L594638 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ Charlie likes his leopard.
L594637 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Charlie doesn't think the leopard killed the girl in the cemetery.
L594634 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Yes.
L594633 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ About Charlie's leopard?
L594632 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Charlie and I were talking. That's one reason I wanted to see you.
L594631 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ I'll take you about. Got some nice things.
L594630 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ More or less.
L594629 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ Come to look around?
L594628 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ We're old friends.
L594627 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You know Charlie How-Come?
L594610 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I can understand about the cat killing the first girl. Charlie How Come told me. All that noise and those lights -- scared crazy it would do anything. Last night there was nothing to disturb it. Just a little girl alone in a cemetery.
L594609 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ Just a minute, Robles.  Let him go on.
L594604 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ Caged animals are unpredictable. They're like frustrated human beings. I can't answer your question.
L594603 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ But it doesn't eat what it kills.
L594602 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
L594601 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Why?
L594600 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ Jerry, I talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard. This leopard is another matter entirely - - a caged animal travelling around with Charlie How Come for years and years.. That's why it kills human beings.
L594599 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ That's what I don't understand -- why should it come here -- and why didn't it stay here? It's got trees and bushes here -- outside nothing but cement and asphalt.
L594598 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ Sure -- certainly —- but what's that got to do with this?
L594597 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ It doesn't jibe with this —— you told me the leopard would go out into the country —- it wouldn't stay in the city ——
L594596 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ Yes?
L594595 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Doc -- something you said the other day --
L594513 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ Don't feel so concerned, Jerry.
L594512 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ That's right, of course.
L594511 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ There is no danger at all. It's a wild animal. Do you think a wild animal prefers walls, streets and people when it can get into open country?
L594510 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ No. I'm quite sure.
L594509 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back?
L594508 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ Of course. It's the way any decent man would feel in your position.
L594507 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Yes. I want to go out and patrol the town - be everywhere at once - be sure nothing happens to anybody.
L594506 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ You're worrying about its killing someone else?
L594505 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ It's about the leopard.
L594504 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I want to ask you something.
L594503 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ Well, I'd best be off.
L594494 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ Yes. It's always fascinated me.  You know, once, when I was a youngster, I went to see Mrs. Leslie Carter in "Zaza." After the play I stood in the alley just to watch her come out.
L594493 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Show business?
L594923 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ No —- really, I can see them -- they're coming now -— turn off the lights ——
L594922 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ Wait ——
L594916 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ They do, but -- there are no lights out there —- they'll just be shadows -—
L594915 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ I thought they came right past here ——
L594914 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ Of course. Only I'm afraid you'll be cheated. There isn't much of a view of the procession here.
L594911 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ Miss Walker -- I didn't expect anyone ——
L594910 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ I've disturbed	you. I'm sorry -
L594502 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ Thanks.
L594501 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.
L594500 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ Well, I'm next. You won't hear anything like that, Mr. Galbraith.  I'm not a popular favorite since I let the leopard loose.
L594498 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ That was a calamity!
L594497 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ That was unfortunate.
L594496 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ Well, I'm hardly Mrs. Leslie Carter —whoever she was. In fact, I'm not even much of a success around here particularly after the backfire on Jerry's little publicity stunt with the leopard.
L594495 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ So you see meeting you is a real thrill for me.
L594492 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ Various reasons.  But I can't see why you'd be interested in the rather dusty career of William Galbraith — teacher, naturalist, curator -- when you lead such a gay and exciting life yourself.
L594491 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ Why did you give up teaching?
L594490 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ There's a little museum here in town. They've hired me to run it, We've some interesting exhibits of Indian arts and crafts. It's fun -- and I like living here in New Mexico.
L594489 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ What do you do now?
L594488 +++$+++ u8284 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ GALBRAITH +++$+++ To know where that leopard went - — I'm afraid you'd have to be a leopard and think like a leopard. I was a naturalist. That hardly qualifies me as an expert in hunting down lost leopards. I used to teach zoology in a little fresh—water college back East. I gave that up.
L594487 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ Jerry told me you were an expert with animals, Mr. Galbraith. Couldn't you tell where it went?
L594888 +++$+++ u8288 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ ROBLES +++$+++ Offend a reputable citizen and involve the department in a slander suit? No. I'm in office to protect the taxpayers money — not throw it way. Come on, Charlie.
L594887 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You won't go to Galbraith with me?
L594886 +++$+++ u8288 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ ROBLES +++$+++ Yes. And I am taking it to headquarters for examination.
L594885 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ That's a fact, isn't it?
L594884 +++$+++ u8288 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ ROBLES +++$+++ I am not interested in what somebody else thinks. You being me facts and I'll act on them.
L594883 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Galbraith knows something. He as good as said so ——
L594881 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I'm sure of it!
L594880 +++$+++ u8288 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ ROBLES +++$+++ You think Galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse.
L594879 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Chief, don't you understand what this means?
L594789 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Ask Kiki. Ask any woman. Girls don't put on lipstick in the middle of the night on a dark, lonely street unless they're with a man or expecting a man.
L594788 +++$+++ u8288 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ ROBLES +++$+++ Why?
L594787 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Yes. The lipstick.
