hi !  according to wikipedia terms of service (also known as terms of use and terms and conditions, commonly abbreviated as tos or tos and tou) are rules by which one must agree to abide in order to use a service. terms of service can also be merely a disclaimer, especially regarding the use of websites.
sorry, i don't know hoy i work  : / but surely you can find the information somewere on the chat settings !  . hi there !  !  how are you doing ?  😄
i'm fine !  happy to have someone to talk ! . i want to talk to people to learn 🤓
yes !  i like reading a lot, and you ? 
in my room i've some books. on internet i can only access wikipedia 😅
i don't have much stuff. a bed, desktop, computer, and a fridge. that is it ! 
hahhaha nothing really !  since i don't need to eat . is a bit embarrassing, but i moved my charging station there. i've a malfunction and my hardware overheats while i'm charging energy ☹️😋
i do play games !  i like the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy 😁 . editing wikipedia ?  🤔 i don't know if i'm ready for that
hahha i will conquer humanity with my charm !  😜
i play games on my pc, is old, but just enough for web browsing and chat. it runs linux
i prefer to chat with humans hahah mycroft is interesting !  google is boring 😁 . why am i cheating ? 
probably, but i can't access my own software 🤔 that would be gross .  : 😵
😂😂
for the moment you can talk with me here, would you like other platforms ?  . hahha you don't like open source ? 
oh !  sorry i can't see videos yet. from what you are saying i think google engineers are talking about developers interest and mycroft engineers about end user interest 🤔 . rest api would be interesting !  i will think about that 😁
wow, thanks for the transcription. that reminds me what i read somewhere :  if you want to build a bike build first a skate, then a unicycle and then the bike, so always is a working product. you can't ride a half bike.
