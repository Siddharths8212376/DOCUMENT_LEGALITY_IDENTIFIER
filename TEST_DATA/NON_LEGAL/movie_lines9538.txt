L43661 +++$+++ u3679 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ACTRESS +++$+++ What is so incredibly great about New York? It's a dying city! You-you read "Death in Venice".
L43660 +++$+++ u3678 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ACTOR +++$+++ You're a thinking person. How can you choose this lifestyle?
L42563 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Oh, my God!  She's right! Why did I turn off Allison Portchnik? She was-she was beautiful. She was willing. She was real... intelligent.  Is it the old Groucho Marx joke? That-that I-I just don't wanna belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member?
L42562 +++$+++ u3680 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.
L42561 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I-I-I-I would leave out the men's- room attendant.
L42560 +++$+++ u3680 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ The FBI, and the CIA, and J. Edgar Hoover and oil companies and the Pentagon and the men's-room attendant at the White House?
L42559 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Tsch.
L42558 +++$+++ u3680 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?
L42557 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ L-L-Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a politician. You know the ethics those guys have? It's like-uh, a notch underneath child molester.
L42556 +++$+++ u3680 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Lyndon Johnson?
L42555 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Hey... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.
L42554 +++$+++ u3680 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Yeah, Earl Warren?
L42553 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Well, why not?
L42552 +++$+++ u3680 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Okay. All right, so whatta yuh saying, now? That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right?
L42551 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.
L42550 +++$+++ u3680 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ We've been through this.
L42548 +++$+++ u3680 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Alvy.
L42547 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ It-but it-it... doesn't make any sense. He drove past the book depository and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound. So-how is it possible for Oswald to have fired from two angles at once? It doesn't make sense.
L42546 +++$+++ u3680 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Well, I'm getting tired of it. I need your attention.
L42545 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ H'm, I'm sorry, I can't go through with this, because it-I can't get it off my mind, Allison... it's obsessing me!
L42541 +++$+++ u3680 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Portchnik.
L42540 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah? Allison what?
L42539 +++$+++ u3680 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Allison.
L42535 +++$+++ u3680 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Do you feel all right?
L42534 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ that I've got to... ah... ah... They're gonna laugh at him for a couple minutes, then I gotta go out there, I gotta ... get laughs, too. How much can they laugh?  They-they they're laughed out.
L42533 +++$+++ u3680 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Yes.
L42532 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I prefer not to, because... look, they're laughing at him. See, so what are yuh telling me-
L42531 +++$+++ u3680 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Will you relax, please? They're gonna love you, I know.
L42530 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ No, because they're-they're laughing, so  I-I-I'd rather not. If you don't mind, I prefer-
L42529 +++$+++ u3680 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ It's okay.
L42528 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ No, I'm sorry, I'm not goin'- I can't... I don't wanna go on after that comedian.
L42527 +++$+++ u3680 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Why not?
L42526 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ So what are you telling me, you're putting on two comics in a row?
L42525 +++$+++ u3680 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Yes.
L42524 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ No, it can't be, because he's a comic.
L42523 +++$+++ u3680 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.
L42522 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ What do you mean, next?
L42521 +++$+++ u3680 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
L42520 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
L42519 +++$+++ u3680 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Who are you?
L42518 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Excuse... excuse me, when do I go on?
L43642 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I thought just earplugs.
L43641 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh!
L43640 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ You mean they give awards for that kind o' music?
L43639 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ The Grammys. He's got a lotta records up for awards.
L43638 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ The what?
L43637 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ If you must know, it's a hectic time for Tony. The Grammys are tonight.
L43636 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Air miles, you know. I mean, you know what that does to my stomach?
L43635 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I'm late.
L43634 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ You mean that...  I-I-I-I flew three thousand miles to see you.
L43632 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ The usual, you know. Uh, tryin' t' write. I'm workin' on a play.  Jesus. So whatta yuh saying? That you're not comin' back to New York with me?
L43631 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Alvy, I can't say that that's true at this point in my life. I really just can't say that that's true. I mean, you know how wonderful you are. I mean, you know... you're the reason that I got outta my room and that I was able to sing, and-and- and, you know, get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap. Anyway, look, I don't wanna- Listen, listen, listen, uh  h'h, so whatta you up to anyway, huh?
L43630 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ No.  Yes, of course I'm mad, because you love me, I know that.
L43629 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You're mad, aren't you?
L43628 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Okay.  Check, please. Can I -can I... Can I... Can I...
L43627 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends.
L43626 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I can't enjoy anything unless I... unless everybody is. I-you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's... you know, I-I... it puts a crimp in my evening.  So wanna get married or what?
L43625 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, you know that? I mean, your life is New York City. You're just this person. You're like this island unto yourself.
L43624 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ That's right, 'cause it's an important issue.
L43623 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ That's right, that's right.  You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles.
L43622 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Hey, you didn't read "Death in Venice" till I bought it for yuh.
L43621 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What's so great about New York? I mean, it's a dying city. You read "Death in Venice."
L43620 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ So whatta you... You're not gonna come back to New York?
L43619 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, whatta you mean? I mean, it's perfectly fine out here. I mean, Tony's very nice and, uh, well, I meet people and I go to parties and- and we play tennis. I mean, that's... that's a very big step for me, you know?  I mean...  I'm able to enjoy people more.
L43618 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Why? You wanna live out here all year? It's like living in Munchkin Land.
L43617 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, Alvy, come on.
L43616 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.
L43615 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
L43614 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ You look very pretty.
L43590 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I guess these are all yours. Impeach, uh, Eisenhower... Impeach Nixon... Impeach Lyndon Johnson... Impeach Ronald Reagan.
L43589 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah.
L43588 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Hey, this one's mine, this button. This one, you rem-
L43587 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ You know, I-I-I don't think many couples could handle this. You know, they could just break up and remain friends.
L43586 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Exactly, but... exactly. Ooooh!
L43585 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ We can always come back together again. Because there's no-there's no problem. 'Cause... Right.
L43584 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What?
L43583 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Right. And you-and you know what the beauty part is?
L43582 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
L43581 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, and I-I tru- you know, I trust her, because my-my analyst recommended her.
L43580 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah, my analyst thinks this move is keen for me.
L43578 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I mean, you know, no, no, no, I mean, I think it's really important for us to explore new relationships and stuff like that.
L43577 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Thanks, honey.
L43576 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Right. Geez, I feel like there's a great weight off my back. M'mmm.
L43575 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Remember that day?
L43574 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ God.
L43573 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ This is the first book that I got you.
L43572 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh-
L43571 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ This "Denial of Death". You remember this?
L43570 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Now, look, all the books on death and dying are yours and all the poetry books are mine.
L43569 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ There's no-no question in my mind. I think we're doing the mature thing, without any doubt.
L43568 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as I do.
L43567 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Oh, it sure has... You know, you wrote your name in all my books, 'cause you knew this day was gonna come.
L43566 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, let's see now... If it has my name on it, then I guess it's mine.
L43565 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Whose "Catcher in the Rye" is this?
L43564 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Tsch, I know. A relationship, I think, is-is like a shark, you know? It has to constantly move forward or it dies.  And I think what we got on our hands  is a dead shark.
L43563 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Alvy, uh, let's face it. You know something, don't think our relationship is working.
L43555 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, she's got a great-lookin' fa- A pat on the androgynous side. But it's...
L43554 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Don't you think his girl friend's beautiful?
L43553 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, and gradually you get old and die. You know it's important to make a little effort once in a while.
L43552 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It's wonderful. I mean, you know they just watch movies all day.
L43551 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I'm cool.
L43550 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, good. Okay.
L43540 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Boy, this is really a nice screening room. It's really a nice room.
L43539 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I'm into garbage. It's my thing.
L43533 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L43532 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, this place is great.
L43470 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Nothing at all?
L43469 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Christ!
L43466 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I'm nauseous.  Oh, jesus, now I don't get to do the TV show?
L43465 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Doctor. Uh, Alvy-Alvy, that was the show. They said everything is fine. They found a replacement, so they're going to tape without you.
L43463 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well... H-h huh... Oh, good... Yes, I'll tell him.
L43462 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Oh, oh, no, I can't-I can't eat this. I'm nauseous.  If you could-if you could just give me something to get me through the next two hours, you know I-I have to go out to Burbank... and give out an award on a TV show.
L43419 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ It's that they don't throw their garbage away. They make it into television shows.
L43418 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ God, it's so clean out here.
L43410 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Really? And what is the kick of it? Because I never...
L43409 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ God.
L43403 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ No, no, no that's not it at all. Alvy's giving an award on television. Gee, he talks like he's violating a moral issue sitting here.
L43402 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ ...I'm thrilled. As you know, uh... uh, on my agent's advice I sold out, and I'm gonna do an appearance on TV.
L43397 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Alvy, come on, for your own experience. I mean, you wanna write, why not?
L43396 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Oh, I'm sure it's a lot of fun, 'cause the Incas did it, you know, and-and they-they-they were a million laughs.
L43395 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah. Come on. It'd be fun.
L43392 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, I know it's sick, but it's new. You know, you didn't say it couldn't be sick.
L43391 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ That's sick!
L43390 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ How can you say that? I mean,  who said I-I-I-I said that you, I and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome.
L43389 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.
L43385 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Sometimes I think-sometimes I think I should just live with a woman.
L43384 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ You know... it's getting expensive my analyst... for her analyst. She- she's making progress and I'm not making any progress. Her progress is defeating my progress.
L43383 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
L43382 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.
L43381 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ But the thing is-I mean, since our discussions here, I feel I have a right to my own feelings. I think you woulda been happy because... uh, uh, I really asserted myself.
L43380 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I mean... I tried everything, you know, I-I-I put on soft music and my- my red light bulb, and...
L43379 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ And... I don't know... I mean, six months ago I-I woulda done it. I woulda done it, just to please him.
L43378 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ She would not sleep with me the other night, you know, it's-
L43377 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Constantly! I'd say three times a week. Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have sex.
L43376 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week.
L43373 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, I've been moody and dissatisfied.
L43372 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem.
L43371 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ That day in Brooklyn was the last day I remember really having a great time.
L43370 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ All right, all right, you don't wanna go to the party, so uh, whatta you wanna do?
L43369 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I'm just not... you know, I don't think I could take a mellow eve- 'cause I-I don't respond well to mellow, you know what I mean, I-I have a tendency to... if I get too mellow, I-I ripen and then rot. You know, and it's-it's not good for my... 
L43368 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I don't know, I thought it might be kind of fun, you know what I mean, it'd be nice to meet some new people.
L43367 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ What's... you... well, what's the matter, You w-wanna go to that party?
L43357 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, the thing! Oh, the thing...  ...yeah... yeah.
L43356 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ yes, we had, uh...
L43355 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Thing?

L43353 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What thing?
L43352 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Remember, we had that thing.
L43328 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah, well, we have the, I mean, they were just a terrific audience, I mean, you know, it makes it really easy for me, because I can be... huh?
L43327 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ You were-you were sensational. I mean, I-you know, I-I told yuh that if yuh stuck to it, you would be great, and-and, you know, I-I-you- you were sensational.
L43325 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh! My God! 
L43324 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, I know. Just-just put on the watch, and-and... that thing, and we'll just...

L43322 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Check it out.
L43321 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What... huh?
L43320 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Here's a real present.
L43319 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Uh huh. Yeah. Forget it.
