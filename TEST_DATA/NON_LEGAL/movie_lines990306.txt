L514404 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ Why would I lie to you, Auggie? You think it was easy to come here and walk into this place? Why would I do it if I didn't have to?
L514403 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ You've suckered me before, darling, remember? Why should I believe you now?
L514402 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
L514401 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ I know what it means. That still don't make it a good name.
L514400 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ It means "happiness."
L514399 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Stop it, already. Just stop all this crap right now.  Was that your idea to call her Felicity?
L514398 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ Her name is Felicity, and she just turned eighteen.  She ran away from Pittsburgh last year, and now she's living in some shit-hole here in Brooklyn with a guy named Chico. Strung out on crack, four months pregnant.  I can't bear to think about that baby. Our grandchild, Auggie. Just think of it. Our grandchild.
L514397 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Our daughter? Is that what you said? Our daughter? I mean, you might have a daughter, but I sure as hell don't. And even if I did -- which I don't -- she wouldn't be our daughter.
L514396 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ Don't rush me, okay? You're jumping to conclusions before I've even said anything.  And besides, it's not for me.  It's for our daughter.
L514395 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Help, huh? And I don't suppose this help has anything to do with money, does it?
L514394 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ Like what you're doing. I'm not going to eat you up.  I need your help, and if you keep staring at me like that. I might start screaming.
L514393 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Like what?
L514392 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ Don't look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me the creeps.
L514391 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ All right, sugar, what's on your mind?
L514387 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ You heard her, pipsqueak. The lady and I have private business to discuss. Go outside and stand in front of the door. If anyone tries to come in, tell 'em we're closed. You got that?
L514386 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ This is private, Auggie. Just between you and I.
L514385 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Talk away, lady of my dreams. I'm all ears.
L514384 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ I've got something to talk to you about, and the least you can do is listen. You owe me that much. I drove all the way from Pittsburgh to see you, and I'm not going until you've heard me out.
L514383 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ At least I've stayed true to myself. Which is more than I can say about some people.
L514382 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ You always were a son-of-a-bitch, weren't you? A little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth.
L514381 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ And you think it looks better to go around dressed up like Captain Hook?
L514380 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ I don't want to talk about it.  If you really want to know. I lost it. And I'm not sorry I did. That eye was cursed, Auggie, and it never gave me nothing but grief.
L514379 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ No I'm not. I look like shit. And so do you, Ruby. You look just awful.  What's with the patch, anyway? What'd you do with that old blue marble -- hock it for a bottle of gin?
L514378 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ You're looking good, Auggie.
L514377 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Is that all? I thought it was about three hundred.
L514376 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ Eighteen and a half years.
L514375 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Christ, Ruby, it's been so long. I figured you were dead.
L514205 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Okay, my man. Love to the wife and kids, et cetera, et cetera. Drop me a postcard if you can remember the address.
L514204 +++$+++ u7686 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ VINNIE +++$+++ I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie.
L514203 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ They come in, they go out. I've got it planned to the last detail.
L514202 +++$+++ u7686 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ VINNIE +++$+++ Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long.
L514201 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ It's the law that's buying. That's what's so beautiful about it. I mean, when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail?
L514200 +++$+++ u7686 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ VINNIE +++$+++ No thanks. I don't care what you do, but just make sure you don't get caught, okay? The last I heard, it was still illegal to sell Cuban cigars in this country.
L514199 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ It's all set. My guy in Miami said he'd have them within the next few weeks.  Are you sure you don't want to go in with me? Five thousand dollars outlay, a guaranteed ten-thousand-dollar return. A consortium of Court Street lawyers and judges. They're just drooling to get their lips around some genuine Cuban cigars.
L514198 +++$+++ u7686 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ VINNIE +++$+++ Speaking of which, are you still going ahead with that deal on the Montecristos?
L514197 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Tobacco today, sex tomorrow. In three or four years, it'll probably be against the law to smile at strangers.
L514196 +++$+++ u7686 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ VINNIE +++$+++ They catch you smoking tobacco, they'll stand you up against a wall and shoot you.
L514195 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Enjoy it while you can, Vin. Pretty soon, they're going to legislate us out of business anyway.
L514194 +++$+++ u7686 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ VINNIE +++$+++ I should stop smoking these damn things is what I should do. The fuckers are going to kill me one day.
L514193 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ I try not to, anyway. It's better for your health. I mean, look at you, Vincent. You're the guy with the wife and three kids and the ranch house on Long Island. You're the guy with the white shoes and the white Caddy and the white shag carpet. But you've had two heart attacks, and I'm still waiting for my first.
L514192 +++$+++ u7686 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ VINNIE +++$+++ You don't take anything seriously, do you?
L514191 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ She made a play for me after I got back, but her glass eye kept interfering with my concentration. Every time we got into a clinch, I'd start thinking about that hole in her head, that empty socket with the glass eye in it. An eye that couldn't see, an eye that couldn't shed any tears. The minute I started thinking about it, Mr. Johnson would get all soft and small. And I can't see getting married if Mr. Johnson isn't going to be in tiptop shape.
L514190 +++$+++ u7686 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ VINNIE +++$+++ Lovely.
L514189 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ She upped and married some other cat after I joined the navy. By the time I got my discharge, though, she was divorced. Her husband poked out her eye in a domestic quarrel.
L514188 +++$+++ u7686 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ VINNIE +++$+++ Sounds like another one of your stories to me.
L514187 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Ruby McNutt. My one true love.
L514186 +++$+++ u7686 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ VINNIE +++$+++ Yeah, I know. To that girl who moved to Pittsburgh.
L514185 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ I almost got married once.
L514184 +++$+++ u7686 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ VINNIE +++$+++ Shit. You should have been married to someone by now. You know, settled down somewhere with a kid or two, a nice steady job.
L514183 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ I don't know.  Maybe because I love you so much, boss.
L514182 +++$+++ u7686 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ VINNIE +++$+++ It's pretty crazy, don't you think? I mean, a smart guy like you. What do you want to hang on to a dead-end job like this for?
L514181 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years. Something like that.
L514180 +++$+++ u7686 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ VINNIE +++$+++ How long you been working for me, Auggie?
L514179 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ No problem, Vinnie. Everything's under control.  I could run this store in my sleep.
L514178 +++$+++ u7686 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ VINNIE +++$+++ Okay. I think everything's set.  You've got the number for Cape Cod, right? Just in case something goes wrong.
L514816 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ What difference does it make?
L514815 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Come on, come on, you yellow belly. The whole thing. First name and last name.
L514681 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ You're a dumb, whacked-out little fuck, do you know that?
L514680 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ To look at the dirty magazines. I can see all the naked women I want, and it doesn't cost me a cent.
L514679 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Your job? You've got five thousand bucks. What do you want a piece-of-shit job like that for?
L514678 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ So I can get my job back.
L514677 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ And why the hell would you give me money?
L514676 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ What do you care where it comes from? It's yours.
L514675 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Shit. I don't want your money, you little twerp.  It's probably stolen anyway.
L514674 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ No, it's five thousand dollars.
L514673 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ What is this, some kind of joke?
L514672 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Open it.
L514671 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ For me? And what am I supposed to do with a paper bag?
L514670 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ It's for you.
L514647 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ This way, gentlemen. Let's retire to my office, shall we?
L514646 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ A little. Not much.
L514640 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Sure thing. See you later.
L514639 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ I'll be back in about an hour. Watch the register while I'm gone, okay?
L514611 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Ten o'clock tomorrow morning. I'll be there.
L514610 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o'clock and we'll talk about it, okay? We'll see what we can work out.
L514609 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ A job?  I definitely wouldn't turn down a job.
L514604 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Good. Keep it up, and maybe one day you'll grow up and become a great man like me. 
L514603 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Definitely. I'd say you've hit the nail on the head.
L514602 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Seventeen? I remember when I was seventeen. Christ, I was one little whacked-out son-of-a-bitch when I was seventeen. Is that what you are, son? One little whacked-out crazy fella?
L514601 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Seventeen.
L514722 +++$+++ u7681 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I thought maybe he was pretending.
L514721 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Of course it hurts. What does it look like?
L514720 +++$+++ u7681 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Does it hurt?
L514714 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Jesus, man, you're one fucking mess.
L514713 +++$+++ u7681 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Sure, Auggie. I follow. When you don't know nothing, it's like paradise. I know what that is. It's after you're dead and you go up to heaven and sit with the angels.
L514712 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ ... If it happens, it happens. If it doesn't, it doesn't. Do you understand what I'm saying? You never know what's going to happen next, and the moment you think you know, that's the moment you don't know a goddamn thing. That's what we call a paradox. Are you following me?
L514390 +++$+++ u7681 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Okay, Auggie, I got it. You don't have to yell.
L514389 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ When I tell you it's open. It's open when I tell you it's open!
L514388 +++$+++ u7681 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Sure, Auggie, I got it.  The store's closed.  And when do I tell them it's open?
L514057 +++$+++ u7681 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I just do what you tell me, Auggie. You tell me to sweep, so I sweep.
L514056 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ That's how it is with sidewalks. People come, people go, and they all drop shit on the ground. As soon as you clean up one spot and move on to the next, the first spot is dirty again.
L514055 +++$+++ u7681 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Huh?
L514054 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ It'll never be finished.
L514053 +++$+++ u7681 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Good, Auggie. Real good.  All finished.
L514052 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ How'd you do out there, Jimmy?
L514079 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Damned if I know. But it has a nice ring to it, don't it?
L514078 +++$+++ u7689 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ What does that mean?
L514077 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Any time. And congratulations to you and your wife. Just remember, though, in the immortal words of Rudyard Kipling: "A woman is just a woman, but a cigar is a smoke.
L514076 +++$+++ u7689 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ Thanks for the tip.
L514075 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ It'll keep them fresh. If they get too dry, they'll break. And you don't want that to happen, do you?  Tobacco is a plant, and it needs the same loving care you'd give an orchid.
L514074 +++$+++ u7689 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ The refrigerator?
L514073 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ A good choice. You wouldn't want to celebrate the birth of your firstborn with a box of stinkers, would you? Remember to keep them in the refrigerator until you hand them out.
L514072 +++$+++ u7689 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ I think I'll take them. 
L514071 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Forty-four. They're on special this week from the Canary Islands. A real bargain.
L514070 +++$+++ u7689 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ And these?
L514069 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Fifty-six.  That girl had on a corset.
L514068 +++$+++ u7689 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ And these?
L514067 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Seventy-eight dollars. The girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties.
L514066 +++$+++ u7689 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ And how much are these?
L514065 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ They don't come cheap, son. These little honeys are works of art. Rolled by hand in a tropical climate, most likely by an eighteen year old girl in a thin cotton dress with no underwear on. Little beads of sweat forming in her naked cleavage. The smooth, delicate fingers nimbly turning out one masterpiece after another...
L514341 +++$+++ u7677 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ Henry told Cyrus he'd kill him if he ever showed his face around our house again. When Henry makes a threat like that, people tend to take him seriously.
L514340 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ And he's never tried to get in touch with his son?
L514339 +++$+++ u7677 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ No, I don't suppose it has. He was broken up like nobody's business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was dead.
L514338 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It can't have been easy on him. Walking around with that on his conscience all these years.
L514337 +++$+++ u7677 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ Jesus had nothing to do with it. If He'd been involved. He would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did.
L514336 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Jesus.
L514335 +++$+++ u7677 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ Don't put words in my mouth. What I'm saying is she drove off in Cyrus's car and went to the Five-Spot Lounge with him for a drink. What I'm saying is that he imbibed too much in the way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours later and got back in the car, he was in no shape to drive. But he drove the car anyway, and before he could get her back to where she lived, the damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck. Louisa got thrown through the windshield and was killed. Cyrus lived, but he came out of it a cripple. His left arm was so mangled, the doctors had to cut it off. Small punishment for what he did, if you ask me.
L514334 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind?
L514333 +++$+++ u7677 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ His father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born. Louisa was Henry's younger sister, and she and the baby moved in with us. Four or five years go by, and then one day Cyrus shows up out of the blue, tail between his legs, wanting to patch things up with Louisa. I thought Henry was going to tear Cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door. They're both big men, those two, and if they ever started to tangle, you'd see some teeth jumping on the floor. I guarantee it ... So Cyrus persuaded Louisa to go out with him to talk things over in quiet. And the poor girl never came back.
L514332 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Those are pretty hostile words.
L514331 +++$+++ u7677 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ And nothing. Thomas looked at me straight in the eye and said, "I don't have a father. As far as I'm concerned, that son-of-a-bitch is dead."
L514330 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ And?
L514329 +++$+++ u7677 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ I figured he had a right to know.
L514328 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ And you told your nephew about it?
L514327 +++$+++ u7677 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ Well, one thing I suppose, but I don't think it has anything to do with this.  A friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she'd spotted Thomas's father working at some gas station outside of Peekskill.
L514326 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Has anything happened lately? Anything unusual or unexpected?
L514325 +++$+++ u7677 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ No thank you.
L514324 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Do you want something to drink? A beer? A glass of water?
L514323 +++$+++ u7677 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ He's in trouble, all right. But I don't have any idea what it is.
L514322 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I was about to get run over by a car, and your nephew pulled me back. He saved my life.  I sensed he was in trouble, so I offered to put him up for a few days. Maybe I should have pressed him a little more, I don't know. I feel pretty stupid about it now.
L514321 +++$+++ u7677 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ Which brings me back to my original question. What was he doing here in the first place?
L514320 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I shouldn't have let him go.
L514319 +++$+++ u7677 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ His mother's dead, and he hasn't seen his father in twelve years.
L514318 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ And his parents?
L514317 +++$+++ u7677 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn.
L514316 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ He doesn't go to the Trinity School?
L514315 +++$+++ u7677 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ I always knew that boy had an imagination, but now he's gone and made up a whole new life for himself.  Do you mind if I sit down?  He's been living with me and his uncle Henry since he was a baby. And we don't live in Manhattan. We live in Boerum Hill. In the projects.
L514314 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ That's what he said. He told me he lived with his mother and father on East Seventy-fourth Street.
L514313 +++$+++ u7677 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents?
L514312 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ As far as I know, he went back to his parents.
L514311 +++$+++ u7677 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ I just want to know where he is.
L514310 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Look, lady, that's enough. If you don't calm down. I'm going to throw you out. Do you hear me? Right now!
L514309 +++$+++ u7677 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ And what was he doing here in the first place? That's what I want to know. What's a man like you messing around with a black boy like Thomas for? Are you some kind of pervert, or what?
L514308 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Well, whatever his name is, he's not here anymore. He left two days ago, and I haven't heard from him since.
L514307 +++$+++ u7677 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?
L514306 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You mean Rashid?
L514305 +++$+++ u7677 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole. My nephew.
L514304 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I'm telling you. I don't know anyone named Thomas.
L514303 +++$+++ u7677 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ Don't give me any of that. I know he's been here. You can't fool me, mister.
L514302 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Thomas? Who's Thomas?
L514301 +++$+++ u7677 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ I'm looking for my nephew,  Thomas.
L514300 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ The damn lock's broken again.  And so you just barge in on strangers, is that what you do? Is that your game?
L514299 +++$+++ u7677 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ What do you mean, how'd I get in? I pushed the door and walked in. What do you think?
L514298 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ How the hell did you get into the building?
L514297 +++$+++ u7677 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ I just want to know what your game is, mister, that's all.
L514296 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What can I do for you?
L514295 +++$+++ u7677 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUNT EM +++$+++ Is your name Paul Benjamin?
L514829 +++$+++ u7678 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ CYRUS +++$+++ You shut your mouth! You shut your mouth now!
L514828 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Louisa Vail. Remember her, Cyrus?
L514827 +++$+++ u7678 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ CYRUS +++$+++ I don't like this. I don't like it one bit.
L514822 +++$+++ u7678 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ CYRUS +++$+++ Are you making fun of me? I won't be mocked. Do you hear me? I won't let no punk kid stand there and mock me!
L514821 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Thomas Cole. My name is Thomas Jefferson Cole.
L514814 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Thomas.
L514813 +++$+++ u7678 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ CYRUS +++$+++ Paul. Rashid. Thomas. Which one is it?
L514812 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Thomas.
L514803 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ That's how we met. We're members of the International Same Name Club. Believe it or not, there are 846 Paul Benjamins in America. But only two in the New York metropolitan area. That's how Paul and I got to be such good friends. We're the only ones who show up at the meetings.
L514802 +++$+++ u7678 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ CYRUS +++$+++ Yeah, but he's my son. Nothing strange about that. He's my own flesh and blood. But here you got the same name as this man here, and you're not even the same color.
L514801 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Well, you and Junior have the same name, too, don't you?
L514800 +++$+++ u7678 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ CYRUS +++$+++ That's funny. His name is the same as yours.
L514442 +++$+++ u7678 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ CYRUS +++$+++ Say hi to Paul.
L514441 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Hi there, little brother.
L514440 +++$+++ u7678 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ CYRUS +++$+++ And this one, in case you haven't guessed, is Junior.
L514439 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ It's only temporary. On a freelance basis.
L514428 +++$+++ u7678 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ CYRUS +++$+++ That boy's one in a million. A real tiger.
L514427 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ You named the kid after yourself, huh?
L514426 +++$+++ u7678 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ CYRUS +++$+++ I don't know. I try. Every day I keep on trying, but it's no easy task for a man to change his nature.  I'm off the booze, though. Haven't had a drop in six years. And now I've got me a wife. Doreen. Best damned woman I've ever known.  And a little boy, too. Cyrus Junior.  So things have definitely improved since I got fitted with this hook. If I can just turn this goddamn garage around, I'll be in pretty good shape.
L514425 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ And have you mended them?
L514424 +++$+++ u7678 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ CYRUS +++$+++ An ugly piece of hardware, isn't it?  I'll tell you what happened to my arm.  I'll tell you what happened.  Twelve years ago, God looked down on me and said, "Cyrus, you're a bad, stupid, selfish man. First of all, I'm going to fill your body with spirits, and then I'm going to put you behind the wheel of a car, and then I'm going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you. But you, Cyrus, I'm going to let you live, because living is a lot worse than death. And just so you don't forget what you did to that poor girl, I'm going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook. If I wanted to, I could rip off both your arms and both your legs, but I'm going to be merciful and just take off your left arm. Every time you look at your hook, I want you to remember what a bad, stupid, selfish man you are. Let that be a lesson to you, Cyrus, a warning to mend your ways."
L514423 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ I don't mean to be nosy, but I was wondering what happened to your arm.
L514372 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Paul. Paul Benjamin.
L514371 +++$+++ u7678 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ CYRUS +++$+++ The name is Cyrus Cole.
L514370 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Five dollars an hour?  I'll take it.
L514369 +++$+++ u7678 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ CYRUS +++$+++ I'm afraid we'll be working on a strictly freelance basis.
L514368 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ You know, health insurance, dental plan, paid vacation. It's not fun being exploited. Workers have to stand up for their rights.
L514367 +++$+++ u7678 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ CYRUS +++$+++ Benefits?
L514366 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Is there a benefits package, or are you hiring me on a freelance basis?
L514365 +++$+++ u7678 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ CYRUS +++$+++ Five bucks an hour. That's the going rate, isn't it?  It's a quarter past two now. My wife's picking me up at five-thirty, so that'll give you about three hours. If you can't finish today, you can do the rest tomorrow.
L514364 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ What's your offer?
L514363 +++$+++ u7678 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ CYRUS +++$+++ I'll tell you what. You want to work. I'll give you a job. Nothing permanent, mind you, but that upstairs room over there  -- the one above the office -- is a hell of a mess. It looks like they've been throwing junk in there for twenty years, and it's time it got cleaned up.
L514362 +++$+++ u7678 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ CYRUS +++$+++ Yeah, well, do your thinking somewhere else, Michelangelo. I got work to do.
L514361 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ It was just a thought.
L514360 +++$+++ u7678 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ CYRUS +++$+++ Not a one. Not one customer all day. I bought this broken-down shit-hole of a place three weeks ago, and if business don't pick up soon, I'm going straight down the skids. What do I want to be hiring someone for? I can't even pay my own wages.
L514359 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Not a one.
L514358 +++$+++ u7678 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ CYRUS +++$+++ Do you have eyes in your head, or are those brown things bulging out of your sockets just marbles? You've been sitting here all day, and how many cars have you seen drive up and ask for gas?
L514357 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ I just tell it like it is, mister.  If I'm getting on your nerves, though, you might want to think about hiring me.
L514356 +++$+++ u7678 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ CYRUS +++$+++ Son-of-a-bitch. You're some piece of work, aren't you?
L514355 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Once you look at it, you're going to want to buy it from me. That's guaranteed. And that's the price: five bucks. So if you're not willing to spring for it, you might as well not bother to look. It'll just tear you up inside and make you miserable.
L514354 +++$+++ u7678 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ CYRUS +++$+++ Five bucks! You mean you're going to charge me five bucks just to look at it?
L514353 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ It'll cost you five bucks.
L514352 +++$+++ u7678 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ CYRUS +++$+++ It's rundown, all right. But drawing a picture won't improve the way it looks.  Let's see what you did, Rembrandt.
