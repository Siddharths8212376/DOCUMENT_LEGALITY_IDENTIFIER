L176650 +++$+++ u4958 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Can I give you one bit of advice? About Shari?
L176649 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah?
L176647 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ And all the kids stared calling me "Pumpkin Ass." "Hey Pumpkin Ass," -- for like a year. So, now, I feel like everyone's watching me and, you know, I'm "Pumpkin Ass" again.
L176646 +++$+++ u4958 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Uh-huh?
L176645 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I feel like when I was a kid and my mother sent me to school in orange corduroy pants.
L176644 +++$+++ u4958 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ How you doing, Ed?
L176643 +++$+++ u4958 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Good idea.  Could you all leave us alone for a few minutes?
L176642 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Could we just talk alone for a second? I --
L176641 +++$+++ u4958 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Yes, Ed.
L176281 +++$+++ u4958 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ I do.
L176280 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Don't say that. That's like... telling a guy before you have sex you'd better be good. You don't do that.
L176279 +++$+++ u4958 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ I bet my career on you. You'd better be good.
L176278 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No, uh...
L176277 +++$+++ u4958 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Now look. Don't freeze up on me. I picked you because you had kind of a relaxed, go-with-the-flow quality. You're not going to lose that, are you?
L176276 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Um, yeah -- thanks.
L176275 +++$+++ u4958 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ That has my work number, my home number, my pager number. I sleep three hours a night. Call me whenever you want to talk. Off the air, on the air, whenever. Okay?
L176274 +++$+++ u4958 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ I want you to take this.
L176273 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Cool.
L176272 +++$+++ u4958 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Okay, so you understand? We're installing a permanent camera in your bedroom, one in the kitchen, one in the living room, plus, of course, there'll always be a couple of steady-cams following you.
L176271 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Excuse me.
L176270 +++$+++ u4958 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Ed, can I see you a second.
L176183 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Oh, see, studying would've been a huge help. Where were you, then?
L176182 +++$+++ u4958 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ What did you study?
L177336 +++$+++ u4958 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ I've got this great idea. We put together a video. "The Network Executives Goofiest Moments." And listen, i've really loved working here.
L177335 +++$+++ u4971 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SCHARLACH +++$+++ Where are you going?
L177113 +++$+++ u4971 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SCHARLACH +++$+++ Cynthia, I think you're laboring under a misconception. You seem to believe that because you happened to predict this, we should be impressed. We're not. Anybody in any business can predict failure. 1 need people who prevent failure. I want to see this thing turned back in the right direction. Remember this was your baby.
L177112 +++$+++ u4958 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Isn't this getting kind of pathetic. I mean we drank the juice, now we're just licking peel. Let it go!
L177061 +++$+++ u4958 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Good luck.
L177060 +++$+++ u4971 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SCHARLACH +++$+++ With all due respect, Cynthia you're nuts. I'm giving him another month!
L177059 +++$+++ u4958 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ I'm telling you, it's peaked. Ed TV is an over-inflated balloon. Get it off before it explodes all over us.
L177058 +++$+++ u4971 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SCHARLACH +++$+++ What are you talking about? He's fine. He's out of the hospital already. The ratings are higher than ever.
L177057 +++$+++ u4958 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Take him off the air.
L176195 +++$+++ u4971 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SCHARLACH +++$+++ I'm not sure about the entire concept.
L176194 +++$+++ u4958 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable.
L176193 +++$+++ u4971 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ SCHARLACH +++$+++ This guy.
L176192 +++$+++ u4958 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ He's who we want to go with.
L177180 +++$+++ u4959 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ DR. GELLER +++$+++ No.  The deceased is ... Henry Pekurny.
L177179 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Al!
L177178 +++$+++ u4959 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ DR. GELLER +++$+++ Who?
L177177 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I thought -- I thought he was dead.
L177170 +++$+++ u4959 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ DR. GELLER +++$+++ I ... don't know. I ...
L177169 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Hotel? What were they doing in a hotel?
L177168 +++$+++ u4959 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ DR. GELLER +++$+++ According to your mother. When the paramedics got to the hotel, she told them that --
L177167 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Really? They were..
L177166 +++$+++ u4959 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ DR. GELLER +++$+++ Very quick. Between you and me, it's not a bad way to go. Making love to your wife... it's very sweet.
L177165 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What about him -- did he suffer any or was it quick? I'd hate to think he...
L177164 +++$+++ u4959 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ DR. GELLER +++$+++ 
L177163 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Mm...  Oh, man...
L177162 +++$+++ u4959 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ DR. GELLER +++$+++ Just wait here. She's coming right back out.
L177161 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Thank you. Can I see her?
L177160 +++$+++ u4959 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ DR. GELLER +++$+++ I'm Dr. Geller. Your mother is just lying down for a few minutes. we gave her something to calm her down.
L177159 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yes?
L177158 +++$+++ u4959 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ DR. GELLER +++$+++ Mr. Pekurny.
L177144 +++$+++ u4965 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Oh.
L177143 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ So he killed himself.
L177142 +++$+++ u4965 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Right.
L177141 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ And then, uh... you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again.
L177140 +++$+++ u4965 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Right, right...
L177139 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah, a thing. He became a big hero. He was on TV and there was a parade and a movie about him
L177138 +++$+++ u4965 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Oh right, right! She fell down, like a...
L177137 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No! Like, ten years ago. In Texas. Baby...  Jessica!
L177136 +++$+++ u4965 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ When? Today?
L177135 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You know about that fireman who rescued that little girl?
L176790 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What?
L176789 +++$+++ u4965 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ No! Don't --  Oh, wow.
L176788 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah.  Honey, if you're watching this is for you.
L176787 +++$+++ u4965 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Oh -- so I'm just, what -- a poor substitute?
L176786 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Aah, I wanted Shari to come.
L176785 +++$+++ u4965 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Yeah. You did good. What's wrong?
L176784 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Hey, if it's free, it's me.  You ready?
L176128 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah, what - they put some schmuck on TV all day long or something?
L176127 +++$+++ u4965 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Oh, that thing. Yeah. Did you hear about this?
L176107 +++$+++ u4965 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Your brother's here.
L176106 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ So do I. So what? I'm doing all right.
L176105 +++$+++ u4965 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "If you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." And I'm laughing and then I realize I wear a nametag.
L176104 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I'm gonna stick this right in your eye.
L176103 +++$+++ u4965 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ We're the guys who clean up after the parade.
L176102 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Tell me.
L176101 +++$+++ u4965 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You know who we are?
L176100 +++$+++ u4965 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ We're falling behind.
L176099 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You said that.
L176098 +++$+++ u4965 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Look at this -- people are getting married, they're getting married...
L176097 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What?
L177250 +++$+++ u4963 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JEANETTE +++$+++ I'm a whore!  Your bathrooms are filthy!
L177249 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ And how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home.
L177248 +++$+++ u4963 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JEANETTE +++$+++ I'm a tramp  Meet your new father. The whole nation is laughing at us!
L177247 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Ma...
L177246 +++$+++ u4963 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JEANETTE +++$+++ Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore!
L177245 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You're famous. Somebody called me. What are you doing in a place like this?
L177244 +++$+++ u4963 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JEANETTE +++$+++ Ed! How did you know I was here?
L177211 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Well, he's the only one in America who doesn't!
L177210 +++$+++ u4963 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JEANETTE +++$+++ Don't tell Al. He doesn't know.
L177208 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Apparently, neither can Hank. What the hell did you do to him?
L177207 +++$+++ u4963 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JEANETTE +++$+++ Do you think it's been easy for me? It's been years. Al can't have sex.
L177206 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ But Al is your husband now!
L177205 +++$+++ u4963 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JEANETTE +++$+++ One thing led to another. He was my husband once.
L177204 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Why? How...
L177203 +++$+++ u4963 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JEANETTE +++$+++ Oh my god! On TV!
L177202 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yes. He assumed Hank was your husband. He didn't know.
L177201 +++$+++ u4963 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JEANETTE +++$+++ To you? In front of him?  With the...
L177200 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ The doctor said you were having sex.
L177199 +++$+++ u4963 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JEANETTE +++$+++ What?
L177198 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ So you had sex with him?
L177197 +++$+++ u4963 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JEANETTE +++$+++ Hank! He said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged -- he cried. So I went to this horrible hotel he was staying in... I felt so sorry for him --
L177196 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Who?
L177195 +++$+++ u4963 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JEANETTE +++$+++ It was horrible. He called me up.
L177194 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What happened?
L177153 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I'm coming right over. I'll be right there.
L177152 +++$+++ u4963 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JEANETTE +++$+++ St. Joseph's.
L177151 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Oh God. What hospital?
L177150 +++$+++ u4963 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JEANETTE +++$+++ He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart.
L177149 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What's the matter?!
L177148 +++$+++ u4963 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JEANETTE +++$+++ I'm at the hospital.
L177147 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Mom?
L177146 +++$+++ u4963 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JEANETTE +++$+++ Eddie...
L176886 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What do you think. I mean about... him. Should I just... have nothing to do with him? I mean...
L176885 +++$+++ u4963 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JEANETTE +++$+++ Hank! All of a sudden. Because now you're famous and he can get something from you. I don't wan you to become a victim like Marcia.  Not that you're a victim, honey. You're not. Life's just been a little hard on you, sweetie.
L176884 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Who?
L176883 +++$+++ u4963 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JEANETTE +++$+++ And what did he come back now for?
L176882 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ If I don't call you "Dad" it' just because... 1 was already a big boy when you came into our lives --  or when I thought you came into our lives --
L176879 +++$+++ u4963 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JEANETTE +++$+++ He had a woman in my own bed! And how dare you call him "Dad" in front of Al.  This is your father. This is who was there for you when you needed someone.
L176878 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Oh my God. You and Al were - and that's why you threw him out.
L176874 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ The difference is for twenty years I thought one thing and now it's another thing.
L176873 +++$+++ u4963 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JEANETTE +++$+++ What's the difference?
L176872 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ So does Grandma. So does Shaquille O'Neal. You told me you had a hysterectomy and he ran off with your nurse.
L176871 +++$+++ u4963 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JEANETTE +++$+++ She had white shoes.
L176870 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Could've been a nurse?
L176869 +++$+++ u4963 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JEANETTE +++$+++ She could've been a nurse.
L176868 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ But what was that whole story about him and a nurse?
L176867 +++$+++ u4963 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JEANETTE +++$+++ He... apologized, he begged me. He can be very... charming when it suits his purpose.
L176866 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Chicken pox? I was six. He didn't leave 'til I was twelve.
L176865 +++$+++ u4963 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JEANETTE +++$+++ All right -- do you want to know the truth? I took you and Marcia and Ray to my sister's on the train for the weekend and you all got chicken pox. So I took you home a day early and there was your father with a woman in our bed. Okay?
L176857 +++$+++ u4963 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JEANETTE +++$+++ I don't care what he says. Look, I don't need to relive this. On television!
L176856 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ He says --
L176855 +++$+++ u4963 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JEANETTE +++$+++ He had girlfriends!
L176853 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Holy sh--
L176852 +++$+++ u4963 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JEANETTE +++$+++ Both.
L176851 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yes to me or yes to the coil?
L176850 +++$+++ u4963 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JEANETTE +++$+++ Yes.
L176842 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ So everything he told me yesterday was a lie. Everything.
L176841 +++$+++ u4963 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JEANETTE +++$+++ I told you the facts! He abandoned us -- those are the facts.
L176839 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I'm not! I'm just trying to get some facts.
L176838 +++$+++ u4963 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JEANETTE +++$+++ I can't believe you're taking his side.
L176590 +++$+++ u4963 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JEANETTE +++$+++ Oh my God!!
L176589 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I mean, that worked out.
L176588 +++$+++ u4963 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JEANETTE +++$+++ Oh my God!
L176587 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You and Al lived together a few months before you got married -- after Dad left.
L176586 +++$+++ u4963 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JEANETTE +++$+++ Mm.
L176585 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Well, who knows? Maybe she finally picked a winner this time.
L176584 +++$+++ u4963 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JEANETTE +++$+++ I don't know. She's living with that "entertainer"...
L176583 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ How's Marcia? She all right?
L176582 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No! I -- All right, look, if you hear from Ray.... tell him to call me, okay?
L176581 +++$+++ u4963 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JEANETTE +++$+++ I know you. This Shari is a passing fancy.
L176577 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No! And that girl has a name.
L176576 +++$+++ u4963 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JEANETTE +++$+++ No. Maybe he's watching.  Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you'11 stay away from that girl.
L176575 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I don't want to -- do you know where he is?
L176574 +++$+++ u4963 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JEANETTE +++$+++ He made a mistake.
L176573 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Hey, he cheated on her.
L176572 +++$+++ u4963 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JEANETTE +++$+++ Eddie, how could you do it? Your brother's girlfriend.
L176571 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Ma, do you know where Ray is? I've been calling him and I'm getting his machine and --
L176569 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Look, Ma, come on out. Really. I need to talk to you.
L176568 +++$+++ u4963 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JEANETTE +++$+++ No. It's a mess.
L176567 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Do you want us to come in the kitchen?
L176566 +++$+++ u4963 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JEANETTE +++$+++ No.
L176565 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Send him? Ma, I can't. it's -- just come out here. Please, I --
L176564 +++$+++ u4963 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JEANETTE +++$+++ Send him away.
L176563 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah. The camera guy is here.
L176562 +++$+++ u4963 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JEANETTE +++$+++ Are the TV people with you?
L176561 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah?
L176560 +++$+++ u4963 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ JEANETTE +++$+++ Eddie? ...
L176977 +++$+++ u4970 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ She wouldn't tell me.
L176976 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I'm sorry. Where'd they send her?
L176975 +++$+++ u4970 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ She left. She moved. She got Fed-Ex to give her a transfer and she left. She couldn't stand it anymore. We had people, news people, regular people, just sleeping in our hallway, going through our mail, our garbage. I mean it was she couldn't take it anymore. Now I've got to move. I can't afford this place by myself.
L176974 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L176973 +++$+++ u4970 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ She won't.
L176972 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Well, when will she be back?
L176971 +++$+++ u4970 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ She left.
L176970 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What is she, at work?
L176969 +++$+++ u4970 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ No.
L176968 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Hi. Is Shari here?
L176493 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Shari, Ray feels --
L176492 +++$+++ u4970 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ Hi, Mom. 
L176484 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No, I understand. That's - where is she, is she all right?
L176483 +++$+++ u4970 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ She really doesn't want you and the camera in here right now.
L176482 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Right, yeah --
L176126 +++$+++ u4970 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ Everybody's making audition tapes for that Real TV thing.
L176125 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What's going on over there?
L177294 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ All right. Let them decide.
L177293 +++$+++ u4968 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ MR. SCHARLACH +++$+++ Not too good. That's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you're in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses. Ed, I urge you to reconsider. I urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours. Play fair with them, Ed.
L177292 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Look, if you don't let me out of this... I'11 just... I'11 just sit in my apartment all day. I won't go anywhere, I won't do anything. What kind of show will that be?
L177291 +++$+++ u4968 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ MR. SCHARLACH +++$+++ Well, no. You agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to. The station entered into this on that understanding. If you had refused we'd have begun this with somebody else. You can't just change the rules in the middle of the game, son. It's not fair to us. More importantly, it's not fair to the viewers. They're interested in you. They've devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you.
L177290 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I can't?
L177288 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ All right, I'11 pay for the parking. Big network!
L177287 +++$+++ u4968 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ MR. SCHARLACH +++$+++ Well, Ed, that's ... not really possible.
L176737 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I can imagine. You said you wanted nothing to do with this. You swore to me. "Don't come near me. Don't bring this into my life..."
L176736 +++$+++ u4967 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ MARCIA +++$+++ Ed, he needs a break. You don't know what kind of bad luck he's had --
L176735 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Oh! Oh -- okay, now I get it. It's "Star Search." You wanted me here because the camera comes with me.
L176732 +++$+++ u4960 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Hm? I'm, uh... Why isn't this drunken woman you?
L176731 +++$+++ u4967 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ MARCIA +++$+++ What are you doing?
L176242 +++$+++ u4967 +++$+++ m330 +++$+++ MARCIA +++$+++ Our foibles, our foibles!
