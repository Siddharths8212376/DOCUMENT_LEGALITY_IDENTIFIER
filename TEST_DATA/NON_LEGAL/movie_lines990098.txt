L362553 +++$+++ u6446 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ ...oh Jesus, what the fuck...?
L362552 +++$+++ u6449 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ I said I'm fine.
L362551 +++$+++ u6446 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Stand up.
L362550 +++$+++ u6449 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ I didn't I'm fine, I'm fine.
L362547 +++$+++ u6449 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ I don't know.
L362546 +++$+++ u6446 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Bullshit.  Bullshit. You know the answer to every goddamn question and I knew the answer to those questions and I'm not half as smart as you are so What Happened?
L362545 +++$+++ u6449 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ I didn't know the answer --
L362544 +++$+++ u6446 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Why didn't you answer those questions?
L362543 +++$+++ u6449 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ I'm fine. nothing.
L362542 +++$+++ u6446 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ What's the problem, what's the problem here?
L361937 +++$+++ u6449 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ See you.
L361936 +++$+++ u6446 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Go to it, handsome.
L361928 +++$+++ u6449 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ Sure.
L361927 +++$+++ u6446 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ You ready to keep winning?

L361535 +++$+++ u6449 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ Should be one-thirty.
L361534 +++$+++ u6446 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Be ready at two --
L361532 +++$+++ u6449 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ I can't carry all of them. I need them. I need my books. I need them to go to school.
L361531 +++$+++ u6446 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Why the hell do you need all four bags of books to go to school each day?
L361530 +++$+++ u6449 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ I need this one.
L361529 +++$+++ u6446 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Cmon,cmon,cmon, that one to?

L363026 +++$+++ u6451 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ WORM +++$+++ What the fuck is goin' on, WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?
L363025 +++$+++ u6449 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ This happens....this is something that happens.
L363024 +++$+++ u6451 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ WORM +++$+++ ....what the fuck, what the fuck....
L363023 +++$+++ u6449 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ It's raining frogs from the sky.
L363022 +++$+++ u6451 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ WORM +++$+++ ...fuck you mean, it's raining frogs?
L363021 +++$+++ u6449 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ It's frogs.  It's raining frogs.
L363020 +++$+++ u6451 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ WORM +++$+++ What is that?
L363008 +++$+++ u6449 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ I can take you to get money.  I don't need it...I don't <u>need</u> it -- listen to me: I can let you have money so your father won't hit you ever again -- you'll have the money because I don't need it.
L363007 +++$+++ u6451 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ WORM +++$+++ No.  No.  I have to do this on my own.
L363006 +++$+++ u6449 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ I have money to give you.
L363005 +++$+++ u6451 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ WORM +++$+++ ...what...?
L363004 +++$+++ u6449 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ I have money.
L363003 +++$+++ u6451 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ WORM +++$+++ I'm sorry to put all this on you, Stanley --
L363002 +++$+++ u6451 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ WORM +++$+++ I hate it.
L363001 +++$+++ u6449 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ It's not right.
L363000 +++$+++ u6451 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ WORM +++$+++ Cause he hates me....he hates me so much.
L362999 +++$+++ u6449 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ ....Why does he do it...?
L362998 +++$+++ u6451 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ WORM +++$+++ You know what it's like to come home scared, scared that maybe if you don't have the money you're supposed to go out each day and get that you're gonna get beaten....by a belt...he hits me with a belt, Stanley....  I'm supposed to sell those candy bars, and if I don't, I come home without the money....
L362997 +++$+++ u6449 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ Yes.
L362996 +++$+++ u6451 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ WORM +++$+++ ....you have it...easy....you know? You have a father who loves you, huh?
L362954 +++$+++ u6449 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ It's ok.
L362953 +++$+++ u6451 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ WORM +++$+++ ..sorry...
L362952 +++$+++ u6449 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ Hi.
L362951 +++$+++ u6451 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ WORM +++$+++ Hi.
L362922 +++$+++ u6449 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ It's ok.
L362921 +++$+++ u6451 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ WORM +++$+++ ..sorry...
L362920 +++$+++ u6449 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ Hi.
L362919 +++$+++ u6451 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ WORM +++$+++ Hi.
L367823 +++$+++ u6456 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ D'ARTAGNAN +++$+++ Anne... The night we had together... I always wanted more.  But that one, it was enough.  Enough to make me love you forever.  I want you to remember that... and go on.  As strong as you are now.  No matter what happens.
L367822 +++$+++ u6453 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry.
L367821 +++$+++ u6456 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ D'ARTAGNAN +++$+++ There were two.  Not one.  But two.
L367763 +++$+++ u6453 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ We have much to discuss.  Tomorrow.
L367762 +++$+++ u6456 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ D'ARTAGNAN +++$+++ I have never seen a sight more beautiful than you, tonight.
L367761 +++$+++ u6453 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ D'Artagnan.
L367760 +++$+++ u6456 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ D'ARTAGNAN +++$+++ My Queen...
L367512 +++$+++ u6453 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Then we will both die traitors, d'Artagnan.
L367511 +++$+++ u6456 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ D'ARTAGNAN +++$+++ Anne...!  I know... I know that to love you is treason against France. But not to love you... is treason against my heart.
L367509 +++$+++ u6453 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Nothing... Nothing.
L367508 +++$+++ u6456 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ D'ARTAGNAN +++$+++ I can't bear to see you cry.  What is wrong?
L367507 +++$+++ u6453 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
L367506 +++$+++ u6456 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ D'ARTAGNAN +++$+++ M'lady... if anyone sees, it is death...
L367504 +++$+++ u6453 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ No, stay back!  Stay back!
L367503 +++$+++ u6456 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ D'ARTAGNAN +++$+++ What -- ?
L367502 +++$+++ u6456 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ D'ARTAGNAN +++$+++ M'lady...?
L367501 +++$+++ u6453 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Oh God I -- Forgive me...
L367200 +++$+++ u6453 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ That is good.
L367199 +++$+++ u6456 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ D'ARTAGNAN +++$+++ No, M'lady.
L367198 +++$+++ u6453 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ And you were not hurt?
L367197 +++$+++ u6456 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ D'ARTAGNAN +++$+++ God smiled upon us.
L367196 +++$+++ u6453 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ I understand you saved my son's life today.
L367195 +++$+++ u6456 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ D'ARTAGNAN +++$+++ M'lady...?
L367817 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Wear it until you love it.  And die in it!!
L367816 +++$+++ u6453 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ No, Louis!  No!
L367815 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ D'Artagnan, you will hunt down Aramis, Porthos and Athos, and bring me their heads, or I will have yours.  And as for you, Phillippe... Back to the prison you shall go, and into the mask you hate.
L367805 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ He is nothing now.
L367804 +++$+++ u6453 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ He is your brother!
L367803 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ What had you to do with this, Mother?
L367802 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ My guards are useless!  Take her from me!
L367801 +++$+++ u6453 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Louis, please -- !
L367704 +++$+++ u6453 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Yes.  Dead.  Two nights ago.  The night of my dream.
L367703 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ It -- it doesn't matter, Mother!  He is dead now!  Dead!
L367701 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You have prayed too much.  Your mind is weak.
L367700 +++$+++ u6453 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Because I have dreamed of him.  Not as the baby they took away, but as a man.
L367699 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Why would you ask now?  You never asked before!
L367698 +++$+++ u6453 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ He was my blood -- and I demand to know what happened to him.
L367697 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I am King, Mother!  And I do not wish to discuss this with you.
L367696 +++$+++ u6453 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.
L367695 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ He is dead!  By God's choice!  There is nothing to discuss.
L367694 +++$+++ u6453 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ I wish to discuss your brother.
L367693 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ What is it, mother?
L367692 +++$+++ u6453 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ We haven't visited in three years. And we should have privacy.
L367691 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I am preparing for a ball!
L367690 +++$+++ u6453 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ May I speak with you?  Alone?
L367689 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Mother -- ?
L367782 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ Shut up, knave!
L367781 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ D'Artagnan, arrest them all!
L367736 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Phillippe?!  Why do you call me --
L367735 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ Don't look so shocked, Phillippe. Come, you're going back to prison.
L367734 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Wh-- Wha--
L367306 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You bring me the heart of the Jesuit General, and you will have a palace of your own.
L367305 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ I grow closer to my target, your Majesty.
L367304 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ How goes that favor I asked of you?
L367303 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ Your Majesty...
L367138 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Once a Musketeer, always a Musketeer, eh?
L367137 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ If I find out the identity of this Jesuit rebel.  I will kill both him and the man who told me.
L367136 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the Jesuits is. You are now a priest, but you were once a Musketeer, serving the throne of France, a throne ordained of God. Can you accept this mission, and keep it private?
L367135 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ How can I serve you in this?
L367134 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I have demanded it -- and common priests present themselves!  Can you imagine the arrogance?  Common Jesuit priests try to act as my equals, and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order!  No one can keep secrets like the Jesuits can, and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold.  Even the Pope himself does not know who leads the Jesuit Order in France!  He suspects the Governor General of Jesuits, whoever he is, is angling to become Pope himself.
L367133 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ Well... perhaps you should speak with them, your Majesty.
L367132 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Next week.  This is a mere garden party -- and I wish to join it, so I will be brief.  I am experiencing resistance from the Jesuits.
L367131 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ Your birthday celebration, your Majesty?
L367848 +++$+++ u6455 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ATHOS +++$+++ To the Bastille.  And death.
L367847 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ Then to the Bastille.
L367843 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ Perhaps he serves a different king.
L367842 +++$+++ u6455 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ATHOS +++$+++ So what has changed?
L367841 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ Perhaps.  But of d'Artagnan I am certain.  What he did tonight was what he told us all along he would do -- be faithful to his King.
L367840 +++$+++ u6455 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ATHOS +++$+++ You're a fool!
L367839 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ He seeks redemption.
L367833 +++$+++ u6455 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ATHOS +++$+++ We can't... stay here.  That traitor d'Artagnan... knows about this place.
L367832 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ Bloody hell...
L367712 +++$+++ u6455 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ATHOS +++$+++ Hold your goblet with two fingers.
L367711 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ Remember, Phillippe... nobility is born in the heart.
L367668 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ It presses us but it is good for us too!  Louis' whims make him more vulnerable.  We are less ready, but so are his guards!
L367667 +++$+++ u6455 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ATHOS +++$+++ But --
L367666 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that.  If we miss him now we may not get another chance.
L367665 +++$+++ u6455 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ATHOS +++$+++ Aramis, this will never --
L367620 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ You said you'd do anything, Athos, anything to replace this King.  So do it.
L367619 +++$+++ u6455 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ATHOS +++$+++ But --
L367618 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ I offer you the perfect revolution. A revolution without bloodshed, without any loss of life, even without treason, for he too is the son of the King.
L367617 +++$+++ u6455 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ATHOS +++$+++ What you're asking is impossible!
L367616 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ He can learn to be Phillippe in time.  But first he must learn to be Louis, and for that he has two more days.
L367615 +++$+++ u6455 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ATHOS +++$+++ But Aramis -- !  Phillippe can learn in time, but --
L367614 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ Paris.  There is still much to do. We'll be back soon.  Be ready.
L367613 +++$+++ u6455 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ATHOS +++$+++ Where are you going?!
L367608 +++$+++ u6455 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ATHOS +++$+++ All I noticed was that Phillippe feels even more like an animal.
L367607 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ The mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected.  Do you notice?
L367606 +++$+++ u6455 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ATHOS +++$+++ Poor Phillippe!
L367597 +++$+++ u6455 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ATHOS +++$+++ But -- but --
L367596 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ Come now, Athos, if Porthos is determined to end his life, then he will certainly manage to find the opportunity.
L367595 +++$+++ u6455 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ATHOS +++$+++ We must stop him!
L367594 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ He's threatened to do it, it's been building up in him for months.
L367593 +++$+++ u6455 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ATHOS +++$+++ Hang himself?!
L367592 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ About to hang himself, I should think.
L367591 +++$+++ u6455 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ATHOS +++$+++ But -- what is he doing?
L367590 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ Now.  You were saying?
L367589 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ Going into the barn naked -- or so it appears.
L367588 +++$+++ u6455 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ATHOS +++$+++ But -- what is Porthos doing?
L367587 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ Go on.
L367586 +++$+++ u6455 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ATHOS +++$+++ Don't play God with me, Aramis I --
L367585 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ You grow fond of him.  That's good.
L367584 +++$+++ u6455 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ATHOS +++$+++ Phillippe -- he's very bright, he's perceptive, but he is in such turmoil --
L367580 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ The King is having a ball, a masquerade ball.  It is the perfect opportunity and perhaps our only one.  At any time Phillippe could be discovered, and what then?  Remember France.  Remember the poor. Remember Raoul.  More wine!!  Where are those serving girls...?
L367579 +++$+++ u6455 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ATHOS +++$+++ Three days??!!
L367578 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ Three days.
L367577 +++$+++ u6455 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ATHOS +++$+++ In a year, maybe two, I could teach him enough to --
L367576 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ You can do it.
L367575 +++$+++ u6455 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ATHOS +++$+++ You must reconsider this plan. Phillippe is like a child, he --
L367574 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ More wine!!
L367573 +++$+++ u6455 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ATHOS +++$+++ Resting, he's had a long day. Aramis --
L367572 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ How is he?
L367555 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ Yes, and he has a choice!
L367554 +++$+++ u6455 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ATHOS +++$+++ It is not just our lives you risk with this conceit of yours!  It is Phillippe's as well!
L367553 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ Do you think I have not considered that?  I have a plan -- and you may rest assured that it is brilliant!
L367552 +++$+++ u6455 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ATHOS +++$+++ And people close to him, who --
L367551 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ Those can be adopted --
L367550 +++$+++ u6455 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ATHOS +++$+++ Physical resemblance is but one small thing!  Louis has an arrogance, a manner --
L367549 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ I have it all worked out.
L367548 +++$+++ u6455 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ATHOS +++$+++ Switch?!  That is your plan?  It is ludicrous!
L367497 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ There is that, of course -- but mainly it is because I am so much smarter than everyone else.
L367496 +++$+++ u6455 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ATHOS +++$+++ Then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son.  What gives you the right to judge me, to play God with the lives of others?  Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?!
L367495 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ Those are the words of a broken spirit.  My spirit is whole.  I have trusted d'Artagnan with my deepest secrets, and I will never believe he is my enemy.
L367494 +++$+++ u6455 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ATHOS +++$+++ He who is not with us is against us.
L367493 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ You are bitter, Athos.  You are torn by grief, not only for Raoul, but for d'Artagnan, whom you love, and now treat as an enemy.
L367492 +++$+++ u6455 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ATHOS +++$+++ You are not my priest, Aramis!  You would not be, even if I had one.
L367491 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ You seek facts, when it would be better to seek truth.
L367490 +++$+++ u6455 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ATHOS +++$+++ Tonight!  Right now!  We steal a man from a royal prison, we hide in a country chateau among an assortment of saints and sluts such as only you could provide, and still you wish to tell me nothing?!
L367489 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ Tomorrow.
L367488 +++$+++ u6455 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ATHOS +++$+++ Who is he, Aramis?
L367465 +++$+++ u6455 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ATHOS +++$+++ His plight is obvious, isn't it?
L367464 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ Excellent, Athos.  You have a keen sense of this man.
L367463 +++$+++ u6455 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ATHOS +++$+++ Prison was horrible but it was his home.  He's been torn from it by strangers.  He's frightened, exhausted -- and the mask is familiar.  Let him rest in it tonight, and remove it tomorrow.
L367427 +++$+++ u6455 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ATHOS +++$+++ I see that is a body!  But where did you get it?
L367426 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ A body.
L367425 +++$+++ u6455 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ATHOS +++$+++ What is that?
L367424 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ Come, we have a boat waiting.
L367423 +++$+++ u6455 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ATHOS +++$+++ The Prison of Belle Sur.
L367422 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ Soon enough.  Here we are.
L367421 +++$+++ u6455 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ATHOS +++$+++ Porthos sleeps, and you plot.  Don't you think it's time you told me what it is you are plotting?
L367419 +++$+++ u6454 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ARAMIS +++$+++ Making the key to the throne.
L367418 +++$+++ u6455 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ ATHOS +++$+++ What are they doing?
