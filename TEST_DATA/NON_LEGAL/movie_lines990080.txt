L354141 +++$+++ u6348 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PRISCILLA +++$+++ So where does that put us?
L353967 +++$+++ u6330 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ She's pulled herself out of a pretty rough neighborhood.
L353966 +++$+++ u6348 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PRISCILLA +++$+++ But I'm the one in charge of her sorry ass.
L353965 +++$+++ u6330 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ Hey--she's in a tough situation. I cut her some slack--
L353964 +++$+++ u6348 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PRISCILLA +++$+++ You spoil 'em, Cliff.
L353956 +++$+++ u6330 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ He'll probably be getting a medical discharge--
L353955 +++$+++ u6348 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PRISCILLA +++$+++ He'll be transferred to a military hospital as soon as he's stabilized--
L354155 +++$+++ u6330 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ Sheriff Deeds was in on our archeological find yesterday.
L354154 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Pleased to meet you.
L354153 +++$+++ u6330 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ Sheriff--hi--this is Sergeant--this is Priscilla Worth.
L353686 +++$+++ u6330 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ Old bullets.  He uhm-- makes art with them.
L353685 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Treasure hunter?
L353684 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Masons been around a long while.
L353683 +++$+++ u6330 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ That ring--
L353682 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I've got the forensics fella coming down from the Rangers. No way to know how old the body is without some lab work.
L353681 +++$+++ u6330 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CLIFF +++$+++ This was a rifle range way back when. But we figured it isn't Army land anymore, it's your jurisdiction.
L353680 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I was driving back from Apache Wells when they got me on the radio.
L354140 +++$+++ u6331 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CODY +++$+++ Old Sam stood for somethin', you know? The day that man died they broke the goddamn mold.
L354139 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Yeah. I bet he would.
L354138 +++$+++ u6331 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CODY +++$+++ --but just as a kind of safety tip.
L354137 +++$+++ u6331 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CODY +++$+++ --warning. Not 'cause he had it in for the colored
L354135 +++$+++ u6331 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CODY +++$+++ Take that pair over in the corner--
L354134 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors, you be out of a job.
L354133 +++$+++ u6331 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CODY +++$+++ You joke about it, Sam, but we are in a state of crisis. The lines of demarcation has gotten fuzzy--to run a sucessfull civilization you got to have lines of demarcation between right and wrong, between this one and that one--your Daddy understood that. He was like the whatchacallit-- the referee for this damn menudo we got down here. He understood how most people don't want their sugar and salt in the same jar.
L354132 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Good deal you were born down here, then.
L354131 +++$+++ u6331 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CODY +++$+++ --but I gotta say I think there's something to this cold climate business. I mean, you go to the beach- what do you do? Drink a few beers, wait for a fish to flop up on the sand. Can't build no civilization that way. You got a hard winter coming, though, you got to plan ahead, and that gives your cerebral cortex a workout.
L354130 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ If the next guy's a redneck.
L354129 +++$+++ u6331 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ CODY +++$+++ Now I'm just as liberal as the next guy--
L353871 +++$+++ u6341 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ Appreciate it, sir.
L353870 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ I sprint the last quarter mile. You gentlemen don't have to keep up if you don't care to.
L353866 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ I meant on the post. In general. How are you dealing with it?
L353865 +++$+++ u6341 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ Well, yeah, but I went through the Program. I haven't had a drink since--
L353864 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Substance abuse?
L353863 +++$+++ u6341 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ You know how it is, Colonel--first time away from home, dealing with new people--I remember my first hitch--
L353858 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Have we had trouble there before?
L353857 +++$+++ u6341 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ There's not that much down here, Colonel. Big O's is the only place in the county that our African American soldiers are uhm--that they feel comfortable in.
L354197 +++$+++ u6344 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ Because I'm your father.
L354196 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Why would you want to do that?
L354195 +++$+++ u6344 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ I gonna meet that family of yours?
L354194 +++$+++ u6344 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ A lot of 'em choose both. There's not like a borderline between the good people and the bad people--you're not either on one side or the other--
L354193 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ And people make their choice--
L354192 +++$+++ u6344 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ Over the years, this is the one place that's always been there. I loan a little money out, settle some arguments. Got a cot in the back- people get afraid to go home they can spend the night. There's not enough of us to run anything in this town- the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the Mexicans hire each other. There's the Holiness Church and there's Big O's place.
L354191 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ I hear things, too.  People call you the Mayor of Darktown.
L354190 +++$+++ u6344 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ Right.
L354189 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ The Army hands you a command, you go wherever it is.
L354188 +++$+++ u6344 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ I been hearing rumors about this new commander coming for a couple weeks now. Boys say they heard he's a real hard case. Spit-and-polish man. Full- bird colonel name of Payne, they say-- Bet you never figured you end up back here.
L354187 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ That's right.
L354186 +++$+++ u6344 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call.
L354185 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
L354184 +++$+++ u6344 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ Your boys out there cooped up together, need somewhere they can let the steam out. If they're Black, there's not but one place in this town they feel welcome. Been that way since before you were born.
L354183 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ I assume a lot of your business is from our people.
L354182 +++$+++ u6344 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ This is an official visit, then--
L354181 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ So tell me why I shouldn't make this place off-limits.
L354180 +++$+++ u6344 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ So.
L354178 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Nice to meet you, Ma'am.
L354177 +++$+++ u6344 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ This here's Carolyn. Honey, this is my son, Delmore.
L354176 +++$+++ u6344 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ If I thought it would help I'd put up a sign telling them not to. Right under the one about the employees washing their hands.
L354175 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Deal drugs in the bathroom--
L354174 +++$+++ u6344 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ It's a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out--
L354173 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ You get much of that in here?
L354172 +++$+++ u6344 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ That's where he fell.
L354171 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ That where he was shot?
L354170 +++$+++ u6344 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ Hobby of mine. Got some artifacts, couple pieces one of your men out at the base made. Free admission.
L354169 +++$+++ u6332 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Black Seminoles?
L354463 +++$+++ u6353 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Just a shotgun, huh? Better let me take a look at that.
L354462 +++$+++ u6333 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ ELADIO +++$+++ Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--
L354461 +++$+++ u6353 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't lie to me now.

L354458 +++$+++ u6353 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Bandidos, Injuns--
L354457 +++$+++ u6333 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ ELADIO +++$+++ Reputation?

L354454 +++$+++ u6353 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ This same person been bragging all over the county how he don't have to cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it-- he can run his own operation 'thout any help. Como se llama, amigo?
L354453 +++$+++ u6333 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ ELADIO +++$+++ I haven't seen anybody doing that.

L354744 +++$+++ u6334 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ ENRIQUE +++$+++ No es la verdad--[That isn't true--]
L354743 +++$+++ u6340 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ MERCEDES +++$+++ You think you're doing these people a favor? What are they going to do? Either they get on welfare or they become criminals--
L354742 +++$+++ u6334 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ ENRIQUE +++$+++ No! No puede hacer esto--[You can't do that--]

L354163 +++$+++ u6334 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ ENRIQUE +++$+++ Es muy lindo, su coche--
L353781 +++$+++ u6337 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ --but Buddy Deeds was my salvation.
L353780 +++$+++ u6335 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ FENTON +++$+++ Your mother was a saint.
L353772 +++$+++ u6337 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ We made our collection at Roderick's place and that was the last anybody seen hide nor hair of him.  He went missing the next day, along with ten thousand dollars in county funds from the safe at the jail.
L353771 +++$+++ u6335 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ FENTON +++$+++ Charley Wade were known to have put a good number of people in the ground, and your daddy gets eyeball to eyeball with him.
L353770 +++$+++ u6335 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ FENTON +++$+++ That Buddy was a cool breeze.
L353769 +++$+++ u6337 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ "Mas cerveza por favor."
L353742 +++$+++ u6337 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ And the Sheriff at the time was Big Charley Wade. Charley was one of your old-fashioned bribe-or-bullets kind of Sheriffs, he took a healthy bite out of whatever moved through this county.
L353741 +++$+++ u6335 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ FENTON +++$+++ '57, 1 believe--
L353740 +++$+++ u6337 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ The two of us were the only deputies back then me and Buddy--it's what-- '58--
L353737 +++$+++ u6337 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ Hell, everybody heard that story a million times.
L353736 +++$+++ u6335 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ FENTON +++$+++ Tell that one, Hollis--
L353733 +++$+++ u6337 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ That's not the whole story. The Mexicans that know, that remember, understand what Buddy was for their people.  Hell, it was Mercedes over there who swung the deciding vote for him.
L353732 +++$+++ u6335 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ FENTON +++$+++ They just wanted it to be one of theirs--
L353726 +++$+++ u6335 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ FENTON +++$+++ Bad enough all the street names are in Spanish--
L353725 +++$+++ u6337 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ King wasn't Mexican, Fenton--
L353724 +++$+++ u6335 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ FENTON +++$+++ Every other damn thing in the country is called after Martin Luther King, they can't let our side have one measly park?
L353721 +++$+++ u6335 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ FENTON +++$+++ Better late than never. Korean War hero, Sheriff for near thirty years-- Buddy Deeds Memorial P--
L353720 +++$+++ u6337 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ Big day coming up--I wish we'd have thought of it while he was still living. But he went so unexpected.
L353718 +++$+++ u6335 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ FENTON +++$+++ He was a unique individual.
L353717 +++$+++ u6337 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ Sam! I was just telling a few about your old man.
L353714 +++$+++ u6337 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ He known who it was onnacouna the tire tracks in the dirt from the back of the garage to where they loaded up. "Old Fishbait," he says, "never lifted a thing in this world if there was a way he could roll it."
L353713 +++$+++ u6335 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ FENTON +++$+++ Buddy Deeds. He had a way.
L353712 +++$+++ u6337 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ "Fishbait," says Buddy, in that quiet way of his, "What you know about them tires that went missing from markets?" Fishbait thinks for a minute, then he lifts up a loose board from the porch floor and calls down into it, "C'mon out, Pooter, they caught us!"
L354227 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ When you backed me you needed somebody named Deeds to bump the other fella out of office.  Hey, folks--
L354226 +++$+++ u6336 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ H.L. +++$+++ When we backed you--
L354223 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ We need a drug rehab program, we need a new elementary school--
L354222 +++$+++ u6336 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ H.L. +++$+++ Dammit, Sam, the people are concerned about crime--
L354219 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ We're already renting cells to the Feds for their overflow--
L354218 +++$+++ u6336 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ H.L. +++$+++ That's a matter of interpretation--
L354217 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ We don't need a new jail.
L354216 +++$+++ u6336 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ H.L. +++$+++ Which is why we need to talk to you about the new jail--just so we're all on the same page.
L354211 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Rather have that than the ten-foot- high catfish statue--
L354210 +++$+++ u6336 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ H.L. +++$+++ That kind of talk doesn't help, Sam.
L354205 +++$+++ u6336 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ H.L. +++$+++ Jorge and his Chamber of Commerce boys got to keep things hummin'--
L354204 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Seems like we have another one every week.
L354203 +++$+++ u6336 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ H.L. +++$+++ Historic occasion, isn't it?
L354816 +++$+++ u6337 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ Word gets out who that body was, people are gonna think Buddy done it.
L354815 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Don't think the Rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have.
L354812 +++$+++ u6337 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ Widow's benefits. He figured it would make the disappearance look better, and that Mexican gal was just scrapin' by after Charley killed her man. They didn't get hooked up till late--
L354811 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ And the ten thousand?
L354810 +++$+++ u6337 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ The three of us cleaned up and took him to the post and put him under. Can't say I was much help.
L354805 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Buddy Deeds was a murderer.
L354804 +++$+++ u6337 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ Buddy Deeds--
L354803 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Yeah, and my mother was a saint. For fifteen years the whole damn town knew he had another woman on the side. Stole ten thousand dollars to set her up in business. But hell, what's that? You got a problem? Buddy'll fix it. Facing some time in jail? Buddy'll knock half of it off-- if you do what he says, when he says. You got some business that's not exactly legal? Talk to Buddy--
L354802 +++$+++ u6337 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ Your father had the finest sense of justice of any man I ever met--
L354801 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Imonna find out one way or the other.
L354796 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Open late.
L354795 +++$+++ u6337 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ Hey, Sam.
L354794 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Fellas.
L354578 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I got to go see somebody in San Antonio today. Your memory gets any better, I'll be back tonight.
L354577 +++$+++ u6337 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ You lived in the man's house what-- seventeen, eighteen years? And you didn't get to know him any better than that?
L354576 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I think somewhere between Roderick Bledsoe's club and his house, Wade ran into Buddy Deeds. I think Buddy put a bullet in him, waited for him to die, threw him in the trunk of the Sheriff's car and drove him out by the Army post, I think he buried him under four feet of sand and never looked back.
L354575 +++$+++ u6337 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ Do you?
L354574 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I got an idea what happened.
L354573 +++$+++ u6337 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ I wish I could tell you I remembered something new, but I can't.
L354572 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Charley Wade.
L354571 +++$+++ u6337 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ We have a murder?
L354570 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You thought any more about our murder?
L354569 +++$+++ u6337 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ Sam! Quite a do the other day. It meant a lot to folks that you said something.
L354568 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Morning, Hollis.
L353939 +++$+++ u6337 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ And I understand why you might want to think he could.
L353938 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ People have worked this whole big thing up around my father. If it's built on a crime, they deserve to know. Now I understand why you might want to believe he couldn't do it.
L353937 +++$+++ u6337 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ We got that dedication tomorrow. This is a hell of a time to be draggin' up old business.
L353936 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ And Buddy was one of them.
L353935 +++$+++ u6337 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ There's no call for that, Sam. Fella made himself a pile of enemies over the years.
L353934 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Besides my father, I mean.
L353933 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Forensics people are sure of it. You have any idea who might have put him there?
L353932 +++$+++ u6337 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ No. I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though.  You think it's Charley Wade, huh?
L353931 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ He still living?
L353930 +++$+++ u6337 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O--
L353929 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Bledso
L353928 +++$+++ u6337 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ I told the story enough times--hell, we were just in the car, he was stewing about the fight with Buddy while we drove over to Roderick Bledsoe's--
L353927 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You don't remember anything else from that last night you saw him, do you?
L353926 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ All it was wearing was a big old Masonic ring and a Rio County Sheriffs badge.
L353925 +++$+++ u6337 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ Charley? I believe he was. Used to go for lodge meetings over to Laredo. What's he got to do with your body?
L353924 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?
L353923 +++$+++ u6337 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?
L353922 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ We found a body out by the Army base yesterday. Been there for a long time.
