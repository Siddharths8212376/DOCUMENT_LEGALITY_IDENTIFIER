L242301 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN +++$+++ You'll think about my offer?
L242300 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ I'm sure it is.
L242299 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN +++$+++ I've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began.  And that's quite verifiable.
L242298 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ You promise Wickwire a fast ticket, too?
L242297 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN +++$+++ I once promised you a fast ticket, Jordan, and I always meant to make good on that.  Come work for me.  I can always use a hard-charger on my team.
L242294 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ I wanted the choice.  The chance to prove myself, my skills, my work, me.  That's how it should've been.
L242293 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN +++$+++ The reality is this:  We send far too many men off to war.  I don't need to compound the problem with women.  Can you honestly tell me you wanted that life?  Squat-pissing in some third-world jungle with --
L242292 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ So the rhetoric gets you headlines. But the reality gets you in trouble.
L242291 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN +++$+++ Jordan.  I don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory.
L242290 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ You were never going to let women serve in combat.  You always had a safety net.  Or thought you did.
L242289 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN +++$+++ I'm saying it's not going to happen. Not when the President is set to turn this into a third-rail issue should I choose to ever campaign against him.  He will fry me six ways to Sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war -- and, quite possibly, for bringing them back in body bags.
L242288 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ What are you saying?  That a women's life is more valuable than a man's? That a women's death hurts a family more?
L242287 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN +++$+++ In face, I do:  Roper, Harris, Gallop -- they all come back the same.
L242286 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ You don't know that.
L242285 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN +++$+++ What he did was light the bandwagon on fire.  Because he knows what I know -- that American families are not prepared to put their daughters in harm's way.
L242284 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ So?  Isn't the President jumping on your bandwagon?
L242281 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ If I have to ask again, Senator, I'll be asking in front of cameras.
L242280 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN +++$+++ Should probably ask him that.
L242279 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ What changed?
L242278 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN +++$+++ Wickwire was there to help.  To be my eyes on the inside, to make sure you were getting a fair shot.  At least that was the intent.
L242277 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN +++$+++ Absolutely not.
L242276 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Did you set me up?  Did you set me up just to see me fail?
L242275 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN +++$+++ Jordan.  Might we do this over lunch tomorrow?  I do very much want to talk, but now is scarcely --
L242274 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ It should.  You nominated him for Spec-Recon just three days after you nominated me.
L242273 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN +++$+++ Sounds familiar.
L242272 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ You know him.
L242271 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.
L242270 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN +++$+++ Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that --
L241885 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN +++$+++ Gonna be visiting that all-woman's America's cup team in a few weeks -- If I were a gambler, I'd say Dennis O'Conner's days are numbered.  But they're in San Diego, so I thought I'd take a quick promenade of the base.
L241884 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Uh, ma'am.
L241883 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN +++$+++ Hmmm.  Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person.
L241882 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Can't complain, ma'am.
L241636 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN +++$+++ There'll be more to follow -- but yes, dear, right now you're the pick of a very large litter.  And your success would mean a lot.  Jumping, now...
L241635 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Would I be the only one?  The only woman?
L241634 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN +++$+++ Yes, dear.
L241633 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Uh, question, ma'am.
L241632 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN +++$+++ My office will fill him in and help expedite.  Look forward to meeting you at the proper time.  Jumping off now...
L241631 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Captain Dwyer.  Technically.
L241630 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN +++$+++ This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat.  Or, actually, its official non-policy.  Now who's your immediate superior there?
L241629 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ I know that, sir.  Ma'am.  It's just that... Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but... do you understand that this involves combat training?
L241628 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN +++$+++ California.
L241627 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ "Coronado."
L241625 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN +++$+++ High-school pentathlete... ROTC scholarship, graduated with honors... top marks in Basic Training... and, as it just so happens, a constituent of my home state of Virginia.  Oh, the things I'll do for one extra vote.
L241624 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Thank you, ma'am.  Um, may I ask what this is regarding?
L241623 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN +++$+++ So everyone I talk to says you're top drawer with silk stockings inside.
L242167 +++$+++ u1014 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ HAYES +++$+++ "G.I. Jane."  And which one of you told me she wouldn't last a week? Huh?
L242166 +++$+++ u1012 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ FLAG OFFICER #1 +++$+++ I think it's more important, sir, to decide what we're going to do -- since it's apparent this issue is not going away quietly.
L242165 +++$+++ u1014 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ HAYES +++$+++ What the hell is the President trying to do?  Steal DeHaven's thunder?
L241593 +++$+++ u1012 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ FLAG OFFICER #1 +++$+++ Doesn't matter who she picks.  No woman is going to last one week in a commando training course.  And I don't care who it is.
L241592 +++$+++ u1014 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ HAYES +++$+++ Then I suggest we start there.
L241591 +++$+++ u1012 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ FLAG OFFICER #1 +++$+++ I'd go Special Reconnaissance. Every bit as tough -- and we have a 60 percent drop-out rate among the men.
L241590 +++$+++ u1014 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ HAYES +++$+++ So she picks the women, we pick the programs.  Seals?
L242360 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Spotted you, Chief.  Pri One is to slip you some air, so we're coming down with a tank -- just something until the A-team shows.  Over.
L242359 +++$+++ u1013 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ FLEA +++$+++ Six o'clock!  Marking, marking!
L242337 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Flea, 'Cool, Cortez, Newman -- take your minis, hit the water.  Go, GO!
L242336 +++$+++ u1013 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ FLEA +++$+++ Close as I can get, el-tee!
L242051 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Fuck.  Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction. Stand by for a PRC fix...
L242050 +++$+++ u1013 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ FLEA +++$+++ Really don't wanna be captured, el- tee.  Heard some bad things.
L241832 +++$+++ u1013 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ FLEA +++$+++ 'Snot me.  It's him.
L241831 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Hey.  You okay, Flea?
L241828 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Do that.
L241827 +++$+++ u1013 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ FLEA +++$+++ I'll work on it, ma'am.
L241826 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Well, Flea, I appreciate the respect you just showed me.  But I don't need it and don't want it -- not that kind of respect, anyway.  It's just gonna hurt us both, okay?
L241825 +++$+++ u1013 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ FLEA +++$+++ No, ma'am.
L241824 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?
L241823 +++$+++ u1013 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ FLEA +++$+++ It's really "F. Lee Montgomery" -- but that gets whittled down to just "Flea."  For short, ma'am.
L241822 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Montgomery, why do they call you "Flea"?
L242184 +++$+++ u1015 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ INSTRUCTOR JOHNS +++$+++ You're wanted at the C.O.'s.
L242183 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Sir?
L242182 +++$+++ u1015 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ INSTRUCTOR JOHNS +++$+++ O'Neil?
L241821 +++$+++ u1015 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ INSTRUCTOR JOHNS +++$+++ Flea!  O'Neil!  Why is there a break in that line?
L241820 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Come on, Montgomery...
L241819 +++$+++ u1015 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ INSTRUCTOR JOHNS +++$+++ If you can't feel the other guy's pecker, you ain't in tight enough! I want nuts to butts!
L241818 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Just do it, okay?
L241760 +++$+++ u1015 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ INSTRUCTOR JOHNS +++$+++ ... two... one... MARK!
L241759 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ I can make this wall without --
L241758 +++$+++ u1015 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ INSTRUCTOR JOHNS +++$+++ Don't have to use it, O'Neil, but it's gotta go out.  Five... four... three...
L242156 +++$+++ u1021 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE CHIEF +++$+++ I think you probably would -- if you didn't know I was right.
L242155 +++$+++ u1016 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ INSTRUCTOR PYRO +++$+++ I oughtta report you.
L242154 +++$+++ u1021 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE CHIEF +++$+++ Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing, that real lives are gonna be lost.  Maybe mine, maybe yours.
L242153 +++$+++ u1016 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ INSTRUCTOR PYRO +++$+++ She's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback.
L242152 +++$+++ u1021 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE CHIEF +++$+++ She's an officer.  There's a higher standard.
L242151 +++$+++ u1016 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ INSTRUCTOR PYRO +++$+++ She's a trainee, just like the others.  Why are you coming down so hard?
L242150 +++$+++ u1021 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE CHIEF +++$+++ I've had it.  Just because they pay me like a baby-sitter doesn't mean I'm gonna be one.
L242149 +++$+++ u1016 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ INSTRUCTOR PYRO +++$+++ You broke a dozen training rules back there -- before I lost count.
L242148 +++$+++ u1021 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE CHIEF +++$+++ You don't think she'd be raped if she were captured?  You don't think the threat of rape would be used to leverage the men?
L241898 +++$+++ u1016 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ INSTRUCTOR PYRO +++$+++ Get it up!
L241897 +++$+++ u1021 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE CHIEF +++$+++ Boat Five -- Wickwire, Cozad, Vinyl, Intagliata, Ayers, and Wise. Lieutenant Wickwire is your senior officer.  Follow his orders to your death.
L241858 +++$+++ u1021 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE CHIEF +++$+++ Every class has its surprises, Pyro. This one'll be no different.
L241857 +++$+++ u1016 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ INSTRUCTOR PYRO +++$+++ Miller.  Thought the guy was made of depleted uranium.  Really didn't expect to lose him.
L241830 +++$+++ u1021 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ THE CHIEF +++$+++ Check your watch, Pyro.  Seems fast.
L241829 +++$+++ u1016 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ INSTRUCTOR PYRO +++$+++ Time.
L242394 +++$+++ u1016 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ INSTRUCTOR PYRO +++$+++ Maybe it's not my place to speculate on his private thoughts.  But I think the Chief knew that his way -- his world -- had come and gone.
L242393 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Just a coincidence?
L242392 +++$+++ u1016 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ INSTRUCTOR PYRO +++$+++ The Chief was granted early retirement as of 17-hundred yesterday.  By 18-hundred he was gone.  Out of the Navy.
L242391 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ I was looking for him earlier, but...
L242390 +++$+++ u1016 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ INSTRUCTOR PYRO +++$+++ I believe he earned it for saving a man's life in Saudi Arabia.  He wanted you to have it.  He was very clear on that point.
L242389 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ The Navy Cross...
L241771 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ What "all females"?  If I'm the only --
L241770 +++$+++ u1016 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ INSTRUCTOR PYRO +++$+++ Automatic five-second deduction, which slips you under the wire. It's called "gender-norming," O'Neil -- standard procedure for all females in physical training courses.  Where you been the last few years?
L241724 +++$+++ u1016 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ INSTRUCTOR PYRO +++$+++ You'll try what we tell you to try, O'Neil.  Go regulation.
L241723 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ I'll try anyway, sir.
L241722 +++$+++ u1016 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ INSTRUCTOR PYRO +++$+++ Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.
L241721 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Thank you, sir.  But I like these just fine.
L242401 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ "Yes, Jordan -- I'll wait for you no matter how long."
L242400 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Which is guy-speak for...
L242399 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ Look.  It's not like you'd be completely out of reach.  And maybe we could call in a few favors, get you stationed at Norfolk instead of Coronado.  There are ways of dealing with these things -- I mean, if people are so inclined.
L242398 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ So here we are again.  Staring three years of operational duty in the face.
L242240 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Yeah.  Me too.
L242239 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ I'd sure like to know who.
L242238 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ You don't crap out of Spec-Recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country.  He's got a Sea Daddy somewhere.
L242237 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ "Wickwire, Thomas Dane"... Second run at Coronado... and correct, they had him stashed in the "Appropriation Liaison Office," whatever that is.
L242236 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Wickwire said he was dry-docked in Washington between stints at Coronado...
L242235 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ What?
L242234 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ "In Washington..."
L242232 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ Well, pardon me if I do.  Now who else?  Who could've leveraged a class officer like that?  C'mon, Jordan, keep your head in the game.
L242231 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ I don't know, I don't care.
L242230 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ Or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the Navy.
L242229 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Sounds like an amazing coincidence.
L242228 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Instructors typically pull three year assignments.  This guy's in and out in one year -- your year.  That sound right?
L242227 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ What about him.
L242226 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ "John James Urgayle."  The Chief.
L242225 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ Well, before you crawl off to die, Jordan, give me five minutes of good headwork.
L242224 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ I'm tired of fighting back.  I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
L242223 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
L242222 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ It's done with, Royce.  Let it go.
L242221 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ C'mon, Jordan.  Do the headwork with me.
L242218 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ The Chief?  Or maybe even Turrentine?  Your C.O.?
L242217 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ No shortage of suspects.
L242216 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ Almost like someone put him up to it.  Okay, who?
L242215 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Maybe.  Though it didn't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it.  Almost like...  Did I say he was class officer?
L242214 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ And this class officer... "Wickwire."  You think he was just trying to get even?  Striking back for...
L242213 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ All I wanted was an honest chance. And If I couldn't get it, I couldn't stay.
L242005 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Sure.  I'll join the crowd.
L242004 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ Jordan.  You watch your ass.
L242003 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Still can't make up your mind, huh? Gotta go, Royce.
L242002 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ That's not what I want, Jordan.  I mean... it is and it isn't...
L242001 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Well, let me warm you:  I'm going though with this.  The more everybody fucks with me, fucks with my head, the more it just makes me want to finish.  So don't expect me back crying in your arms any time soon, okay?
L242000 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ I'm only trying to warn you in case --
L241999 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ You know, Royce, I got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets, too.
L241998 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you.
L241997 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ So why are you telling me this?
L241996 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ I can't walk two blocks in Washington without hearing about "G.I. Jane."  You're all over the place, and whether you wanted it or not, the feminists are sizing you up for that poster.
L241995 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ I saw an article...
L241994 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?
L241993 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Me?  Why me?
L241992 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ Well, not this.  I was doing the Pentagon scene few nights ago.  Got some fresh stuff -- about you.  You may be in a hostile camp.  I think someone may be taking steps to ensure that you crash and burn.
L241991 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ I feel like there's men here, there's women here -- then there's men.  But hey, what'd I expect?
L241990 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ That bad?
L241989 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ How hard they making it on you?
L241988 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ It's hard to find time to sleep, Royce.  Much less keep up with my phone life.
L241987 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ I've been trying you for five days. Don't they give you messages?
L241660 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Thank you, Royce.  It was shaping up like such a tough call -- and then you go and make it so goddamn easy. Really, thank you so much.
L241659 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ Jordan...
L241658 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ You know, right up until you said that -- I thought I did know.
L241657 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you.
L241656 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Which is guy-speak for...
L241655 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ I don't feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life, Jordan.  Maybe we should just let it happen.
L241654 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Wai', wait.  What happens if it works?  Four months of training, three years of operational duty. What then?
L241653 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ I'll try to keep the door open.  If you wash out, I make it so that --
L241652 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Sorry.  But after our days...  So if I try this thing... if I ship out to Coronado... what happens here?
L241651 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ You're such a ball-breaker sometimes.  Especially at night.
L241650 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Get your dick back here.  It has everything to do with you.
L241649 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ Well, guess I don't even need to be here...
L241648 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ This has nothing to do with you.
L241647 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ So dump on me.
L241646 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ You need operational duty to really advance... you need combat training to go operational... yet combat training is off-limits to people with tits.  I'm topped out at Intel. Forget the glass ceiling -- I'm beating my head on a big brass ceiling.
L241645 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ She's haze grey and underway...
L241644 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Royce.  We're the same age, we started the same time -- and now you're sitting in the upperdecks while I'm still down in the bullpen. What does that tell you about the Navy?
L241643 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ Well, you're doin' shit-hot at Intel.
L241642 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ I take it you don't either.  Feet.
L241641 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ Spec-Recon.  Those guys are world- class warriors.  And they will not want you there, Jordan.
L241640 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Just like you would be.
L241639 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ So why're you even considering it? Are you?
L241619 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Is this my glory, sir?
L241618 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ By the way, I'll need that option paper by 11-hundred today so I can review it with Admiral Hanover.  And do we have any of that breakfast tea around here?
L241617 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ Intel has its own glory, lieutenant -- no matter how subtle.
L241616 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Hate this part.  Just sweating it out on the sidelines.
L241615 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ Probably hear back from CNN first.
L241614 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Thank you, sir.  We hear back from the Pentagon?
L241613 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ That was good headwork, lieutenant.
L241610 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Only four minutes to neutral waters, sir.  Why not?
L241609 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ You expect the extraction team to ride the sub bare-back?  Is that correct, O'Neil?
L241608 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Quick-hit technique used by Capone. Rigged a getaway car with running boards and handles.  All his guys had to do was jump on and take a ride.  Check the files -- DPRK-57 -- I doped it out as a contingency plan:  Seal Team infiltrates, picks up the package, links up with recovery sub.  But don't waste time opening and closing hatches.  They just grab the periscope and hang on for neutral waters.
L241607 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ Blank faces here, O'Neil.
L241606 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Unless you Whiskey Run.
L241605 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ Halfway 'round the world.  So that's the problem -- we can get the team in, just not out.
L241604 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ North Korean beaches are the best protected, most heavily monitored in the world.  The civilian population is so propagandized that it acts as an Early Warning system.  Extraction team has to be small and silent -- I'd go with Seals over Delta Force. Problem is, don't want to hold a conventional sub off-shore for target practice.  Where's The Polk?
L241603 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ You're the analyst for East China, O'Neil.  Analyze.
L241602 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Chances of recovery?
L241601 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ Signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries.
L241600 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Do we know it's him using the beacon?  Not a decoy?
L241596 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Not due in for 22 minutes, sir. Watcha got?
L241595 +++$+++ u1019 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ ROYCE +++$+++ Gotta situation here.  Where are you?  Stuck in traffic?
L241594 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Lieutenant O'Neil.
L242191 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ This is insane.  You've got no proof.
L242190 +++$+++ u1023 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ WICKWIRE +++$+++ I'm sorry, O'Neil.  But as class officer, it's my obligation to report all violations.
L242180 +++$+++ u1023 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ WICKWIRE +++$+++ Okay.  Well... thought I'd ask.
L242179 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ We're going over to her place to make salad and pasta.  Just, you know, nothing special.
L242178 +++$+++ u1023 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ WICKWIRE +++$+++ Sure, sure.
