L353921 +++$+++ u6337 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ Just as well. The new people just painted it some God-awful color--
L353920 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ No.
L353919 +++$+++ u6337 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ You go by your old house?
L353918 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I haven't been out here for a while.
L353917 +++$+++ u6337 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ Sounds great. Where do I sign up?
L353916 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Floating around out here, playin' hell with them bass--play a little cards, play a little golf, drink some beer--
L353915 +++$+++ u6337 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ Sam! Hey podner! You caught me playing hooky--
L353914 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I always wondered what you Mayors do when you're not cutting ribbons.
L353779 +++$+++ u6337 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ Look, I know you had some problems with your father, and he and Muriel-- well--
L353778 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Right.
L353777 +++$+++ u6337 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ Oh--he come to an accommodation. Money doesn't always need to change hands to keep the wheels turning.
L353774 +++$+++ u6337 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ Not a peep. Buddy run the man out of town.
L353773 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Never heard from him again?
L353735 +++$+++ u6337 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ She put it even at three to three, so as the Mayor I get to cast the tiebreaker. The older generation won't have any problem with it. They remember how Buddy come to be Sheriff, that it was all 'cause he took their part.
L353734 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ That so?
L353731 +++$+++ u6337 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ Right. But nobody here ever noticed him till they read his name on the national news--
L353730 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ --Santiago.
L353729 +++$+++ u6337 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ There was a faction pulling for that boy who was killed in the Gulf War-- Ruben--
L353723 +++$+++ u6337 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ HOLLIS +++$+++ Oh, you know, the usual troublemakers. Danny Padilla from the Sentinel, that crowd.
L353722 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I heard there was a bit of a fuss.
L354225 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Look, I'm not gonna campaign against your deal here, but if anybody asks me, I got to tell them the truth. We-- don't--need--a new jail.
L354224 +++$+++ u6338 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ There isn't money allocated for that. But a jail--
L354221 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ It wouldn't happen to be your construction company gonna get the bid on building this thing, would it, H.L. And Jorge, you wouldn't be thinking about a couple dozen new jobs to dangle in front of the voters--
L354220 +++$+++ u6338 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ There was a mandate in the last election--
L354215 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Danny's gonna be out for blood the next time.
L354214 +++$+++ u6338 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ He agreed it wasn't exactly news--
L354213 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ The Perdido thing?
L354212 +++$+++ u6338 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ I got Eddie Richter at the Sentinel to kill that story.
L354209 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You ought to put up a banner-- "Frontera, Texas: Gateway to Cut- Rate Pussy"--
L354208 +++$+++ u6338 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ Sam--
L354207 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ People come here to catch bass and to get laid at the Boy's Town in Cuidad Leon--
L354206 +++$+++ u6338 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ We're building up tourism, Sam--
L354510 +++$+++ u6339 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ MARISOL +++$+++ You told me one time it was true love.
L354509 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ I'm unmarried. I'm not available.
L354508 +++$+++ u6339 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ MARISOL +++$+++ The old-high-school-heartthrob Sheriff. I thought you were crazy about each other. He's available, you're available--
L354507 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ The Sheriff.
L354506 +++$+++ u6339 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ MARISOL +++$+++ How 'bout the Sheriff?
L354505 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ All my mother does is work. That's how you get to be Spanish.
L354504 +++$+++ u6339 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ MARISOL +++$+++ You got to be interested in somebody. All you do is work.
L354503 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ Sure, they go back to Cortez. When he rode by, they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner.
L354502 +++$+++ u6339 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ MARISOL +++$+++ Your mother's family is Spanish?
L354501 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ Spanish, please. My mother would have a heart attack.
L354500 +++$+++ u6339 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ MARISOL +++$+++ Steve. Board of Education Steve who likes you? He goes for us hot-blooded Mexican girls, I can tell.
L354499 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ Steve?
L354498 +++$+++ u6339 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ MARISOL +++$+++ Steve called for you.
L354124 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ "That boy"--Mami, say his name for chrissakes!
L354123 +++$+++ u6340 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ MERCEDES +++$+++ I never said that. It was just that boy--
L354122 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--
L354121 +++$+++ u6340 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ MERCEDES +++$+++ I felt that you could do better for yourself--
L354120 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody.
L354119 +++$+++ u6340 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ MERCEDES +++$+++ I never said that.
L354118 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ Mami, the first time I brought him home, those were your exact words-- "some chulo with grease under his nails."
L354117 +++$+++ u6340 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ MERCEDES +++$+++ I don't mean Fernando.
L354116 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ Thank you.
L354115 +++$+++ u6340 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ MERCEDES +++$+++ Maybe now. It was different back then. I had this place, I was doing all the shopping, all the cooking. What do I need some chulo with grease under his nails to drink up the profit?
L354114 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ Nobody's too busy.
L354113 +++$+++ u6340 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ MERCEDES +++$+++ I was too busy.
L354112 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ There must have been somebody.
L354111 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ How come you never got married again?
L354110 +++$+++ u6340 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ MERCEDES +++$+++ A little older than Paloma is now.
L354109 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ Right. When he was killed.
L354108 +++$+++ u6340 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ MERCEDES +++$+++ He was killed.
L354107 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ Mami, how old were you when my father--
L354106 +++$+++ u6340 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ MERCEDES +++$+++ You want to see Mexicans, open your eyes and look around you. We're up to our ears in them.
L354105 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ Oh, come on--you must be curious how it's changed. Amado is into this big Tejano roots thing and I've never been further than Ciudad Leon--
L354104 +++$+++ u6340 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ MERCEDES +++$+++ Why would I want to go there?
L354103 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ No. I was wondering if you'd like to take a trip down south with us. Maybe see where you grew up--
L354102 +++$+++ u6340 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ MERCEDES +++$+++ Did you come here to tell me how to run my business?
L354101 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ If you spent a little more time training them--
L354100 +++$+++ u6340 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ MERCEDES +++$+++ Nobody is illegal in my cafe! They've got green cards, they've got relatives who were born here--if they only had a little common sense I'd be very happy.
L354099 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ Well, you hire illegals--
L354098 +++$+++ u6340 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ MERCEDES +++$+++ If they're going to survive here, they have to know how to work, Elalco! Adelante! Los clientes esperan!
L354097 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ Maybe you're just getting less patient.
L354096 +++$+++ u6340 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ MERCEDES +++$+++ These ones coming up are getting stupider every year.
L353991 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Do you remember the last time you saw him?
L353990 +++$+++ u6342 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ MINNIE +++$+++ Not if they was colored or Meskin. Not if they wanted to keep breathin'.
L353989 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ People didn't complain?
L353988 +++$+++ u6342 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ MINNIE +++$+++ Sheriff Buddy was a different story. Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. That Sheriff Wade, though, he took an awful big bite.
L353987 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ And my father?
L353986 +++$+++ u6342 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ MINNIE +++$+++ Wasn't legal to sell liquor in a glass back then unless you was a club, see. Roderick used to say, "Buy yourself a drink, you get a free membership." But Sheriff Wade, he could shut you down anytime.
L353985 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ He squeezed money out of you?
L353984 +++$+++ u6342 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ MINNIE +++$+++ Them days, you deal with Sheriff Wade or you didn't deal at all. First of the month, every month, he remind you of who you really workin' for.
L353983 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You had to deal with him in running the club.
L353982 +++$+++ u6342 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ MINNIE +++$+++ Not if I can help it.
L353981 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ So you must remember Sheriff Wade.
L353980 +++$+++ u6342 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ MINNIE +++$+++ We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.
L353979 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ He had the club out on the old trail road--
L353978 +++$+++ u6342 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ MINNIE +++$+++ I won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away.
L353977 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband? Roderick?
L353976 +++$+++ u6342 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ MINNIE +++$+++ Well, don't ever start up on 'em, cause once you do you can't stop. I tell myself I'm gonna play just three little games after breakfast, and here I sit with half the day gone.
L353975 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I've seen 'em.
L353974 +++$+++ u6342 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ MINNIE +++$+++ You ever play one of these?
L353973 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Yeah, that's the story of my life.
L353972 +++$+++ u6342 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ MINNIE +++$+++ Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just Sheriff junior.
L353971 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm Sheriff Deeds--
L353970 +++$+++ u6342 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ MINNIE +++$+++ That's me.
L353969 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Mrs. Bledsoe?
L354496 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ I have new respect for some of my kids, meeting the parents they've been dealt--
L354495 +++$+++ u6343 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ I'd like to see them spend a day pulling 14-year-olds off of each other--I should get combat pay--
L354494 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ I don't think you can take it personally--
L353705 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ He's going to wish he was dead.
L353704 +++$+++ u6343 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ No. Is he sick?
L353703 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ Okay? He's not here?
L353702 +++$+++ u6343 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Pilar, is uhm--is Amado okay?
L354799 +++$+++ u6344 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ Yeah. How about that? People start digging holes in this county, there's no telling what'll come up.
L354798 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Hollis probably told you we found Charley Wade.
L354797 +++$+++ u6344 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ I'm not open. We were just talking.
L354041 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ He ever accept cash for a favor?
L354040 +++$+++ u6344 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ Buddy was more a part of the big picture--county political machine, chamber of commerce, zoning board if I kept those people happy, he was pretty much on my side.  Whenever somebody thought--they start up another bar for the black  folks, they'd be--how should I put this? They'd be officially discouraged.
L354039 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What was your deal with him?
L354038 +++$+++ u6344 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ What about it?
L354037 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ And when my father was Sheriff?
L354036 +++$+++ u6344 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ Could of been. That was white people's business.
L354035 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ That was the night he disappeared?
L354034 +++$+++ u6344 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ Oh--I think he came in one more time with Hollis and--naw, your Daddy wasn't with them. Made their monthly pickup. Roderick wasn't in so I just kept my mouth good and shut and handed over that envelope.
L354033 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ And that was the last time you saw him?
L354032 +++$+++ u6344 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ I didn't understand the spot I was putting Roderick in.
L354566 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ Oh, my mother wanted to keep me away from away from boys.
L354565 +++$+++ u6345 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PALOMA +++$+++ How come?
L354564 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ I only went for my last two years.
L354563 +++$+++ u6345 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PALOMA +++$+++ Just 'cause you went to Catholic school and wore a uniform.
L354562 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ Enough with the clothes--
L354561 +++$+++ u6345 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PALOMA +++$+++ I could name five girls at school who have one just like it--
L354560 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma.
L354559 +++$+++ u6345 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PALOMA +++$+++ Can I get this?
L354558 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ Yeah. I had uhm--school business.
L354557 +++$+++ u6345 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PALOMA +++$+++ You got in late last night.
L354556 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ It's Saturday.
L354555 +++$+++ u6345 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PALOMA +++$+++ She finally got in--
L354351 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ What do you think?
L354350 +++$+++ u6345 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PALOMA +++$+++ What's she singing about?
L354349 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ For a while.
L354348 +++$+++ u6345 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PALOMA +++$+++ You gonna stay out here?
L354347 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ Yeah?
L354346 +++$+++ u6345 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PALOMA +++$+++ Mom?
L354060 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ It doesn't have anything to do with being smart.
L354059 +++$+++ u6345 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PALOMA +++$+++ What?
L354058 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ Of course you can.
L354057 +++$+++ u6345 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PALOMA +++$+++ Not if you have half a brain in your head.
L354378 +++$+++ u6346 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Chucho Montoya saw it with his own eyes. Shot him in cold blood.
L354377 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Murdered him?
L354376 +++$+++ u6346 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough enough for you?
L354375 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--
L354374 +++$+++ u6346 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Out in the fresh air, nice gringo lady making you pies--who's gonna sit back in a little jail cell all day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no hay dos. And after that cabron Charley Wade--
L354373 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You built our patio while you  were on the county?
L354372 +++$+++ u6346 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ It could have just been a box lunch from the jail.
L354371 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Well, you were working there--
L354370 +++$+++ u6346 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ And your mother was a saint. That summer I built the patio at your house? She made me lunch every day.
L354369 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ So I've heard--
L354368 +++$+++ u6346 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ He was afraid I was going to poison somebody. Your father tried to do good for people--
L354367 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm surprised he bothered with it.
L354366 +++$+++ u6346 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ That's how I ruined my stomach.
L354365 +++$+++ u6346 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Different charge. I had a still. Made my own mescal.
L354364 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I thought he busted you a couple times.
L354363 +++$+++ u6346 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Your father never bothered me about it. Leastways not till the drug people got on his back in the late '60s.
L354362 +++$+++ u6346 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ I got a bad stomach. It helps me digest.
L354361 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You're going to smoke an acre and a half of marijuana?
L354360 +++$+++ u6346 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ It was for personal consumption.
L354359 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight.
L354358 +++$+++ u6346 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Three months.
L354357 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ How much you got left?
L354356 +++$+++ u6346 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Time marches on.
L354355 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Hey, Pete. How's it going?
L354354 +++$+++ u6346 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Morning, Sheriff.
L354836 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ Everything that went before, all that stuff, that history--the hell with it, right?
L354835 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Yeah--
L354834 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ We start from scratch--
L354833 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ If I met you for the first time today, I'd still want to be with you.
L354832 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ I'm not having any more children. After Amado, I had some complications-- I can't get pregnant again, if that's what the rule is about--
L354830 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I remember thinking you were the one part of my life Buddy didn't have a piece of--
L354829 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ From the first time I saw you at school--all those years we were married to other people I always felt like we were connected.
L354828 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ He paid the hospital bill when you were born. Your mom always calls you "our beautiful daughter" in the letters she wrote to him.
L354827 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ They can't pull this on me. It isn't fair--I don't believe this--
L354826 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county. Pilar looks away, struggling not to cry--
L354825 +++$+++ u6347 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ PILAR +++$+++ I've never seen my mother in a bathing suit before.  Didn't know she owned one.
L354824 +++$+++ u6351 +++$+++ m423 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Try a year and a half. He bands her an old snapshot. PILAR looks at it--
