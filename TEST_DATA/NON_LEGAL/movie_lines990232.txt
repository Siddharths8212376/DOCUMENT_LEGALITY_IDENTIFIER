L466851 +++$+++ u7251 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ THREEPIO +++$+++ Here we go again.
L466715 +++$+++ u7245 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?
L466714 +++$+++ u7251 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ THREEPIO +++$+++ In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.
L466713 +++$+++ u7251 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ THREEPIO +++$+++ You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.
L466712 +++$+++ u7245 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Good, I hate long waits.
L466711 +++$+++ u7251 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ THREEPIO +++$+++ Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.
L466619 +++$+++ u7252 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ VADER +++$+++ I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.
L466618 +++$+++ u7246 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ JERJERROD +++$+++ We shall double our efforts.
L466617 +++$+++ u7252 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ VADER +++$+++ That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.
L466616 +++$+++ u7252 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ VADER +++$+++ Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
L466615 +++$+++ u7246 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ JERJERROD +++$+++ But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
L466614 +++$+++ u7252 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ VADER +++$+++ The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
L466613 +++$+++ u7246 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ JERJERROD +++$+++ I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
L466612 +++$+++ u7252 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ VADER +++$+++ Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
L466611 +++$+++ u7246 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ JERJERROD +++$+++ I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.
L466610 +++$+++ u7252 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ VADER +++$+++ You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule.
L466609 +++$+++ u7246 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ JERJERROD +++$+++ Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence.
L467176 +++$+++ u7253 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ WEDGE +++$+++ Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out.
L467175 +++$+++ u7247 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.
L467174 +++$+++ u7253 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ WEDGE +++$+++ There it is!
L467160 +++$+++ u7253 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ WEDGE +++$+++ Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.
L467159 +++$+++ u7247 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.
L467158 +++$+++ u7247 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ Here goes nothing.
L467157 +++$+++ u7253 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ WEDGE +++$+++ I'm going in.
L467137 +++$+++ u7247 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down.
L467136 +++$+++ u7253 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ WEDGE +++$+++ Good shot, Red Two.
L467052 +++$+++ u7253 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ WEDGE +++$+++ Red Leader standing by.
L467051 +++$+++ u7247 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ All wings report in.
L467028 +++$+++ u7248 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Oh, no.
L467027 +++$+++ u7251 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ THREEPIO +++$+++ I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
L467026 +++$+++ u7248 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Quiet.
L467025 +++$+++ u7251 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ THREEPIO +++$+++ Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!
L467017 +++$+++ u7251 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ THREEPIO +++$+++ He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.
L467016 +++$+++ u7248 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ What's he saying?
L466947 +++$+++ u7251 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ THREEPIO +++$+++ Your Royal Highness.
L466946 +++$+++ u7248 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Oh!
L466682 +++$+++ u7251 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ THREEPIO +++$+++ Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.
L466681 +++$+++ u7248 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Ugh!
L466988 +++$+++ u7249 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.
L466987 +++$+++ u7248 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ But, why must you confront him?
L466986 +++$+++ u7249 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ No, you don't. You've always been strong.
L466985 +++$+++ u7248 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
L466984 +++$+++ u7249 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Then you know why I have to face him.
L466983 +++$+++ u7248 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ I know. Somehow...I've always known.
L466982 +++$+++ u7249 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Yes. It's you Leia.
L466981 +++$+++ u7249 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.
L466980 +++$+++ u7248 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.
L466979 +++$+++ u7249 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.
L466978 +++$+++ u7248 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Your father?
L466977 +++$+++ u7249 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ He's my father.
L466974 +++$+++ u7249 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Vader is here...now, on this moon.
L466973 +++$+++ u7248 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?
L466972 +++$+++ u7249 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.
L466971 +++$+++ u7248 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.  Why are you asking me all this?
L466970 +++$+++ u7249 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Tell me.
L466969 +++$+++ u7248 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Just...images, really. Feelings.
L466968 +++$+++ u7249 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ What do you remember?
L466967 +++$+++ u7248 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
L466966 +++$+++ u7249 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
L466882 +++$+++ u7249 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I see them. Wait, Leia!
L466881 +++$+++ u7248 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Over there! Two more of them!
L467146 +++$+++ u7249 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Never-r-r!
L467145 +++$+++ u7252 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ VADER +++$+++ Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.
L467144 +++$+++ u7252 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ VADER +++$+++ Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for...
L467143 +++$+++ u7249 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I will not fight you.
L467142 +++$+++ u7252 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ VADER +++$+++ You cannot hide forever, Luke.
L467133 +++$+++ u7252 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ VADER +++$+++ You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny.
L467132 +++$+++ u7249 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.
L467131 +++$+++ u7252 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ VADER +++$+++ There is no conflict.
L467130 +++$+++ u7249 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict.
L467128 +++$+++ u7249 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I will not fight you, father.
L467127 +++$+++ u7252 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ VADER +++$+++ Obi-Wan has taught you well.
L467012 +++$+++ u7252 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ VADER +++$+++ It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now.
L467011 +++$+++ u7249 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
L467010 +++$+++ u7252 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ VADER +++$+++ If that is your destiny.
L467009 +++$+++ u7249 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
L467008 +++$+++ u7252 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ VADER +++$+++ You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.
L467007 +++$+++ u7252 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ VADER +++$+++ Obi-Wan once thought as you do.
L467006 +++$+++ u7249 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Come with me.
L467002 +++$+++ u7252 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ VADER +++$+++ So, you have accepted the truth.
L467001 +++$+++ u7249 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I know, father.
L467000 +++$+++ u7252 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ VADER +++$+++ The Emperor has been expecting you.
L466790 +++$+++ u7254 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.
L466789 +++$+++ u7249 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Well, I'm sorry.
L466788 +++$+++ u7249 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Unfortunate that I know the truth?
L466787 +++$+++ u7254 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
L466786 +++$+++ u7249 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Yes.
L466785 +++$+++ u7254 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Told you, did he?
L466784 +++$+++ u7254 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Your father he is.
L466783 +++$+++ u7249 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Yoda, I must know.
L466779 +++$+++ u7254 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
L466778 +++$+++ u7249 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
L466777 +++$+++ u7254 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.
L466776 +++$+++ u7249 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Master Yoda, you can't die.
L466653 +++$+++ u7251 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ THREEPIO +++$+++ Disintegrated?
L466652 +++$+++ u7250 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ NINEDENINE +++$+++ Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.
L466651 +++$+++ u7251 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ THREEPIO +++$+++ I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...
L466650 +++$+++ u7250 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ NINEDENINE +++$+++ How many languages do you speak?
L466649 +++$+++ u7251 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ THREEPIO +++$+++ Oh. Well, yes.
L466648 +++$+++ u7250 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ NINEDENINE +++$+++ Yes or no will do.
L466647 +++$+++ u7251 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ THREEPIO +++$+++ I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
L466646 +++$+++ u7250 +++$+++ m489 +++$+++ NINEDENINE +++$+++ Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?
L468159 +++$+++ u7258 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You are - so quake with fear, you tiny fools.
L468158 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ It's as if we were glued to the spot.
L468107 +++$+++ u7258 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Rocky!
L468106 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ Janet!
L468094 +++$+++ u7258 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room.
L468093 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ He might be.  I don't know.
L468092 +++$+++ u7258 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ And now he works for your Government, doesn't he, Brad?  He's attached to the Bureau of Investigation of that which you call U.F.O's.  Isn't he, Brad?
L468091 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ He was a Science Teacher at Denton High.
L468090 +++$+++ u7258 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I know what you told me, Brad. But this Dr Everett Scott.  His name is not unknown to me.
L468089 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ I was telling the truth.
L468088 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ I told you, my car broke down.
L468087 +++$+++ u7258 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I see.  So this wasn't simply a chance meeting.  You came here with a purpose.
L468040 +++$+++ u7258 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ On my mother's grave.
L468039 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ You promise you won't tell?
L468038 +++$+++ u7258 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Oh come on, Brad, admit it.  It was enjoyable, wasn't it?  There's no crime in giving yourself over to pleasure.
L468037 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ Like this.  Like how?  It's your fault - you're to blame.  I thought it was the real thing.
L468036 +++$+++ u7258 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this?
L468035 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet.  Janet.
L468034 +++$+++ u7258 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I know, but it wasn't all bad was it? I think you found it quite pleasurable.  Oh so soft.  So sensual.
L468033 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ You tricked me.  I wouldn't have - I've never - never.
L468032 +++$+++ u7258 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Nothing.  Why do you think I should?
L468031 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ Why you - what have you done with Janet?
L468030 +++$+++ u7258 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I'm afraid so, Brad.  But wasn't it nice?
L468029 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ You!
L467941 +++$+++ u7258 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Oh well.  How about you.  
L467940 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ Certainly not!
L467939 +++$+++ u7258 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Do you have any tattoos Brad.
L467807 +++$+++ u7257 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ FAMILY +++$+++ Janet
L467806 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ Made me give you the eye And then panic,
L467805 +++$+++ u7257 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ FAMILY +++$+++ Janet.
L467788 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ I've one thing to say and that's Dammit, Janet. I love you.
L467787 +++$+++ u7257 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ FAMILY +++$+++ Janet.
L467786 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ So please don't tell me to can it.
L467785 +++$+++ u7257 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ FAMILY +++$+++ Janet.
L467784 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ The future is ours so let's plan it.
L468051 +++$+++ u7260 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ If only we hadn't made this journey. If only the car hadn't broken down. If only we were amongst friends or sane persons.
L468050 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to beat again. So give me a sign That a lover makes You look around The one you've found Is back again.
L468049 +++$+++ u7260 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly.  Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?
L468048 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ So baby don't cry like there's no tomorrow After the night there's a brand new day. And there'll be no pain And no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place It'll be O.K.
L468047 +++$+++ u7260 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ I could see Brad's face before me and my mind screamed No!  But my lips were hungry - too hungry.
L468046 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to turn to stone The sweeter the wine The harder to make the break You hear something about someone You'd thought you'd known.
L468045 +++$+++ u7260 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ I'm engaged to Brad just the same as Betty Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy I've never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses.
L468028 +++$+++ u7260 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ I hope so my darling.
L468027 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ Janet!  Oh!  Yes it's alright.  Janet. Everything's going to be alright.
L468026 +++$+++ u7260 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ Maybe we could try it this way.
L468009 +++$+++ u7260 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ Oh don't be so shy.
L468008 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ No, don't do that.
L468007 +++$+++ u7260 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ Oh, I hope so my darling.  But let me switch on the light.
L468006 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ It's alright Janet.  Everything's going to be alright.
L468005 +++$+++ u7260 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ Oh Brad - Mmmm - Oh yes, my darling - what if...
L467951 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ It's alright Janet.
L467950 +++$+++ u7260 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ Brad...
L467936 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ Weiss.
L467935 +++$+++ u7260 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ Weiss.
L467934 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ I'm Brad Majors and this is my fiancee, Janet Vice.
L467924 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ It's alright Janet, we'll play along for now and pull out the aces when the time is right.
L467923 +++$+++ u7260 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ Oh Brad.
L467911 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ We'll just say where we are Then go back to the car We don't want to be any worry.
L467910 +++$+++ u7260 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ Right!
L467903 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ I'm here, there's nothing to worry about.
L467902 +++$+++ u7260 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.
L467901 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ They're probably foreigners with ways different from our own.  -  They may do some more folk dancing.
L467900 +++$+++ u7260 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
L467899 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
L467898 +++$+++ u7260 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ Then ask the butler - or someone.
L467897 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.
L467896 +++$+++ u7260 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ Well I want to leave.
L467895 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ It's just a..a party Janet.
L467894 +++$+++ u7260 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ But it seems so unhealthy here.
L467893 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
L467892 +++$+++ u7260 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ Brad, please lets get out of here.
L467891 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ Say!  Do any of you guys know the Madison?
L467890 +++$+++ u7260 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ Oh....Say something.
L467862 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.
L467861 +++$+++ u7260 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ Oh Brad, I'm frightened.  What kind of place is this?
L467857 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ Yes.
L467856 +++$+++ u7260 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ Yes, the rain has been very heavy.
L467852 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ Just a moment, Janet.  They may have a telephone.
L467851 +++$+++ u7260 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ Oh, Brad.  Let's go back.  I'm cold and I'm frightened.
L467829 +++$+++ u7260 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ I'm coming with you.  Besides, darling, the owner of the phone might be a beautiful woman and you may never come back.
L467828 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ There's no point both of us getting wet.
L467827 +++$+++ u7260 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ I'm coming with you.
L467826 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ Didn't we pass a castle back down the road a few miles?  Maybe they have a telephone I might use.
L467825 +++$+++ u7260 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
L467824 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ You'd better sit here and keep warm while I go for help.
L467823 +++$+++ u7260 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ Oh...
L467822 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ We must have a blow-out.
L467821 +++$+++ u7260 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ What was that bang?
L467820 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ Hmmm ... Well, I guess we will have to turn back.
L467819 +++$+++ u7260 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ Oh dear!  But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
L467818 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ I think we took the wrong fork a few miles back.
L467816 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ Yes, Janet.  Life's pretty cheap to that type.
L467815 +++$+++ u7260 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist that's passed us.  They certainly take their lives in their hands.  What with the weather and all.
L467810 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ Dammit, Janet.
L467809 +++$+++ u7260 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ Oh Brad, I'm mad.
L467801 +++$+++ u7260 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ For you.
L467800 +++$+++ u7255 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ Oh Janet
L467782 +++$+++ u7260 +++$+++ m490 +++$+++ JANET +++$+++ Oh Brad.
