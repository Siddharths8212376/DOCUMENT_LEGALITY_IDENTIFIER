L267900 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Scrambled eggs, kippered herring, fried potatoes--and a whole onion. I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
L267899 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Breakfast?
L267864 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Ram it up your ass!
L267863 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I have some change!
L267858 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ We all do.  But now it's body time. Relax.  Ideally, the body of a woman should feel like a hot water bottle filled with Devonshire cream. You feel like a paper bag crammed with curtain rods.  Think of your muscles one by one.  Let them go slack.  Relax.  Let the brain go blank.  Relax.  That's the idea-- that's my girl.  Now the small of the back.  Let those knots over those kidneys unsnarl.
L267857 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I have a brain.
L267856 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You're thinking with your brain instead of your body.  That's why you're so tense!  Forget Norbert. Relax.  It's body time.
L267855 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.
L267854 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I'm going to touch your shoulders very gently now.  You mustn't scream.  So tense, so tense.
L267853 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I'm not about to introduce to you a jungle novelty.  What I have in mind is massage--a perfectly decent massage.  Turn around, turn around.
L267852 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Turn around?
L267851 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Now--turn around, if you would.
L267849 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I'm not going to strike you.  I am going to be as gentle as pie--as lemon meringue pie.  You mustn't run away now.  This is your loving husband approaching.  I'm your husband.  Society approves!
L267848 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.
L267847 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You used to like it stark!
L267846 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ It's so--so stark.
L267845 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Honeymoon!  Honeymoon!  Say it: Honeymoon!
L267840 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Buy yourself breakfast.  There we go.
L267839 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ He hasn't had breakfast yet.
L267836 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I had a trip.  We'll honeymoon here.  Go out and play.
L267835 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ A trip, you mean?
L267834 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ We were one hell of a pair--and we'll be one again.  What we need is a honeymoon.  Let's start right now.
L267833 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I did?
L267832 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again.  You used to eat it up.
L267831 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.
L267830 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Now that's what I call fun.
L267823 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Do say hello to your mother.
L267822 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Say hello to your mother.
L267821 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Awful.  I can't tell you how sorry I am.
L267818 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ He thought he could take my place. It is now my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why I don't think he's man enough to do that.
L267817 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ He doesn't deserve this!  You don't know him.  It isn't fair!
L267813 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You and your damned bedside manner and your damned little black bag full of miracles.  You know who filled that bag for you?  Not Alice-sit-by-the-fires like yourself.  Men with guts filled it, by God--men with guts enough to pay the price for miracles--suffering, ingratitude, loneliness, death--
L267812 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Please--
L267811 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I could carve a better man out of a banana!
L267810 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Harold!
L267802 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Have some.
L267801 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I'm so glad you like each other.  I was so scared, so scared.
L267785 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Thank God!
L267784 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Nothing would please me more.
L267783 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ You know what I want?  I want you both to be friends.  I know you both, respect you both. You should be friends.
L267779 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I was, I was.  It never lasts long.
L267778 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Paul said you were awfully sick.
L267777 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ When I'm dead--  or fucking.
L267776 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Shouldn't you lie down?
L267775 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ We all are.
L267774 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ He's a very decent man, Harold.
L267773 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I don't want that chancre mechanic in here.
L267772 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ We thought it was an emergency.
L267771 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Your old beau?
L267770 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ We thought a doctor might help.
L267769 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What's that all about?
L267761 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ You'd better get Dr. Woodly.
L267760 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Bluh.
L267703 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Every fuse in my nervous system has been blown.
L267702 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?
L267701 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Well--enjoy the natural, honest, unrehearsed result--surgical shock.
L267700 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural, unrehearsed.
L267699 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ A telegram--a phone call might have helped.
L267698 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ This reunion isn't what I imagined it would be.
L267697 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Situation.
L267696 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Disease?
L267695 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I don't know.  This is a new disease to me.
L267694 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What sort of time period do you have in mind?  Half an hour?  An hour?
L267693 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ We adjust to what there is to adjust to.  Perhaps Paul, being young, can adjust to joy or grief immediately.  I hope he can.  I will take a little longer.  I'll be as quick as I can.
L267692 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You were well adjusted to my being dead?
L267691 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
L267690 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Like hugging a lamp post.
L267689 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Give us time.
L267688 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What's the matter?
L267674 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I couldn't help overhearing that you were about to get married again.
L267673 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Not at all.
L267672 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ How do you do, Mrs. Ryan?  I'd heard you were beautiful, and so you are.  Am I intruding here?
L267671 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ How do you do?
L267533 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ The pelt is black.  It's a kind of man.
L267532 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Some kind of animal?
L267531 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ My parents died in an automobile accident when I was sixteen years old.  They left me a brewery and a baseball team--and other things.  I live for a living.  I've just come back from Kenya--in Africa.  I've been hunting Mau Mau there.
L267530 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ What do you do for a living?
L267529 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Destiny often seems that way. You're going to marry me.
L267528 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ This is crazy.
L267527 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You are woman.  I know woman well.
L267526 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ You don't even know me.
L267525 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Daughter--I love you very much.
L267524 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I'm engaged.
L267523 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?
L267522 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I'm sorry, sir, I'm engaged to be married.  My boyfriend would be mad if I went out with another man.
L267521 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What time do you get off work, my child?
L267520 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Yes, sir.  It was a very unusual automobile. It was a Cadillac, but it had water buffalo horns where the bumpers should be.  And what to drink?
L267519 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Raw hamburger, please--and a whole onion.  I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
L267518 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Sir?
L267517 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ A springbok, an oryx, a gemsbok--a gazelle.
L267516 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Eighteen--  and a half.
L267515 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I think so, daughter.  How old are you?
L267514 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Can I help you, sir?
L267513 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Heaven.
L267512 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ "Hamburger Heaven."
L267169 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I am Harold Ryan, her husband.  I have killed perhaps two hundred men in wars of various sorts--as a professional soldier.  I have killed thousands of other animals as well--for sport.
L267168 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ How do you do.  My name is Penelope Ryan.  This is a simple-minded play about men who enjoy killing--and those who don't.
L268396 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ For what it's worth now, Harold Ryan, the clown, gives his sacred word.
L268395 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Give me your word of honor that that's all you're going to do.
L268394 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I'll put it in Paul's room, where it belongs.
L268393 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Leave the rifle here.
L268392 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
L268391 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ What are you going to do?
L268390 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Somewhere in this city.  Not here, not here.  Tell Penelope I loved her--in my clownish way.  And Paul. Tell him to be a healer, by all means.
L268389 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ New lives begin!
L268388 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ It's trash now, like mine.
L268387 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Thank you--for my life.
L268386 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Thank God. HAROLD Crawl home.
L268385 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Can't do it.
L268384 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Have it your way.  We'd both be better off dead now.
L268383 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ No.
L268382 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Get up.
L268381 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ No.  No.
L268380 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I've enjoyed being man.
L268379 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Don't shoot.
L268378 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Man, as man was meant to be--a vengeful ape who murders.  He will soon be extinct.  It's time, it's time.
L268377 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ What is this thing that kills me?
L268376 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ If you want to be found that way.
L268375 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Can I beg for mercy--on my knees?
L268374 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Oh God--you're really going to kill me. HAROLD It won't hurt as much as the sting of a bumblebee.  Heaven is very much like Paradise, they say. You'll like it there.
L268373 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Like the saber-toothed tiger.
L268372 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ New dignity can be yours--as a merciful man.  You can change!
L268371 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ My self-respect is gone--and my soldier's honor with it.  It is now very easy for me to shoot an unarmed man.
L268370 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ No!
L268369 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I'm going to shoot you now.
L268368 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ You'd be killing a friend.  Don't you know how much I like you?
L268367 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ We never quit fighting until we're dead.
L268366 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ More clowning!  Don't you see?
L268365 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You're making a mistake.  Obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded.  You've wounded me.
L268364 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I'm utterly satisfied.
L268363 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Here.  Finish the job.
L268362 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Never.  For when you began to kill for the fun of it, you became the chief source of agony of mankind.
L268361 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Was I ever of use?
L268360 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ But the new hero will be a man of science and of peace--like me. He'll disarm you, of course.  No more guns, no more guns.
L268359 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You're too modest.
L268358 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I hate crowds, and I have no charisma--
L268357 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ The new hero is you.
L268356 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.
L268355 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.
L268354 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ My violin is avenged!
L268353 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Don Quixote.
L268352 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ You aren't going to hurt me.  You aren't going to hurt anybody any more.  Any violent gesture will seem ridiculous--to yourself!
L268351 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I see.
L268350 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ No. WOODLY The magic root you gave me--I had it analyzed.  It was discovered by a Harvard botanist in 1893!  He explored your famous jungle for five years, armed with nothing but kindness, a talent for languages, and a pocketknife.
L268349 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ You can never take yourself seriously again!  Look at all the creatures you've protected us from! Did you shoot them on the elevator, as they were on their way up here to eat us alive?
L268348 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I--I really must congratulate you. Something is happening in there.
L268347 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ You have a very good mind, or I wouldn't have come back.  That mind is now asking itself, cleverly and fairly, "Is Harold Ryan really a clown?" And the answer is, "Yes."
L268346 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Poison.
L268345 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I put a poisoned thought in your head.  Even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind.  It's saying, "Obsolete, obsolete, obsolete," and, "Clown, clown, clown."
L268344 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I've poisoned you. HAROLD  Lucretia Borgia?  Something I drank or touched?  You refused a cigar.  That's it! Potassium cyanide in the humidor! Treacherous lover of peace!
L268343 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ With spittle?
L268342 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I've struck my blow.
L268341 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Cut me open.  Find out.
L268340 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Don't you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew?
L268339 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ No quarter asked.  No quarter given.
L268338 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ In any event, I will not beg for mercy.
L268337 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You hope.
L268336 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ King Arthur.
L268335 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I'm an honorable clown?
L268334 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man.
L268333 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that?
L268332 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.
L268331 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?
L268330 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Evolution has made you a clown-- with a cigar.  Simple butchers like you are obsolete!
L268329 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I love you!  Have a cigar!
L268328 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ You're a clown.  You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.
L268327 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Glands.  You're supposed to be happy when you die.  Call me comical again.
L268326 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I'm high as a kite.
L268325 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You're in one hell of a jam.  You realize that?
L268320 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ And terror, if you don't mind.
L268319 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Hands and knees, you say?
L268311 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Comical?
L268310 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I haven't told you, Harold, how comical I think you are.
L268289 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Yes--well--uh--that's another one of those statements which more or less automatically requires an apology.  Whenever you feel like it. It's sort of like turning off an alarm clock that's ringing loudly. Your apology turns off the alarm.
L268288 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ You're a son of a bitch.
L268287 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ We do survive, don't we?  You're going to have to apologize, of course, for calling me a bastard. That's a matter of form--not allowing you or anybody to call me a bastard.  No rush about that. Just remember to apologize sometime soon.
