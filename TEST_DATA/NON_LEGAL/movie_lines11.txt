L4748 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I got a lot to protect.
L4747 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
L4746 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here.
L4745 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ You're crazy.
L4744 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
L4743 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah?
L4741 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Didn't work out that way.  He busted out with a big Indian. They capped two guards on a road gang. Nice meeting you Reggie.
L4740 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
L4739 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah, I noticed...
L4732 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.
L4731 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You here to write my life story?
L4729 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Sure, anything you want.
L4728 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
L4727 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You got a name, cop?
L5245 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
L5244 +++$+++ u70 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HADEN +++$+++ Where the Christ do you think you're going?
L5243 +++$+++ u70 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HADEN +++$+++ Just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... How you gonna take to a pink slip, huh?.
L5242 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with.
L5104 +++$+++ u70 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HADEN +++$+++ Too bad, it would've covered your ass.  Now you're in the shit and so's the department. In case you haven't noticed, this wasn't our finest hour... I told you everyone was watchin' on this one. Maybe you better start thinkin' about writin' tickets off a three wheel bike.
L5103 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I didn't have the time.
L5102 +++$+++ u70 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HADEN +++$+++ Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?
L5101 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Right.  I screwed up.  I fucked up. I messed up.  Anybody could have done better, especially you. I bet you're real good at hitting targets through crowds.
L5100 +++$+++ u70 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HADEN +++$+++ What a screw-up.
L5099 +++$+++ u70 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HADEN +++$+++ You couldn't get to him?
L5098 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.
L5097 +++$+++ u70 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HADEN +++$+++ Which one pulled the trigger?
L5096 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ They ran.  As fast as they could. Caught a train.
L5095 +++$+++ u70 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HADEN +++$+++ How did they get away?
L5094 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I lost them, that's what happened.
L5093 +++$+++ u70 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HADEN +++$+++ What the bell happened?
L4703 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I'll keep it in mind.
L4702 +++$+++ u70 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HADEN +++$+++ Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
L4701 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah?
L4700 +++$+++ u70 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HADEN +++$+++ Jack?
L4699 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
L4698 +++$+++ u70 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HADEN +++$+++ Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.
L4697 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
L4696 +++$+++ u70 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HADEN +++$+++ You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
L4695 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
L4694 +++$+++ u70 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HADEN +++$+++ Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
L4693 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah...
L4692 +++$+++ u70 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HADEN +++$+++ Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... I know, we all know the truth's a little different.
L4691 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Hey, the bastard's got my gun.  I want it back.
L4690 +++$+++ u70 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HADEN +++$+++ Yeah, I read the report...
L4689 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.
L4644 +++$+++ u77 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ YOUNG COP +++$+++ I guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible...
L4643 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
L4642 +++$+++ u77 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ YOUNG COP +++$+++ Somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report.
L4639 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?
L4638 +++$+++ u77 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ YOUNG COP +++$+++ But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
L4637 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah.
L4636 +++$+++ u77 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ YOUNG COP +++$+++ That's what you say, Cates...
L5163 +++$+++ u73 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ KEHOE +++$+++ I'm not paid to take your personal calls.  He was in some bar. .. off duty.
L5162 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't you tell me before?
L5159 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ What?
L5158 +++$+++ u73 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ KEHOE +++$+++ I almost forgot.  That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him.
L5145 +++$+++ u73 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ KEHOE +++$+++ Okay.  See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...
L5144 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I got to wait for a call.
L5143 +++$+++ u73 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ KEHOE +++$+++ I'm heading out. How about you?
L5142 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Bullshit red tape.
L5138 +++$+++ u73 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ KEHOE +++$+++ Nothing.
L5137 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
L5136 +++$+++ u73 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ KEHOE +++$+++ Doesn't look like it.
L5135 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
L5134 +++$+++ u73 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ KEHOE +++$+++ Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
L5133 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ So do you...been a long day.
L5132 +++$+++ u73 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ KEHOE +++$+++ You look awful.
L4687 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ One of  em's in the slam.
L4686 +++$+++ u73 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ KEHOE +++$+++ Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
L4685 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking.  Can we find them?
L4682 +++$+++ u73 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ KEHOE +++$+++ Hey ... Dick Tracy.
L4681 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Tell me that's not the same guy.
L4680 +++$+++ u73 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ KEHOE +++$+++ Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job.
L4679 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
L4678 +++$+++ u73 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ KEHOE +++$+++ They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.
L4677 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Who are all these?
L4676 +++$+++ u73 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ KEHOE +++$+++ Backup man from the East Bay. Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang.
L4675 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Billy Bear...
L4673 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Shit.
L4672 +++$+++ u73 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ KEHOE +++$+++ This guy must have had a .44 like yours, Jack. Now he's got yours.
L4671 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I'll help you out.
L4670 +++$+++ u73 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ KEHOE +++$+++ Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.
L4669 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?
L4823 +++$+++ u75 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ I dunno ... he's gonna call me...
L4822 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ When? How?
L4821 +++$+++ u75 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ He ... he wants me to help him skip town.
L4819 +++$+++ u75 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ I don't know.
L4818 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
L4817 +++$+++ u75 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie.
L4813 +++$+++ u75 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ Who gives a fuck what you think?
L4812 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
L4811 +++$+++ u75 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
L4810 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
L4809 +++$+++ u75 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ A cop...
L5365 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ That's what I always say.
L5364 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ You're impossible...
L5363 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ He's takin' care of the same business I'll be takin' care of - soon as I dry off.
L5362 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Tell me.
L5361 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...
L5360 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Where is he?
L5359 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Three more hours...
L5358 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works.
L5357 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
L5356 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
L5355 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ How'd they take it back at headquarters?
L5303 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Let's go, Reggie.
L5302 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
L5301 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Whaddya think?
L5298 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Oh, yeah, well look where you came when you were down and out.
L5297 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
L5296 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
L5295 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ So what?
L5294 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
L5293 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
L5292 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?
L5287 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...
L5286 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ How do you know?
L5285 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
L5284 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Nothing.  No sign of Ganz.  No sign of the Indian.  Airport's clean.  Train station. Bus station.  Docks... Shit...
L5276 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I've been better...Dead end.  No Ganz, no Indian.
L5275 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ You real down?
L5263 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...
L5262 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
L5261 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Don't.  We've had a hard night.
L5260 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
L5259 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Hiya, kid.
L5258 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Hey, I don't believe it.
L5221 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Fuck you.
L5220 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Hi, it's me...
L5219 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Hello.
L5169 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Just a second, that's all!
L5168 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Jack, wait...
L5167 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Elaine, I gotta put you on hold...
L5165 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Jack?  What was that?
L5164 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ The number ... what's the Goddamn number?
L5153 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ So am I.
L5152 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
L5151 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ No wonder you're so popular.
L5150 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
L5149 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I'm at work, asshole.  Where else?
L4840 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
L4839 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?
L4837 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Elaine, look, I'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... I'm not gonna have time to come by. I don't know when I can get there.
L4836 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Just one.  Some lady called.  Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....
L4718 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I get that. The job first. Everything else, especially me, second. I get it. I don't like it.
L4717 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
L4716 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
L4715 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
L4714 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
L4713 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
L4712 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...
L4709 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Sure, okay, fine, no problem... See, there's this kid in jail ... First thing I got to do is go up and see what he knows ...
L4708 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Jack, are you okay?
L4707 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day...
L4706 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ You made the front page.
L4705 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah, one of my favorites.
L4704 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Great place for lunch.
L4535 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Guess people ought to know who I am...
L4534 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
L4533 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Thanks for the coffee.
L4532 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...
L4531 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ You sure you want me to?
L4530 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Call me later.
L4529 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ That's the way I see it, too.
L4528 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
L4525 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I wish you'd stop trying to make me mad so I won't care for you... I wish you'd give me a little more of a chance.
L4524 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?
L4523 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ When you start with that attitude... it's like I don't know who you are.
L4522 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
L4521 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
L4520 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
L4519 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
L4517 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
L4516 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Maybe you ought to buy me one.
L4514 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place?
L4513 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ You know, if you let me come over to your place once in a while, you could put on a clean shirt in the morning.
L4488 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.
L4487 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
L4486 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Hey, you know what I really think?
L4485 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
L4484 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
L4483 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
L4482 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
L4481 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
L4480 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I guess he got the message...
L4479 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
L4478 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ What'd you do?
L4477 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
L4476 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ What's wrong with that?
L4475 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I'm all wet.
L4474 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ That's the way I see it, too.
L4473 +++$+++ u68 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ You're hopeless.
