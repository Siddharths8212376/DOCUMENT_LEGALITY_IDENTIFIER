L69662 +++$+++ u3911 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ "Shreck's."  You --
L69661 +++$+++ u3913 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ CATWOMAN +++$+++ Where's the fire?
L69944 +++$+++ u3911 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ Maybe you're right.
L69943 +++$+++ u3917 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ PENGUIN +++$+++ I think you're jealous that I'm a genuine freak, and you have to wear a mask!
L69658 +++$+++ u3911 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ Things change.
L69657 +++$+++ u3917 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ PENGUIN +++$+++ Ah, the direct approach.  I admire that in a man with a mask.  But you don't really think you'll ever win, playing it your way ..?
L69656 +++$+++ u3911 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ What're you really after?
L69655 +++$+++ u3917 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ PENGUIN +++$+++ Better than you know, Bat-boy.
L69654 +++$+++ u3911 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ Once you were their freak, now these clowns do your bidding. Must feel pretty good.
L69653 +++$+++ u3917 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ PENGUIN +++$+++ Things change.  Hey, good to meet you.  We'll be working hand in glove in Gotham's glorious future.
L69652 +++$+++ u3911 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ You're not the Mayor.
L69651 +++$+++ u3917 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ PENGUIN +++$+++ Touring the riot scene.  Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff.
L69650 +++$+++ u3911 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BATMAN +++$+++ Admiring your handiwork?
L69893 +++$+++ u3912 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I don't know.  Till we figure it out, let's ... let's keep dancing.
L69892 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ ... What do we do?
L69888 +++$+++ u3912 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean ... it.
L69887 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ A kiss under the mistletoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
L69886 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ I don't know anymore, Bruce ...
L69885 +++$+++ u3912 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Jesus, Selina, you're not the judge <u>or</u> the jury... I mean, just who do you think you <u>are</u>?
L69884 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ Now don't give me a killing-Max- won't-solve-anything speech, because it will.  Aren't you tired of this sanctimonious robber baron always coming out on top?  When he should be six feet under?
L69879 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ You first.
L69878 +++$+++ u3912 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Same here.  So why'd you come tonight?
L69877 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ...
L69876 +++$+++ u3912 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Y'mean take off our costumes?
L69875 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding.  What say we ...
L69873 +++$+++ u3912 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ No hard feelings?
L69872 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ 'S'okay, I had to go home, feed my cat.
L69871 +++$+++ u3912 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Sorry about yesterday ... Some big deal came together, no, fell through, and --
L69772 +++$+++ u3912 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ What're you doing three dates from now?
L69771 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ Nor I, on the second.
L69770 +++$+++ u3912 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I, ah ... never fool around on the first date.
L69769 +++$+++ u3912 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Ah ... then you've come to the right lonely mansion.
L69768 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ It's the so-called "normal" guys who always let you down.  Sickos never scare me.  At least they're commited.
L69767 +++$+++ u3912 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ If I said yes, then you might think me a Norman Bates, or a Ted Bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you.
L69766 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ Well?  Was "Vicki" right?  About your difficulty with duality?
L69765 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ Sure.
L69764 +++$+++ u3912 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Photojournalist.
L69763 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ "Vicki."  Ice-skater, or stewardess?
L69762 +++$+++ u3912 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Well ... How can I put this. There were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. Because <u>I</u> had trouble reconciling them.  Vicki said.
L69761 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ And the truth frightened her?
L69760 +++$+++ u3912 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Nope, I told her everything.
L69759 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ What went wrong?  Hang on, I think I know ... You kept things from her.
L69758 +++$+++ u3912 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Had one.  Didn't work.
L69757 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?
L69756 +++$+++ u3912 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
L69755 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ I'm sure he's wonderful company and all, but ... doesn't the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale?
L69748 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ Yes and no...
L69747 +++$+++ u3912 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ ... and me.  No, that's be me and me.  Is that what I said?
L69746 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ "We"?  You and...
L69745 +++$+++ u3912 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ ... Maybe I'll watch it on TV.
L69744 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ Yeah?  Me too...
L69743 +++$+++ u3912 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Well, I'm... braver at night, if that's what you mean...
L69742 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ No darker than yours, Bruce.
L69741 +++$+++ u3912 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
L69740 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ I detest violence, but ... Christmas complacency can be a downer, too.
L69739 +++$+++ u3912 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ You almost sound enthusiastic.
L69738 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ -- and it's gonna be a hot time in the cold town tonight.
L69737 +++$+++ u3912 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I wouldn't be caught dead.  No, it's probably how I would be caught.  The Mayor stupidly took Cobblepot's bait --
L69736 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ You're not coming to that, are you?  "The Relighting of the Tree" thing?
L69735 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ I heard on TV, "Catwoman is thought to weigh 140 pounds."  How do these hacks <u>sleep</u> at night?
L69734 +++$+++ u3912 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ And it's not even accurate ... I mean, "Batman Blows It"?  The guy probably prevented <u>millions</u> in property damage.
L69733 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ The news these days ... weird. People looking to superheroes for their peace of mind, and blaming their problems on super-villains ... instead of themselves, or their spouses at least.
L69731 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ Treat to be here.
L69730 +++$+++ u3912 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I don't see how ... Anyway, it's a treat to find you out in the world, away from Ebeneezer Shreck.
L69729 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ Scare me?  No, actually, I was just scaring myself ...
L69728 +++$+++ u3912 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Selina.  Hi.  Didn't mean to --
L69586 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ Oh.  "Kyle."
L69585 +++$+++ u3912 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I, ah ... didn't catch your last name.
L69584 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ Pouring myself into my work.
L69580 +++$+++ u3912 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I'm tempted.
L69579 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ I'm listed.
L69578 +++$+++ u3912 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Well, I could ... free up some time...
L69577 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ Well that's a ... long story ...
L69576 +++$+++ u3912 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ No.  And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him.
L69575 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ You don't seem like the type who does business with Mr. Shreck.
L69570 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ Yes and no ...
L69569 +++$+++ u3912 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Didn't I say that?
L69568 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ You mean mistook <u>me</u>?
L69567 +++$+++ u3912 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Sorry.  I mistook me for somebody else.
L69566 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ Have we?
L69565 +++$+++ u3912 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ We've met.
L69869 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Yawn.
L69868 +++$+++ u3912 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ It does to me.
L69867 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I am the light of this city.  <u>And</u> I am its mean, twisted soul.  Does it really matter who's the "mayor"?
L69866 +++$+++ u3912 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Course you're feeling fine ... You almost made a monster the Mayor of Gotham City.
L69865 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Ingenious costume.  Let me guess ... Trust-fund goody-goody?
L69572 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Yes, did -- did you injure yourself on that ski slope?  Is that why you cut short your vacation and came back?
L69571 +++$+++ u3912 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ What happened?
L69559 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Wayne, I'll not stand for mud- slinging in this office.  If my assistant were here, she'd already have escorted you out, to --
L69558 +++$+++ u3912 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ "Oswald" is linked to the Red Triangle Gang.  I can't prove it but we both know it's true.
L69557 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Scared of Oswald, are you?  Why, if his parents hadn't eighty- sixed him you two might've been roomies, at prep school!
L69556 +++$+++ u3912 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Not compared to that "Cobblepot" person you're promoting...
L69555 +++$+++ u3912 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I'm not scared of you, Max.
L69554 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Mayors come and go.  And heirs tire easily.  Really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with Muhammed Shreck.
L69553 +++$+++ u3912 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Max, I'm gonna fight you on this. The Mayor and I have already spoken and we see eye to eye here.  So --
L69552 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ If my life has had any meaning, that's the meaning.
L69547 +++$+++ u3912 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Good time, too.  Everyone but the bandits seem to be slacking off till after New Years'.
L69546 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time.
L69545 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Weird, huh?
L69544 +++$+++ u3912 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ No.  No glass on the inside.
L69543 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Damn those Carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows --
L69542 +++$+++ u3912 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Hmm.  Primitive ventilation.
L69967 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ One way to find out?
L69966 +++$+++ u3913 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ CATWOMAN +++$+++ You killed me, Batman killed me, Penguin killed me.  Three lives down.  Got enough bullets to finish me off?
L69965 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Was.
L69964 +++$+++ u3913 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ CATWOMAN +++$+++ He <u>is</u> Batman, you moron.
L69963 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Selina!  Selina Kyle!?  You're fired!  And Bruce -- Bruce Wayne! Why are you dressed up as Batman?
L69954 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Either you've caught a cold, or you're planning to kill me.
L69953 +++$+++ u3913 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ CATWOMAN +++$+++ Sorry, Max.  A die for a die.
L69952 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Let's make a deal.  <u>Other</u> than my blood, what can I off--
L69951 +++$+++ u3913 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ CATWOMAN +++$+++ A half-pint.  I'm talking gallons.
L69950 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ My blood?  I ... I gave at the office.
L69949 +++$+++ u3913 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ CATWOMAN +++$+++ Your blood, Max.
L69948 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I don't know what you want, but I know I can get it for you with a minimum of fuss.  Money, jewels, a very big ball of string...
L69818 +++$+++ u3917 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ PENGUIN +++$+++ The name is Oswald Cobblepot.
L69817 +++$+++ u3913 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ CATWOMAN +++$+++ Me, domesticated?  By you?  I doubt it!  You repulsive... awful... <u>penguin</u>.
L69816 +++$+++ u3913 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ CATWOMAN +++$+++ Did I?  Only 'cause my mom trained me to, with a man... any man, all men --  Corn dog!
L69815 +++$+++ u3917 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ PENGUIN +++$+++ I oughta have you spayed!  You sent out all the signals!
L69814 +++$+++ u3913 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ CATWOMAN +++$+++ I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.
L69813 +++$+++ u3917 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ PENGUIN +++$+++ Let's consummate our fiendish union!
L69721 +++$+++ u3913 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ CATWOMAN +++$+++ I want in.  The thought of busting Batman makes me feel all ... dirty.  Maybe I'll give myself a bath right here ...
L69720 +++$+++ u3917 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ PENGUIN +++$+++ Well, a plan <u>is</u> forming ... A vicious one, involving the loss of innocent life ...
L69719 +++$+++ u3913 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ CATWOMAN +++$+++ He napalmed my arm.  He knocked me off a building just when I was starting to feel good about myself. I want to play an integral part in his degradation.
L69718 +++$+++ u3913 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ CATWOMAN +++$+++ You're off the hook, Ozzie.  But Batman is decidedly <u>not</u>.
L69717 +++$+++ u3917 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ PENGUIN +++$+++ Thanks.  Jeez.  Not used to this man-woman, cat-mouse business. Generally the babes flock to me, I tell 'em take a number.
L69711 +++$+++ u3913 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ CATWOMAN +++$+++ You're quick.  Mayor Cobblepot.
L69710 +++$+++ u3917 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ PENGUIN +++$+++ Y'mean frame him?
L69709 +++$+++ u3913 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ CATWOMAN +++$+++ He'd have more power as a martyr. No, to destroy Batman we must first turn him into what he hates most.  Meaning, us.
L69708 +++$+++ u3917 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ PENGUIN +++$+++ We're gonna disassemble his spiffy old Batmobile, then reassemble it as an H-bomb on wheels.  Capiche? Yesterday's victor is tomorrow's vapor.
L69707 +++$+++ u3917 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ PENGUIN +++$+++ Oh, him again.  He's already history -- check it out.
L69706 +++$+++ u3913 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ CATWOMAN +++$+++ I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
L69705 +++$+++ u3917 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ PENGUIN +++$+++ Are you perchance a registered voter?  I'm also a mayoral prospect.
L69703 +++$+++ u3917 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ PENGUIN +++$+++ Huh?  You're implying I'm some kinda psycho criminal?
L69702 +++$+++ u3913 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ CATWOMAN +++$+++ Batman.  The thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment.
L69701 +++$+++ u3917 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ PENGUIN +++$+++ Appetite for destruction? Contempt for the czars of fashion? Wait don't tell me ... Naked sexual charisma?
L69700 +++$+++ u3913 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ CATWOMAN +++$+++ Down, Oswald.  We have to talk.  You see we've got something in common.
L69699 +++$+++ u3917 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ PENGUIN +++$+++ I'll warm ya!  I got hot mitts --!
L69589 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Women... nothing surprises me, Chip. Excepting your late mother... Who even knew Selina had a brain to damage?  Bottom line:  she tries to blackmail us, we drop her out a higher window.  Meanwhile I got badder fish to fry.  Yeah -- Oswald, please.
L69588 +++$+++ u3914 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ CHIP +++$+++ You buy this "blurry" business?
L69539 +++$+++ u3914 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ CHIP +++$+++ PMS.
L69538 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Yes.  <u>Yes</u>.  Boyfriend trouble ..?
L69537 +++$+++ u3914 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ CHIP +++$+++ She jumped.  She'd been depressed.
L69536 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I ... it was terrible, I leaned over, and accidentally knocked her, out --
L69417 +++$+++ u3914 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ CHIP +++$+++ Dad!  Save yourself!
L69416 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Son!
L69941 +++$+++ u3915 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ FAT CLOWN +++$+++ My lips are sealed.
L69940 +++$+++ u3917 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ PENGUIN +++$+++ But who could've ... no, don't say it.
L69939 +++$+++ u3915 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ FAT CLOWN +++$+++ Well, um... funny thing, your penguins... they're not responding to the launch command.  Fact they're kind of turned around now... Like someone jammed our signal...
L69935 +++$+++ u3915 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ FAT CLOWN +++$+++ All is shrill, all is blight...
L69934 +++$+++ u3917 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ PENGUIN +++$+++ Silent night, violent night...
L69933 +++$+++ u3915 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ FAT CLOWN +++$+++ ... eight, seven...
L69932 +++$+++ u3917 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ PENGUIN +++$+++ The Christmas Eve of Destruction -- !
L69931 +++$+++ u3915 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ FAT CLOWN +++$+++ Ten, nine...
L69907 +++$+++ u3917 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ PENGUIN +++$+++ Okay, you have a point.  Plus, the hysterics are getting on my nerves.
L69906 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I'm the one you want!  Penguin, please!  Ask yourself:  Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  Isn't it Max, not Chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
L69905 +++$+++ u3917 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ PENGUIN +++$+++ I don't.  So, no.
L69904 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Not Chip!  Please!  Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead.
L69903 +++$+++ u3917 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ PENGUIN +++$+++ You're coming with me, you Great White Dope!  To die, way down in the sewer!
L69847 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I think you'd feel out of place at my party.  You see, it's for winners.
L69846 +++$+++ u3917 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ PENGUIN +++$+++ Max!  Relax!  Josh and Jen'll put a spin on this.  We'll talk it over tonight, at your costume par--
L69831 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Point is, listen to them.  They've lost faith in old symbols. They're ready to bond with you, the icon of the future.  If it works, don't fix it...
L69830 +++$+++ u3917 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ PENGUIN +++$+++ He didn't even lose a limb, an eyeball ... bladder control ..
L69633 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Imagine:  You'll have the ear of the media.  Access to captains of industry.  Unlimited poon- tang ...
L69632 +++$+++ u3917 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ PENGUIN +++$+++ Reclaim my birthright, y'mean?
L69631 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Sidetracked?  Oswald, this is your chance to fulfill a destiny that your parents carelessly discarded ...
L69630 +++$+++ u3917 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ PENGUIN +++$+++ I got my own ... <u>quest</u> to pursue up here.  It's crucial I not get sidetracked, with some silly ...
L69629 +++$+++ u3917 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ PENGUIN +++$+++ ... Want 'em to go apeshit.  Nutso. Ballistic ... Do permanent damage to little old ladies.  Loot, pillage, annoy people in a big way ...  <u>Sounds</u> fun.  But I ...
L69628 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Precisely.  But they must come and go via the plumbing ducts that I've provided.  That shall be as sacred as the separation between church and state.
L69626 +++$+++ u3917 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ PENGUIN +++$+++ "You're doin' great, Mayor Cobblepot."  "Your table is ready, Mayor Cobblepot."  "I need you, Oswald.  I need you now.  That's the biggest parasol I ever --"
L69625 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ That's fine, Oswald.  But to get the Mayor recalled, we still need a catalyst, a trigger, an incident. Like the Reichstag fire, the Gulf of Tonkin.
L69624 +++$+++ u3917 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ PENGUIN +++$+++ A platform?  Lemme see ... Stop global warming.  Start global cooling.  Make the world a colder place.  <u>Frigid</u> ...
L69623 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Oswald:  We need one more thing.
L69622 +++$+++ u3917 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ PENGUIN +++$+++ I could teach her my "French flipper" trick...
L69621 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ We need signatures.  To overturn the ballot.  I can supply those, Oswald.
L69620 +++$+++ u3917 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ PENGUIN +++$+++ Wonder if it's worth my time.
L69610 +++$+++ u3917 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ PENGUIN +++$+++ Max, elections happen in November. Is this not late December, or have I inhaled too much swamp gas in my time?
L69609 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Yes, adulation is a cross to bear. God knows <u>I</u> know.  But someone's got to supplant our standing-in- the-way-of-progress Mayor and don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot, you've got the magic!
L69608 +++$+++ u3917 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ PENGUIN +++$+++ Bu ... wh ... I ... I mean ...
L69606 +++$+++ u3917 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ PENGUIN +++$+++ A big bag of fan mail?  Filthy lucre?  Wait don't tell me ... Is it a broad?
L69605 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Don't look, Oswald.  It's a surprise.
L69469 +++$+++ u3917 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ PENGUIN +++$+++ You won't regret this, Mr. Shreck.
L69468 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You know what, Mr. ... Penguin-Sir? I think perhaps I could help orchestrate a little welcome-home scenario for you.  And once we're both back home, perhaps we can help each other out ...
L69466 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Fred.  Fred?  He's ... actually he's been on an extended vacation, and --
L69465 +++$+++ u3917 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ PENGUIN +++$+++ A lot of tape and a little patience make all the difference.  By the way, how's Fred Adkins, your old partner?
L69464 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ If there were such documents -- and that is not an admission -- I would have seen to it they were shredded.
L69463 +++$+++ u3917 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ PENGUIN +++$+++ What about the documents that prove you own half the firetraps in Gotham?
L69462 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Yawn.  That coulda come from anywhere.
L69460 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ And exactly <u>why</u> am <u>I</u> gonna help <u>you</u>?
L69459 +++$+++ u3917 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ PENGUIN +++$+++ Most of all, I want to find out who I am.  By finding my parents. Learning my "human" name.  Simple stuff that the good people of Gotham take for granted.
L69455 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Well it's not working.
L69454 +++$+++ u3917 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ PENGUIN +++$+++ No, just give you a splitting headache.
L69453 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ What, is that supposed to "hypnotize" me?
L69449 +++$+++ u3917 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ PENGUIN +++$+++ Quiet, Max.  What do you think, this is a conversation?
L69448 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ My god ... it's true.  The Penguin- Man of the sewers ... Please, don't h--
L69447 +++$+++ u3917 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ PENGUIN +++$+++ Actually this is all just a bad dream.  You're home in bed. Heavily sedated, resting comfortably, and dying from the carcinogens you've personally spewed in a lifetime of profiteering. Tragic irony or poetic justice? You tell me.
L69685 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ Actually I have to split.  Take a "personal day."  You don't mind? Max, you're tops.
L69684 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I damn well better be.  In fact I want you to phone those goniffs over at Gotham Insurance and tell them --
L69683 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ Morning, Max.  Bummer about the store.  You insured?
L69564 +++$+++ u3916 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Uh, Selina, this is, uh, Bruce Wayne.
L69563 +++$+++ u3918 +++$+++ m259 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ That's my name, Maximillions. Don't wear it out, babe, or I'll make you buy me a new one.
