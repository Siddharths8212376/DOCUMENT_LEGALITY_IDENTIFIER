L157745 +++$+++ u4777 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHET +++$+++ What are you doing?!
L157743 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Chet...
L157742 +++$+++ u4777 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHET +++$+++ Stop what?
L157741 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Don't stop.
L157740 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ You know,
L157739 +++$+++ u4777 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHET +++$+++ It does?  What?
L157738 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Oh Chet, that feels fabulous,
L157358 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Nice meeting you, Knox.  Bye, Gin.
L157357 +++$+++ u4777 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHET +++$+++ Chris.  We got it.  Let's go.
L157347 +++$+++ u4777 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHET +++$+++ It's not all right.  Come on, Dad
L157346 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ It's all right, Chet.
L158005 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ It's just for a little while. You promised.
L158004 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ I have to go home. Chet might call.
L157986 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ My Word
L157985 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ What is that?
L157984 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Dead Poets honor.
L157983 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Knox, if you promise that this will be the end of it-
L157982 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Chet won't know anything.  We'll sit in back and sneak away as soon as it's over.
L157981 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ God, if Chet found out he'd...
L157980 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ I promise.  Dead Poets honor.  Come with me tonight, then if you don't want to see me again, I swear I'll bow out.
L157979 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L157978 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Just give me one chance.  If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever.
L157977 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Knox, you are so infuriating!
L157976 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Then come with me.
L157975 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Chet?  To a play? Are you kidding?
L157974 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Are you going with Chet?
L157973 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Look, I've got to go.  I'm gonna be late for the play.
L157972 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Then you wouldn't be here warning me about Chet.
L157971 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ And if it so happens that you're wrong? If it just so happens that I could care less About you?
L157970 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Of course just like that.  That's how you always know when it's right.
L157969 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Just like that?!  You just knew?
L157968 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Of course I know you!  From the first time I saw you, I knew you had a wonderful soul.
L157966 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ You say that over and over but you don't even know me!
L157965 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ But I love you.
L157964 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Well, you did!  Chet found out and he's nuts.  It took everything I could do to keep him from coming here and killing you. You have to stop this stuff, Knox.
L157963 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ I didn't mean to make a fool of you.
L157962 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Oh, but it's fine for you to come barging into my school and make a complete fool out of me?
L157961 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ If they catch you here, we'll both be in big trouble.
L157960 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ You can't be in here.
L157959 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Knox, why are you doing this to me?
L157958 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Chris!
L157935 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ All I'm asking you to do is listen.  "The heavens made a girl named Chris, With hair and skin of gold To touch her would be paradise To kiss her glory untold."
L157934 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Knox, I don't believe this!
L157931 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Knox, you're crazy.
L157930 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ I don't care.  I love you, Chris.  You deserve better than Chet and I'm it. Please accept these.
L157929 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ If Chet sees you, he'll kill you, don't you know that?
L157927 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Knox!  what are you doing here?
L157926 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Chris!
L157736 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Huh?
L157735 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ carpe breastum.  Seize the breast.
L157671 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ I gotta find Chet.  Make yourself at home.
L157670 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ But, Chris...
L157669 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Ginny Danburry's here.  Look for her.
L157668 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ No.
L157667 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Oh, hi.  I'm glad you made it.  Did you bring anybody?
L157613 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ I'll be there.  The Danburrys.  Friday night.  Thank you, Chris.
L157612 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Chet's parents don't know about it, so please keep it quiet.  But you can bring someone if you like.
L157611 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Well, sure!
L157610 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ You are?  She's glad I called!
L157609 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Knox.  Oh yes, Knox.  I'm glad you called.
L157608 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.
L157607 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Hello?
L157353 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ You going out for the Henley Hall play?  They're doing "A Midsummer Night's Dream."
L157352 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Sort of.
L157351 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ That's your sister school, right?
L157350 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Ridgeway High.  How's Henley Hall, Gin?
L157349 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ So, uh, where are you in school?
L157342 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ The pleasure is mine.
L157341 +++$+++ u4778 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Pleased to meet you.
L157872 +++$+++ u4780 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ HAGER +++$+++ That goes for all of you.  Now eat with your correct hands.
L157871 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Yes sir.
L157870 +++$+++ u4780 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ HAGER +++$+++ Mr. Overstreet, I suggest you worry less about breaking old habits and more about developing good study habits.  Do you understand?
L157869 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ They perpetuate mechanical living, sir. They limit your mind.
L157868 +++$+++ u4780 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ HAGER +++$+++ What is wrong with old habits, Mr. Overstreet?
L157867 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ We thought it would be good to break old habits, sir.
L158007 +++$+++ u4783 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MEEKS +++$+++ "We went to the woods because we wanted to suck all the marrow out of life." Anybody want to read?
L158006 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ We used to meet here on special occasions. Who would like to convene the meeting?
L157833 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Rahesh Non never existed, Mr. Meeks. You make him or someone like him up.  No self important college professor such as this one would dare admit ignorance of such an obviously important figure and you will probably receive a comment similar to the one I received:
L157832 +++$+++ u4783 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MEEKS +++$+++ Oh Captain, My Captain.  What if we don't know anything about someone like Rahesh Non?
L157557 +++$+++ u4783 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MEEKS +++$+++ Oh, Captain, My Captain. Is there poetry in math?
L157556 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ And don't limit poetry to the word. Poetry can be found in a work of art, music, a photograph, in the way a meal is prepared--anything with the stuff of revelation in it.  It can exist in the most everyday things but it must never, never be ordinary  By all means, write about the sky or a girl's smile but when you do, let your poetry conjure up salvation day, doomsday, any day, I don't care, as long as it enlightens us, thrills us and--if it's inspired--makes us feel a bit immortal.
L157385 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Precisely, Meeks. Greek for the herd. However, be warned that, when you say "the hoi polloi" you are actually saying the the herd.  Indicating that you too are "hoi polloi."
L157384 +++$+++ u4783 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MEEKS +++$+++ The hoi polloi.  Doesn't it mean the herd?
L157310 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Seize the day while you're young, see that you make use of your time.  Why does the poet write these lines?
L157309 +++$+++ u4783 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MEEKS +++$+++ Meeks.
L157308 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Very good, Mr._?
L157307 +++$+++ u4783 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MEEKS +++$+++ Carpe Diem... seize the day.
L157306 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.  The Latin term for that sentiment is "Carpe Diem." Anyone know what that means?
L157814 +++$+++ u4786 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NOLAN +++$+++ At these boys' age? Not on your life! Tradition, John.  Discipline.  Prepare them for college, and the rest will take care of itself.
L157813 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ I always thought education was learning to think for yourself.
L157812 +++$+++ u4786 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NOLAN +++$+++ John, the curriculum here is set.  It's proven.  It works.  If you question it, what's to prevent them from doing the same?
L157811 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Oh that. That was an exercise to prove a point.  About the evils of conformity.
L157810 +++$+++ u4786 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NOLAN +++$+++ Boys marching.  Clapping in unison.
L157809 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Courtyard?
L157808 +++$+++ u4786 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NOLAN +++$+++ What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
L157807 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Your reprimand made quite an impression I'm sure.
L157806 +++$+++ u4786 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NOLAN +++$+++ English.  Way before your time.  It was hard giving it up, I'll tell you.  I'm hearing rumors, John, of some unusual teaching methods in your classroom.  I'm not saying they have anything to do with the Dalton boy's outburst, but I don't think I have to warn you that boys his age are very impressionable.
L157805 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ I didn't know you taught.
L157804 +++$+++ u4786 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NOLAN +++$+++ This was my first classroom, John, did you know that?  My first desk.
L158009 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ I have something.
L158008 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Come on boys, don't be shy.
L157589 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ From the moment we enter crying to the moment we leave dying,  It will cover just your head as you wail and cry and scream!
L157588 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Don't stop!
L157587 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Stretch it, pull it, it will never cover any of us.  Kick at it, beat at it, it will never be enough-
L157585 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ His hands reach out and choke me All the time he mumbles slowly.  Truth... Truth is like a blanket that always leaves your feet cold.
L157584 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Excellent!  Have him act.  Give it rhythm!
L157583 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain.
L157582 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ A sweaty-toothed madman
L157581 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ I... I close my eyes.  His image floats beside me.
L157580 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Now there's the poet speaking!  Close your eyes and think of the picture. Describe what you see.  NOW!
L157579 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ A... A  sweaty-toothed madman.
L157578 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Use your imagination!  First thing that pops to your mind, even if it's gibberish!
L157577 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ A crazy madman.
L157576 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ A madman.  Perhaps he was.  What kind of madman?  Don't think!  Answer.
L157575 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ A madman.
L157574 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Todd, there's a picture of Whitman over the door.  What does he remind you Of? Quickly, Anderson, don't think about it.
L157573 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ All right!  Very good!  There's a barbarian in there after all!
L157572 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ AHHHHHH!
L157571 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ LOUDER!
L157570 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ YAWP!
L157569 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Again!  Louder!
L157568 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Yawp!
L157567 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Good god, boy! Yell!
L157566 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ A barbaric yawp.
L157565 +++$+++ u4788 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ A yawp?
L157948 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Yeah.  He didn't like it one bit but at least he's letting me stay in the play. Of course, he won't be able to come. He'll be in Chicago on business.  But I think he's gonna let me stay with acting.  As long as I keep my grades up.
L157947 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Really?  You told your father what you told me?  You let him see your passion for acting?
L157946 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Yeah.
L157945 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ What did your father say? Did you talk to him?
L157914 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Not if you're going to stay true to yourself.
L157913 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Isn't there an easier way?
L157912 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Give your father the benefit of the doubt.  Talk to him.  Let him see who you are.
L157911 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Eighteen!  That's two years!  What about the play?  The performance is tomorrow night!
L157910 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Well, if it's more than a whim, then you'll have to prove that to him.  You'll have to show him with your passion and commitment that it's what you really want to do.  If that doesn't work, at least by then you'll be eighteen and able to do what you want.
L157909 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ I know what he'll say.  He'll say that acting is just a whim and that it's frivolous and that I should forget about it.  He'll tell me how they're counting on me and to put it out of my mind "for my own good."
L157908 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Neil, I know this seems impossible but you have to go to your father and show him what you're feeling.  You have to let him see who you are-  It's your only chance.
L157907 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Then you're playing a part for him too, aren't you?  A dangerously self- destructive one.
L157906 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Are you kidding?  He'd kill me!
L157905 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ You can't live a life for someone else, Neil.  You can only live for yourself. Have you told your father what you just told me?  Have you shown him your passion about acting?
L157904 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Mr. Keating, my father is making me quit the play at Henley Hall.  When I think about carpe diem and all that, I feel like I'm in prison!  I mean, I can see his point.  We're not a rich family like Charlie's.  But he's planned the rest of my life for me and he's never even asked me what I want!
L157903 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Ah, but I am seeing the world, Neil. The new world.  Seeing a student like you take root and bloom.  It's worth everything.  That's why I came back here. A place like this needs at least one teacher like me.  Did you come here to talk about my teaching?
L157902 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Why do you do it?  I mean, with all this seize-the-day business, I'd have thought you'd be out seeing the world or something?
L157901 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Maybe they don't want worldly things distracting me from my teaching.
L157900 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Gosh, they don't give you much room around here, do they?
L157893 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Actually, I'd like to talk to you alone.
L157892 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Okay.
L157891 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Oh Captain, My Captain, we came here so I could talk to you about something.
L157414 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ All poetry was acceptable.  The name simply referred to the fact, that to join the organization, you had to be dead.
L157413 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ What did the name mean.  Did you only read dead poets.
L157407 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Nothing wrong with research.
L157406 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ I was just looking in an old annual and...
L157405 +++$+++ u4781 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KEATING +++$+++ Ah, so you boy's have been snooping.
L157404 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Mr. Keating? Sir? Oh Captain My Captain.  What was the Dead Poets Society?
L157941 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ I don't know.
L157940 +++$+++ u4787 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ PITTS +++$+++ All right!  What'd she say?
L157923 +++$+++ u4787 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ PITTS +++$+++ Nuwanda recited poetry to Gloria and she jumped all over him... right, Nuwanda?
L157922 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ She won't even see me, Pitts.
L157921 +++$+++ u4787 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ PITTS +++$+++ Why don't you read it to her? It worked for Nuwanda.
L157920 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Damn.  Damn!  If I could just get Chris to read this poem!
L157376 +++$+++ u4787 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ PITTS +++$+++ You have another choice.
L157375 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ You really think I should forget her?
L157371 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ I can't just forget her, Pitts.  And I certainly can't think about math!
L157370 +++$+++ u4787 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ PITTS +++$+++ All the good ones go for jerks, you know that.  Forget her.  Take out your trig book and figure out problem twelve.
L157369 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ It's not too bad.  It's a tragedy! Why does she have to be in love with a jerk?!
L157368 +++$+++ u4787 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ PITTS +++$+++ Too bad.
L157603 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ I'm calling her!
L157602 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Where are you going?
L157515 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ But she's in love with: the moron son of my father's best friend.  What would the dead poets say about that?
L157514 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ You know what the dead poets would say: Gather ye rosebuds while ye may...
L157367 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ She's practically engaged to Chet Danburry.  Mr. Mondo Jocko himself.
L157366 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Are you crazy? What's wrong with that?
L157326 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Listen, anything's, better than mystery meat.
L157325 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ They're friends of my dad.  Probably in their nineties or something.
L157278 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ What I have to do.  Screw the annual.
L157277 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ All right.  Jesus, what are you gonna do?
L157274 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Yeah, you just do everything they say! You'll be in daddy's law firm as sure as I'm standing here.  And you'll be approving loans till you croak.
L157273 +++$+++ u4782 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ KNOX +++$+++ Wait a minute.  I don't let my parents walk on me.
L157525 +++$+++ u4783 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MEEKS +++$+++ Good luck.
L157524 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ I gotta get to the tryouts.  Wish me luck.
L157469 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ God, I want to do everything!  I'm going to explode.
L157468 +++$+++ u4783 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MEEKS +++$+++ If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost.  That is where they should be.  Now put foundations under them.
L157433 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Then you can help him.
L157432 +++$+++ u4783 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MEEKS +++$+++ His grades are hurting, Charlie.
L157397 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Nothing.  No mention of it.
L157396 +++$+++ u4783 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MEEKS +++$+++ Any group pictures in the annual?
L157280 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Screw it all.  I don't give a damn about any of it.
L157279 +++$+++ u4783 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MEEKS +++$+++ I certainly wouldn't lose any sleep over it.  It's just a bunch of people trying to impress Nolan.
L157861 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Yes sir.
L157860 +++$+++ u4784 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MR. PERRY +++$+++ I don't care if the world is coming to an end tomorrow night, you are through with that play!  Is that clear?  Is that clear!
L157859 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Father, I have the main part.  The performance is tomorrow night.  Father, please.
L157858 +++$+++ u4784 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MR. PERRY +++$+++ Did you really think I wouldn't find out?!  "My niece is in a play with your son," Mrs. Marks says.  "You must be mistaken," I say.  "My son isn't in a play."  You made a liar out of me, Neil! Now you will go tomorrow and tell them you are quitting.
L157857 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Nobody-  I thought I'd surprise you. I've got all As and-
L157856 +++$+++ u4784 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MR. PERRY +++$+++ Don't you dare talk back to me!  It's bad enough that you've wasted your time with this absurd acting business.  But you deliberately deceived me!  Who put this in your head? How did you expect to get away with it? Answer me!
L157855 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Father, I--
L157854 +++$+++ u4784 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MR. PERRY +++$+++ Neil, you are going to quit this ridiculous play immediately.

L157267 +++$+++ u4785 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Yes sir.
L157266 +++$+++ u4784 +++$+++ m318 +++$+++ MR. PERRY +++$+++ You know what this means to your mother, don't you?
