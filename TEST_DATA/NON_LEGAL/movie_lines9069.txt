L227622 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ No.  That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.
L227621 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.
L227620 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Yeah, explain it to me. I need an explanation. What's the matter with you?
L227616 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ What the fuck is she doin' there?!
L227615 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ She's in the other room.
L227614 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin' woman, the hostage. Where the fuck is she, Richard!?
L227613 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ What?
L227612 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Where's the woman?
L227611 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ I heard it on the radio. We gotta get our asses into Mexico tonight. Carlos is gonna meet us tomorrow morning at a rendezvous on the other side, then Carlos and his boys will escort us to El Ray and --
L227610 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ How do you know?
L227609 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin' worse before it gets any fuckin' better. We showed our ass in Texas. We killed Texas fuckin' Rangers. They ain't gonna stop lookin' till they find us, and when they find us, they're gonna kill us. Texans take it very personal when ya kill their law enforcement officers. The El Paso police have already started a motel and hotel search for us.
L227608 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Look, fuck the border. Let's just dig in and wait for things to cool down.
L227607 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ I gotta figure a way to get across that goddamn border. Longer we fuck around El Paso our lives ain't worth a shit.
L227606 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ They're going to apprehend us in forty-eight hours.
L227605 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Yeah, I saw the border. Through binoculars from on top of a high building. That's about as close as I risked getting. What's the TV say?
L227604 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Didya look at the border?
L227603 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Cops.
L227602 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ What'd ya see?
L227601 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Sight seein'.
L227600 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Shit, I started to get worried. Where the fuck ya been?
L227550 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ -- This conversation is over.
L227549 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ All I'm saying --
L227548 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ These guys ain't spic firecracker salesman from Tijuana. They don't even know the meaning of the word "barter".  You wanna stay in El Ray? You give them thirty percent of your loot. It's scripture. So it is written, so shall it be done. You want sanctuary, you pay the price, and the price is thirty percent.
L227547 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Did you even to try to negotiate?
L227546 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ That's their standard deal, brother. They ain't about to change it for us.
L227545 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Hey, when you talk to him, see if you can arrange a better deal than thirty percent.
L227541 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ I'm gonna go get the money.
L227540 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Feels good.
L227539 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ I got both rooms on either side of us, so we don't gotta worry about eavesdropping assholes. How's that feel? You okay?
L227538 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ How ya think, it hurts like a son-of- a-bitch.
L227537 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ How's it feel?
L227530 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ They don't have anything except four walls and a roof, and that's all we need.
L227529 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Do they have a waterbed?
L227528 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ No.
L227527 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Do they have an X-rated channel?
L227526 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ No.
L227525 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Do they have cable?
L227487 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ He didn't recognize shit.
L227486 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us.
L227485 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ What did I tell you? What did I tell you? Buy the road map and leave.
L227484 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ One... Two... Three.
L227483 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Gotcha!
L227482 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!
L227481 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Yeah?
L227478 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ I'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot! I told you that bastard said, "Help us!"
L227477 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Richie? You okay?
L227476 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Shut up and start the car.
L227475 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ You believe me don't cha?
L227474 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Start the car.
L227473 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Seth, he did it. You were by the beer cooler with your back turned. I was by the magazines, I could see his face.  And I saw him mouth:
L227472 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ What the fuck is wrong with you --
L227468 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ He signaled the Ranger.
L227467 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ What the fuck was that about?
L228079 +++$+++ u1004 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ He's beyond our help. You saw him get bit. I saw him get bit. We all saw it. You can't help him. I've got no one left to lose but you. I can't be alone again. We're sticking together.
L228078 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ He needs our help!
L228077 +++$+++ u1004 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ He's right, Kate. Daddy's dead! He was too far away. If flinging that door and filling this room with those bat-things would save him, I'd fling it. The only thing it'll do is turn us into one of them.
L228050 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Actually, our best weapon against these satanic cocksuckers is this man.  He's a preacher.
L228049 +++$+++ u1004 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ You could take their head off.
L227950 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Go out and bring it in. I feel a song coming on.
L227949 +++$+++ u1004 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Yeah, it's mine.
L227948 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take it that's yours.
L227926 +++$+++ u1004 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Okay, I'll have one.
L227925 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ How 'bout you?  You are safer in here with us than wandering around a Mexican border town all night long. Just don't do nothin' stupid and we'll all get along fine.  Scotty, you sure you don't want a drink?
L242251 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ What'd you find, Kathy?
L242250 +++$+++ u1007 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ BLONDELL +++$+++ Wow...
L242249 +++$+++ u1007 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ BLONDELL +++$+++ Uh... don't see it.  There's no signature.  But hang on -- there's a note to "See Addendum."  Checking...
L242248 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Who signed as his "sponsoring officer"?
L242247 +++$+++ u1007 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ BLONDELL +++$+++ Got it.
L242246 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ "Wickwire, Thomas Dane."  See what you can find.
L242245 +++$+++ u1007 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ BLONDELL +++$+++ Okay, but... You didn't have to do what you did.  Not for me.
L242244 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Or rank.  But can you do me a favor and pull a transfer order?
L242243 +++$+++ u1007 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ BLONDELL +++$+++ Who's...  Lieuten --
L242242 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Don't say my name.
L242241 +++$+++ u1007 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ BLONDELL +++$+++ Administration, Ensign Blondell.
L241984 +++$+++ u1007 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ BLONDELL +++$+++ More than you'd guess.  It's just that we don't hold coffee klatches. If more then three of us get together at any one time, the guys think it's some kind of uprising.
L241983 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ But are there... I mean, how many...
L241982 +++$+++ u1007 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ BLONDELL +++$+++ Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
L241981 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ The woman I saw you with...
L241980 +++$+++ u1007 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ BLONDELL +++$+++ I've been accused of that wish.
L241979 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ I don't know if there's any single reason.  But my father was Navy. And he had this old-time recruiting poster in his den.  It showed a girl trying on a sailor's uniform while saying, "Gee, I wish I were a man! I'd join the Navy!"  Was maybe 10 years old when I first saw it, and even then it felt wrong.  Made me mad.  And I don't think a month has gone by that I haven't thought about that poster.  "Gee, I wish I were a man."
L241978 +++$+++ u1007 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ BLONDELL +++$+++ Just some of the women.
L241977 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Who's "we"?
L241976 +++$+++ u1007 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ BLONDELL +++$+++ Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this?  I mean, we're kinda curious.
L241975 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ That's what I hear.
L241974 +++$+++ u1007 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ BLONDELL +++$+++ They take you away to San Clemente Island.  Half the guys quit when they come back.  Supposed to be just hell-and-a-half.
L241669 +++$+++ u1007 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ BLONDELL +++$+++ No problem, lieutenant.
L241668 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Thank you, ensign.
L241667 +++$+++ u1007 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ BLONDELL +++$+++ B.O.Q., south side.  Take a starboard tack out the door.
L241889 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN +++$+++ Then set out the good plates, we'll all have lunch.  My office will follow up with details.  Jumping off, now...
L241888 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ C.O. +++$+++ Of course, but there's more --
L241887 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN +++$+++ "Security"?  What the hell you talkin' about?  Your base isn't secure?
L241886 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ C.O. +++$+++ Uh, V.I.P. security arrangements generally take some time, Senator.
L241881 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN +++$+++ Jordan, dear.  How are they treating you?
L241880 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ C.O. +++$+++ Standing right here in my office.
L241879 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN +++$+++ Awright.  How's our girl doin', anyway?
L241878 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ C.O. +++$+++ Your prerogative, Senator.
L241877 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN +++$+++ Well, seein's how this thing is out, you let me handle the r.p.m.  From this point forward, I want all press matters coordinated via my office. I'll be god-damned if I'm gonna watch Hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this one. Him or the President.  This my shade?  "Midnight Mahogany"? 'Cuz I'm comin' dangerously close to lookin' like Ronald Reagan here.
L241874 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN +++$+++ Are you truly mouthin' off to a senior member of the Senate Arms Committee?  I mean, I'll give you points for style -- just nothin' for smarts.
L241873 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ C.O. +++$+++ -- nothing I can do about it unless you're suggesting I infringe on their civil liberties -- which I'd happily do if you'll just trim a little fat off the Constitution.
L241872 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN +++$+++ -- and now I got reporters from Toadsquat, Iowa, calling my office and askin' what I know about this "G.I. Jane" thing.
L241871 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ C.O. +++$+++ Senator, they stand out on the public highway with telephoto lenses --
L241870 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN +++$+++ Commander, are you of the habit of letting photographers traipse around your base snappin' their fill? These were supposed to have been discreet test cases --
L242310 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ C.O. +++$+++ Basically -- he asked me if I could unring a bell.
L242309 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Sir?  What did he say?
L242308 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ C.O. +++$+++ Well, if you had to go over my head, lieutenant, that's the way to do it.  Christ, nothin' like a 0-200 call from the Commander and Chief to get the bowels movin'.
L242207 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Would you have the discretion to end it right then and there?
L242206 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ C.O. +++$+++ I'm not sure what --
L242205 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Sir.  If tomorrow... I was not under your command... would the inquiry still go forward?
L242204 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ C.O. +++$+++ I don't see how, O'Neil.  Dismissed.
L242203 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Sir, please... if there's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud...
L242202 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ C.O. +++$+++ I find this as distasteful as you, lieutenant.  But if it's on my desk, it's on my shoulders.  There's going to be an inquiry -- it will not be quick and it will definitely not be pretty.  You should prepare yourself.
L242201 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ I'm saying, we're just friends.
L242188 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Sir, if someone is suggesting that I'm a lesbian, they're wrong.
L242187 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ C.O. +++$+++ I don't know of any delicate way to say this, lieutenant, so I won't try.  Claims have been made that you have engaged in fraternization -- of the same-sex variety.  Specifically, that you were...  "... seen leaving the apartment of another female officer at such a time and in such a manner as to suggest conduct unbecoming."
L241894 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ C.O. +++$+++ Permission to evaporate, O'Neil.
L241893 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Permission to leave, sir?
L241891 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ C.O. +++$+++ "We'll all have lunch."  Good idea. Oh, and let's be sure to invite this sociologist, too -- just in case we want to have a FUCKING BRIDGE GAME AFTERWARDS!
L241890 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Sir, I want you to know that I had nothing to do with any of this.  Not this article, not --
L241876 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ C.O. +++$+++ You makin' friends with the press, lieutenant?
L241875 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ See me, sir?
L241800 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ C.O. +++$+++ You'll get everything you want, O'Neil.  Let's see if you want what you're gonna get.
L241799 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ So I'll get a fair shot?
L241798 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ C.O. +++$+++ Then good night.
L241797 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Wouldn't dream of it, sir.
L241796 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ C.O. +++$+++ And if you just happen to wash out, I won't have to contend with you bitchin' to some hairy-chested female Senator?  And please note I did not identify any one in particular.
L241795 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Across the board, sir.
L241794 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ C.O. +++$+++ Straight up?
L241793 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Same rules for everyone, sir.
L241792 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ C.O. +++$+++ Well.  'Least now we're talking the same language.  So one standard.  Is that what you're after?
L241791 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ The shape doesn't bother me.  It's just that goddamn rotten stench.
L241790 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ C.O. +++$+++ No, sir, WHAT?
L241789 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ No, sir.
L241788 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ C.O. +++$+++ What I resent, lieutenant, is some politician using my base as a test tube for her grand social experiment.  What I resent is the sensitivity training that is now mandatory for my men... the day-care center I have to build where an officer's lounge used to be... and the OB/GYN I have to keep on staff just so someone can keep track of your personal pap smears.  But most of all, lieutenant, I resent your perfume, however subtle it may be, competing with the aroma of my fine three-dollar-and-fifty- nine cent cigar, which I will happily put out this very instant if the phallic nature of it happens to offend your goddamn fragile sensibilities.  DOES IT?
L241787 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ I think you've resented me from the start, sir.
L241786 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ C.O. +++$+++ Did you just barge in here and curse at your base commander?  If so, I regard that as a bonafide brain- fart, and I resent it when people fart inside my home.
L241785 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Pardon?
L241784 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ C.O. +++$+++ Did you just have a brain-fart?
L241783 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ I can't afford civility, sir.  How am I supposed to fit in with these guys when you've got me set up as an outsider?  Even if I make it under these rules, I still lose, because there'll always be a flag in my file -- "Yeah, she made it, but..."  I mean, really -- why didn't you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around the base?
L241782 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ C.O. +++$+++ Because I was civil, now you're complaining.
L241781 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ It's this double-standard, the separate quarters, the deferential treatment.  It's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met.
L241780 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ C.O. +++$+++ Oh, really.
L241779 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ It's you, sir.  And it started the day I came here.
L241778 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ C.O. +++$+++ All right, lieutenant, give me a name and specifics, I'll have the X.O. file an action first thing in the morning.  A name?
L241777 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ C.O. +++$+++ Didn't take long.
L241776 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Pardon the hour, sir.  But you told me to come to you immediately if I felt I was being mistreated in any way.
L241685 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ C.O. +++$+++ If you were like everyone else, lieutenant, I suspect we wouldn't be making statements about not making statements, would we?  Take your leave.
L241684 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Sir, I just want you to know... I'm not here to make a statement.  I don't want to make men look foolish. All I care about is completing the training and getting operational experience -- just like everyone else, I suspect.
L241683 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ C.O. +++$+++ Then that's all I have to say. Dismissed.
L241682 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ None at this time, sir.
L241681 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ C.O. +++$+++ I'm not out to change your sex, lieutenant.  You'll have separate beds, separate heads.  If you have specific medical needs, inform the infirmary.  If a classmate or superior acts in an harassing or otherwise unbecoming manner, please inform me immediately so I can deal with it immediately.  Questions?
L241680 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Really, I have no problem with --
L241679 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ C.O. +++$+++ Don't worry about it.  If it's off your collar and out of your eyes, that's all I'm going to ask.
L241678 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Barber was my next stop, sir. Would've had it regulation sooner, only --
L241677 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Thank you, sir.  But I expect a certain amount of pain.
L241676 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ C.O. +++$+++ So.  We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training.  It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you.
L241675 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ I'm fine, sir.
L241674 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ C.O. +++$+++ Would you care for a beverage?  Tea?
L241673 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Thank you, sir.
L241672 +++$+++ u1008 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ C.O. +++$+++ Yes, of course.  Please, have a seat, lieutenant...
L242017 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ West?
L242016 +++$+++ u1009 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ CORTEZ +++$+++ Entering my scan now...
L242015 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Newberry, get a photo.  South?
L241905 +++$+++ u1009 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ CORTEZ +++$+++ No problem, sir!
L241904 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Fine by me, sir!
L241901 +++$+++ u1009 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ CORTEZ +++$+++ Motherachrist...
L241900 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Ah, c'mon...
L241757 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ Sir...
L241756 +++$+++ u1009 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ CORTEZ +++$+++ Aw, what is this...
L242370 +++$+++ u1018 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ MCCOOL +++$+++ O'Neil.  Our air's gonna crap out as soon as we get down there.  You know that, don't you?
L242369 +++$+++ u1009 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ CORTEZ +++$+++ What, we're gonna pry 'em out with paddles?
L242042 +++$+++ u1018 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ MCCOOL +++$+++ Fuck me.
L242041 +++$+++ u1009 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ CORTEZ +++$+++ Banditos on the east perimeter!  150 yards!  Shit, she was part of it!
L242035 +++$+++ u1018 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ MCCOOL +++$+++ Hey.  Ain't your call, man.
L242034 +++$+++ u1009 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ CORTEZ +++$+++ Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
L242033 +++$+++ u1018 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ MCCOOL +++$+++ I ain't gonna shoot her.
L242032 +++$+++ u1009 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ CORTEZ +++$+++ Smoke her.
L242031 +++$+++ u1018 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ MCCOOL +++$+++ Shit.  Think we're had.
L242160 +++$+++ u1011 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN'S AIDE +++$+++ Not that.  The White House just announced that it was sponsoring legislation that would, in one stroke, void all remaining elements of the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws.
L242159 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN +++$+++ She made it through S.E.R.E. training.  Got a call this morning from --
L242158 +++$+++ u1011 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN'S AIDE +++$+++ Did you hear?
L242157 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN +++$+++ Yes?
L241896 +++$+++ u1011 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN'S AIDE +++$+++ Congress and the Pentagon share a lot of plumbing.  They'll never know whose leak it is.
L241895 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN +++$+++ Think I overplayed it?
L241578 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN +++$+++ I'll act surprised.
L241577 +++$+++ u1011 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN'S AIDE +++$+++ White House boys want a private meeting.
L241573 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN +++$+++ That aside for the moment, I'm struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit of your report... the degrading remarks by other aviators... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior.  In my seven years on this committee, I've never seen a downed aviator treated like this.  Never.  I'm deeply disturbed by this report, Mr. Hayes.  Not just what it bodes for women in the military -- but for your own confirmation as well.
L241572 +++$+++ u1014 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ HAYES +++$+++ The commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier.
L241571 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN +++$+++ I'd like to think our next Secretary of the Navy would be prepared for anything, Mr. Hayes.
L241570 +++$+++ u1014 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ HAYES +++$+++ I'm really not prepared for any kind of in-depth review of --
L241569 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN +++$+++ Yes, I see your signature right here -- twice the size of everyone else's.  And your conclusion was "pilot error," hmm?
L241568 +++$+++ u1014 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ HAYES +++$+++ I was one member of the investigating commission.
L241567 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN +++$+++ The Navy's conclusion regarding the crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier.  Female aviator, it just so happens.  You're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am I right?
L241566 +++$+++ u1014 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ HAYES +++$+++ Madam Senator... this is an internal document of the U.S. Navy.  I must seriously question whether --
L241565 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN +++$+++ "The Lark Report."
L241564 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN +++$+++ Well, I'm just an old dame without much time left, so you'll pardon me if I jump right in here before they discontinue my blood-type.  I am deeply concerned over the Navy's seemingly incontrovertible attitude toward women in the military.  Case in point...
L241563 +++$+++ u1014 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ HAYES +++$+++ Hardly the case, Senator.
L241561 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN +++$+++ Whoa, whoa, whoa.  "Land-based maritime specialties." Gimme a second here to de-euphemize that...
L241560 +++$+++ u1014 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ HAYES +++$+++ ... last few years have brought many advances in the interests of women in naval service, particularly in the land-based maritime specialties. What's more, the Navy has instituted special sensitivity courses with an eye on --
L242303 +++$+++ u1010 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ DEHAVEN +++$+++ Well, I spoke with Mr. Hayes this morning myself -- and told him the deal was off.  No more test cases. He was only too happy to oblige.  Don't play politics with me, little darlin'.  You'd be up way past your bedtime.
L242302 +++$+++ u1017 +++$+++ m66 +++$+++ JORDAN +++$+++ You know, I wonder what the SecNav would think about it.  If I spoke with him.
