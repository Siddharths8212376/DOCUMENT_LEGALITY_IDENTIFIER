L424175 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ I'm not telling 'til you straighten up. You been acting like fucking Jerry Lewis on me and this shit's gotta stop or you can forget about your Betty... I mean it.
L424174 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What?
L424173 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ I'm not telling.
L424172 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Where? Where is she?
L424171 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Well, guess what? I found Betty... where she's been, anyway.
L424114 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Yes, I am and we're not going. Act professional.
L424113 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Every American should see the Grand Canyon. Are you an American?
L424112 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Do you hear yourself right now...? Like a fucking madman...
L424111 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ "When I grow up I'm going to become a nurse or a veterinarian. I always want to help people and value all life, be it animal, plant or mineral..."  Does that sound like a goddamn showgirl to you?
L424110 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ I said, 'No.' N-O.
L424109 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What difference does it make? She wasn't in Kansas City, or Houston, or Dallas. We went to every goddamn place Del mentioned and no Betty. So what the hell makes you think she's in Vegas? You think she's waiting for us with tassles on her titties? Vegas is too crass for Betty.
L424108 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ No... be dark before we get there. You wanna see the Grand Canyon at night?
L424107 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.
L424106 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ No.
L424105 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ It's a very moving experience, trust me.
L424104 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.
L424103 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ We should go.
L424038 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Not so fast! Slower... 'blonde, thin', yes... Did they say she had style? A kind of grace or anything?
L424037 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
L424036 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ How'd they describe her?
L424031 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ I don't know, but when we find her she's gonna die for it.
L424030 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I dunno... something.  Why is she doing this to me? Why?...
L424029 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ What? What does she represent?! What could some cornbread white bitch from Kansas who's dragging our sorry asses up and down the Louisiana Purchase possibly mean to you?!! I'd just love to know...
L424027 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ I'm sick of looking at her mother- fucking face.
L424026 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ That was a really shitty thing to do.
L424025 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ What the hell's the matter with you?
L424024 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You don't look comfortable here. That's 'cause you don't like being the center of attention, do you? Nah. You're like me.
L423989 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Well, I should be in FLORIDA now! If Carl hadn't gone in to get those stones removed, you wouldn't be here and I'd be on my way to the Keys. On my boat, RELAXING WITH A GLASS OF PORT!! Re-ti red!
L423988 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Worse... you're in Texas.
L423987 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Do I deserve this? In the twilight of my career, do I deserve this? I don't think so! I've always tried to do what's right. I never took out anybody who didn't have it coming. I'm a professional!  AND WHERE THE FUCK AM I? I'M IN PURGATORY!
L423986 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ AND TURN THAT FUCKING MUSIC OFF!
L423985 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ I know that.
L423984 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ That woman could be in any one of four states. Four big states where the deer and the antelope play, Wesley! We're not in Rhode Island!
L423983 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ There it is again. That lousy attitude that got us here in the first place. That "make a statement," do an end zone dance, shake your ass and sue everybody in sight attitude that's dragging this whole country down the drain.  They don't owe us shit, Wesley! WHEN YOU FINISH THE JOB, YOU GET PAID!! WE HAVEN'T FINISHED THE GODDAMN JOB!!
L423982 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ They paid us half. They still owe us half...
L423981 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What?
L423980 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Half.
L423979 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ They said find it. Find her, find it. Finish the job you were paid to do.
L423938 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ ...She's got class, and poise. Lots of poise...
L423937 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Okay, thank you, goodbye... Keep in touch...
L423934 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Betty would never dress like that. She's not some trailer park slut!
L423933 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Let's get out of here. We got another long drive ahead of us.  ...the fuck where I do not know, but I know it's gonna be long.
L423927 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You're always so coarse... "Do her right here." Let's just see what happens, okay?  "I wish that I could find a way; To speak my thoughts on Mother's Day. There are no words that quite express; My gratitude or happiness. A pleasant smile perhaps a kiss; I would not fail to give her this. I'd make her glad the whole day through; By sayin' 'Mother', I love you!' P.S. I wish I could say this to my mother's face, but I can't anymore."
L423926 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ And then we're gonna do her right here. Right?
L423925 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ It's not an exact science, Wesley. He said they'll be here... My Houston contact has always been very reliable.
L423924 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Thas' it, thas' it... conquer that bitch.  What time're they coming?
L423880 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Well, then, did you ever get any indication that she wanted to leave her husband?
L423879 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Wise beyond her years, I'm sure, and such poise, too.  Very, very impressive...
L423852 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ No,... like a worthy adversary, Wesley. Like a very worthy adversary.
L423851 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Like... us?
L423850 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Oh, for Chrissakes. It just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night.
L423849 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ So what the fuck's a Finn?
L423848 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Betty, Betty, Betty...
L423847 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You should read more. Listen to me. I think this woman was waiting for a chance to do this, and we gave it to her. She kept to herself for years, living with a pompous asshole. Then she sees her opportunity, and BOOM! -- she leaves that little mudpatch in the dust. These heartlanders can't figure it out, 'cause that's not their sweet little Betty. Hah! We've been tracking her for, what, three days and I already understand her better'n most the people in that shitty little burg.
L423846 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ A 'Finn?' What is a Finn?
L423845 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ No, I see Betty as a Midwestern Stoic type. Ice water in her veins. A clear thinker. Probably a Swede or a Finn.
L423841 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Yeah, well, if the wife's trying to sell it she'll fuck up. She's an amateur, just like Del was.
L423840 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I'd say that about torches her credibility, wouldn't you?
L423839 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ ...among others.
L423838 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Joyce was screwing Del.
L423837 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ You think so? Joyce says she's timid.
L423836 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ So she gets rid of the asshole and is set for life in the same day.
L423737 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ ...I know I am. Let's just do what we gotta do here, and get the fuck gone.
L423736 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I hope you're right...
L423735 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ I can eat because I know we didn't kidnap that woman. I can eat because they aren't looking for us. And I can eat 'cause I'm fucking hungry...  ...relax. She's gonna end up on a milk carton and that's about it.
L423734 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Maybe you don't appreciate the gravity of this situation. It's bad enough that we don't have what we came here for. It's worse that we don't know where it is. And now this.  This was supposed to be my last job. I already put the deposit down on my boat.  How can you eat at a time like this? I get nauseous just watching you...
L423730 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ We don't. But a '97 Le Sabre'll be easy to find if it's here, town this size...  He said he gave his wife some car as a gift, remember?
L423729 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ So how do we know that car's still in Fair Oaks?
L423709 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You have to rise above it. The professionals rise above that kind of thing...
L423708 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
L423707 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What the hell was that, another statement?
L423702 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Wait. Any last words, General Lee?
L423701 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Should I kill him now?
L423700 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ He's telling the truth. He doesn't know.
L423695 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Actually, I scalped him, and then you killed him.
L423694 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Del's dead, by the way. I sent him to the Great Beyond.
L423679 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I'm a Yankee, myself. Massachusetts.
L423678 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ We can live with that.
L423674 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ I like 'em small. When you're inside a little Asian chick, it's like your dick is the axle that holds her body together.
L423673 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Mmmm. Well, it was a piece of luck running into you, Duane. I thought I was gonna have to take Wesley out and hose him down. All he talks about is those Japanese gals.
L423629 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Fine, I'll get you a bumpersticker, but you better start believing it! It's the only statement you need to make.
L423628 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ ...that's a good motto.
L423627 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Let me tell you something. In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy, just good. They get in, they get out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom, boom, boom. Three in the head and you know they're dead.
L423626 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ I wanted to make a statement.
L423625 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something, now that you fucked it up.
L423624 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
L423623 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ It's not here. Let's go.
L423622 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What the hell does that mean? If I'd told a Ty Cobb story would you have clubbed him to death with a bat?
L423621 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian story?
L423620 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I wasn't done, I was just sick of hearing him whine. And you didn't take him out, you scalped him. Christ, I almost puked, did I tell you that?
L423619 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ That one look you got! I thought you were done, so I took him out...
L423618 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What 'look'?
L423617 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ I didn't. You gave me a look!
L423616 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I saw his soul Wesley. He was face to face with his God, and no one lies in that situation. But your Geronimo act rattled me, and I abandoned my instincts.  Never abandon you instincts.
L423615 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ I still don't understand how you knew Del was telling the truth.
L423570 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I had to shoot him! It was the only decent thing to do.
L423569 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Well, why'd you shoot him?
L423568 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ We don't know which Buick, do we?
L423567 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ He told us it's in the Buick.
L423566 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ This is great -- just great! Now we don't know where the goddamn stuff is.
L423565 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ That was to get him to talk!  Get rid of that thing, will you?
L423564 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ You told me how to do it!
L423563 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Are you out of your mind? You scalped him!
L423560 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ IT SURE IS!!
L423559 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I'm all for them owning casinos, getting rich off the white man's greed. It's a beautiful piece of irony, isn't it, Wesley?
L423549 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ A mark, huh?
L423548 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Hold still, Del, we're just talking here...  Then you grab a big handful of hair and pull as you cut. It's amazing how easily the scalp comes off.
L423546 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ It wasn't always fatal, Wesley. We could scalp Del right now, and he'd be plenty alive to tell us how it feels.
L423545 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Hell of a way to die.
L423544 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You know, a hundred and fifty years ago you'd have been scalped for that remark about Native Americans. Right here where your house is -- you'd have been scalped.
L423542 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ So you see, we have totally different ideas of what's stupid and what's not. Don't we?
L423541 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Now, that's really stupid.
L423540 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?
L423539 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ That is so right.
L423538 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.
L423537 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ That's right.
L423517 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ That's what I thought.  You better give me another example.
L423516 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ No, that's ignorant. They just don't know any better.
L423513 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I'm just curious. Can't you give me an example?
L423512 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Relax, we brought the cash.
L423479 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Wesley...  Your wife's a very lovely woman. Have I seen her before?
L423478 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Hey... you got a fine one right here!
L423476 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Beer, please.
L423475 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Bourbon, little water, thank you.
L423884 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Mrs. Blaine? I can tell you right now, without a doubt, that your granddaughter is alive, and did not kill Del Sizemore.
L423883 +++$+++ u2377 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ If anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed, it would have been me.
L423882 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What do you mean?
L423881 +++$+++ u2377 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ I don't like talking bad about the dead, but now that he's gone I can tell you she put up with things in that marriage I wouldn't have. And yes, she, of all people, was the one who defended him. And that's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry.
L423875 +++$+++ u2377 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Betty was a lovely child.
L423874 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Very graceful. Perfect form.
L423873 +++$+++ u2377 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ This is Betty at twelve.
L423759 +++$+++ u2373 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DARLENE +++$+++ ...who doesn't?
L423758 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
L423757 +++$+++ u2373 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DARLENE +++$+++ If it helps bring her back, be my guest...
L423756 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I see.  May I?
L423755 +++$+++ u2373 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DARLENE +++$+++ No... she just wanted something outta life. Anything. And with Del, she wasn't getting nothing. That's her husband, Del. I'm sorry about what happened and all, but that's the way I feel about all of this...
L423754 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ But she wanted more out of life, right?
L423753 +++$+++ u2373 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DARLENE +++$+++ Aren't you a sweetheart... no, not quite. Anyway, she's been with us awhile.
L423752 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Hmm... you two in high school together?
L423751 +++$+++ u2373 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DARLENE +++$+++ Oh, five years, give or take.
L423750 +++$+++ u2371 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ ...and how long did she work here?
L423522 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ "Injuns?"
L423521 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid.
L423520 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ He's waiting...
L423519 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Jesus Christ!
L423503 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ You better believe it.
L423502 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Really?
L423499 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ It is, if you like idiots...
L423498 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Seems like a nice place.
L423493 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Yeah, well, I don't have time to screw around. I got buyers in Dallas, Houston and Vegas who are ready to snap this stuff up.
L423492 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Isn't that the point?
L423486 +++$+++ u2374 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ DEL +++$+++ Huh? Oh, umm, a car.  So, to a successful transaction...
L423485 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ What'd you get her?
L424580 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ Then do as you're told. Get her back.
L424579 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Jesus, don't do that! If it gets around that you fired me, I'll never land a pilot.
L424578 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ That's not a bad idea. How many episodes before he comes back?
L424577 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I got news for you. I loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... I'm toying with the idea of killing David Ravell off in a boating accident.
L424576 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What about me? Don't you wanna know how I feel about it? I'm the one who...
L424575 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ You fucked it up. Who wouldn't freeze in those circumstances? And I don't care what her problems are. She wouldn't be the first one in that cast with problems. We have nothing to lose by making her an offer.
L424574 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I don't think she can do it. You saw what happened.
L424573 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ This story is beyond belief, which is perfect for us. It's free advertising and it's gonna run for months.
L424377 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ I SAID FORGET IT!
L424376 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Let me try this, goddamnit! SHE'S BEEN DOING IT ALL WEEK, SHE CAN DO IT NOW!
L424373 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ No! Let me try this!
L424372 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ All right, everybody! That's ten minutes!
L424371 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ No! No problem, there is no...  What is the problem? Just do that... thing... you do! Come on! You drove me nuts with this for three days, now do it!
L424370 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ Is there a problem, George?
L424365 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ If you need a minute, that's okay. But I thought you'd want to --
L424364 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ What the hell's going on?
L424363 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Betty, I thought this would be the best way. You know, throw you into it...
L424265 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ ...yeah.
L424264 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ "Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch?" Remember?
L424263 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Hmm?
L424262 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ Actually, she was my discovery... just like you.
L424261 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Fine, but promise me one thing. If we use her, I want to direct those episodes. She's my discovery.
L424260 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ I said I'll think about it.
L424259 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here!
L424258 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ I'll think about it.
L424257 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
L424256 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ I don't know, George...
L424255 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy?  Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens.
L424254 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember?
L424253 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Can I have an evil twin?
L424252 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ We know that...
L424251 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ She's even taken a job as a nurse!  David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla.
L424250 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ I know, George, I was there. I'm not denying that she's good.
L424249 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ She makes me stretch! I got inside my character last night like I haven't done in six years on "Reason". It was a totally rejuvenating experience.
L424162 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ Yeah, bring your friend along. I'm sure you got a lot of catching up to do...
L424161 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Right, uhh... I feel terrible about this, we have a prior engagement at another party.  But... I'd be honored if you'd come.
L424150 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I can't tell you how much it hurts me to hear that you married him.
L424149 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ Funny, that's just what I was thinking...
L424136 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ Are you sure you want to encourage this?  No, you're right, let's have some fun. So, what did happened next, "Betty"?
L424135 +++$+++ u2379 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ No, wait... what happened next, Betty?
L424134 +++$+++ u2384 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ Alright, I admit it, you had me there. You're better than most of them, anyway... do you have a headshot?
L424292 +++$+++ u2380 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GUARD +++$+++ Sure.
L424291 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Hey, can you sneak me on the lot?
L424290 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Oh fuck...
L424289 +++$+++ u2380 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GUARD +++$+++ Better.
L424288 +++$+++ u2389 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ WESLEY +++$+++ Damn, that's sweet...  She really that good-looking in person?
L424287 +++$+++ u2380 +++$+++ m152 +++$+++ GUARD +++$+++ Uh-huh.
