L634557 +++$+++ u8698 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ ELIJAH +++$+++ Why is it, do you think, that of all the professions in the world... you chose protection?
L634555 +++$+++ u8698 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ ELIJAH +++$+++ We've already begun.
L634554 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ We're not proceeding anywhere together.
L634553 +++$+++ u8698 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ ELIJAH +++$+++ Not money.  But I appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner. It will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution.
L634552 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What do you want?
L634551 +++$+++ u8698 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ ELIJAH +++$+++ I've come to understand that...  An ill advised purchase in the parking lot.
L634550 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ It's for last week's game.
L634529 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I see guys like you all the time in my work. You find someone you think is emotionally vulnerable and you tell them a fantastic story, utterly convincing... and somewhere in there, you slip it in... 'I just need your credit card number','I just need a small down payment.'
L634528 +++$+++ u8698 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ ELIJAH +++$+++ You've misunderstood.
L634527 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What's this about? This is obviously some scam. Is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment?
L634526 +++$+++ u8698 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ ELIJAH +++$+++ Technically no. I gambled that you would attend the church service. I just waited for you.
L634525 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ At the church... You were following me weren't you?
L634519 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What was your idea Elijah?
L634518 +++$+++ u8698 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ ELIJAH +++$+++ This city has had its share of disasters. Well publicized ones. It was around the time of that plane crash, when it first entered my head. And there it stayed, as I waited and watched the news over the years...  And then one day I see a news report on a train accident and its sole survivor who was miraculously unharmed.  And just like that, an idea blossoms into the flower of possible reality.
L634516 +++$+++ u8698 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ ELIJAH +++$+++ The life of an idea that has lived too long in my head.
L634515 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You forgot the "Now I'm going to tell you what the hell is going on" step. See usually that comes before the, "It's over" Step. And it always, always comes before the "You can go" Step.  What is over?
L634512 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You assumed wrong.
L634511 +++$+++ u8698 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ ELIJAH +++$+++ I assumed because of the train.
L634509 +++$+++ u8698 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ ELIJAH +++$+++ Was it serious?
L634508 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ In college. A car accident.
L634507 +++$+++ u8698 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ ELIJAH +++$+++ What's he talking about?
L634505 +++$+++ u8698 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ ELIJAH +++$+++ Your answer to my question. It's one thing to have never been injured in your life, but to state that you've never taken ill, well that's a whole new level.
L634504 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Skeptical about what?
L634503 +++$+++ u8698 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ ELIJAH +++$+++ Seventy-five percent? That's not nearly good enough for me. I'm extremely skeptical.
L634502 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Seventy-five percent.
L634501 +++$+++ u8698 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ ELIJAH +++$+++ How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life?
L634496 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I don't know for sure.  ...I don't think so.
L634495 +++$+++ u8698 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ ELIJAH +++$+++ You've never been sick?
L634931 +++$+++ u8699 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ ELIJAH'S MOTHER +++$+++ Yes he is.
L634930 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ He's kind of a miracle.
L634929 +++$+++ u8699 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ ELIJAH'S MOTHER +++$+++ I'm very proud of him.  He's been through a lot in his life. A lot of ups and downs, a lot of bad spells. A couple I'd thought had broken him... I mean emotionally.  They were bad... But he made it. Yes he did.
L634928 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ He's doing well today.
L634927 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ We are.
L634926 +++$+++ u8699 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ ELIJAH'S MOTHER +++$+++ He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends.
L634925 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.
L634924 +++$+++ u8699 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ ELIJAH'S MOTHER +++$+++ I am. I'm helping him with the sale.
L634744 +++$+++ u8703 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ WALKIE +++$+++ Just now. They want you to come down to his school.
L634743 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ When?
L634742 +++$+++ u8703 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ WALKIE +++$+++ There's a message for you at the office. Your kid was hurt.
L634741 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Yeah?
L634547 +++$+++ u8703 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ WALKIE +++$+++ Consider him packed. I didn't like his attitude... Struttin around with a cane and shit.
L634546 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Send him packing. I'm not walking all the way over there.
L634545 +++$+++ u8703 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ WALKIE +++$+++ He's got the most beautiful eyes... The hell kind of question is that? He's a guy.
L634544 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What's he look like?
L634543 +++$+++ u8703 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ WALKIE +++$+++ Dunne, it's Jenkins, we got a guy at gate 17C with a bogus ticket. Says he knows you. He won't tell me his name.
L634798 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Jeremy if you pull that trigger I'm going to leave! I'm going to go to New York.
L634797 +++$+++ u8700 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ Don't be scared.
L634796 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Jeremy listen to what--
L634795 +++$+++ u8700 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ I'll just shoot him once.
L634792 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I'm not. I just didn't connect it.
L634791 +++$+++ u8700 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ You're lying.
L634790 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ That was me they were talking about. I almost died. That was me.
L634785 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Elijah was wrong.
L634784 +++$+++ u8700 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ YOU WON'T GET HURT...
L634695 +++$+++ u8700 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ You're secret identity.  That man was right.
L634694 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Know what?
L634693 +++$+++ u8700 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ I know now.
L634692 +++$+++ u8700 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ Do you know why?
L634691 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ That's great.
L634690 +++$+++ u8700 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ I'm not scared.
L634689 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I see.
L634688 +++$+++ u8700 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ I'm sleeping in my room.
L634648 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ There's no more left?
L634647 +++$+++ u8700 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ All of it.
L634646 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ How many did you put on that time?
L634645 +++$+++ u8700 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ Get mom.
L634644 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What do you do if something happens?
L634638 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Two hundred and seventy.
L634637 +++$+++ u8700 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ How much is it?
L634635 +++$+++ u8700 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ I lied.
L634634 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ How much did you take off?
L634632 +++$+++ u8700 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ What if he wasn't aloud to kick and you were really mad at him?
L634631 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ No Jeremy.
L634630 +++$+++ u8700 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ I mean if you knew karate?
L634629 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ No.
L634625 +++$+++ u8700 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ How much can you lift?
L634624 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You put too much. That's two hundred and fifty pounds.
L634621 +++$+++ u8700 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ What if you only ate foods that were good for you and you worked out everyday for a year?
L634620 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ No.
L634619 +++$+++ u8700 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ What if you worked out everyday for six months? You think you could beat him then?
L634618 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ No.
L634617 +++$+++ u8700 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ You think you could beat up Mike Tyson? I mean before he started wiggin out and eating people's ears?
L634614 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ There's nothing to do.
L634613 +++$+++ u8700 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ I'll help you.
L634612 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I'm going to work out.
L634611 +++$+++ u8700 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ What things?
L634610 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Jeremy.  I'm going in. I have to do some things.
L634609 +++$+++ u8700 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ Just one--
L634608 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Why'd you do that?
L634607 +++$+++ u8700 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ Just play one set of downs. I told them you were great.
L634606 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I'm going to go in.
L634605 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ In under six seconds.  I've heard.
L634604 +++$+++ u8700 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ He going pro in the draft. They say he can run the fifty--
L634379 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ How about your room then? If you get scared like before, you can come back in here?
L634378 +++$+++ u8700 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ I won't make any noise.
L634377 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I think it's be better if I was alone.
L634376 +++$+++ u8700 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ I want to sleep here tonight.
L634375 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Jeremy, why don't you go sleep with your mom?
L634922 +++$+++ u8704 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ That's what I said to my son. He said, there's always two kinds. The soldier villain who fights the hero with his hands, and then there's the real threat. The brilliant and evil arch enemy who fights the hero with his mind.
L634921 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ He doesn't look very threatening.
L634654 +++$+++ u8704 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Is David Dunne there?
L634653 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Yeah, hello.
L634327 +++$+++ u8704 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ This kid is six foot two, two hundred and forty pounds. He runs the fifty in under six seconds. He's going to be a God.
L634326 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Not really.
L634325 +++$+++ u8704 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ I'm meeting a player from Temple University. He's a cornerback. You like football?
L634324 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You represent someone in Philadelphia?
L634323 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ But I'm afraid of water, so that's been holding my career back a little bit.
L634322 +++$+++ u8704 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Is that right?
L634321 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What a coincidence? I'm a male synchronized swimmer and I'm looking for representation.
L634320 +++$+++ u8704 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ It's my field. I represent athletes. I'm an agent.
L634319 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You like sports?
L634354 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ No.
L634353 +++$+++ u8701 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ MAN IN SCRUBS +++$+++ Did you get up from your seat?
L634352 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ No.
L634351 +++$+++ u8701 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ MAN IN SCRUBS +++$+++ Was your family traveling with you?
L634350 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Yes. Where are the rest of the passengers?
L634349 +++$+++ u8701 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ MAN IN SCRUBS +++$+++ In the passenger car?
L634348 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Against a window.
L634347 +++$+++ u8701 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ MAN IN SCRUBS +++$+++ Where were you sitting on the train?
L634346 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Fine.
L634345 +++$+++ u8701 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ MAN IN SCRUBS +++$+++ You are in the emergency room of the University of Pennsylvania Hospital. You were in a serious accident.  How's your vision?
L634344 +++$+++ u8697 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Okay.
L634343 +++$+++ u8701 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ MAN IN SCRUBS +++$+++ How are you feeling?
L634735 +++$+++ u8698 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ ELIJAH +++$+++ I believe comic books are based loosely on reality -- I believe there are real life equivalents of the heroes in those books that walk the earth -- I believe your husband is one of those individuals.
L634734 +++$+++ u8702 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ MEGAN +++$+++ For a second there I thought you were a fanatic.
L634733 +++$+++ u8698 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ ELIJAH +++$+++ I own a comic book museum. It's called the Limited Edition.
L634732 +++$+++ u8702 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ MEGAN +++$+++ Is this a religious thing?
L634730 +++$+++ u8702 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ MEGAN +++$+++ And what was that explanation?
L634729 +++$+++ u8698 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ ELIJAH +++$+++ There have been three major disasters in this city over the last four years. I've followed each one of them... A Seven-three-seven crashes on take off. One hundred and seventy-two die. No survivors... A hotel fire downtown. Two hundred and eleven die. No survivors... And am Amtrak train derails seven and half miles outside of the city. One hundred and thirty one die. One survivor. He is unharmed.  I've spoken with your husband about his survival. I suggested a rather unbelievable explanation. Since then, I've come to believe, that my explanation, however unbelievable, is in fact, true.
L634721 +++$+++ u8698 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ ELIJAH +++$+++ ...And everyone lived happily ever after.
L634720 +++$+++ u8702 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ MEGAN +++$+++ Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
L634719 +++$+++ u8698 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ ELIJAH +++$+++ You and my mother would have a special connection.
L634718 +++$+++ u8702 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ MEGAN +++$+++ Football wasn't the kind of life I wanted... For ten years I'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game. And if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. I've seen way too much of it in my job... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain.  I don't hate the game. I admire the amount of skill it involved and, like everyone else, I was in awe of how he could play it, but I couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him. And it always does with that game.  It's not a thing many people would understand.
L634717 +++$+++ u8698 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ ELIJAH +++$+++ How so?
L634716 +++$+++ u8702 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ MEGAN +++$+++ ...See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together. Our car flipped on an icy road. We were both injured. He couldn't play football anymore.  If that hadn't happened, we wouldn't have been together.
L634715 +++$+++ u8698 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ ELIJAH +++$+++ Now you're going to have to tell me more.
L634713 +++$+++ u8698 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ ELIJAH +++$+++ How did you get together?
L634712 +++$+++ u8702 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ MEGAN +++$+++ Twelve years.
L634711 +++$+++ u8698 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ ELIJAH +++$+++ How long have you been married?
L634710 +++$+++ u8702 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ MEGAN +++$+++ We're going to prevent any substantial atrophy of your good leg with this.  It works the quadriceps.
L634462 +++$+++ u8699 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ ELIJAH'S MOTHER +++$+++ On a bench, across the street.
L634461 +++$+++ u8698 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ ELIJAH +++$+++ Where is it?
L634460 +++$+++ u8699 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ ELIJAH'S MOTHER +++$+++ Well, go get it then.
L634459 +++$+++ u8699 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ ELIJAH'S MOTHER +++$+++ Forget why. Do you want it or not?
L634458 +++$+++ u8698 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ ELIJAH +++$+++ Why?
L634457 +++$+++ u8699 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ ELIJAH'S MOTHER +++$+++ ...I got a present for you.
L634454 +++$+++ u8699 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ ELIJAH'S MOTHER +++$+++ You can't do anything about that. You might fall between that chair and this television. If that's what God has planned for you, that's what's going to happen. You can't hide from it in your room.
L634453 +++$+++ u8698 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ ELIJAH +++$+++ I'm not going out anymore. I'm not getting hurt again. This was the last time. I told you.
L634452 +++$+++ u8699 +++$+++ m590 +++$+++ ELIJAH'S MOTHER +++$+++ No more sitting in this room. I've let it go on long enough.
L635478 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Innocent of what?
L635477 +++$+++ u8705 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ You just kicked the shit out of a innocent man, you big asshole.
L635473 +++$+++ u8705 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ On account of they seen you was beatin' on their friend.
L635472 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ If they was just here for the fuckin', how come they lit out the back window?
L634995 +++$+++ u8705 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Like whores?
L634994 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Ain't you seen enough blood for one night? Hell, Alice, they ain't loafers nor tramps nor bad men. They're hard workin' boys that was foolish. Why if they was given over to wickedness in a regular way...
L634993 +++$+++ u8705 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ For what they done? Skinny gets some ponies an' that's...?
L634992 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ I fined 'em instead.
L634991 +++$+++ u8705 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ You... you ain't even gonna... whip 'em?
L634972 +++$+++ u8705 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ But what they done, they...
L634971 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice.
L634970 +++$+++ u8705 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ A whippin'? That's all they get? After what they done?
L634967 +++$+++ u8705 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ All she done was... when she seen he had a teensy little pecker... she gave a giggle. That's all. She didn't know no better.
L634966 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ No?
L634965 +++$+++ u8705 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ She's gonna live.  She didn't steal nothin', She didn't touch his poke.
L635412 +++$+++ u8716 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ SKINNY +++$+++ Thank God.
L635411 +++$+++ u8705 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Rain's coming.
L635072 +++$+++ u8716 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ SKINNY +++$+++ What you gonna do when somebody comes to collect?  FUCK 'EM? FUCK 'EM A THOUSAND TIMES?  The kind of people who'll come after that thousand, they won't tolerate if you don't have it. They won't just cut your face up a little.  STUPID CUNTS!
L635071 +++$+++ u8705 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ We was... lyin'.
L635070 +++$+++ u8716 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ SKINNY +++$+++ You told them cowboys you had it.
L635069 +++$+++ u8705 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ We ain't got it. We ain't got no money.
L635068 +++$+++ u8716 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ SKINNY +++$+++ Where'd you get the money, huh?
L635662 +++$+++ u8705 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I told you, he don't have no wife, not aboveground, anyhow.
L635661 +++$+++ u8709 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ DELILAH +++$+++ He said...

L635659 +++$+++ u8709 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ DELILAH +++$+++ That Kid... he's just a... boy. And that other one, Bill, being true to his wife...
L635658 +++$+++ u8705 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ What did you think, they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us?
L635657 +++$+++ u8709 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ DELILAH +++$+++ I didn't think they'd really do it.
L635206 +++$+++ u8710 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ ENGLISH BOB +++$+++ Ah, I see.
L635205 +++$+++ u8706 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ BARBER +++$+++ Don't matter. They burned the table in '78 for firewood.
L635204 +++$+++ u8710 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ ENGLISH BOB +++$+++ Billiards, eh? Even though I don't really wish to play?
L635203 +++$+++ u8706 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ BARBER +++$+++ Down the street and across. Greely's Beer Garden and Billiard parlor. Just ask for Alice and say you want a game of billiards.

L635201 +++$+++ u8710 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ ENGLISH BOB +++$+++ A wise policy. But if you did, I can assure you, the sight of royalty would cause you to dismiss all thoughts of bloodshed and stand... in awe.  Whereas, a president... I mean, why not shoot a president?
L635200 +++$+++ u8706 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ BARBER +++$+++ I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody, sir.
L635199 +++$+++ u8710 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ ENGLISH BOB +++$+++ Why, if you were to point a pistol at a King or a Queen, sir, I can assure you your hand would shake as though palsied...

L635190 +++$+++ u8708 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ Asked what they looked like, that's all. Christ, maybe he's tough but he sure ain't no carpenter.
L635189 +++$+++ u8707 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ CHARLEY +++$+++ He didn't say nothin', huh?
L635186 +++$+++ u8708 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ Little Bill? He didn't say nothing. Like I said, he was buildin' his porch. Have you seen that thing?
