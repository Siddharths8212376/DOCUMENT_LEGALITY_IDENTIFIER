L124422 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Pull over!  Pull over someplace.
L124421 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ It's going to be some fucking snowstorm.
L124420 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ You won't live to see it.
L124419 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Think about what's going to happen to your valuables when that trunk flies open at 75 miles per?
L124417 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Take your hand out of there. Slowly.
L124416 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Know what else is in here?
L124404 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Local lawyer for Dominican dealers.  Off to buy a half interest in a mall in Granada Hills on their behalf.
L124403 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Exactly who was this Oberfeld?
L124402 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Took preparation.
L124401 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Some nice fantasy you all cooked up for me.
L124399 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ That's a skill you acquire when you do fantasy phone sex for a living. I must've had thirty regulars salivating at 4.99 per minute.
L124398 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Just sitting here listening to her voice does it to me all over again.  No harm admitting I fell in love with the sound of you.
L124393 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Nothing but CDs in there.  I thought maybe you'd like some Celine or Whitney.
L124392 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Both hands on your lap.
L124357 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ He let the fucking cop out -- but he won't --
L124356 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I'm handling it.
L124349 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ That's how it's going to be.
L124348 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ That's not good enough.
L124347 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I'm going to cuff you and leave you in that house.  It may take awhile but you'll be found after we're long gone.
L124337 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Only one way to find out.
L124336 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
L124335 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Naturally.
L124334 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Naturally.
L124333 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ You're the man with the gun.
L124332 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Which one of us is elected to do the deed?
L124331 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ We can't leave him to repeat anything.
L124330 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ What's your point?
L124329 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ He might've heard everything we said in the car.
L124328 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ That's a reasonable possibility.
L124327 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
L124326 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ What's really on your wicked little mind?
L124325 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ How about "later?"
L124324 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.
L124323 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Yeah, I was waiting for that suggestion.
L124321 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ We had a backup plan.  But I knew you'd come through for me.
L124320 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You've had a lot of fun with me today.  What would you have done if I hadn't responded to your call?
L124319 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ As a child I hated being told how sweet I looked.  That angelic little face wasn't me at all.  I had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image. Sometimes words were enough -- but I wasn't beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously.  I enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who I was.  That same look you gave me when I turned the gun on you.
L124318 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Who'd ever think, to look at you?
L124317 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I need a break.  I've been on a marathon run ever since I had the misfortune to strike up a conversation with you.
L124316 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Why are we stopping?
L124315 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Developer ran out of money years back.  I'd hate to think about what's living in there.
L124314 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I had it in my mind what you'd look like.  "Her," I could've painted.  <u>You</u>, I'd be afraid to turn my back to mix the colors.
L124313 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Think you could do a picture of me?
L124312 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ That's where this Chicano correctional officer first taught me to slap paint on a canvas.  I could copy any fucking thing he put in front of me.
L124311 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ They did some great job of reforming you.
L124310 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I was sentenced to a youth camp out here when I was fourteen.  We cleared some of these same roads.
L124309 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Any idea where you're going?
L124306 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ The money, Nels ... ?
L124305 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Wonderful feeling of security knowing your adversaries are both crippled and unarmed.
L124304 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ I can't hear.  Now there's a siren.  They must be in an ambulance.  What about the money?  Nels?
L124303 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ What's happening?
L124302 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Some people fall apart in a pinch. But you shine.
L124301 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ That's why we're turning off onto a fire road.
L124300 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ They'll have units blocking us up ahead.
L124291 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Ask them.
L124290 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Do you think they'll walk away?
L124271 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Dial him up.  We need him to run interference.
L124270 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ 259-7881.
L124269 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ What's Nels' number?
L124268 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ No, there's a police car way back there.  See it, in the distance coming around the turn?  The van is blocking it now.
L124267 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ It could be a fire.  This is Malibu.
L124257 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Let me talk to him.  Hold the phone to my ear -- but don't nudge me.
L124256 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Did you hear that?
L124255 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Plus names, addresses and I.D. for the lot of you.  We're in this together and I need to know who my partners are.  In case I ever need to roll over on somebody.
L124254 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ He wants 75 back.
L124253 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Inform him the fee is seventy-five large for your return.  All parts intact.
L124252 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ I'm still okay.
L124249 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Then scream for me.  A repeat performance.  Let me see how easy you can turn it on.  Scream!  I want to hear you scream for me!
L124248 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Stop talking like that!
L124247 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Yes I would.  Not kill you.  But blow off a few toes, absolutely. I'm entitled to that as retribution.  It'll help you to remember me in years to come -- every time you put on stockings. They must have prosthetic toes by now -- with little nails on them you can polish --
L124246 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ You wouldn't --
L124245 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Only in the leg or the thigh. You'd live but you just wouldn't wear shorts.
L124244 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ You could've hit me.
L124243 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Now you're starting to sound like a victim again.
L124242 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You're enjoying this too much.
L124241 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ I think it was my tone of voice more than anything else that sold you.  And when you thought I was being kicked around, I wish I could've seen your face.
L124240 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I guess I ought to stop seeing woman as victims.
L124239 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.
L124238 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You were at the Emerald that night?
L124237 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Oh no, you were too busy trying to keep some Croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend. She showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel.
L124236 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You, I would've noticed.
L124235 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
L124234 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ What's that supposed to me?
L124233 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ A typical fuck-up.
L124232 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Those shots your associates got off may not have done him too much good.  That's on their head.  All I did I was put him there.
L124231 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ I don't hear him moving around anymore.
L124230 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Granted, the cops are not an alternative.  Certainly not with one of their own still locked in my trunk.
L124229 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ The one thing you don't want is to attract the police.
L124228 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I'm not trying to lose them.  Nor am I exceeding any speed limits.
L124227 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ He seems to be headed for Topanga.
L124226 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Absolutely.  And Topanga Canyon has a hell of a lot of potholes if I recall.
L124225 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Do you have to point that?
L124224 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ We might hit a bump and the gun might go off.  Ever see that Tarantino movie -- where Travolta blew that guy away in the back seat -- purely by accident?
L124223 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ You won't shoot me.  That's not your style.
L124222 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Not all.  They already have a third.  The question is how much of that are they willing to give to get you back?
L124221 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ He seems to think he's entitled to it all.
L124220 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Tell them I'm keeping what's left. I earned it.  I probably killed some poor bastard for it.
L124216 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Assure them that you're being well treated.
L124215 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ There's no way out for you.  You have to deal with us.
L124214 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Your friends are probably still on the line.  Pick it up and say hello.
L124213 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Shit.  You couldn't be in much worse shape.
L124212 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ L.A.P.D.
L124211 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Who's in back?
L124210 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You knew about me.
L124209 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Nobody's easier to con than a con man.
L124208 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Why pick me to be your "mark?"
L124207 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Sit completely still with both hands on the wheel -- until they get here.
L124206 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ There was <u>no</u> cop involved.  Oh shit!  Fuck!
L124205 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ I thought it was inspired.
L124204 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ And all that crap about your driver being murdered by a cop --
L124203 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ As they say -- no good deed goes unpunished.
L124202 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I got what I fucking deserved.  I had it all.  I could've kept going!
L124201 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ They always pick Rachel up early on Thursday.
L124200 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You timed that beautifully.
L124199 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Plus they'll remember you going after his daughter at school.
L124198 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ At least one.
L124197 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ The video cameras will put you with him in the bank, and I'll bet there were enough witnesses.
L124196 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Damned if I know.
L124195 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Jack Oberfeld in person.  Did you kill him?
L124194 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ The guy with the transplant.
L124193 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ It belongs to the man you took it from.  Or should I saw <u>stole</u> it from?
L124192 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Whose money is this?
L124191 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ There isn't any such person.
L124190 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You're not Lenore Oberfeld.
L124186 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ The rest of the money is here in the car.  Why don't you come and get it?
L124185 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Why are you telling him that.  Are you crazy?
L124184 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ He had a gun.  I have it now.
L124182 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Hand me the phone.
L124181 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ For Christ sakes don't point it at me.  We want to get Rachel out of there in one piece.  I'm waiting for the girl.  Her mother wants to talk to her.
L124177 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Somehow I got along better with you on the phone.  It's all there isn't it?
L124176 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ They put their hands all over me.
L124175 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ So far they're keeping their part of it.
L124174 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ They tortured us.  And you're going to let them have all that money?
L124173 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ We've almost got your husband and your daughter out.  So don't get any ideas.
L124172 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ You're going to let them get away with this?
L124171 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Because a lot of people would've gotten killed.  Probably all the wrong ones.
L124170 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Why didn't you just shoot them?
L124169 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Now I have -- it's a long story.
L124164 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Include me in that.
L124163 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ She'll never be the same.  None of us will.
L124162 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ She'll be with you soon.  They're pulling up.  They'll realize I kept my part of the bargain.
L124161 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Rachel was terrified when I left her.  I could see it in her eyes.
L124156 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Shit.  I'm sorry.
L124155 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ It's locked.
L124152 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Just start walking.  Come on. Walk to me.
L124151 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Rachel -- Oh my God.
L124146 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ I'm sorry.  You've thought this out better than I ever could.  I'm ready now.
L124145 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Once you're in the car with me she's sure to come to us.
L124144 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ All right.  Now that you explain it I see that you're right.
L124143 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ She's a child.  She might panic. She doesn't know me.  She might not come to me.  She might just run.
L124142 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Why can't it be her?
L124141 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ They won't allow that.  It's one at a time.  And you have to be first.
L124140 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Yes.  But I want Rachel to come with me.
L124139 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Can you walk?
L124138 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Yes.
L124137 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Don't start thinking about it.  Is the tape off?
L124136 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ I can't do it.
L124135 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ She's next.  In two or three more minutes she'll be free.
L124134 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ I'm not leaving my daughter behind.  Not with them.
L124133 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Lenore -- you promised you'd follow instructions.  We're almost there.  Simply get out when they slide the van open and walk to me.
L124104 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Put the man back on.
L124103 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Yes sir.
L124102 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Now you're going to do just what I tell you to.  No discussion.  No hesitation.
L124101 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Yes.
L124100 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You're all three of you in that van?
L124099 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ He's in back.  Lying face down. They haven't hurt him anymore -- but he was crying.  I never heard Jack cry before --
L124098 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Your husband?
L124097 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ She's awake but she hasn't spoken. I don't know what they did to her. I don't want to think about it.
L124096 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ That's coming off.  How about the girl?
L124095 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
L124094 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Are you okay?
L124093 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Thank you.  God bless you for helping us.
L124022 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ They're tied with duct tape so they can't speak -- but they seem to be --
L124021 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I'm in possession of the bag he was carrying.  And I'm in a position to negotiate.  What about your husband and your child?
L124020 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ God, if he doesn't come back --
L124019 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I had a little encounter at the bank and our Mr. Transplant ended up under the wheels of a Chevy.
L124018 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ What did you do?
L124017 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Lucky for them they didn't.
L124016 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ They dragged me downstairs.  I thought they were going to kill me.
L124015 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Hi Lenore.  It's me.  I got you back.  Courtesy of Star 69.  Are you hurt?
L124014 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Yes?  Yes?
L123983 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Try what you did before.  It worked before.  I won't talk anymore.
L123982 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ No.  I hear them.  They're coming upstairs.  They know!
L123980 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Don't panic.  I might be wrong.  Hello?  I guess I was wrong.
L123979 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Downstairs.  There must be an extension.  Oh my God --
L123978 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Or somebody else there is listening in --
L123977 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Yes -- I think so.  Another crossed line?
L123976 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Did you hear that click?
L123975 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ No.
L123974 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Did you jiggle the phone?
L123972 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ When they first started questioning Jack -- he answered them in that tone he usually reserves for me.  And they began beating him.  And I watched.  And I didn't feel anything ... What kind of a person am I?
L123971 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You can't give up.
L123970 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Because you're probably the last person I'll ever talk to.
L123969 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Why tell me this?
L123968 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Jack hasn't loved me for years. And now I'm afraid she's turning out to be like him.  So cold and distant.  I've let him make her like that.
L123967 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I've got a lot of respect for you too.  For the way you feel about your family.
L123966 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ But I guess we haven't really met -- have we?
L123965 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Yeah, sure that's me.  Ask anybody.
L123964 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Theo, I want you to know, you're probably the most decent man I've ever met.
L123963 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ It won't be him.
