L295947 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ In Louisville it was seventy-five per cent.
L295946 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Half.
L295945 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ And just how do you figure that, Bert? What do you figure I owe you?
L295944 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Eddie?...  YOU OWE ME MONEY!
L295903 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ You gotta be hard, Eddie.
L295902 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Tell her what?
L295901 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ You want me to tell her for you?
L295900 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I got time, Bert.
L295899 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ It's a long walk.
L295898 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I wanna walk.
L295875 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What do you want me to do, huh? What do you want me to do? Just say it and you got it but PLEASE don't get off me now.
L295874 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ I know when to quit. You don't. Win or lose, you don't know when to quit.
L295873 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Please don't get off me now.
L295866 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ All right, then. I'll play him with my own money.
L295865 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ I don't believe you, Eddie. I think you're still a loser.
L295864 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I can beat him, Bert. Now he suckered me 'cause he knows how to hustle. I didn't think he did. But I can outplay him. I can beat him.
L295863 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ I said we're leavin'.
L295862 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Hey, Bert. Wait a minute!
L295859 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Well, rack up your cue. We're leavin'.
L295858 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ They're fine.
L295857 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ How're the hands?
L295856 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I'll beat him the next game.
L295852 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ All right. Five hundred.
L295851 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I can beat him.
L295843 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What's the difference? You got a pool cue, balls on the table. All you gotta do is get the feel of it.
L295842 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Level with me, Eddie. You ever play billiards before?
L295841 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Bert, if that's his best game, I can beat him.
L295840 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ I don't know.
L295839 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ When do I raise the bet?
L295838 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ 'Bout even.
L295837 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ How do we stand?
L295832 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ You hustlin' me?
L295831 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Sure.
L295828 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ How much?
L295827 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
L295826 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Well, we won't.
L295819 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ It's all right. She had a little too much to drink, that's all. Forget it.  Go upstairs and sleep it off.
L295818 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What's the matter? What happened?
L295800 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Well, I win sometimes.
L295799 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ So does Eddie.
L295788 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Nah. Sit tight. He'll be over here.
L295787 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Aren't you gonna go over and talk to him?
L295786 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Over there by the bar.
L295785 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Where?
L295784 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Hey, Findley's here.
L295753 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Come on, let's go...
L295752 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You know, that's real sweet music in there. You can almost smell the action and the money. You know, I can feel it right down in the bottom of my shoes.
L295738 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Hey, whaddya say something like that for?
L295737 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Good. I'd hate to think I was putting my money on a cripple.
L295736 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Fine.
L295730 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Play it again. Learn something.  Fats went in the john, see? Washed his face, cleaned his fingernails, made his mind a blank, combed his hair, came back all ready to go.  You were through. You saw him, you saw how he looked. Clean, all set to start all over again. Hold tight and push hard. You know what you were doing? You were waitin' to get beat. Flattened out on your butt, swimmin' around in glory. And whisky. Probably deciding how you could lose.
L295729 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I played that game, Bert. In my head I played it a thousand times.
L295728 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Fats knew the game was in the clutch, knew he had to do something to stop ya. He played it smart.
L295727 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ No, no. When you play for me, I pick up all the tabs.
L295726 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Here, I got it.
L295725 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Means I got confidence that he's a loser. All the way a loser. You happen to be about only one-half loser -- the other half, winner.  I'm finished.
L295724 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What's that supposed to mean?
L295723 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ I don't. But I got confidence in Findley.
L295722 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You must have a lot of confidence in me.
L295719 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ I don't know. Never saw him play. They say he's one of the best.
L295718 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ How good is he?
L295717 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ He's a gentleman. Gentleman gambler. He gets his kicks playing with hustlers. He's got an old Southern mansion with a pool table in the basement, drinks eight-year-old bourbon, smokes cork-tipped cigarettes.
L295716 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What? And he -- he hustles pool?
L295715 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ James Findley is a very rich man. Grandfather left him twenty per cent of a tobacco company.
L295705 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Miss Packard. How do you do?
L295704 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Sarah Packard... Bert Gordon.
L295661 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Hey, get us a couple of drinks here, will ya? J. T. S. Brown.
L295660 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Maybe I'm not such a high-class piece of property right now. And a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.
L295659 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Thinking about what?
L295658 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I been thinking.
L295657 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ No, I don't mean the thumbs. You already told me about the thumbs.
L295656 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Like I told ya. My thumbs.
L295655 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ What happened to you anyway?
L295654 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You name the place, boss. I'll be there.
L295653 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky.
L295652 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Where do I sign?
L295651 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Sign up.
L295650 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Maybe you oughta give me lessons.
L295649 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays.
L295648 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You know everybody, don't you?
L295647 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Man named Turk Baker?
L295646 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
L295645 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
L295644 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I'd say my game is about twenty per cent off. Maybe more.
L295643 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Oh. You seem to do all right that way.
L295642 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Yeah. Had a little accident. A place called Arthur's.
L295641 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Ahh, slow... Why the open hand bridge? Something wrong with your hand?
L295640 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Hi. How's business?
L295639 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Hello, Eddie.
L295562 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ I don't know when it was.
L295561 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Now, when did you adopt me?
L295560 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Word's out on you, Eddie. You walk in the wrong kind of place and they'll eat you alive.
L295559 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ There are places. I'll scuffle around.
L295558 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Hey, wait.  What are you gonna do about the money?
L295557 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Kiss off.
L295556 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ No, we don't talk. I don't make bad bets. Seventy-five, twenty-five. That's it.
L295555 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Yeah, you already told me that. You cut that slice down to bite-size and maybe we can talk.
L295554 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ I'm already rich. But I like action. That's one thing I think you're good for is action. Besides, like I say... you got talent.
L295553 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Why back me then? Why not back yourself? Go find yourself a big fat poker game and get rich. You know all the angles.
L295552 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Look, you wanna hustle pool, don't you? This game isn't like football. Nobody pays you for yardage. When you hustle you keep score real simple. The end of the game you count up your money. That's how you find out who's best. That's the only way.
L295551 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You saw me beat Minnesota Fats for eighteen thousand dollars.
L295550 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ I never saw you do anything else.
L295549 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You think I can lose?
L295548 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ How much you think you're worth these days? I'm puttin' up the money, I'm puttin' up the time. For that I get seventy-five per cent return on my money -- if you win.
L295547 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ That's a -- that's a pretty big slice. Who do you think you are, General Motors?
L295546 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ For me.
L295545 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ For who?
L295544 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Seventy-five per cent.
L295543 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Oh yeah, I figured that. How much?
L295542 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Ten reasons. Maybe fifteen. And also there's something in it for me.
L295541 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Why?
L295540 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Get the three thousand. Play Minnesota Fats again.
L295539 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ To do what?
L295538 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.
L295537 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Thanks for the drink.
L295536 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Sure, you got drunk. That's the best excuse in the world for losing. No trouble losing when you got a good excuse. And winning! That can be heavy on your back too. Like a monkey. You drop that load too when you got an excuse. All you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. It's one of the best indoor sports: feeling sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers.
L295535 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I told you. I got drunk.
L295534 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ First time in ten years I ever saw Minnesota Fats hooked, really hooked. But you let him off.
L295533 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What's that supposed to mean?
L295532 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Eddie, you're a born loser.
L295531 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Whaddya been so far?
L295530 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Eddie, is it all right if I get personal?
L295529 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ In that case, you owe me another drink.
L295528 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ See that big car parked out by the fireplug on the way in? Well, that's mine. I like that car. But I get a new one every year because I make it my business to know what guys like you and Minnesota Fats are gonna do. I made enough off of you the other night to pay for it twice over.
L295527 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ How do you know? Huh? When nobody knows that much?
L295526 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ No, three thousand at least. He'll start you off at five hundred a game -- he'll beat the pants off you. That's the way he plays when he comes up against a man who knows the way the game is. He'll beat you flat four or five games -- maybe more, depending on how, uh... steady your nerves are. But he might -- he just might be a little scared of you, and that could change things. But I wouldn't count on it.
L295525 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ A thousand.
L295524 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Maybe by that time you'll die of old age. How much do you think you'll, uh, need?
L295523 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ So I stay. Stay until I hustle up enough to play Fats again. Maybe by that time I'll develop myself some character.
L295522 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ That's your problem.
L295521 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Okay, okay... What do I do now, lie down on the floor and, uh, bow from the ankles? What do I do, go home?
L295520 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ You bet he knows how.  You think that's a talent too, huh? Knowin' how to drink whisky? You think Minnesota Fats was born knowin' how to drink?
L295519 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Maybe he knows how to drink.
L295518 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ He drank as much whisky as you did.
L295517 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I got drunk.
L295516 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ You're damned right I'm sure. Everybody's got talent. I got talent. You think you can play big-money straight pool, or poker, for forty straight hours on nothing but talent? You think they call Minnesota Fats the best in the country just 'cause he's got talent? Nah. Minnesota Fats's got more character in one finger than you got in your whole skinny body.
L295515 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Yeah. Sure, sure.
L295514 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Character.
L295513 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ So I got talent. So what beat me?
L295512 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ I don't think there's a pool player alive shoots better pool than I saw you shoot the other night at Ames. You got talent.
L295511 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You being cute?
L295510 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Pool.
L295509 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What is?
L295508 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Poker's not your game.
L295507 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I lost twenty bucks.
L295506 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ I like it. It's good for you. Besides, you start drinking whisky gambling and it gives you an excuse for losing. That's something you don't need -- an excuse for losing. How did you make out in the poker game?
L295505 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Yeah? Why?
L295504 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Only when I work.
L295503 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Thought you only drank milk.
L295502 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ I'm buyin'.
L295501 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Two.
L295500 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
L295499 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Deal.
L295498 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Cut.
L295497 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Make it twenty.
L295492 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Sit down.
L295491 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Okay?
L295230 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What did he say?
L295229 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Stay with this kid. He's a loser.
L295213 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Mister. You been sittin' in that spot for hours. Would you mind moving? It bothers me.
L295212 +++$+++ u1413 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ The name's Gordon. Bert Gordon.
L295211 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Hey, mister.
L295149 +++$+++ u1414 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BIG JOHN +++$+++ Comes right in this poolroom every night, eight o'clock on the nose. Just stay where you are. He'll find you.
L295148 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Just tell me where I can find him, friend.
L295147 +++$+++ u1414 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BIG JOHN +++$+++ Okay, I told you what I wanted about Minnesota Fats. You just go ahead and play him, friend.
L295146 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You got that wrong, mister. I am.
L295143 +++$+++ u1414 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BIG JOHN +++$+++ You well-heeled, partner?
L295142 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ He's my partner.
L295139 +++$+++ u1414 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BIG JOHN +++$+++ Want some free advice?
L295138 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Yeah, that's right.
L295137 +++$+++ u1414 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BIG JOHN +++$+++ Come up here to play straight pool with Minnesota Fats?
L295136 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ The expensive kind.

L295134 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Okay, I'm Eddie Felson. I shoot straight pool. You got any straight pool shooters in this here poolroom?
L295133 +++$+++ u1414 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BIG JOHN +++$+++ Look, friend, I'm not trying to hustle. I don't never hustle people that walk into poolrooms with leather satchels. Don't try to hustle me.
L295132 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You name it, we shoot it.
L295131 +++$+++ u1414 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BIG JOHN +++$+++ What's your game? What do you shoot?
L295130 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Who's he?
L295129 +++$+++ u1414 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ BIG JOHN +++$+++ No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson?

L295456 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Yeah. Just like that.
L295455 +++$+++ u1415 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Just like that?
L295454 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Lay down and die by yourself. Don't take me with you.
L295453 +++$+++ u1415 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ All right. That's what I want. Poolroom with a little handbook on the side. Getting old.
L295452 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Yeah, that's what I think.
L295451 +++$+++ u1415 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Is that what you think?
L295450 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You still don't see it, do you, Charlie? You are nothing but a small- time Charlie. You'd love to keep me hustling for you, huh? Wouldn't ya? I mean, a couple more years with me, scuffling around them little towns and those back alleys. You might make yourself enough to get a little poolroom back in Oakland. Six tables and a handbook on the side. Is that when you say goodbye to me, Charlie?
L295449 +++$+++ u1415 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You wanna come back on the road with me, okay, the money's yours. But if you wanna give it to Minnesota Fats... nothing doing. What do you say?

L295447 +++$+++ u1415 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What for? To play Fats again?
L295446 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ C'mon, c'mon, just give me the money.
L295445 +++$+++ u1415 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Aw, Eddie.
L295444 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Oh, you crumb. With that fifteen hundred I coulda beat him. That's all I needed, Charlie.
L295443 +++$+++ u1415 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ My twenty-five per cent. Approximately fifteen hundred bucks.
L295442 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ HOW MUCH?!
L295440 +++$+++ u1415 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What's the difference where? I'll raise it.  Is it all right if I have another drink?
L295439 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Oh yeah? Where?
L295438 +++$+++ u1415 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Don't worry about it. I'll raise the money.

L295435 +++$+++ u1415 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ He thinks I care about the money.  I care about you. Do you care about me, Eddie? We're together a long time, night and day. So how do you say goodbye?  You gimme the car and a hundred bucks. You think I care about the dough, the car? I care about you.  This boy is the greatest pool hustler you ever saw. A real high-class con man. He can charm anybody into anything. Did he ever tell you how well we were doing on the road? We had everything: we ate good, we slept late, we had money to burn. Whisky, dames...  Excuse me...  I'll tell you what -- take her along.
