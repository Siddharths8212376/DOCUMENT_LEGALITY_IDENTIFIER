L572565 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ Is Alan Baer "the Game?"  Is that what this is?
L572564 +++$+++ u8115 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ PLUMP GUY +++$+++ Look... what I'm doing is none of your business...
L572563 +++$+++ u8115 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ PLUMP GUY +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about.  I'm just driving...

L573028 +++$+++ u8116 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ SUTHERLAND +++$+++ Bravo, young man.  you have to tell me what this was all about sometime.  I want you to know... when it looked there for awhile like you were going slowly insane... I was fully prepared to have you committed to the <u>finest</u> mental-health facility available.  I mean that sincerely, don't thank me.

L572602 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ Sam...  Thank you.
L572601 +++$+++ u8116 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ SUTHERLAND +++$+++ Very well.  If you tell me not to worry, I shan't.
L572600 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ It's what they do.  It's like... being toyed with by a bunch of...  Depraved children.
L572599 +++$+++ u8116 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ SUTHERLAND +++$+++ You're joking.

L572593 +++$+++ u8116 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ SUTHERLAND +++$+++ Sounds like they make tennis rackets. What do we know?
L572592 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ Find out about a company called C.R.S.  Consumer Recreation Services.
L572591 +++$+++ u8116 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ SUTHERLAND +++$+++ You know you can.

L572589 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ It was a misunderstanding.

L572328 +++$+++ u8116 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ SUTHERLAND +++$+++ I checked it personally.
L572327 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ Don't ask.
L572326 +++$+++ u8116 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ SUTHERLAND +++$+++ Attractive...
L572325 +++$+++ u8116 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ SUTHERLAND +++$+++ Wanted to wish you luck.  Not that you'll need it.
L572324 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ I wasn't expecting you.
L572301 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ Nothing.  Nothing at all.

L573247 +++$+++ u8117 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ You know what I love about wine that comes in bottles like this?
L573238 +++$+++ u8117 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ It's not Victorian, everyone thinks that the whole nineteenth century was Victorian.  This is gothic, this is English Craftsman, this is Romanesque.  This is... insane.  Who lives here?

L573493 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ Is this true?  I've been hypnotized?
L573492 +++$+++ u8117 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Modelling small-group dynamics in the formation of narrative hallucinations.  You brought us here to scare us.  Insomnia, that was just a decoy issue.  You're disgusting.
L573391 +++$+++ u8117 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ It's somebody's idea of a joke.
L573390 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ Welcome Home Eleanor.  Welcome Home?  I've never been here.  Who did this?
L573337 +++$+++ u8117 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I did okay.
L573336 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ Couldn't get the last ones.  You?
L573335 +++$+++ u8117 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Come on.  These are the typically sentimental gestures of a depraved industrialist.
L573334 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ The children.  The children Hugh Crain built the house for.  The children he never had.
L573235 +++$+++ u8117 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Who's Watts?
L573234 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ I only saw Theo drive up.
L573217 +++$+++ u8117 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Obsessive worrier.  Join the club.  And you?  I'd guess...
L573216 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ Well, I... uh...
L573215 +++$+++ u8117 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ And what kind of sleeper?
L573214 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ Uh... Nell Vance...
L573213 +++$+++ u8117 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Hi, Luke Sanderson, bad sleeper, I'm your basic tosser-turner, and you are...
L573552 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ Watts.  Those were his keys Nell found.  His roommate called and said Watts left when he was supposed to.  I think he's here.
L573551 +++$+++ u8117 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ You're not telling us something.
L573539 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ Just stay there, Nell!
L573538 +++$+++ u8117 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ It's not going to hold your weight.
L573517 +++$+++ u8117 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ She got the child labor stuff from me.
L573516 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ It's a question.
L573515 +++$+++ u8117 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Is that the question of compassion or science?
L573514 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ You get your money.
L573513 +++$+++ u8117 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Do we still get paid for the week?
L573512 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ I gave my key to the gate to Todd, but the Dudleys'll be here in the morning.
L573346 +++$+++ u8117 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ There's a carriage house around back.
L573345 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ And those are Luke's and mine.
L573313 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ Go ahead.
L573312 +++$+++ u8117 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Do you need me anymore?  Cause I'm going to bed.  They can stay up talking another 45 minutes if they want, but I gotta try to get some sleep.
L573288 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ I've read your tests.
L573287 +++$+++ u8117 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Why?
L573286 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ Because... well, I know I can trust you.
L573285 +++$+++ u8117 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Sure.
L573284 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ Luke, can I talk to you?
L573283 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ Yeah.
L573282 +++$+++ u8117 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ That could have been worse.
L573265 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ I thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily.  You'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company.
L573264 +++$+++ u8117 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test?
L573226 +++$+++ u8117 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Greetings.
L573225 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ And this is my assistant, Mary Lambretta.
L573582 +++$+++ u8117 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ We can't stay here looking for her.  She doesn't want to be found...
L573581 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Nell!
L573577 +++$+++ u8117 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Where in the hell can she be.
L573576 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Was sure she'd be in here.
L573570 +++$+++ u8117 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ -- how much is this car worth?
L573569 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Nell --
L573550 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Will the two of you shut up!  God damn it!  Maybe the tests were right, Marrow.  She's sensitive, she's vulnerable, but I don't think she's suicidal and I didn't have to test her.  Maybe she wasn't trying to kill herself. Maybe she was really scared. Maybe she really heard voices.
L573549 +++$+++ u8117 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ You used the wrong test.
L573528 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Maybe someday.
L573527 +++$+++ u8117 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ You want company?
L573526 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Yeah.
L573525 +++$+++ u8117 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ All night?
L573524 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ That depends on your definition of ghosts.  I'm going to check on her, and then I'm going to stay awake.
L573523 +++$+++ u8117 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ You don't really believe it's haunted... Do you believe in ghosts?
L573522 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ We're fucked.  We're in a haunted house and we can't get out until the morning.
L573469 +++$+++ u8117 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ The whole thing feels like experimental misdirection.  Like he says it's about one thing, a psychological profile of environmental effects on insomnia... and that'd be a legitimate study, but I think that we've been subjected to an academic bait and switch; he's really looking at something else.
L573468 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Mister very talky, would you please say what it is about this study that bothers you?
L573396 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ No.
L573395 +++$+++ u8117 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ So could you!  Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?
L573394 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You could have.
L573393 +++$+++ u8117 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I didn't do it.
L573348 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ He must have left.  Didn't like the looks of the place or something.
L573347 +++$+++ u8117 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Well, this lot is full!
L573309 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Luke.
L573308 +++$+++ u8117 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Hey!  I heard screaming...
L573291 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ And why didn't Marrow tell <u>us</u>? Doesn't he trust women?  That fuck.
L573290 +++$+++ u8117 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ He said that Hugh Crain... Hugh Crain was a monster.  He said that he was a brutal, horrible man.  He told me that Crain drove his workers to early deaths.  Crain had children chained to the looms in his mill.  And listen to this: his beautiful Rene killed herself.
L573252 +++$+++ u8117 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Nah, you're going crazy with doubt, all of your mistakes are coming back up the pipes, and it's worse than a nightmare. --
L573251 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ The rest of you may hate your insomnia, but I find it the best time of the day for me.  I'm alone.  Nobody's talking to me but myself.  My mind is racing with ideas, and I can think.
L573099 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ This is the last chapter.  Please, please give me clearance.  It's for science.
L573098 +++$+++ u8118 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.
L573097 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ She needed a job, Malcolm.  And she's smart.  And she helps me.
L573096 +++$+++ u8118 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I, I just can't...
L573095 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ No.
L573094 +++$+++ u8118 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Does she know that's why you're using her?
L573093 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ No, but she does, and that's all that matters.
L573092 +++$+++ u8118 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ You don't believe in the paranormal.
L573091 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ And after she was thrown out, she needed a job.
L573090 +++$+++ u8118 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Why are you working with her? Mary Lambretta was thrown out of the department for trying to get a Ph.D. in psychic studies.
L573089 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ Mary, I'll meet you outside.
L573088 +++$+++ u8118 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Are you working with her?
L573087 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ But if the group knows it's being studied as a group, you contaminate the results.  The deception is minor.
L573086 +++$+++ u8118 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Not the way you've constructed your group, it's just not ethical!
L573085 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ No, Malcolm!  Individual performance is only part of it.  I know why baseball players choke for no reason, I know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert, and need to, to give a great performance, but what I want to know is, how fear works in a group...
L573084 +++$+++ u8118 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ And that will be a good place to end this study.
L573083 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ Malcolm, this is essential work I'm doing.  Just think what my research can do for education. Elementary school classrooms near train tracks or airports, where loud noise is random; this helps to prove the need for sound insulation if the children are ever going to learn to read.
L573081 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ Come on Malcolm, it's only seven ohms, it's nothing, it's like a joy buzzer!  And it's not about the pain, it's about the interference with concentration...
L573080 +++$+++ u8118 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ It's still an electric shock!
L573606 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ Nothing, if you leave right now. There's a war going on all around us.  Don't get in the way, please.
L573605 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ What'll happen to us, Nell?
L573595 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ No --
L573594 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ Come on.
L573593 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ My mother used to hum this to me. Like her mother hummed it to her. And my great grandmother Carolyn hummed it to her.
L573592 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ No.
L573568 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ Then who called me?
L573567 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ Nell, the first time I ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here.
L573566 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ But you told me to look in the paper!  You told me I'd be perfect!
L573544 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ Nell.  You will come here now.
L573543 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ The children want me.  They're calling me.  They need me.
L573502 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ Because that's where he burned them up, the child laborers from his mills!  Because that's where their bones are!  He killed <i>hundreds</i>.  He took them here and he killed them.  Their bones are in the fireplace!
L573501 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ Why would we want to do that, Nell?
L573495 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ It's not real?  Crain?  He's not real?
L573494 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ I hadn't done a study of how group fear affects individual performance.  Mass hysteria is like a story, Nell.  A communal story.  Someone starts it.  Then we all add a little more to it. And then for some reason -- no one knows how -- we start believing it.  This story shapes what we see and hear.  We interpret everything through it, make it fit the story. I started our story when I gave you the history of Hill House. You've added to it.  That's what this experiment has all been about.  That's what it was about, the experiment's over.  I'm pulling the plug.  This is my fault.
L573486 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ And they're all locked together in here... and he won't let go of them!
L573485 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ Nell... please, Nell... take a deep breath...
L573433 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ I don't know.  A lullaby I guess. My mother used to hum it to me. And her mother before that, and so on.  Hugh Crain, would you care to dance?
L573432 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ What is that tune?
L573431 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ It doesn't matter.  Even if they're tormenting me, someone wants me.  What I do with this is up to me.  I can be a victim, or I can be a volunteer.  And I want to be the volunteer.
L573430 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ I don't know.
L573429 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ Why?
L573428 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ Someone is playing with you.
L573411 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ Sure.
L573410 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ You'll never see it again.  Mr. Dudley's taking care of it.  I'm sorry, Nell.  Can I show you something you'd like to see?
L573409 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ Welcome Home.
L573408 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ It was.
L573407 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ It was a stupid thing to do.
L573406 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ I don't know.
L573405 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ Let's say it wasn't you.  Who did it?
L573404 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ I wish I were.  I wish I had done it, then I could confess and you'd be at peace.  That great moral philosopher Frank Sinatra once said to someone he loved, I wish you had an enemy, so I could beat him up.
L573403 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ Are you coming to confess?
L573386 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ No you're not.  Something moved you.  You saw something.
L573385 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ I'm sorry.  I'm messing up the study.
L573384 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ Hmm.
L573383 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ I got more scared.
L573382 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ And then what happened?
L573381 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ Yes.
L573380 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ Like she smelled it too?
L573379 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ I looked at Theo.  She had a look on her face.
L573378 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ What happened after you smelled it?
L573377 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.
L573376 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ So... smell... is... Smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories.  And a memory can trigger a smell.
L573375 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ In the bathroom in my mother's room, the toilet was next to an old wooden table.  It smelled like that wood.
L573374 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ All right...
L573373 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ It was very specific.
L573372 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ What did it smell like?
L573371 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ That smell... oh, God.
L573370 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ Nell!  What's wrong?
L573326 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ For an American you do a good imitation of the British at their most apologetic.  Pardon me.  Excuse me, sorry, sorry...
L573325 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ Sorry.
L573318 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ How do you feel about Luke's suggestion that it was just the old plumbing?  Water hammer, something like that?
L573317 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ Theo I think.  You've asked us that three times, Doctor Marrow. What's going on?
L573316 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ The cold sensation.  Who felt it first?
L573271 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ But there's a sad catch to the story.
L573270 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ All the carvings.
L573258 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ Yes, because someone was always keeping me awake.  Ever since I was little.  That was my job.  I took care of my mother and I had to be there for her all night long, and she woke up all the time.  And after she died, well, it's been a few months, but I still, I still wake up, it's... a habit.  I know we've only known each other a couple of hours, but I'm really glad to be with people who let me talk about this.  I'm really happy to be here with you.
L573257 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ You wrote that you had trouble sleeping.
L573231 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ Well... we're glad to have you.
L573230 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim.
L573229 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ Nell.  Good enough.  And I'm Jim.
L573228 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.
L573227 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ Eleanor, how was the drive?
