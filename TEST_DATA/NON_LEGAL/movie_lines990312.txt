L520654 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ He's a shoo-in.  I got the word from Max the waiter - his brother-in-law is the electrician who wires the rabbit -
L520653 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You're going to bet my money on a dog?
L520652 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ First thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.
L520651 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ We're not?
L520650 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ No we're not.
L520649 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.
L520648 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Of course I am.
L520647 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You're right, Joe.
L520646 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ How can you be so selfish?  We owe back rent - we're in four eighty-nine bucks to Moe's Delicatessen - we're being sued by three Chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry - we've borrowed money from every girl in the line -
L520645 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ It's just a little inlay - it doesn't even have to be gold -
L520644 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Dentist?  We been out of work for four months - and you want to blow your first week's pay on your teeth?
L520643 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Because I lost a filling in my back tooth. I gotta go to the dentist tomorrow.
L520642 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yeah.  Why?
L520641 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I mean, we get paid tonight, don't we?
L520640 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'll say.
L520639 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Say, Joe - tonight's the night, isn't it?
L521844 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ That's what I call a louse!  If I were you, Sugar, I'd throw that bracelet right back in his face.
L521843 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ He's going to South America to marry some other girl - that's what they call high finance.
L521842 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Thirty-four.
L521841 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Junior gave it to me.  It must have at least thirty stones -
L521840 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I always did.
L521839 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ You like it?
L521838 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ How did you get that bracelet?
L521697 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ And talk about elegant - you should see the yacht - candlelight - mint sauce and cranberries.
L521696 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ What for?
L521695 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Of course not.  As a matter of fact, it was just the other way around.  You see he needs help.
L521694 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Did he get fresh?
L521690 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I know what you need - a slug of bourbon.
L521689 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ I thought I heard voices - and I just had to talk to somebody.  I don't feel like going to sleep.
L521509 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Yes.
L521508 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ No!
L521507 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Yes.  He wants me to have supper with him - on his yacht - he's going to pick me up at the pier.
L521506 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ No!
L521454 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ What do you think, Josephine?  What does it say in your crystal ball?
L521453 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ I hope so.
L521452 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ What do you mean, maybe?  I saw the way he looked at you.  He'll be there for sure.
L521437 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ I met one of them.
L521436 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Oh, come on - you can do better than that.
L521429 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ That's it.  Something tells me she's going to walk through that door in a whole new outfit.
L521428 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Do you suppose she went out shopping?
L521427 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Yeah.  This is one for Ripley.
L521426 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Believe it or not - Josephine predicted the whole thing.
L521425 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ No, no, Sugar - wait.  I have a feeling she's going to show up any minute.
L521424 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Well, I'll come back later.
L521423 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ That's funny.  Josie -  I can't imagine where she can be.
L521422 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ I guess she's not in here.
L521421 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Josephine -
L521420 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Oh yes, we do!
L521419 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ We don't have to run.
L521418 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Neither can I.  Come on - lets go up to her room and tell her - right now.
L521417 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -
L521416 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Yeah - Josephine.
L521415 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ If I'd been watching my step, I never would have met him.  Wait till I tell Josephine.
L521414 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Sugar, dear - let me give you some advice. If I were a girl - and I am - I'd watch my step.
L521413 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Now look, Daphne - hands off - I saw him first.
L521412 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Well, I'll be - !   How about that guy?
L521411 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Come on, Daphne.
L521410 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Oh, please do come.  Don't disappoint us. It'll be such fun.  And bring your yacht.
L521403 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Or was it Bryn Mawr?
L521402 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I'm a what?
L521401 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ It sleeps twelve.  This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.
L521400 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ His yacht?
L521397 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Vanity Fair?
L521396 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ I recognized him too - his picture was in Vanity Fair.
L521392 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Okay.
L521391 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Run along, Daphne - I'll catch up with you.
L521390 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Come on, Sugar - time to change for dinner.
L521314 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ You're so flat-chested.  Clothes hang so much better on you than they do on me.
L521313 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ What's that?
L521312 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ But there's one thing I envy you for.
L521311 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
L521310 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -
L521309 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You should have seen me before I went on a diet.
L521308 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ You know, Daphne - I had no idea you were such a big girl.
L521306 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Just a little trick I picked up in the elevator.
L521305 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ What do you think you're doing?
L521303 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ She'll rub it on me - and I'll rub it on her - and we'll rub it on each other - bye.
L521302 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Oh, I have some suntan lotion.
L521298 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ We'll rent some at the bathhouse. How about you, Josephine?
L521297 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ See?  She doesn't have one either -  You don't?
L521294 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You betcha.
L521293 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ A bunch of us girls are going for a swim. Want to come along?
L521292 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Here you are, Sugar.
L521191 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Thank you, Daphne.
L521190 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I'll carry the instruments.
L521088 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ I'm just going to get some ice.
L521087 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Not you, Sugar.
L521066 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Oh, Sugar.  You're going to spoil my surprise.
L521065 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ And bring the cocktail shaker.
L521062 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ We have some bourbon - lets make Manhattans.
L521061 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Who needs vermouth?
L521056 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ No fair guessing.
L521055 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Here.  This'll put hair on your chest.
L521054 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ We better have a drink first.
L521053 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ When?
L521052 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Uh-uh.  Not yet.
L521051 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ What's the surprise?
L521050 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ So spill it.  Spills, thrills, laughs, games - this may even turn out to be a surprise party.
L521049 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ I may spill something.
L521048 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ No - no lights.  We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.
L521047 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.
L521046 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I tell you - this is the only way to travel.
L521044 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Half-full.
L521043 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ How's the bottle?
L521042 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I'm fine.
L521041 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ You all right?
L521040 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I know where to get some.  Don't move.
L521039 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ You got some?
L521038 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Look, Sugar, if you feel you're coming down with something, the best thing is a shot of whiskey.
L521037 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ I have a very low resistance.
L521036 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I'm not that sick.
L521035 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Maybe I'd better go before I catch something.
L521034 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I'm a very sick girl.
L521033 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ What did you say?
L521032 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I'm a girl, I'm a girl, I'm a girl -
L521031 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Let me warm them a little.  There - isn't that better?
L521030 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Isn't that ridiculous?
L521029 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ And you've got cold feet.
L521028 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ That's ridiculous.
L521027 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ And your head is hot.
L521026 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ That's ridiculous.
L521025 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Why you poor thing - you're trembling all over.
L521024 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ No, no.
L521023 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Anything wrong?
L521022 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Interesting.
L521021 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ When I was a little girl, on cold nights like this, I used to crawl into bed with my sister.  We'd cuddle up under the covers, and pretend we were lost in a dark cave, and were trying to find out way out.
L521020 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ No.  It's nice and cozy.
L521019 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ I'm not crowding you, am I?
L521018 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Stay as long as you'd like.
L521017 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ I'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep.
L521016 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ We won't tell anybody - not even Josephine.
L521015 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ I don't want her to know we're in cahoots.
L521014 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Sssh.  Sweet Sue.
L521013 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ And that's one of them.
L521012 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Oh, I can think of a million things -
L521011 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ If there's anything I can do for you -
L521010 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ It must be freezing outside.  When I think of you - and your poor ukulele -
L521009 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ If it hadn't been for you, they would have kicked me off the train.  I'd be out there in the middle of nowhere, sitting on my ukulele.
L521008 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ It's nothing.  I just think us girls should stick together.
L521007 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal.
L521006 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Oh - Sugar!
L520991 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Honey - she called me honey.
L520990 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Good night, honey.
L520989 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Good night, Sugar.
L520947 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ See you around, girls.
L520946 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I'll say.
L520945 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Are my seams straight?
L520942 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ I don't want you to think that I'm a drinker. I can stop any time I want to - only I don't want to.  Especially when I'm blue.
L520941 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ We'll take a rain check.
L520938 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ I don't really have much of a voice - but then it's not much of a band, either.  I'm only with 'em because I'm running away.
L520937 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ She sings, too.
L520929 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ I'm Sugar Cane.
L520928 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ That's us.  I'm Daphne - and this is Josephine.
L520925 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ That's all right.  I was afraid it was Sweet Sue. You won't tell anybody, will you?
L520924 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Terribly sorry.
L520923 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ OH!
L521169 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I'm sorry. I was having a nightmare.  Something I ate.  I'm not at all well.  See?  Hot water bottle.
L521168 +++$+++ u7721 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ What's the big idea?
L521167 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I was it.
L520975 +++$+++ u7721 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ I thought you said three years.
L520974 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Yes.  For a whole year.
L520973 +++$+++ u7721 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Didn't you girls say you went to a conservatory?
L520960 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Oh - those.  I don't know.  Mice?
L520959 +++$+++ u7721 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ How did those holes get there?
L520887 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Oh - here and there - and around.
L520886 +++$+++ u7721 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Where did you girls play before?
L520881 +++$+++ u7721 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ This is our manager, Mr. Bienstock. I'm Sweet Sue.
L520880 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Brand new.
L520785 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Look, if William Morris doesn't come through -
L520784 +++$+++ u7719 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ POLIAKOFF +++$+++ Hello, Mr. Morris? This is Poliakoff, in Chicago. Say, you wouldn't have a couple of girl musicians available? A sax player and a base?
L520773 +++$+++ u7719 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ POLIAKOFF +++$+++ What's with him - he drinks?
L520772 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Wait a minute, Joe.  Lets talk this over.  Why couldn't we do it?  Last year, when we played in that gypsy tearoom, we wore gold earrings.  And you remember when you booked us with that Hawaiian band?  Grass skirts!
L520771 +++$+++ u7719 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ POLIAKOFF +++$+++ Yes, I'm holding on.
L520766 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ We could -
L520765 +++$+++ u7719 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ POLIAKOFF +++$+++ - and you got to be girls.
L520764 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ We could dye our hair.
L520763 +++$+++ u7719 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ POLIAKOFF +++$+++ - you got to be blonde -
L520762 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ We could pass for that.
L520757 +++$+++ u7719 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ POLIAKOFF +++$+++ You're the wrong shape.  Goodbye.
L520756 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ What's wrong with us?
L520750 +++$+++ u7719 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ POLIAKOFF +++$+++ The Florida job?
L520749 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ It's about the Florida job.
L521941 +++$+++ u7717 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ OSGOOD +++$+++ Well - nobody's perfect.
L521940 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ But you don't understand!  I'm a MAN!
L521939 +++$+++ u7717 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ OSGOOD +++$+++ We'll adopt some.
