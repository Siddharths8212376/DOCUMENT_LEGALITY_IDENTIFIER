N'if you go to war again, who is it going to be against?  Your "ability to fight a Two-ocean War" against who?  Sweden and <u>Togo</u>? Who you sitting here to Go To War Against?  That time has <u>passed</u>.  It's <u>passed</u>.  It's <u>over</u>.  The War of the Future is <u>Nuclear Terrorism</u>.  It is and it will be against a Small Group of Dissidents who, unbeknownst, perhaps, to their own <u>governments</u>, have blah blah blah. And to go to <u>that</u> war, you've got to be <u>prepared</u>.  You have to be alert, and the <u>public</u> has to be alert. Cause that is the war of the <u>future</u>, and if you're not gearing up, to fight <u>that</u> war, <u>eventually</u> the axe will fall.  N'you're gonna be out in the street.  And you can call this a "drill," or you can call it "job security," or you can call it anything you like. But I got one for you:  you said, "Go to War to protect your Way of Life,"  well, Chuck, <u>this</u>  is your way of life.  Innit?  And if there ain't no war, you can punch out, go home, and take up Oil Painting.  And there <u>ain't</u> no war but ours.
