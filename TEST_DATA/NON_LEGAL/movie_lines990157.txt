L407033 +++$+++ u6794 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Where are you going?

L407031 +++$+++ u6794 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Where's Bill?
L407030 +++$+++ u6792 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You're not.
L407029 +++$+++ u6794 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Sorry I'm late.
L407206 +++$+++ u6800 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Mary?
L407205 +++$+++ u6794 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I mean...
L407204 +++$+++ u6800 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Oh?
L407203 +++$+++ u6794 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You know Bill is really mad at you.
L407202 +++$+++ u6794 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ They're looking all over for you. Do you have a copy of the album.
L407201 +++$+++ u6800 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Not yet. Listen, Norman, I want...
L407200 +++$+++ u6794 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Pretty good. Sure was surprised to hear from you. You talk to Bill?
L407199 +++$+++ u6800 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ How's your stomach?
L406978 +++$+++ u6800 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Just a minute.
L406977 +++$+++ u6796 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ OPAL +++$+++ Come on.
L406976 +++$+++ u6800 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Yeah, you bet. You're really terrific. You know what I mean?
L406975 +++$+++ u6796 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ OPAL +++$+++ Come on back to bed.
L406918 +++$+++ u6800 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Depends on what I'm studying.
L406917 +++$+++ u6796 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ OPAL +++$+++ Do you study at all?
L406916 +++$+++ u6800 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Probably a little too long.
L406915 +++$+++ u6796 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ OPAL +++$+++ How long have you been together?
L406914 +++$+++ u6800 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Dent it a little. Boy -- just she couldn1t even find it. She had a hamburger on her desk that looked three weeks old.
L406913 +++$+++ u6796 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ OPAL +++$+++ Did it break?
L406912 +++$+++ u6800 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ No  Hell, some secretary in New York just hands it to you. Only this one kept dropping it out of the box.
L406911 +++$+++ u6796 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ OPAL +++$+++ Do they have a show to give it to you?
L406910 +++$+++ u6800 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ We just got a gold record.
L407068 +++$+++ u6796 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ OPAL +++$+++ What? Oh. A film.
L407067 +++$+++ u6801 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ TRIPLETTE +++$+++ What?
L407066 +++$+++ u6796 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ OPAL +++$+++ Why?
L407065 +++$+++ u6801 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ TRIPLETTE +++$+++ Why?
L407064 +++$+++ u6796 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ OPAL +++$+++ The architect  His buildings are drippy. You know, like sand and castles. Then I got this assignment. They want to start in two weeks.
L407063 +++$+++ u6796 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ OPAL +++$+++ I'm gathering information about the characteristics of music people. I just finished a documentary on Gandi.
L407062 +++$+++ u6801 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ TRIPLETTE +++$+++ Oh yes, I'm John Triplette.
L407061 +++$+++ u6796 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ OPAL +++$+++ I'm Opal.
L407060 +++$+++ u6801 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ TRIPLETTE +++$+++ Hello.
L407059 +++$+++ u6796 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ OPAL +++$+++ Hi.
L406841 +++$+++ u6797 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ REESE +++$+++ I'll be dammed.
L406840 +++$+++ u6801 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ TRIPLETTE +++$+++ Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here.
L406839 +++$+++ u6797 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ REESE +++$+++ I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be something?
L406838 +++$+++ u6801 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ TRIPLETTE +++$+++ Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.
L406837 +++$+++ u6797 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ REESE +++$+++ You really do?  ~ God -- How come you know them?
L406836 +++$+++ u6801 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ TRIPLETTE +++$+++ Ryan O'Neal.
L406835 +++$+++ u6797 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ REESE +++$+++ I never heard of him. Name somebody else.
L406834 +++$+++ u6801 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ TRIPLETTE +++$+++ Peter Finch -- he's English.
L406833 +++$+++ u6797 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ REESE +++$+++ Who?
L406832 +++$+++ u6801 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ TRIPLETTE +++$+++ Ah... Peter Finch.
L406831 +++$+++ u6797 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ REESE +++$+++ No kidding -- Wait till I tell Linnea. Who?
L406830 +++$+++ u6801 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ TRIPLETTE +++$+++ I know a couple.
L406829 +++$+++ u6797 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ REESE +++$+++ Well, I admire your optimism, and I just wondered if it was regional. You ever see any movie stars?
L406828 +++$+++ u6801 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ TRIPLETTE +++$+++ Spent time in Arizona. Why?
L406827 +++$+++ u6797 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ REESE +++$+++ You always live there?
L406826 +++$+++ u6801 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ TRIPLETTE +++$+++ Southern California.
L406825 +++$+++ u6797 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ REESE +++$+++ Where are you from?
L406824 +++$+++ u6801 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ TRIPLETTE +++$+++ You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.
L406823 +++$+++ u6797 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ REESE +++$+++ He was a good Judge, but that was a long time ago.
L406822 +++$+++ u6801 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ TRIPLETTE +++$+++ He is to a lot of people.
L406821 +++$+++ u6797 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ REESE +++$+++ He ain't really new.
L406820 +++$+++ u6801 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ TRIPLETTE +++$+++ Oh yea -- There has never been a better time for something new.
L406819 +++$+++ u6797 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ REESE +++$+++ You do?
L406818 +++$+++ u6801 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ TRIPLETTE +++$+++ Well, I really think he's got a chance.
L406817 +++$+++ u6797 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ REESE +++$+++ We're connected by a relative. One time, one of his aunts married one of my uncles. That was a long time ago, though. How'd you come to work for him?
L406816 +++$+++ u6801 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ TRIPLETTE +++$+++ Oh --
L406815 +++$+++ u6797 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ REESE +++$+++ No, we never did that
L406814 +++$+++ u6801 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ TRIPLETTE +++$+++ You go to school together?
L406813 +++$+++ u6797 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ REESE +++$+++ Hal? Well, Hal and I have been friends for a long time.
L406812 +++$+++ u6801 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ TRIPLETTE +++$+++ What do you think of him?
L406741 +++$+++ u6797 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ REESE +++$+++ Where is she?
L406740 +++$+++ u6801 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ TRIPLETTE +++$+++ Pleasure
L406798 +++$+++ u6802 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Sure thing.
L406797 +++$+++ u6799 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ SUELEEN +++$+++ You think it will?
L406796 +++$+++ u6802 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Well, honey, I sure hope it comes your way then.
L406795 +++$+++ u6799 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ SUELEEN +++$+++ Wade -- I've been working toward this audition for years.
L406794 +++$+++ u6802 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You serious?
L406793 +++$+++ u6799 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ SUELEEN +++$+++ If you're serious. Being serious is real important.
L406792 +++$+++ u6802 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You think I should take lessons?
L406791 +++$+++ u6799 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ SUELEEN +++$+++ It's not bad.
L406790 +++$+++ u6802 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Is that good?
L406789 +++$+++ u6799 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ SUELEEN +++$+++ You sure do it loud.
L406788 +++$+++ u6802 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You think I got any kind of a voice?
L406787 +++$+++ u6799 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ SUELEEN +++$+++ No -- That's exercises. My coach says you have to do exercise because the vocal chords are muscle and need to be stretched. Every time you stretch them, the middle part sets stronger. That's the place where I sing.
L406712 +++$+++ u6802 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Well, you just remember, if you can't kick front, kick back, 'cause at least you're kicking... Ten minutes, okay?
L406711 +++$+++ u6799 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ SUELEEN +++$+++ Got me an audition tonight.
L406710 +++$+++ u6799 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ SUELEEN +++$+++ You bet.
L406709 +++$+++ u6802 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ You want a ride into town?
L407415 +++$+++ u6801 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ TRIPLETTE +++$+++ Now, Sueleen, you know that's not what we talked about right here in this very room.
L407414 +++$+++ u6799 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ SUELEEN +++$+++ Don't you think they'd just love another song instead?
L407412 +++$+++ u6801 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ TRIPLETTE +++$+++ I know that you are an artist and I am sure you are very religious.
L407411 +++$+++ u6799 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ SUELEEN +++$+++ I see.
L407410 +++$+++ u6801 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ TRIPLETTE +++$+++ Now this is to raise funds for someone who can help people who are less fortunate than yourself. The more you take off, you see, more money we can raise.
L407403 +++$+++ u6801 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ TRIPLETTE +++$+++ May I see your costume?
L407402 +++$+++ u6799 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ SUELEEN +++$+++ Oh, why thank you.
L407401 +++$+++ u6801 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ TRIPLETTE +++$+++ I'm John Triplette. Excuse me. I got all caught up in looking at you. You'll be fine.
L407400 +++$+++ u6799 +++$+++ m453 +++$+++ SUELEEN +++$+++ Hi, I'm Sueleen Gay.
L407959 +++$+++ u6804 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ What...
L407958 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Thank you. Grace, there is one other thing...
L407940 +++$+++ u6804 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Yes, you are.
L407939 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ That means his hands are considered a weapon like a gun or a knife. Am I correct on that point?
L407938 +++$+++ u6804 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Yes, they were.
L407937 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Point of fact, weren't Tim's hands registered as lethal weapons?
L407936 +++$+++ u6804 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Yes, I would.
L407935 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ So, I think it would be safe to say that anybody who studied the fighting style that Bruce Lee, arguably the greatest martial artist of all times, developed for nine years, that would be a fella who could defend himself. Would you describe Tim that way, Grace?
L407934 +++$+++ u6804 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ That's what Tim said.
L407933 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Now, while I freely admit total ignorance on the subject, I have heard of Bruce Lee. And I was under the impression that Bruce Lee was one of the, if not <u>the</u> greatest fighter in the history of martial arts.
L407932 +++$+++ u6804 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Yes, I did. That's why Tim studied it. Because it was Bruce Lee's fighting style.
L407931 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Jeet Kune Do...Now I did some research on that form of fighting, and I found out that Jeet Kune Do was a style developed by Bruce Lee. Did you know that?
L407930 +++$+++ u6804 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Tim studied several styles, but his favorite was Jeet Kune Do.
L407929 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Is that a fact? Well then, Grace, could you tell us what form of martial arts it was that Tim was schooled in?
L407928 +++$+++ u6804 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ The style of fighting that Tim studied didn't believe in belts.
L407927 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ What was the color of Tim's belt?
L407926 +++$+++ u6804 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Yes you are.
L407925 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ When you study the martial arts, they give out belts that come in different colors to signify what level you're at in your training. Am I correct on that point?
L407920 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ More or less...
L407919 +++$+++ u6804 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ More or less.
L407579 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ No, but that don't mean much. I was a completely different person ten years ago. Let's give key lime a day in court. And a large glass of milk.
L407578 +++$+++ u6805 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MABEL +++$+++ When ya had it, did ya like it?
L407577 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I haven't had a key lime pie in ten years.
L407576 +++$+++ u6805 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MABEL +++$+++ The key lime is great, but it's an acquired taste.
L407575 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Which do you recommend?
L407574 +++$+++ u6805 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MABEL +++$+++ Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.
L407573 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ What kind of pies do you have?
L408394 +++$+++ u6806 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MALLORY +++$+++ Well, back in slave times they had a thing called the underground railroad. And we got a whole fan club out there just waiting to be conductors.  So, you kids out there, keep the faith. Cause Mickey and Mallory will be comin' to your town real soon.
L408393 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ How do you intend to disappear? you're probably the most famous couple in America.
L408392 +++$+++ u6806 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MALLORY +++$+++ Well, now me and Mickey are gonna take it easy. Just enjoy each other's company, stop and smell the roses, notice the color purple, stuff like that.
L408387 +++$+++ u6806 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MALLORY +++$+++ We had nothing to do with that riot. That riot was just -- whatchmacallit --

L408385 +++$+++ u6806 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MALLORY +++$+++ Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?
L408384 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Did you have anything to do with the riot in the laundry room?
L408383 +++$+++ u6806 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MALLORY +++$+++ I wondered how long it would be before we'd get to be alone together. And I wondered if I could wait that long.
L408382 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ What did you think then?
L408381 +++$+++ u6806 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MALLORY +++$+++ It wasn't 'till we got on the ground floor that I totally realized they weren't gonna shoot unless we shot first. When we got out of the stairwell, I remember thinking, 'Oh my God. This might work.' But Mickey knew it would work all along. There wasn't any doubt in his mind. It's not like there was and he just didn't show it. He knew it would work.
L408380 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Mallory, what did you think of Mickey's plan? Did you think it would work?
L408402 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I said we'd give you an interview. I never said we wouldn't kill you.
L408401 +++$+++ u6806 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MALLORY +++$+++ Looked like an interview to me.
L408389 +++$+++ u6806 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MALLORY +++$+++ What he said. We didn't know jack shit about and riot. It just happened. It was kismet. We didn't even know those people. How are we supposed to organize a riot when we've been in fuckin' isolation for the past year? Just bleep out the fucks and jack shits.  I mean, it's not like we care. If they wanna say we masterminded the whole thing, let 'em. It won't exactly keep us up at night. But you said you wanted the truth, and the truth is we were just lucky.
L408388 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Divine intervention.
L408348 +++$+++ u6808 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ We still got a few tricks up our sleeves.
