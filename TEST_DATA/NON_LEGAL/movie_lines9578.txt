L67905 +++$+++ u3878 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ What?
L67904 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Don't!  I know about your husband.  You still like girls, Beth?
L67903 +++$+++ u3878 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ I got a message on my machine to meet Gus here.  Where is he?
L67902 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Put your fucking hands up!  Don't move.
L67901 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Put your hands up!
L67900 +++$+++ u3878 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L67801 +++$+++ u3878 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ She's evil.  She's brilliant.  Be careful, Nick.
L67800 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ You should do something about this lock.
L67798 +++$+++ u3878 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ I got married.  He was on staff at the clinic.  I was down in Salinas.  It didn't... last long.
L67797 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Why did you change your name?
L67796 +++$+++ u3878 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ She knew you'd find out who Lisa Henderson is.  You're a good cop -- what did she do?  Tell you casually and make it seem irrelevant?  Did she tell you in bed, Nick? That's how I'd do it.
L67795 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ She didn't hand you to me.  She doesn't even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson.
L67794 +++$+++ u3878 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ She's really sick you know.  Don't you know what she's doing?  She knows I went to Berkeley.  She knows I knew Noah.  She makes up that story about me.  She's handing you somebody who's obsessed with he her.
L67792 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ You saw all the reports, Beth!
L67791 +++$+++ u3878 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ I had him in two classes.
L67790 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Did you know Noah Goldstein?
L67789 +++$+++ u3878 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ I did dye my hair.  It didn't have anything to do with her.  I was a redhead for a while, too.
L67786 +++$+++ u3878 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ I slept with her once in school.  I was just a kid.  I was experimenting.  It was just that one time.  She developed a... fixation... on me.  She styled her hair like mine. She wore the same kind of clothes I did.  It scared me.
L67785 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What did she tell me, Beth?
L67784 +++$+++ u3878 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ She told you, didn't she?
L67783 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Tell me about Catherine.
L67782 +++$+++ u3878 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ What do you want, Nick?
L67692 +++$+++ u3878 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ I know the type.  I'm a psychologist.
L67691 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I thought you hardly know her.
L67690 +++$+++ u3878 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ My interest is in you, not in her. She seduces people, she manipulates --
L67689 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What is this interest you've got in her?
L67688 +++$+++ u3878 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Yes you do.  Something's on with you.  You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
L67687 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I don't need any help.
L67686 +++$+++ u3878 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ What is your problem?  I'm trying to help you.  Why won't you let me help you?
L67529 +++$+++ u3878 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Yes you did.  I'm a big girl.  I can handle it.
L67528 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Beth.  I didn't mean what I said. About --
L67526 +++$+++ u3878 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ I hardly knew her.  She gave me the creeps, though.  I don't know why.
L67525 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What was she like in school?
L67524 +++$+++ u3878 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ She must really be something.  From a clinical point of view.
L67523 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ She knows stuff about me that only you know.
L67522 +++$+++ u3878 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ How do you know Catherine Tramell saw my reports?
L67521 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ No.  I mean it, thank you.
L67520 +++$+++ u3878 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ It's the least I could do... considering I got you into this mess with those reports.
L67481 +++$+++ u3878 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Yes.  I care about you.  I did it for you.
L67480 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ You did it for me.
L67476 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Yeah?  Well why don't you find some friendly therapist and work some of that hostility out.  But take my advice.  Put a little more life into it than you usually do.
L67475 +++$+++ u3878 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Sometimes I really hate you.
L67474 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I don't owe you anything; you don't owe me anything.  We went to bed -- what was it? -- ten or fifteen times?  It wasn't memorable enough to carry any obligations.
L67454 +++$+++ u3878 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Nilsen.
L67453 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Who?
L67452 +++$+++ u3878 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ No, Nick, please --
L67451 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ It's Internal Affairs, isn't it?
L67450 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Don't, Beth.  Don't lie to me.
L67449 +++$+++ u3878 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ It's a confidential psychiatric record, it'd be illegal --She backs into a wall.  She looks very scared. He comes very close to her -- puts an arm behind her to the wall.
L67447 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Who's got access to my goddamn file?
L67446 +++$+++ u3878 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ What are you talking about, Nick -- what's wrong with you?
L67390 +++$+++ u3878 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ I thought you quit.
L67389 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I need a cigarette.
L67381 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Why didn't you tell me?
L67380 +++$+++ u3878 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ We were in some of the same classes.
L67378 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ She said what you said she'd say.
L67377 +++$+++ u3878 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Catherine Tramell.
L67376 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Who?
L67375 +++$+++ u3878 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ What was she like?
L67366 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What else is new?
L67365 +++$+++ u3878 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Baby-sitting.  Rookie cop.
L67364 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L67363 +++$+++ u3878 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ You don't look so okay.
L67362 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Yeah.
L67361 +++$+++ u3878 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ You okay?
L67159 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Thank you.
L67158 +++$+++ u3878 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Yes.
L67157 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ It's fucked -- now will you please tell I.A. that I'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here?
L67156 +++$+++ u3878 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ How's not smoking?
L67155 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ No!  I'm working my tail off.  I'm off the sauce, I'm not even smoking anymore.
L67154 +++$+++ u3878 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ No?
L67153 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ No.
L67152 +++$+++ u3878 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ How about the coke?
L67151 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ It's been three months.
L67150 +++$+++ u3878 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ How about the booze?
L67148 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ My sex life is fine.  My sex life is pretty shitty actually since I stopped seeing you -- maybe I should think about my Electrolux again.
L67147 +++$+++ u3878 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ How is your -- personal life?
L67146 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Things are fine.  I told you. They're fine.
L67145 +++$+++ u3878 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ So -- how are things?
L67144 +++$+++ u3878 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ I know it is -- but sit down anyway so we can get it over with, okay?
L67143 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ It's bullshit.  You know it is.
L67142 +++$+++ u3878 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ As long as Internal Affairs wants you to, I suppose.  Sit down, Nick.
L67141 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I'm fine.  Come on, Beth!  You know I'm fine!  How the hell long do I have to keep doing this?
L67140 +++$+++ u3878 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ How are you, Nick?
L67933 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ We fuck like minks.  We forget the rugrats.  We live happily ever after.
L67932 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I hate rugrats.
L67931 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ We fuck like minks.  We raise rugrats.  We live happily ever after.
L67930 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ What do we do now, Nick?
L67889 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ The games are over.  You were right. It was the fuck of the century, Shooter.
L67888 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What is this -- some kind of... Joke?  Are we playing games again?
L67887 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ What do you want, Nick?  Flowers? I'll send you some flowers.
L67884 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I told you.  She kills him.
L67883 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ How did it end?
L67882 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I finished my book.
L67852 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Somebody always does.
L67851 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Why?
L67850 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Somebody has to die.
L67849 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Why not?
L67848 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ It won't sell.
L67847 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ They fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after.
L67846 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ What happens to them?
L67845 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ A detective.  He falls for the wrong girl.
L67844 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Really.  What are you writing about.
L67843 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I'm writing a book.
L67842 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ What are you researching?
L67841 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ No thanks.
L67840 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I'm very good at research.  I'll help you.
L67839 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I have to do some research tomorrow.
L67834 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Come over here and tell me no.
L67833 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ No.
L67832 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Did you miss me?
L67831 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.
L67830 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.
L67829 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ How'd you get in here?
L67811 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Liar.
L67810 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ No.
L67809 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ You still think I kill people, don't you?
L67807 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I did, too.  She told me it was backwards -- she said you even styled your hair the way she did.
L67806 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ You're not going to tell me what she's doing.  I thought we weren't playing games anymore.
L67805 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Did you?  What's she doing?
L67804 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I found Lisa Henderson.
L67803 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I just thought I'd surprise you.  What's the matter?
L67766 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Of course I knew.
L67765 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ You like to hang out with murderers or what?  Did you know Roxy --
L67763 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Honey, why don't you go in the car?  I'll be right there.
L67762 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Can I talk to you a minute?
L67735 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Funny.
L67734 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ He asked if I had an icepick in me yet.
L67733 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ What did he say?
L67728 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I'll convince you.
L67727 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I don't know.
L67726 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Do you believe me?
L67725 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Maybe I'm losing interest in my book.
L67724 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What about the other night. What about last night?  Was that to get to know your character?
L67723 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I would've paid more.  I wanted to know everything about you.  Then you came down here after Johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better.
L67722 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ You paid $50,000 for your character?
L67721 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I'd read about your shootings in the papers.  I decided to write a book about a detective.  I wanted to know my character.
L67720 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Why?
L67719 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ About three months before I met you.
L67718 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ When?
L67717 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I paid him $50,000 in cash for your psychiatric file.
L67716 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Try me.
L67715 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ You won't believe me.
L67713 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ No more games, Nick.  I'm tired of playing games!
L67712 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ No?
L67711 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ No.
L67708 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I never have before.
L67707 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I thought you didn't do adolescent secrets.
L67706 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ No, she didn't... she never got jealous before... she got excited.  I don't have luck with women. There was this girl I met while I was in college.  I slept with her once.  She started following me around, taking my picture.  She dyed her hair, copied my clothes. Lisa something... Oberman.  It was awful.
L67705 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Maybe she got jealous of Johnny Boz, too.
L67704 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ For what... to set me up?  She loved me she wouldn't frame me.
L67703 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Do you think she killed Johnny Boz?
L67702 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Make love to me.
L67701 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ It's OK.  It's OK.
L67700 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Everybody that I care about dies.
L67699 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ No.
L67698 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Do you think I told her to kill You?
L67697 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Did you like her to watch?
L67696 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I should have known.  I came into the house when you were down on the beach.  She looked at me so strangely.  She left right after you.  I shouldn't have let her watch us. She wanted to watch me all the time.  She tried to kill you, didn't she?
L67640 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I know.
L67639 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ You're in over your head.
L67638 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I don't have a choice.
L67637 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ You shouldn't play this game.
L67636 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I told you I had a vivid imagination.
L67635 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I thought that business with the scarf was pretty nifty.
L67631 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets?  I don't do those.
L67630 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Are you kidding?  You think this is my idea of morning-after conversation?
L67628 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ It hurts.
L67627 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Fine.  How's your back?
L67626 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ How's your shoulder?
L67623 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Do you want her to join us sometime?
L67622 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ How about Roxy?  Is she a fuck to the century, too?
L67621 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I thought it was a pretty good beginning.
L67620 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What did you think?
L67619 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I told her it was the fuck of the century.
L67618 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Did you think it was so special?
L67616 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ She's seen everything before.
L67615 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Maybe she saw something she didn't see before.
L67601 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I'll meet you there.
L67600 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I'm leaving the house around midnight.  In case you're going to follow me.  I'm going down to Johnny's club.
L67598 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I'm getting deeper and deeper into my character.
L67597 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ How's your new book?
L67596 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ To see if I can get away with it.
L67595 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Why take the risk?
L67594 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I'll risk it.
L67593 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Good.  I'd miss you.  You can get into trouble, though. You're not really a cop anymore.
L67592 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ No.
L67591 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ You're not going to stop following me around now just because you're on leave -- are you?
