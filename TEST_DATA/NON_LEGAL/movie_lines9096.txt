L239631 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ If you guys are right, if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow, I think I could win the Nobel Prize.
L239624 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Oh, yeah.  This could be bigger than the microchip.  They'll probably throw out the entire engineering department and turn their building over to us.  We're probably the first serious scientists to ever molest a dead old lady.
L239623 +++$+++ u1150 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ I guess I got a little overexcited.  Wasn't it incredible!  I'm telling you, this is a first.  You know what this could mean to the University?
L239622 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ "Get her?"  That was your whole plan?  You call that science?
L239615 +++$+++ u1150 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Okay.  Okay.  I got it.  I know what to do. Stay close.  I have a plan.
L239614 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.
L239613 +++$+++ u1150 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Anything!  Just make contact.
L239612 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ What do I say?
L239611 +++$+++ u1150 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ I don't know.  Talk to it.
L239610 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ What do we do now?
L239609 +++$+++ u1150 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ I told you it's real.
L239607 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly.
L239606 +++$+++ u1150 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ What is it?
L239583 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Uh-huh.  I've heard about the rockfall, Ray. I think you've been spending too much time with Spengler.
L239582 +++$+++ u1150 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.
L239581 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Looked at with your eyes.
L239580 +++$+++ u1150 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ What do you mean by "seen?"
L239579 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff.  You've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience.  And what have you seen?
L239578 +++$+++ u1150 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Spengler and I have charted every psychic occurrence in the Tri-State area for the past two years.  The graph we came up with definitely points to something big.
L239574 +++$+++ u1150 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ No, this one's for real, Peter.  Spengler went down there and took some PKE readings. Right off the top of the scale.  Buried the needle.  We're close this time. I can feel it.
L239573 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Sure.  That's great, Ray.  I think you should get down there right away and check it out.  Let me know what happens.
L239572 +++$+++ u1150 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
L239571 +++$+++ u1152 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ VENKMAN +++$+++ Excuse me for a minute.  Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here.  Can you come back in about an hour?
L240268 +++$+++ u1150 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ What do you mean "choose?"  We don't understand.
L240267 +++$+++ u1153 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ What's he talking about?  Choose what?
L240121 +++$+++ u1150 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ LATER, MAN!!
L240120 +++$+++ u1153 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ Stantz?  You okay in there?
L240088 +++$+++ u1153 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ Right.  We'll believe anything.
L240087 +++$+++ u1150 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ You don't have to worry about that with us, sir.
L240083 +++$+++ u1153 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ Well, has it ever occurred to you that the reason you've been so busy lately is because the dead have been rising from their graves?
L240082 +++$+++ u1150 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world.
L240081 +++$+++ u1153 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ Yeah, Judgement Day.
L240080 +++$+++ u1150 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Judgement Day ...
L240079 +++$+++ u1153 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ Right.  And the sky would fall ...
L240078 +++$+++ u1150 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ And the seas would boil ...
L240077 +++$+++ u1153 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
L240076 +++$+++ u1150 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy.
L240075 +++$+++ u1153 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.
L240074 +++$+++ u1150 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ No.  But I liked Jesus' style.
L240073 +++$+++ u1153 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ Do you believe in God?
L240072 +++$+++ u1150 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Boy!  Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325.
L240071 +++$+++ u1153 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ Me, too.
L240070 +++$+++ u1150 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Mmmhmmm.
L240069 +++$+++ u1153 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ Are you a Christian, Ray?
L240068 +++$+++ u1150 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual.
L240067 +++$+++ u1153 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ Hey man.  What is it you're so involved with there?
L239968 +++$+++ u1153 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ Yeah, I heard that.  Now tell me what you really do.
L239967 +++$+++ u1150 +++$+++ m75 +++$+++ STANTZ +++$+++ Very impressive resume.  Electronic countermeasures, Strategic Air Command ... Black belt in Karate ... Small arms expert ... Mr. Zeddemore, as you may have heard, we locate ghosts and spirits, trap them with streams of concentrated quantum energy and remove them from people's homes, offices and places of worship.
L243076 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ What have I got now?  It's exactly as if there were two emperors. Because of this the people have two minds.  He is their champion.
L243075 +++$+++ u1161 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ LUCILLA +++$+++ You would have had a full scale revolt on your hands.
L243074 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ Damn him!  I should have killed him on the front -- I let you talk me out of that.
L243028 +++$+++ u1161 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ LUCILLA +++$+++ Do you want posters, too?
L243027 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ Lykas, pick a man.  Someone who will look good.  Jerses I want it built up in the Daily Action...
L242988 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ Send them out!
L242987 +++$+++ u1161 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ LUCILLA +++$+++ Not yet, dear brother...
L242986 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ I am their hero!
L242985 +++$+++ u1161 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ LUCILLA +++$+++ You want control of the crowd -- you can't get it by killing their hero.
L242984 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ I want that bastard dead!
L242983 +++$+++ u1161 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ LUCILLA +++$+++ You can't do that... listen to the mood of the crowd.
L242982 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ Tell Lykas to send a retiarius and a Samnite to help Tiger.
L242948 +++$+++ u1161 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ LUCILLA +++$+++ "... by the emperor of Rome.  This writer asks:  between a Senate that debates truth until they choke, an Emperor who has the birth sign of a woman, is it possible there is more virtue within the arena than without?"
L242947 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ Yes?  Go on!
L242946 +++$+++ u1161 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ LUCILLA +++$+++ "... encased in the armor of a demigod, Narcissus The Good continues his impossible climb in the arena where he was unjustly cast..."
L242930 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ But I get what I want, always, don't I?
L242929 +++$+++ u1161 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ LUCILLA +++$+++ If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
L242928 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ Now that we're done with that infatuation forever.
L242927 +++$+++ u1161 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ LUCILLA +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L242926 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ Now that is a happy sound! Tomorrow, I want the citizens -- my people -- back in the arena.  The Gods know, I'm tired.  Come to bed, now; tonight we're celebrating.
L242925 +++$+++ u1161 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ LUCILLA +++$+++ The fans of Narcissus.  They were on vigil outside the school of Proximo. They believe he's dying.
L242924 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ What is that... wailing?
L242923 +++$+++ u1161 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ LUCILLA +++$+++ Why are you so surly -- you've won, brother.  The people have bread and the city is quiet.
L242922 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.
L242921 +++$+++ u1161 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ LUCILLA +++$+++ Taking my pleasure.  Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
L242920 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ Where have you been?
L242844 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ I have to come back.  If I don't come back the people will think I'm a coward.  Tribuus, tomorrow he dies -- I want his blood on the sand.  Do you understand?
L242843 +++$+++ u1161 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ LUCILLA +++$+++ You're coming back?
L242842 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ Tribuus... tomorrow.
L242841 +++$+++ u1161 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ LUCILLA +++$+++ You can't do that!  You came here to turn the crowd around not make them hate you.
L242840 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ Kill him!  Tribuus -- execute that bastard.
L242790 +++$+++ u1161 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ LUCILLA +++$+++ Why not do it in the Colosseum?
L242789 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ For the gods, spit it out!
L242788 +++$+++ u1161 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ LUCILLA +++$+++ If I may be so bold...
L242787 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ How about in the forum.  Right in front of the Senate.
L242768 +++$+++ u1161 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ LUCILLA +++$+++ Commodus is heaving out every thing that belonged to our father.  Except that he can't heave out his ghost.
L242767 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ It's disgusting!  Animals!  I had to come here under armed guard.  Slaves -- get this junk out of my sight.
L242766 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ I want every single thing that belonged to my father out of this house!  If it's worth something then sell it!
L242765 +++$+++ u1161 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ LUCILLA +++$+++ Those are priceless sculptures.
L242734 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ Let some time pass... then ask, quietly, without anyone knowing it comes from me.
L242733 +++$+++ u1161 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ LUCILLA +++$+++ No one in Rome has ever heard of him.  Do you want to remind those few in the Senate who have?  The whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with.  Forget about him.
L242730 +++$+++ u1161 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ LUCILLA +++$+++ I'm sure, I don't know.
L242729 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ Did Narcissus die today?  Wasn't this his day to die?
L242728 +++$+++ u1161 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ LUCILLA +++$+++ If you get me pregnant with a boy he'll be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne.
L242727 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ I should at least have you, don't you think?
L242725 +++$+++ u1161 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ LUCILLA +++$+++ Maybe you should get married.  Pick one of your cousins, it would demonstrate a profound stability.
L242724 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ They hate me, they really hate me don't they?
L242699 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ Why?  Then they'll notice when I'm gone.  Well.  I'm making a public appearance aren't I?
L242698 +++$+++ u1161 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ LUCILLA +++$+++ Don't you think you should at least wave?
L242491 +++$+++ u1161 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ LUCILLA +++$+++ And Caesar!  Let's not forget to serve Caesar!
L242490 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ Quite so.  Narcissus and his courageous men; may they live long to serve Rome...
L242468 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ Oh, stay...  Don't you want to join the chorus of praises for Narcissus' glory?  Just remember, he is a married man.
L242467 +++$+++ u1161 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ LUCILLA +++$+++ I was suddenly thinking about going to bed.
L242466 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ More wine, sister?  Surely you can drink more than that.
L242412 +++$+++ u1161 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ LUCILLA +++$+++ I'm tired of being stuck in that wagon.
L242411 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ Will you please get back in your wagon?  And stay there?
L242410 +++$+++ u1161 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ LUCILLA +++$+++ That's what you told me two days ago!
L242409 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ We're nearly there, Lucilla.
L242408 +++$+++ u1161 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ LUCILLA +++$+++ Where are we now, Commodus?  Can you see the camp?  My Gods!  The air is turning into ice!
L243023 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ If you set me free I will find my way back to the army, march on Rome and depose you.  Then, the army and I will restore the Republic so that animals like you will never control human destinies again.
L243022 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ Endorse me in public.  Do that and I'll make you rich and set you free. I'll return your estates.  I know you would give anything to be outside again.  Endorse me and you will be free.  Think of it.  What would you do with your freedom?
L242641 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ On what charge?
L242640 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ The army is a problem.  They love you.  You have led them from victory to victory in the name of Rome and they love you.  And after all, you're just a hothead acting from a misguided sense of loyalty -- who could fault you for that?  Thus have I reached a compromise with the Senate over your fate: instead of executing you, I'm sending you to Rome where you will be tried...
L242639 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ And my army would have thrown your body into the Danube.
L242638 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate.  I could have executed you.
L242637 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Where is my family?
L242623 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Apparently my opinion wasn't needed.
L242622 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ They won't break this one.
L242621 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Forgive me, Caesar, but do two Senator represent the mood of the whole Senate or the will of the Roman people?  Besides, every truce we make with the Germans they break!
L242618 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ We have to stop the Germans now!
L242617 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ I'm ordering a general stand-down in preparation for withdrawal back across the Danube.
L242546 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ That this illness has clouded his mind.
L242545 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Caesar?
L242544 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ Being as close, I'm certain you've noticed what we all have noticed.
L242543 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ You flatter me, Caesar.
L242542 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ You and my father have become very close.  Perhaps one day I may say the same for us.
L242514 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ Do we really need to repair this fort?  It seems like an expensive undertaking.  I propose we burn it to the ground.  That way if the Germans cross the Danube here there will be nothing to help them build an offensive position.
L242513 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ But they're not destroyed, not yet.
L242508 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ The dangerous man, Caesar, is the man who doesn't care.
L242507 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ I would say there's nothing more dangerous than a man who knows what 'right' is.
L242500 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ Oh, but with the army behind you, you could become extremely political.  Not a Republican by any chance?
L242499 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ I back Rome against all her enemies -- if that answer disappoints you, I'm not a politician...
L242488 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ Or perhaps into a new one.  But here's to your God and the courage of our legions...
L242487 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Gladly Caesar.
L242486 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ Then you'd be out of a job.
L242471 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Perhaps, Master Galen, you may say.
L242470 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ That's difficult to say, general.
L242469 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Do you expect Marcus to be well enough by morning for an audience?
L242443 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ Of course, but not now.  However, if he continues to be unwell, you may report to me.
L242442 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Respectfully Caesar, Quintus and I must report.
L242441 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ Welcome back from your great triumph Narcissus Meridas.  My father sends his heart felt praise.  Sadly, Marcus is in dark humors -- nothing to worry about, but he needs rest. Likely just the weather.
L242825 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ I wouldn't know who to bet on.
L242824 +++$+++ u1157 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ FALCO +++$+++ Caesar, let me sponsor your first wager in the arena.
L242784 +++$+++ u1157 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ FALCO +++$+++ Make a gift to the people.  It's your money anyway so it's only fair.
L242783 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ Take grain away from the army?
L242782 +++$+++ u1157 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ FALCO +++$+++ Sacks of grain, even bread.  I own the grain licenses for the military, I can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube.
L242781 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ Give away food?
L242780 +++$+++ u1157 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ FALCO +++$+++ We can crush Gaius another way. What if you do throw something to the people they really want?  Make them a gift of food.
L242779 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ So am I.
L242778 +++$+++ u1157 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ FALCO +++$+++ I'm serious.
L242777 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
L242776 +++$+++ u1157 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ FALCO +++$+++ Yes.  You know, that's not a bad idea.
L242775 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ Throw it down into the streets! Down into the Forum.  If it's my father they want then give him to them!
L242753 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ At the opening of the month of Janus, I will ask this noble body to confirm my emperorship...
L242752 +++$+++ u1157 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ FALCO +++$+++ And like children everywhere they scream "freedom" the most when they desire it least.  I beg you, please continue, Caesar.
L242707 +++$+++ u1157 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ FALCO +++$+++ Until your confirmation date.
L242706 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ Gods of hell!  This must cost a fortune!  How many days is this going to go on?
L242703 +++$+++ u1157 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ FALCO +++$+++ At least stay for the running of the animals.  You are paying for it you know...
L242702 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ Ignore that?!  The sooner we leave this disgusting place the better.
L242701 +++$+++ u1157 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ FALCO +++$+++ Caesar, ignore them.
L242656 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ How can they?  Who else is there?  I have no heir...
L242655 +++$+++ u1157 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ FALCO +++$+++ The Senate is out to sink you.  I swear it, Caesar, your generosity is being repaid with public attacks on your honor.  Your enemies want you weak enough so by the first of Janus when you must be confirmed the Senate will be able to deny you.
L242643 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ Quintus will tell the army that you are being called to Rome to celebrate your victory.  They will hear that you are living in luxury. He will let them feel you have betrayed them for the good life. And soon the army won't even remember your name.
L242642 +++$+++ u1157 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ FALCO +++$+++ Insubordination.  To the Emperor... and the Senate.
L243079 +++$+++ u1165 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ QUINTUS +++$+++ You don't want to kill him.  If anything happens to him now you will be blamed... and he knows it. Besides, that gladiator school is a fortress.  It would take the army to break in there.  What you want is to... offer him the wooden sword. If he takes it, he's no longer the champion of the people, is he?  He's gone.  And you are a hero for awarding it.
L243078 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ Underdog!  How can he be an underdog -- he wins all the time!  I'm the emperor why can't I kill him?  He could be poisoned, or somehow killed to look like an accident.
L243077 +++$+++ u1165 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ QUINTUS +++$+++ It's because he comes off as the underdog.
L243073 +++$+++ u1165 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ QUINTUS +++$+++ Narcissus will never support you, Caesar, he has too much of a philosophical temperament.
L243072 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ This is the only place in Rome where I thought -- I believed -- I was wholly in power.
L242620 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ I met with Falco, and the Senators have agreed to call for a truce with the Germans.
L242619 +++$+++ u1165 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ QUINTUS +++$+++ We must obey our emperor and the Senate.
L242611 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ He left us at dawn.
L242610 +++$+++ u1165 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ QUINTUS +++$+++ Marcus Aurelius has died.
L242445 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ I'm certain father will be in better humors by then.  Now, honor us with your presence at dinner.  I'll join you as soon as I see my father's physician.
L242444 +++$+++ u1165 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ QUINTUS +++$+++ Gladly, Caesar.  And, if you'd like we can take you for a tour of the front at first light.
L242999 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ We need more statues -- perhaps I should open medical clinics.  For the poor.  Citizens only, though...
L242998 +++$+++ u1168 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ TRIBUUS +++$+++ Yes, Caesar.
L242997 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ Tribuus!  Go left here, I want to see my new statue at Via Claudia.
L242846 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ Jerses -- tomorrow...
L242845 +++$+++ u1168 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ TRIBUUS +++$+++ Yes, Caesar?
L242828 +++$+++ u1168 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ TRIBUUS +++$+++ Caesar, I did my best.  The Colosseum isn't under my control...
L242827 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ Why isn't he dead?  Damn you, you promised me he would be dead!
L242732 +++$+++ u1168 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ TRIBUUS +++$+++ He must have been.  He was on the list of prisoners to be executed.
L242731 +++$+++ u1155 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COMMODUS +++$+++ Tribuus, what happened in the arena? Was Narcissus killed?
L242415 +++$+++ u1168 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ TRIBUUS +++$+++ Where is the emperor and the army, soldier?

L243032 +++$+++ u1164 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ PROXIMO +++$+++ Cos, what in hades is the emperor up to?  And don't tell me you don't know!
L242953 +++$+++ u1164 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ PROXIMO +++$+++ Commodus... he's a gladiator... is he mad?
L242952 +++$+++ u1156 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COS +++$+++ "Caesar Commodus discovering his lineage converges with the Demigod, Hercules, has determined to display his magnificence before his beloved citizens."  The Emperor's going to fight in the arena.  I'm supposed to write this for tomorrow's edition.
L242742 +++$+++ u1156 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COS +++$+++ I'm mentioning you in tomorrow's athlete's section, legate.  So, I'd love to know your birth sign; it effects how people bet.  And perhaps you could tell me a bit about... well, who are you?
L242741 +++$+++ u1164 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ PROXIMO +++$+++ This is Cos, this precocious young man.  A scribe for the Daily Action.  I've invited him to write a small piece about you...

L242943 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Proximo, we need to talk about my one third... I imagine the betting booths will be doing good business. And, what was the name of that olive oil company?
L242942 +++$+++ u1156 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ COS +++$+++ That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl!  Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus?
L242941 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates.  He was born on August thirty-first, you know.
