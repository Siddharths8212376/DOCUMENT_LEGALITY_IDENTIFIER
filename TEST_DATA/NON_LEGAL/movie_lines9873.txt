L249797 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Then why don't we just get it out of the way.
L249796 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ No...I was hoping to get a kiss.
L249795 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Oh, you will?
L249794 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I was kinda' hopin' to get a "good night laid" but...I'll take a kiss.
L249793 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Yes you were.
L249792 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ No I wasn't...
L249791 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Yes you have. You were thinking you were gonna get a good night kiss.
L249790 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ No I haven't...
L249789 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ You know what I mean. I know you've at least thought about it.
L249788 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I really don't 'date' that much.
L249787 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Well, there's this part of the movie that's about how there's always this tension on a first date where both people are thinking about what's going to happen with the whole 'good night kiss' thing.
L249786 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ No.
L249785 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Have you ever seen Annie Hall?
L249777 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Okay...
L249776 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Now, I'm gonna make all these caramels disappear.
L249775 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Sure.
L249774 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ In that case, fine.  Want to see my magic trick?
L249773 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Well, I'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go.
L249772 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ So you just want to use me and go?
L249771 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate.
L249770 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Is Harvard gettin' all that money?
L249769 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ I was happy to pay. I inherited the money.
L249768 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I bet your parents were happy to pay.
L249767 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ I don't know, it was just kind of the boring suburban thing. Private school, Harvard, and now Med. School.  I actually figured out that at the end of it, my brain will be worth a quarter of a million dollars. I shouldn't have told you that...
L249661 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You aren't, by any chance, Pre-law? Are you?
L249660 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Sounds good, where are you now?
L249659 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Yeah, I figured maybe sometime this week we could go to a cafe and have some caramels.
L249658 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd call.
L249657 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Okay, you got me. It's the ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser who got drunk and wouldn't leave you alone all night.
L249656 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ I'm sorry, I don't recall meeting anyone who fits that description.
L249655 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
L249654 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Yeah?
L249622 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ The caramel thing is my pick-up line.
L249621 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ See, it's my life story. Five more minutes and I would have got to hear your best pick-up line.
L249620 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I was trying to be smooth.  But at twelve-fifteen I was gonna come over there and talk to you.
L249619 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ What?
L249618 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Five minutes.
L249617 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Okay, sounds good.
L249616 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ When you think about it, it's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee.
L249615 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ What?
L249614 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Great, or maybe we could go somewhere and just eat a bunch of caramels.
L249613 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Here's my number.
L249612 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I didn't mean you. Listen, maybe...
L249611 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Well, look, I have to go. Gotta' get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education.
L249610 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I kind of got that impression.
L249609 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Skylar. And by the way. That guy over there is a real dick and I just wanted you to know he didn't come with us.
L249608 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I'm Will.
L249607 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ I've been sitting over there for forty- five minutes waiting for you to come talk to me. But I'm just tired now and I have to go home and I wasn't going to keep sitting there waiting for you.
L249606 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ What?
L249605 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ You suck.
L254758 +++$+++ u5622 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ AGENT +++$+++ Joe!
L254757 +++$+++ u5634 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Twicet now I've fell for that line. Maybe he needs a thousan' men. So he get's five thousan' there, an' he'll pay fifteen cents a hour. An' you guys'll have to take it 'cause you'll be hungry.  'F he wants to hire men, let him write it out an' say what he's gonna pay. Ast to see his license. He ain't allowed by law to contrack men without a license.
L254756 +++$+++ u5622 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ AGENT +++$+++ Listen, Smart Guy. I'll run my business my own way. I got work. If you wanta take it, okay. If not, just sit here, that's all.

L254754 +++$+++ u5622 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ AGENT +++$+++ You trying to tell me how to run my own business?
L254753 +++$+++ u5634 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ All right, mister. I'll go. You just show your license to contrack, an' then you make out a order--where an' when an' how much you gonna pay--an' you sign it an' we'll go.
L254748 +++$+++ u5622 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ AGENT +++$+++ Well, I'm contracting the land.

L254781 +++$+++ u5628 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CASY +++$+++ Sure. Why not?
L254780 +++$+++ u5623 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ AL +++$+++ Okay. I think you're a darn fool, though.

With a woman it's all one flow, like a stream, little eddies, little waterfalls, but the river it goes right on. Woman looks at it like that.
L255232 +++$+++ u5623 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ AL +++$+++ Watch me pass that Chevvy.
L255231 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ No. Ain't ever gonna be scared no more.  I was, though. For a while I thought we was beat--*good* an' beat. Looked like we didn't have nothin' in the worl' but enemies--wasn't *no*body frien'ly anymore. It made me feel bad an' scared too--like we was lost... an' nobody cared.
L255230 +++$+++ u5623 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ AL +++$+++ Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?
L255229 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Maybe. Maybe twenny days work, maybe *no* days work. We ain't got it till we get it.

L255217 +++$+++ u5623 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ AL +++$+++ Ready, Ma?
L254809 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Well, you ain't a-goin'! Ain't *nobody* else a-goin'! We *got* here an' we gonna *stay* here, together! As long as we got the fambly unbroke I ain't scared, but it's a long bitter road we got ahead of us--  --an' I'm here to tell ya ef anybody else tries to bust us up anymore I'm a-goin' cat wild with this here piece a bar-arn!
L254808 +++$+++ u5623 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ AL +++$+++ But it ain't runnin' away, Ma. All I wanta do is go away with another fella an' look aroun' for work by ourself--
L254805 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ But ef you *do* whup me, I swear you better not ever go to sleep again, because the minute you go to sleep, or you're settin' down, or your back's turned, I'm gonna knock you belly-up with a bucket.

L254479 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ I never had my house pushed over before. I never had my fambly stuck out on the road. I never had to lose... ever'thing I had in life.
L254478 +++$+++ u5623 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ AL +++$+++ That don't sound like you, Ma. You never was like that before.
L254477 +++$+++ u5640 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ We're goin' to California, ain't we? Awright then, let's *go* to California.
L254476 +++$+++ u5623 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ AL +++$+++ Ain't you gonna look back, Ma?--give the ol' place a last look?
L255177 +++$+++ u5625 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ BLONDE GIRL +++$+++ Now I can't breathe.
L255176 +++$+++ u5623 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ AL +++$+++ That comes from not holdin' you tight *enough.*

L255027 +++$+++ u5623 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ AL +++$+++ Fan-belt's shot.
L255026 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ She's hotter'n a heifer.
L254907 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Thing's been workin' on me, what they was yellin' about. Got me all curious.
L254906 +++$+++ u5623 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ AL +++$+++ Think I'll look aroun' an' see if I can't meet me a girl.
L254868 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I don't know what these cops got to do with it but I don't like it.  An' these here are our own people, all of 'em. I don't like this.
L254867 +++$+++ u5623 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ AL +++$+++ Maybe the road's out.
L254812 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ We got to get outa here right away. Ever'body here? Where's Uncle John?

L255066 +++$+++ u5627 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CARETAKER +++$+++ They don't get in here. Sometimes the boys patrol the fences, especially dance nights.
L255065 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I can't hardly believe it. Camp I was in once, they burned it out--the deputies an' some of them poolroom fellas.
L255064 +++$+++ u5627 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CARETAKER +++$+++ No cop can come in here without a warrant.
L255063 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ An' you say no cops?
L255062 +++$+++ u5627 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CARETAKER +++$+++ That's the way it is.
L255061 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Are you aimin' to tell me that the fellas that run this camp is jus' fellas--campin' here?
L255060 +++$+++ u5627 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CARETAKER +++$+++ We got five sanitary units. Each one elects a central committee man. They make the laws, an' what they say goes.
L255059 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ We'll work it out. What's this committee you talkin' about?
L255058 +++$+++ u5627 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CARETAKER +++$+++ Camp site costs a dollar a week, but you can work it out, carrying garbage, keeping the camp clean--stuff like that.
L255053 +++$+++ u5627 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CARETAKER +++$+++ How many of you?
L255052 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Joad. Tom Joad.
L255051 +++$+++ u5627 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CARETAKER +++$+++ I don't mean to be nosy, y'understand. I just got to have certain information. What's your name?
L254959 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I hear it. I think they's some guys comin' this way, lots of 'em. We better get outa here.
L254958 +++$+++ u5628 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CASY +++$+++ Can't tell if you hear it or not. You hear it, Tom?
L254949 +++$+++ u5628 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CASY +++$+++ Got to learn, like I'm a-learnin'. Don't know it right yet myself, but I'm tryin' to fin' out. That's why I can't ever be a preacher again. Preacher got to *know*.  I don't. I got to *ask*.
L254948 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ We was outa food. Tonight we had meat. Not much, but we had it. Think Pa's gonna give up his meat on account a other fellas? An' Rosasharn needs milk. Think Ma's gonna starve that baby jus' cause a bunch a fellas is yellin' outside a gate?
L254947 +++$+++ u5628 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CASY +++$+++ I guess that's right. Have to take a beatin' before he'll know.
L254944 +++$+++ u5628 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CASY +++$+++ But jus' the minute they ain't strike- breakin' they won't get no five!
L254943 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ They won't. They're a-gettin' five an' they don't care about nothin' else.
L254942 +++$+++ u5628 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CASY +++$+++ Try an' tell 'em, Tom. They'll get two an' a half, jus' the minute we're gone. An' you know what that is? That's one ton a peaches picked an' carried for a dollar. That way you can't even buy food enough to keep you alive! Tell 'em to come out with us, Tom! Them peaches is *ripe*. Two days out an' they'll pay *all* of us five!
L254941 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I'll tell 'em. But I don't know how. Never seen so many guys with guns. Wouldn't even let us talk today.
L254939 +++$+++ u5628 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CASY +++$+++ Well--tell the folks inside how it is, Tom. Tell 'em they're starvin' us and stabbin' theirself in the back. An' as sure as God made little apples it's goin' back to two an' a half jus' as soon as they clear us out.
L254938 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I aim to.
L254937 +++$+++ u5628 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CASY +++$+++ I don't expeck we can las' much longer-- some a the folks ain't et for two days. You goin' back tonight?
L254936 +++$+++ u5652 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I dunno. Payin' five now.
L254935 +++$+++ u5628 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CASY +++$+++ Lookie, Tom. We come to work here. They tell us it's gonna be fi' cents. But they was a whole lot of us, so the man says two an' a half cents. Well, a fella can't even eat on that, an' if he got kids...  So we says we won't take it. So they druv us off. Now they're payin' you five--but when they bust this strike ya think they'll pay five?
L254927 +++$+++ u5628 +++$+++ m374 +++$+++ CASY +++$+++ No, I done my time an' got out. Come on in.
