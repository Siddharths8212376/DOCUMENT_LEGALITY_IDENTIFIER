L504142 +++$+++ u2739 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ PHYLLIS +++$+++ If I was, I would sing your praises up and down the street until they put me in the loony bin. Now Miles, why didn't you tell me you were coming and bringing this handsome man? Look how I'm dressed. I've got to run and put my face on.
L504141 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah, well, you should be my agent.
L504140 +++$+++ u2739 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ PHYLLIS +++$+++ Well, you were wonderful on that show. I never understood why they had to give you that brain tumor so soon. Why that didn't make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin. It's a sin.
L504139 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Jeez, Mrs. Raymond, that was eleven years ago.
L504136 +++$+++ u2739 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ PHYLLIS +++$+++ A famous actor bringing me flowers on my birthday. Don't I feel special?
L504135 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ They're from both of us.
L504920 +++$+++ u2741 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ You said you loved me! You fuck! I hope you die!
L504919 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I can explain.
L504557 +++$+++ u2741 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ Hi.  Maya's in the kitchen.
L504556 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Hi.
L504555 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Couple of wrong turns.  Thanks to Magellan, here.
L504554 +++$+++ u2741 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ What happened to you guys?
L504502 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Me too.
L504501 +++$+++ u2741 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ I'm thinking about the duck breast.
L504476 +++$+++ u2741 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ Not so bad yourself.
L504475 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Great. You look great.  You both do.
L504474 +++$+++ u2741 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ Good. How're you?
L504473 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ How you doin' tonight, beautiful?
L504441 +++$+++ u2741 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ I know. I might need to be spanked.
L504440 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You're a bad, bad girl, Stephanie.
L504437 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No shit. We just had a drink with her last night. Miles knows her.
L504436 +++$+++ u2741 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ Sure I know Maya. Real well.
L504435 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You know a gal named Maya? Works at the Hitching Post?
L504434 +++$+++ u2741 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ Oh yeah.
L504433 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Oh yeah? We're just over in Buellton. Windmill Inn.
L504432 +++$+++ u2741 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ In Santa Ynez.  And I agree with you about Cab Franc.
L504431 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Tastes good to me. You live around here, Stephanie?
L504425 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Nice.
L504424 +++$+++ u2741 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ Stephanie.
L504423 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Now there's a girl who knows how to pour. What's your name?
L504417 +++$+++ u2741 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ That's what people say.
L504416 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah.
L504415 +++$+++ u2741 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ Hey, guys. How's it going?
L504496 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Well, in that case...
L504495 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
L504494 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ No, we're paying for the wine.
L504493 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Whatever you girls want. It's on us tonight. Sky's the limit.
L504337 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ You are not.
L504336 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I am one of those guys.
L504335 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ That's hilarious. You sound just like one of those guys.
L504333 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Maybe. Recognize this?
L504332 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Anything I'd know?
L504331 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ A lot of TV. I was a regular on a couple of series. And lately I've been doing a lot of commercials. National mostly.
L504330 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
L504329 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No, I'm an actor.
L504328 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Are you a writer too?
L504319 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ That's on us.
L504318 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Highliner, please.
L504306 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Hi. Well, nice to see you guys here. Bye, Miles.
L504305 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Hiya.
L505058 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You were wearing your belt.
L505057 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yeah.  Hey, why wasn't I injured?
L505056 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Hey, don't pull away till they see the car.
L505055 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Back at you.
L505054 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Love you, man.
L505053 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yeah.
L505052 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
L505051 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Uh-uh. You're on your own.
L505050 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Why don't you come in?
L505049 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Well. That about does it.
L505045 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ No, not whatever. You fucking derelict.
L505044 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Whatever. Sorry.
L505043 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You broke some.
L505041 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You need a new car anyway.
L505040 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
L505039 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.
L505038 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Look at this!
L505037 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'll pay for it.
L505036 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What the fuck!
L505035 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You said it looked like a car accident.
L505034 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What the fuck!
L505033 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Nothing. Buckle up, okay?
L505032 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What's wrong?
L505031 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I feel like driving.
L505030 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I'm fine. You rest.
L505029 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Come on, let me drive.
L505028 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You're so negative.
L505027 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Somehow I don't think inviting Maya to your wedding is the right move. In fact, after your bullshit, it's going to be hard for me to even go to the Hitching Post again.
L505026 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?
L505025 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ No, I'm okay.
L505024 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Want me to drive?
L505023 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Quite a week.
L505022 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yep. Quite a day.
L505021 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ That was quite a day yesterday.
L505020 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Hrnrnrn?
L505019 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Hey, Jack. Jack.
L505005 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Hold on.
L505004 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Fuck you. I'll get it myself.
L505003 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like that.
L505002 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago, and he seems to have left his wallet behind, and we were wondering...
L505001 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ My ankle. Just go explain the situation.
L505000 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Me?
L504999 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ The plan is... you go.
L504998 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ So what's the plan?
L504996 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Horny as shit. Flopping around like a landed trout.
L504995 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Cutting it a little close, don't you think?  So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, say.
L504994 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Wasn't supposed to be back till six. Fucker rolls in at five.
L504993 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ So what the fuck were you thinking?
L504992 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah.
L504991 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ She tell you she was married?
L504988 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Forget it. Your wallet was stolen at a bar. Happens every day.
L504987 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Please, Miles, please.
L504986 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ No way. No way.
L504985 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No. She ordered them special. Took her forever to find them. They've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in Sanskrit. We've got to go back. Christine'll fucking crucify me.
L504984 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Okay, so they were in your wallet, and you left your wallet somewhere. Some bar. Christine'll understand.
L504983 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You don't understand. The wedding bands. The wedding bands are in my wallet.
L504982 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Big deal. We'll call right now and cancel your cards.
L504981 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I left my wallet. My credit cards, cash, fucking ID, everything. We gotta go back.
L504980 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What?
L504979 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ We gotta go back.
L504978 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Fucking-a it's five clicks! At one point I had to cut through an ostrich farm. Fuckers are mean.
L504977 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ That's five clicks, Jackson.
L504976 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Ran. Twisted my ankle too.
L504975 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
L504974 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.
L504973 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What?
L504972 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Fucking chick's married.
L504968 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You're joking, right?  What are you doing? Un-fucking- believeable. Can we just go back to the hotel and hang out and get up early and play nine holes before we head home?
L504967 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ She gets off in an hour, so I think I'm just going to have a drink and then... make sure she gets home safe.
L504955 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I don't know. I wouldn't know.
L504954 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I bet you that chick is two tons of fun. You know, the grateful type.
L504949 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L504948 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'm thinking it's time to settle down. One woman. One house. You know. It's time.
L504947 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What's that?
L504946 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You know what I'm thinking?
L504944 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Looks like you were in a bad car accident.
L504943 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What's it look like to you?
L504941 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Sure I'm sure. And just what are you implying? I'm really pissed off at you about all this, if you want to know the truth. What's Maya going to think of me now just for associating with you? You're the one who's sabotaging me, not the other way around, pal. Not by a longshot.
L504940 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
L504939 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Huh. Let me think.
L504938 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ So how did Stephanie know it was Saturday? We didn't get into that with Gary.
L504934 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah.
L504933 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ That's thoughtful.
L504932 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Gonna fuck that up too. I should sue her ass. Only reason I won't is to protect Christine.
L504931 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Good thing you have a voice-over career.
L504930 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'm going to need an operation. Maybe a couple of them. They have to wait for it it to heal first. Then they break it again.
L504929 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Well?
L504926 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Keep it elevated.
L504925 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.
L504924 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night.
L504923 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
L504922 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Aren't you glad you didn't move up here and marry her?
L504912 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Neither could I. I think it's Bukowski.
L504911 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ See? Right there. Just what you just said. That's beautiful. A thumbprint on a skyscraper. I couldn't write that.
L504910 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Half my life is over, and I have nothing to show for it. I'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage.
L504909 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Don't give up. You're going to make it.
L504908 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Thanks.
L504907 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces? He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is.
L504906 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.
L504905 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What's that supposed to mean?
L504904 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer. I'm a middle-school English teacher. I'm going to spend the rest of my life grading essays and reading the works of others. It's okay. I like books. The world doesn't give a shit what I have to say. I'm unnecessary.  I'm so insignificant, I can't even kill myself.
L504903 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Just write another one. You have lots of ideas, right?
L504874 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I can't take it anymore. I've got to call Evelyn.
L504873 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What's up?
L504872 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Let me use your phone.
L504871 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I don't know. Tastes okay to me.  Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
L504870 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Tastes like the back of a fucking LA schoolbus. Probably didn't de-stem, hoping for some semblance of concentration, crushed it up with leaves and mice, wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit. Fucking Raid.
L504869 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I say we check it out. You never know.
L504868 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I don't have to.
L504867 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You ever actually been in there, Miles?
L504866 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
L504865 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ How about this one? We didn't hit this one.
L504861 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Are they too sporty?
L504860 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
L504859 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Do you like them?
L504857 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I know what you need.
L504856 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ We gotta slow down.  I'm so tired. Let's just get out of here.
L504855 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Who's being selfish now? I'm the one getting married. I thought this week was supposed to be about me.
L504854 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ This whole week has gone sour. It isn't turning out like it was supposed to.  I want to go home.
L504849 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Shut up! Shut up, Jack!
L504848 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Did you have trouble performing? Yeah, that's...
L504847 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Wow. Okay. Calm down. Sorry.
L504846 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Just stop, okay? Make something up, and that's what happened. Whatever you want. Write my confession, and I'll sign it. Just stop pushing me all the time! I can't take it! You're an infant! This is all a big party for you, but not for me! This is serious. And you -- Just... leave me alone, okay? You're fucking me up.
L504845 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You didn't get any, did you?  You're a homo.
L504844 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Let's leave it alone.
L504843 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You're kidding, right? Tell me what happened, you fucker, or I'll tie your dick in a knot.
L504842 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ It's private.
L504841 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What?
L504840 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ No.
L504839 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ So tell me everything. Details. I like details.

L504809 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ He wrote a great one on Burgundy, and I used to get his newsletter, but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting. Plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century, and they turned out to be turkeys. Fucker never retracted.
