L393444 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Yes. House. More amendments--more changes--and the Bill goes back to the Senate--and *waits its turn on the calendar again*. The Senate doesn't like what the house did to the Bill. They make more changes. The House doesn't like *those* changes. Stymie. So they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out. Besides that, all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and against--government departments get in their two cents' worth--cabinet members--budget bureaus--embassies. Finally, if the Bill is alive after all this vivisection, it comes to a vote. Yes, sir--the big day finally arrives. And--nine times out of ten, they vote it down.  Are you catching on, Senator?
L393443 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ We're over in the House.
L393442 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Pardon me--*this* is. Where are we now?
L393441 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ *This* is.
L393440 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ A committee of the majority party leaders. They decide when a Bill is important enough to be moved up toward the head of the list--
L393439 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Yes. Sure. What's a Steering Committee?
L393438 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Do you really think we're getting anywhere.
L393437 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ The Steering Committee.
L393436 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ What?
L393435 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ What's that?
L393434 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ That's the order of business. Your Bill has to stand *way* back there in line unless the Steering Committee decides it is important enough to be--
L393433 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Calendar?
L393432 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Yes. They give it to a *sub*- committee, where they really give it a going over--hold hearings--call in people and ask questions--then report back to the bigger committee--where it's considered some more, changed, amended, or whatever. Days are going by, Senator. Days--weeks. Finally, they think it's quite a Bill. It goes over to the House of Representatives for debate and a vote. *But* it's got to wait its turn on the calendar--
L393431 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Some committee's got it.
L393430 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Good. Where are we?
L393429 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Yes, I see that.
L393428 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Look--committees--small groups of Senators--have to sift a Bill down-- look into it--study it--and report to the whole Senate. You can't take a Bill no one knows anything about and discuss it among ninety-six men. Where would you get?
L393427 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Why?
L393426 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ That's how Congress--or any large body--is run. All work has to be done by committee.
L393425 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Why?
L393424 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Committee.
L393423 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Committee, huh?
L393422 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ You get to your feet in the Senate and present it. Then you take the Bill and put it in a little box-- like a letter box--on the side of the rostrum. Just hold it between thumb and forefinger and drop it in. Clerks read it and refer it to the right committee--
L393421 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ How?
L393420 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Uh-huh. Well, dinner comes in on trays. We're executives. And we light into this. It is dawn. Your Bill is ready. You go over there and introduce it--
L393419 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Oh--dinner. Yes. Well, I'm hungry, too. I thought--maybe--we could have something brought in--you know, like big executives who eat off trays. You see, we've got to light into this and get it going--
L393418 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Tonight.  Look--uh--I don't want to seem to be complaining, Senator--but in all civilized countries, there's an institution called *dinner*--!
L393417 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Tonight.
L393416 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ A *day*!
L393415 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Oh, just a day--
L393414 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Oh, yes. And *I'm* helping. Simple-- and I'm helping. So we knock this off in record-breaking time of--let's say three or four days--
L393413 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ And with your help--
L393412 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ I see. *This* one is so simple--
L393411 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Oh, but this one is so simple.
L393410 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time--
L393409 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Right.
L393408 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right?
L393407 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ I know--but you--you're going to help.
L393406 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?
L393405 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Yes. Sure. It was his idea. *I* should have been the one to think of it--
L393404 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Pardon me. Senator Paine decided this *with* you?
L393403 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Sure! A Bill. Senator Paine and I decided it was the one way in the world I could make myself--
L393402 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ One moment, Senator. Do I understand you're going to present a *Bill*?
L393401 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp...
L393400 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ We're going right ahead with--*what*?
L393399 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Well, then, I--I *thank* you, Miss Saunders! Nothing better could have happened--. Yes *sir*, Miss Saunders, we're going right ahead with it!
L393398 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ I had a lot to do with that little press conference last night--
L393397 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Punch?
L393396 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Go ahead--punch.
L393153 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ I mean--gosh--I wouldn't be comfortable in a--I--I haven't got clothes and things like that--and--I couldn't keep pigeons *there*--No--I-- I just--just wouldn't be--
L393152 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ You *couldn't*?
L393151 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ No, gee--I couldn't stay here--
L393147 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Oh--a wonderful thing--yes. Get you right in the mood--yes--yes.
L393146 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Go out to Mount Vernon. It'd be a sort of fine thing to do--see Washington's home just before walking into the Senate for the first time-- don't you think?
L393145 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ No. What had you better--?
L393144 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Gosh--that'll be something! You know what I better do in the morning?
L393143 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ With or without 'em.  Twelve--noon. The Senate convenes at twelve o'clock.
L393142 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Convene--that's it--yes. I got to pick up some of those parliamentary words. I imagine a fellow can get pretty lost in the Senate without 'em--
L393141 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Convene?
L393140 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Tell me, Miss Saunders--what time does the Senate--uh--what do they call it?
L393139 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ You--uh--you better relax, Senator. You'll be plumb wore out.
L393138 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ The Capitol Dome! Lighted up!
L393137 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ I wouldn't know in the *day time*.
L393136 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Whose statue is that?
L393135 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Yes--I think maybe you'd better.
L393134 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Now, if you're ready, Senator, we can start for the hotel. I'll *see* that you get there.
L393133 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Well--he's got nothing on me.
L393132 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ I don't believe I've been so thrilled in my--oh, and that Lincoln Memorial! Gee! There he is--Mr. Lincoln--looking right at you as you come up the steps-- sitting there like he was waiting for someone to come along--
L393131 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Most natural thing in the world!
L393130 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ --big as life--sparkling away there under the sun. I--I started walking toward it--and there was a bus outside-- and--well--I--I just naturally got aboard--
L393129 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ The Dome--the Capitol Dome--
L393128 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ There *what* was?
L393127 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ One of those sightseers--you know. You see, I--gosh, I've never been called absent-minded or... but there it was all of a sudden--looking right at me through one of the station doors--
L393126 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Did you say--bus?
L393125 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Gee, I'm sorry. You see, it wasn't until I was fairly well along in the bus that I realized--
L393121 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Pleased to meet you, sir.
L393120 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Yes, I'm Saunders--and this is Mr. Moore--a member of the press. Meet the *Senator*, Mr. Moore.
L393119 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Gee--I'm sorry about that, Miss--you *are* Miss Saunders, aren't you?
L393118 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Oh, no--no!  My dear *Senator*--it may be customary out on the prairie to take French leave of people and not be heard of again for five hours--
L393117 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Is--is something the matter?
L393113 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ J-Jefferson Smith.
L393112 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ What's your name?
L393110 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ No!
L393109 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ The man downstairs said number--
L393108 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ *No*!
L393107 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Office of--Senator Smith?
L393106 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ What is it?
L393332 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ If you thought as much of being honest-- as you do of being smart--!
L393331 +++$+++ u2152 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ VOICES +++$+++ Whoa! Hold it! Pipe down! Come on, now--that's enough of that.
L393321 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ That's what I said--the *truth*!
L393320 +++$+++ u2152 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ VOICES +++$+++ The truth! Well, the man wants the truth! "What *is* truth?" asked so-and-so, and turned away!
L393319 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ *Gentlemen*! Gentlemen are supposed to believe in something decent. Instead of twisting facts and making a joke of everything--why don't you tell the people the *truth* for a change?
L393214 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ You see--if we could take the poor kids off the streets--out of cities-- a few months in the summer--learn something about Nature and American ideals--
L393213 +++$+++ u2152 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ VOICES +++$+++ A camp! Well!
L393212 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Well--for a couple of years now--I-- I've thought it would be a wonderful thing to have a National Boys' Camp out in our State--
L393211 +++$+++ u2152 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ VOICES +++$+++ Ah! That's more like it! What?
L393200 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Hold on, fellows--I'm not used to more then one question at a time--
L393199 +++$+++ u2152 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ VOICES +++$+++ Tell us about yourself, Senator! Hear you got a Boy's Club back home! Any ideas? Going to make things hum in the Senate, huh?
L393643 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ No! No! Gosh. See, there you are! I'm not making sense!
L393642 +++$+++ u2150 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ You're not going to take your *suit* off!
L393641 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Funnier things have happened. Ma says when Pa was courting her, he acted strange for months. Didn't make sense--or anything. And one day, on a hunch, Ma said: "Clayton, so help me, you talk like a man whose collar is too tight to bear." "Not the collar, Mary," he said, "my shoes." "Well, for land's sake," Ma said, "Take the pesky things off!" Which Pa did, an' they were engaged within a week.
L393640 +++$+++ u2150 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Well--I--
L393639 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ It's just as well to tell you--because if we're going to get off on the right foot--I mean--in case I act sort of strange--it's the suit.
L393638 +++$+++ u2150 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Well! You don't say!
L393637 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Oh, the bill. Oh--splendid--I mean--  I--I just can't seem to talk in this suit.  I'll tell you a secret. It's brand new.
L393636 +++$+++ u2150 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ And how's your bill, Senator?
L393635 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ That's--that's splendid.
L393634 +++$+++ u2150 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I'm splendid, too.
L393633 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Uh--that's good. And--uh--you?
L393632 +++$+++ u2150 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Splendid.
L393631 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ I--I'm awfully glad to be--that is, it was nice of you to--  Uh--how's your father?
L393370 +++$+++ u2150 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Goodnight, Senator--
L393369 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Well, goodbye, sir--and thank you again.  Well--it--it was nice seeing you, Miss Paine--
L393368 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ No--I mean--yes--that is--
L393367 +++$+++ u2150 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Then you *did* say it.
L393366 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Oh--you are!
L393365 +++$+++ u2150 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Did you hear, Father? He didn't mean it when he said I was beautiful.
L393364 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Fine--they're fine.  Oh, Miss Paine, I--I want to apologize-- what the papers said I said about you--that wasn't true. I--I would never say a thing like that.
L393363 +++$+++ u2150 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ How are the pigeons?
L393362 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ How--how do you do, Miss Paine?  I--I apologize for looking like this-- I--I have to be going now--
L393019 +++$+++ u2150 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Well, we *must* see a lot of you, Senator. Come, Father.
L393018 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Sure.
L393004 +++$+++ u2150 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Wonderful!
L393003 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Just for the fun of it.--You see the one that makes it back home in the fastest time, I am going to enter in the nationals.
L394110 +++$+++ u2146 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ If the Senator permits this motion to recess he will not have the floor in the morning to babble or anything else, unless he is recognized first by the Chair.
L394109 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Well, now--I wouldn't know about that. Mr. President--what happens to me in the morning--I mean about my having this floor to go on babbling?
L394101 +++$+++ u2146 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ The Senator will please suspend until order is restored in the chamber.
L394100 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ "--We hold these truths to be self- evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights--"  Well--looks like the night shift's comin' on.
L394032 +++$+++ u2146 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Ring the call to quorum.
L394031 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Uh--Mr. President--you and I are about to be alone in here, sir. I'm not complaining for social reasons, but it'd be a pity if the gentlemen missed any of this.  Mr. President--I call the chair's attention to Rule Five of the Standing Rules of the Senate Section Three. "If it shall be found that a quorum is not present, a majority of the Senators present--," and that begins to look like me--"may direct the Sergeant-at-arms to request, and if necessary *compel* the attendance of the absent Senators."  Mr. President--*I so direct*.
L393992 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Mr. President--I stand guilty as *framed*! Because Section Forty is graft, and I was ready to say so. I was ready to tell you that one man in my state--Mister James Taylor-- was putting that dam through for his own profit!
L393991 +++$+++ u2146 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Order, gentlemen!
L393966 +++$+++ u2146 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ That is merely your *impression*, Senator. The Chair has yet to settle the question to its own satisfaction!
L393965 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ You were about to recognize me, sir--
L393964 +++$+++ u2146 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ However, Senator Smith is still a member of this Body and as such has equal claim on the attention of the Chair--
L393820 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Yes, sir--
L393819 +++$+++ u2146 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ The Senator understands he is limited to five minutes?
L393565 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ I--I'm sorry, sir. I--I have a bill--
L393564 +++$+++ u2146 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ The chair recognizes the rather strong- lunged junior Senator, Mr. Smith.
L393313 +++$+++ u2146 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Senator, you can talk all you want to, now.
L393312 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ "So help me God."
L393311 +++$+++ u2146 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ "I do solemnly swear--that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States--against all enemies, foreign and domestic--that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same--that I take this obligation freely--without and mental reservation and purpose of evasion-- and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God."
L393307 +++$+++ u2146 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ The Senator has no voice in this chamber until the oath of office has been administered!
L393306 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ I don't understand, sir! I don't know what the gentleman--
L393067 +++$+++ u2149 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SPIELER +++$+++ Yes, *sir*.  Let's *go* Henry.
L393066 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Yes. Washington laid the cornerstone though--wearing an apron for the ceremony that was embroidered by Madame Lafayette--
L393065 +++$+++ u2149 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SPIELER +++$+++ Oh--you're *sure* of that now?
L393064 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ I said--I mean--Washington didn't live to see it finished. Congress didn't move here from Philadelphia till eighteen hundred.
L393063 +++$+++ u2149 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SPIELER +++$+++ How's that, buddy?
L393062 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Since the time of Adams--not Washington.
L393223 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Well--I can *manage*--
L393222 +++$+++ u2142 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ NOSEY +++$+++ Yeah! How about it? You're a nature lover. Do you handle any of that sign language?
L393217 +++$+++ u2142 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ NOSEY +++$+++ Great!  The Government's putting dough in too many places *now*!
L393216 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Oh--nothing--nothing. My idea is-- for the Government to lend us the money--and the boys'll pay it back-- sending in a penny or a nickel--no more than a dime--no, gosh--the Government's got enough on its hands without--
L393215 +++$+++ u2142 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ NOSEY +++$+++ Marvelous! And what would this camp set the Government back?
L393210 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Well--I have got *one* idea--
L393209 +++$+++ u2142 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ NOSEY +++$+++ A pet idea--you know--pension bill-- save the buffalo--you've got *one* notion you think would be good for this country, haven't you?
L393208 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Ax?
L393203 +++$+++ u2142 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ NOSEY +++$+++ Swell!
L393202 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Well--I haven't needed much law so far--what I'd like to get first is a little common sense--
L393201 +++$+++ u2142 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ NOSEY +++$+++ One moment, friends, let's give the Senator a break.  Now, where'd you say you studied law?
L393457 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Why, he's a Senator, isn't he? I'm surprised at you, Mister McGann-- 
L393456 +++$+++ u2141 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MCGANN +++$+++ What does he want to--? What's *he* doing writing a Bill?
L393455 +++$+++ u2141 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MCGANN +++$+++ A Bill! Not *him*!
L393454 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ The Head Man's writing a Bill.
L393453 +++$+++ u2141 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MCGANN +++$+++ What do you mean? What's going on?
L393452 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ I wouldn't wait if I were you.
L393390 +++$+++ u2141 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MCGANN +++$+++ Yeah? Well, when I get my hands on a red-headed doll with a southern lingo, I'll--
L393389 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ My, my--you sho' are pahwerfully upset, Mister McGann--but you' awfully cute.
L393388 +++$+++ u2141 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MCGANN +++$+++ Whaddaya mean! What did *I* have to do with it? I don't blame the guy.  Wow! Twenty-four hours in this town and nothing but dog-fights! And things aren't bad enough--last night I have to get a run-around from some wise dame--
L393387 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ That's what he's been doing since last heard from.
L393386 +++$+++ u2141 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MCGANN +++$+++ What! Who?
L393385 +++$+++ u2147 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ How'd you like a punch in the nose?
L393384 +++$+++ u2141 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MCGANN +++$+++ Well! Hear anything? Any sign of him?
L393881 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Shut up! You've *got* the man pilloried! Do you have to dance around him like a cannibal--!
L393880 +++$+++ u2141 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MCGANN +++$+++ Your Ranger's on the garbage pile, Happy! He's done for!
L393760 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ --now he wants to talk to the Congressmen from the Willet Creek districts--he's run their names down--
L393759 +++$+++ u2141 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MCGANN +++$+++ Saunders! I'd like to tie her in a sack and drop her from the Brooklyn Bridge--
L393758 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ --I've used every argument in the world to try to turn him off. He just keeps coming back to the dam-- and what he knows--
L393592 +++$+++ u2141 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MCGANN +++$+++ Joe--listen--all Susan has to do is turn those big eyes on him--he'll fall all over himself--just keep him out of there *one afternoon*--while they read that bill--
L393591 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Jim's methods won't do in Washington.
L393590 +++$+++ u2141 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MCGANN +++$+++ Well, then--this is too much for *my* lame brain. I'm calling Jim Taylor.
L393589 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ My daughter isn't here to carry out assignments like that for *anybody*.
L393588 +++$+++ u2141 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MCGANN +++$+++ Susan!
L393587 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ That won't work, Chick. This boy's honest, not stupid.
L393586 +++$+++ u2141 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MCGANN +++$+++ Listen--tomorrow I take him to see monuments--if I have to hit him over the head with a couple!
L393585 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ I know that.
L393584 +++$+++ u2141 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MCGANN +++$+++ Tomorrow! Joe--he'll hear the section on Willet Dam. He can't be there!
L393583 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Be quiet, Chick--I'm trying to think--  This Deficiency Bill is going to be read in the Senate tomorrow.
L393582 +++$+++ u2141 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MCGANN +++$+++ Joe--I'm getting leery of this guy. We keep calling him dumb--and he keeps winding up in our hair! I'm telling you--when he finds out there's a dam going up where he wants his camp, he's gonna start asking questions six ways from Sunday--
L393581 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ --amazing coincidence! Of all places in the world--to choose Willet Creek for his boys' camp!
L393580 +++$+++ u2141 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MCGANN +++$+++ That's dynamite, Joe!
L393579 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Let's get away from here. 
L393578 +++$+++ u2141 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MCGANN +++$+++ Did I hear right? Did he say *Willet Creek*?
L393465 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Yes--a camp bill that will never get beyond a first reading. So calm down, Chick--and--goodnight.
L393464 +++$+++ u2141 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MCGANN +++$+++ Joe! You *told* him to!
L393460 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ What's the matter?
L393459 +++$+++ u2141 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MCGANN +++$+++ Joe--drop everything and come with me!
L393163 +++$+++ u2141 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MCGANN +++$+++ Listen, Joe--at least--after a day like this--I got one good bust coming before I start showing him monuments--
L393162 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Eleven B Street, Northeast. Take his bags and your own right over--and get yourself a room in the same place--
