L401032 +++$+++ u2204 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ DANIELS +++$+++ Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta pure gold!
L401031 +++$+++ u2206 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ HENDERSON +++$+++ I wouldn't trade ya for a brass spittoon!
L400975 +++$+++ u2206 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ HENDERSON +++$+++ For them to protect it like this, you just know there's got to be treasure down there.
L400974 +++$+++ u2204 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ DANIELS +++$+++ See! That proves it! Old Seti's fortune's gotta be under this sand!
L400900 +++$+++ u2210 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ WARDEN +++$+++ Who cares? I don't see no treasure.
L400899 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Do you realize, we are standing inside a room that no one has entered in over four thousand years.
L400798 +++$+++ u2210 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ WARDEN +++$+++ I have come to protect my investment, thank you very much.
L400797 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ What are you doing here?

L400764 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent.
L400763 +++$+++ u2210 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ WARDEN +++$+++ Are you saying this filthy godless son of a pig knows where to find The City Of The Dead? Truly?
L400762 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ I would never!
L400761 +++$+++ u2210 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ WARDEN +++$+++ You lie.
L400753 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Three hundred pounds!

L400750 +++$+++ u2210 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ WARDEN +++$+++ I would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang.
L400749 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ I will give you one hundred pounds to spare his life.
L400748 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ I am an English woman.
L400747 +++$+++ u2210 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ WARDEN +++$+++ No women allowed.
L400745 +++$+++ u2210 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ WARDEN +++$+++ To be hanged.
L400744 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Where are they taking him?
L400710 +++$+++ u2210 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ WARDEN +++$+++ He said... he was just looking for a good time.
L400709 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ And what did he say?
L400708 +++$+++ u2210 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ WARDEN +++$+++ I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.
L400707 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ And what is he in prison for?
L401255 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep them.
L401254 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ Got guts, lady.
L401249 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ I have no choice.
L401248 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ Don't do it, Evelyn.
L401229 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ Got what?
L401228 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Got it!
L401210 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ Jealous? You kiddin' me? Did you see that guy's face?
L401209 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ I think you were jealous
L401208 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ What?... Oh yeah, that was just um, you know, figure a speech.
L401207 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ You called me your girl?
L401143 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ The creature!? Are you sure!?
L401142 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ He's here! I saw him! That thing is here!
L401115 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ FINE.
L401114 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ I'm staying.
L401113 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot.
L401112 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ That's what I am to you? A contract?
L401111 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ Look lady, I appreciate you saving my life and all, but when I signed on, I agreed to take you out there and bring you back, and I did, now were even, end of job, end of story, contract terminated.
L401110 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ It's everybody's problem!
L401109 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ Yeah? So? Is that my problem?
L401108 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ According to that Book, once this creature has been reborn, his curse will spread, and as he grows in strength, so will his curse grow, infecting the people until the whole of the earth is destroyed.
L401107 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ There goes that belief again. Not me, I am outta here!
L401106 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Then we'll have to find some immortal ones.
L401104 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Alright then, Me, I,... I read the book, I woke him up and I intend to stop him.
L401103 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ We?! What we?! You didn't read that book. I told you not to play around with that thing.
L401102 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ No we are not. We woke him up, and we must try and stop him.
L401100 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ No, we are not.
L401099 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone.
L401098 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Having an encounter with a four thousand year old walking-talking corpse tends to convert one.
L401058 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ It's just a book, no harm ever came from a book.
L401057 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ You sure you outta be playin, around with that?
L401048 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ The ten plagues?... You mean all ten plagues.
L401047 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Yes, they never used it because they feared it so. It's written, that if a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt.
L401046 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ That bad huh?
L401045 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ According to my readings, our friend suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of all ancient Egyptian curses, one reserved for only the most evil blasphemers. In all of my research, I've never read of this curse actually having been performed.
L401042 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Very slowly.
L401041 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ Are you saying somebody threw these things in with our guy, and they slowly ate him alive?
L401020 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ No. I've never seen a mummy look like this. He's, he's still...
L401019 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ Is he supposed to look like that?
L401012 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ You dream about dead guys?
L401011 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Oh my god, I've dreamed about this ever since I was a little girl.
L400998 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had.
L400997 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ No... Why?... Should I?
L400992 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ Because that's my name.
L400991 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Why would I do that?
L400990 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ Not unless you call me Rick.
L400989 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ I'm not?
L400988 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ No you're not.
L400987 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ I'm going to kiss you, Mister O'Connell.
L400985 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ And what is that?
L400984 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ I may not be an explorer, or an adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell But I'm proud of what I am.
L400983 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ Okay, I get your father, I get your mother and I get your brother, but what are you doing here?
L400982 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Egypt is in my blood. My father was a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so much that he married an Egyptian. My mother! Who was quite an adventurer herself
L400981 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ Something like that.
L400980 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this?
L400979 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ Unlike your brother, Miss, you I don't get. You're a whole new brew.
L400957 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ No. I believe if I can see it and I can touch it, then it's real. That's what I believe.
L400956 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ You don't believe in curses, huh?
L400955 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ You two!
L400953 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ Salt acid. Pressurized salt acid. Some sort of ancient booby-trap.
L400952 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ How?
L400951 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ Seems the Americans had a little misadventure of their own today, three of their diggers were killed.
L400946 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ Who was talking about what?
L400945 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about.
L400942 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Quarried granite with a cobalt lining.
L400941 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ There's some sort of lock here. You say these thing's are made of granite with a steel interior?
L400938 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ They didn't, they buried him at the foot of Anubis. He was either someone of great importance. Or he did something very naughty.
L400937 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?
L400936 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus.
L400933 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ You two are worse than a couple of schoolboys.
L400932 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ Yeah, that'd bring you back to life.
L400908 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ For entering the afterlife.
L400907 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ Preparation for what?
L400906 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Oh my god, It's a preparation room.
L400898 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Ancient Egyptian trick. You'll see.
L400897 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ What are those mirrors for?
L400896 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ According to Bembridge Scholars, inside the statue of Anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing The Book Of The Living.
L400895 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ The things that get you excited.
L400894 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ That "thing" gets me excited.
L400880 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ We're about to be shown the way.
L400879 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ For what?
L400870 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Are you sure?
L400869 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ We're almost there.
L400849 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ Trust me.
L400848 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Well of course I can swim, if the occasion calls for it.
L400847 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ Can you swim?
L400843 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Oh that's comforting.
L400842 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ Relax! I'm the map!  It's all up here.
L400821 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ I know my treasure.
L400820 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ You know your history.
L400819 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ And the fact that they say it's made out of pure gold, makes no nevermind to you, right?
L400818 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ I don't believe in fairy tales and hokum, Mister O'Connell, but I do believe that one of the most famous books in history is buried out there, The Book Of The Living. It's what first interested me in Egypt as a child. It's why I came here, sort of a life's pursuit.
L400817 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway to the underworld", actually.
L400816 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, they call it, "the doorway to hell."
L400815 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain artifact, a book, actually, my brother thinks there's treasure. What do you think is out there?
L400814 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ There's something out there, you know, something under that sand.
L400813 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ The last time I was at that place everybody I was with died.
L400812 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Did I miss something? Are we going into battle?
L400811 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ If you call that a kiss.
L400810 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
L400809 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
L400808 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.
L400769 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Twenty-five percent, and not one single farthing more.
L400768 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ Give... give him... give him GLAAAA-- !
L400741 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ Really want to know?
L400740 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Yes.
L400739 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ Want to know?
L400738 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Could you tell me how to get there? The exact location?
L400737 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ I found sand. I saw death.
L400736 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ What did you find? What did you see?
L400735 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ -- I know what you mean. I was there, alright. Seti's place. The City Of The Dead.
L400734 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ No, I mean --
L400733 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ Every damn day.
L400732 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ You swear?
L400731 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ Yeah, I was there.
L400730 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Yes, well...  I know my brother.
L400729 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ I just decked your brother
L400728 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ You were actually at Hamunaptra?
L400724 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ Because that's where I found it. I was there.
L400723 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ How do you know the box pertains to Hamunaptra?
L400722 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.
L400721 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ No?
L400720 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ No.
L400719 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ We uh,... found... your puzzle box, and we've come to ask you about it.
L400714 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Broad?!
L400713 +++$+++ u2209 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ O'CONNELL +++$+++ So who's the broad?
L401353 +++$+++ u2208 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ JONATHAN +++$+++ Yes,... I see.
L401352 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Ah! Ah! Ahmenophus!
L401350 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ What's it look like!?
L401349 +++$+++ u2208 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ JONATHAN +++$+++ Ummm, Hootash im... Hootash im now what is this last symbol here?
L401348 +++$+++ u2208 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ JONATHAN +++$+++ Oh.
L401347 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Finish the inscription, idiot!
L401339 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Read the inscription on the cover!
L401338 +++$+++ u2208 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ JONATHAN +++$+++ What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?
L401334 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Shut-up and get me off of here!
L401333 +++$+++ u2208 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ JONATHAN +++$+++ I found it, Evy! I found it
L401022 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Yes. He's more than four thousand years old and still decomposing.
L401021 +++$+++ u2208 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ JONATHAN +++$+++ Juicy?
L400995 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Well neither do I, thank you.
L400994 +++$+++ u2208 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ JONATHAN +++$+++ Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there.
L400993 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ I can't believe I allowed the two of you to get me drunk.
L400950 +++$+++ u2208 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ JONATHAN +++$+++ Did you ever see him eat?
L400949 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ What do you suppose killed him?
L400931 +++$+++ u2208 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ JONATHAN +++$+++ Still...
L400930 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ It's called mummification. You're dead when they do this
L400919 +++$+++ u2208 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ JONATHAN +++$+++ And when those dirty Yanks go to sleep --  No offense.
L400918 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ According to my calculations, we should be right under the statue. We'll come up right between his legs.  Oh my.
L400884 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ After all, you rode us night and day to win that bet.
L400883 +++$+++ u2208 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ JONATHAN +++$+++ Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't we be going?
L400785 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Personally, I think he's filthy, rude and a complete scoundrel. I don't like him one bit.
L400784 +++$+++ u2208 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ JONATHAN +++$+++ Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word.
L400783 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Do you really think he'll show up?
L400712 +++$+++ u2208 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ JONATHAN +++$+++ Way to go, Evy.
L400711 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ But he's just a filthy criminal?
L400706 +++$+++ u2208 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ JONATHAN +++$+++ Picked his pocket, actually.
L400705 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?!
L400704 +++$+++ u2208 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ JONATHAN +++$+++ That just makes you more gullible.
L400703 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ I'm your sister.
L400702 +++$+++ u2208 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ JONATHAN +++$+++ I lie to everybody, what makes you so special?
L400701 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ You lied to me!
L400700 +++$+++ u2208 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ JONATHAN +++$+++ I was mistaken.
L400699 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ You told me you found it on a dig down in Thebes!
L400693 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ All we know is that the city mysteriously vanished around 2,134 B.C.
L400692 +++$+++ u2208 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ JONATHAN +++$+++ Right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. On Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.
L400691 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the early Pharaohs were said to have hidden the wealth of Egypt.
L400687 +++$+++ u2208 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ JONATHAN +++$+++ Alright, good, that's good. I like this fellow, like him very much.
L400686 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all.
L400685 +++$+++ u2208 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ JONATHAN +++$+++ Two questions. Who the hell is Seti the First? And was he rich?
L400682 +++$+++ u2205 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ I think you found something.
L400681 +++$+++ u2208 +++$+++ m142 +++$+++ JONATHAN +++$+++ Yes?
