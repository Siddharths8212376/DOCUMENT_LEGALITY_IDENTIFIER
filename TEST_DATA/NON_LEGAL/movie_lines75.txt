L86648 +++$+++ u509 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ GILL +++$+++ You been home yet?
L86647 +++$+++ u516 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
L86646 +++$+++ u509 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ GILL +++$+++ She's around. Always is.
L86645 +++$+++ u516 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ I can't get Rae on the phone. She's not at home... none of her friends seen her anywhere.
L86644 +++$+++ u509 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ GILL +++$+++ I guess it could be worse. You could be comin' back in a body bag.
L86643 +++$+++ u516 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ They been keepin' a folder on me cuz of my stomach. Like how it was just before we'd play ball back in school. Thought it was just some tic I got, or ulcers like my daddy had.  I can't... shoot. Target practice I'm a pro. I tag between the numbers each time but...  But when there's really loud noises around me... somethin' happens. I get shaky and... I lose my breath. They called it anxiety. Severe anxiety. It can be fixed and all... just not in time for....  It's a long process but... they sent me home.

L86289 +++$+++ u509 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ GILL +++$+++ I bet you did. Just had to get that black cock up in you. I swear to God. What Ronnie sees... you disgust me.
L86288 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ I begged him. Don't see why he had to go...
L86287 +++$+++ u509 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ GILL +++$+++ This thing you got... I've heard people say, you'd fuck a tree if it was handy. I can see that.  But that nigger Tehronne. Thinks he's some player cuz he hustles dope and stolen hubcaps. I mean, I can see a tree. But that piece of shit?
L86286 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ I got others.
L86285 +++$+++ u509 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ GILL +++$+++ Thought you had a skirt earlier.

L86260 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ You go to hell.
L86259 +++$+++ u509 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ GILL +++$+++ You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you?
L86258 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ It's not like I can't go out and have fun with my friends.
L86250 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Yeah.

L86245 +++$+++ u510 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ You wanna go home?
L86238 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ I begged him not to go. And he did.
L86237 +++$+++ u510 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'. Not like you're married.
L86236 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Can't be thinkin' bout him every second of my day. I'll go outta my gourd.
L86235 +++$+++ u510 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Nothing's gonna happen. Not like everybody over there is in the line of fire with them Arabs blowin' themselves up.
L86231 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ It's so stupid. Says to me that he don't want nothin' to do with no military career. Says he wants to move. Open up an auto shop with his uncle up in Knoxville. I said, okay. How about now? Let's go.
L86230 +++$+++ u510 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Ronnie ship out this mornin'?

L86927 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Maybe I won't.
L86926 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ I don't want you to let go.
L86922 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Well, this one's yours now. You ready to take care of it?
L86921 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow.
L86920 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Now that's sharp. That's real sharp. Miss Ella Mae set you up, didn't she? You like it?

L86836 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ No, you do it. I can't sing.
L86835 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Go'on and sing it, I'll play.
L86834 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Woke up real early. Sun was shining. Just thought I'd mess around, try to learn a song.
L86833 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ I know that.
L86832 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ You know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? Like your eyes can open a little bit more.
L86831 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ How you feelin' today?
L86830 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Don't know where I learn't it, but... it's there in my head.

L86718 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ No one's gonna hurt you no more.
L86717 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Oh, Laz... he hurt me. He... hurt me so many times.

L86606 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Now that's sharp. That is sharp. Chain give you any trouble?
L86487 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ GIVIN' UP THAT SWITCH LIKE A TRAMP! BEHIND MY BACK AND KILL MY BABY...!
L86486 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Let go of me...
L86485 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ My God, gal, don't you got no SENSE? I ain't sayin' I ain't weak? Shit. Playin' guitar in the blood-bucket jukes all ya life... a nigga learn how to sin, let me tell you!  I GOT SIN IN ME! I AIN'T GO'N LIE! BUT I GOT RESPECT! AND ALL YOU GOT IS BILE, GAL!
L86484 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Gal... Matthew ain't doin' shit... this just a story...  Look it. I've seen it in nature, I've seen it in men. Ya got to change up your crop. Cuz that seed ain't gettin' in.  Ya gotta cut this shit out. Got no cause to be up under these fools, ruttin' on ya like you a bitch. Like you somebody's dog. No woman... who joins in union with Almighty God... or man... in the sanctity of marriage... should degrade herself... and bend to ANOTHER MAN'S WILL!
L86483 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'?
L86482 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ The seed that land on good soil is for them who hear the word of God... and understand the word of God. Not enough for you to hear what I'm sayin', you gotta understand.
L86481 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Uh-uh.
L86480 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Means ya healin'.  So all this farmin' make me think on Matthew. Matthew 13. The parable of the sower? Man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns... you know the story?
L86479 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Itches.
L86478 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Cuz once in a while soil need a change. Corn take up a lot of nitrate in the fertilizer. So next crop what ya do is plant ya some soy beans. That give off a lot of nitrate. Change keeps it all growin' and growin' strong.  Sting a bit?
L86477 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Uh-uh.
L86476 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ My Daddy was one of the first mens to organize soil conservation in these parts. That's a group of farmers, you know, each season they'd rotate the crop. Know why it's best to rotate em like that?
L86475 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ If I break one you gonna shoot me?
L86474 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong.
L86473 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ You like this? Walkin' me through this field like I's your mule?
L86469 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ I CAN'T!

L86467 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
L86466 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ No, ma'am. You stop that foolishness.
L86463 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ You gonna get a lot more a'that, you keep me locked up like this!
L86462 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Wicked little bitch... gonna cut me...
