L660950 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Who?
L660949 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ He didn't give his name.
L660948 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Sure.
L660947 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Want me to get that?
L660946 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ There is, but it's not that interesting.
L660945 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ I guess there's probably a story behind that.
L660944 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Huh? Oh, no. This isn't Emily's. I just write in it.
L660943 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ I thought you might -- I don't know -- swallow your tongue or something.  I guess you really miss her, huh?
L660942 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Oh.
L660941 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ I put you on the floor.
L660940 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I'm okay. I just lost my balance.
L660938 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ You're welcome.
L660937 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Thank you.
L660888 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Mmrrmmm... KNAP SAP!
L660887 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Shit. He must've left it back at Thaw. In the auditorium.
L660884 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ What's he saying?
L660883 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Mmhmmm... knap... sap...
L660797 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Is he all right?
L660796 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ This is so embarrassing! You guys had to carry me out.
L660760 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Right. That's why you were standing in the Chancellor's back yard twirling that little cap gun of yours tonight. You're fine, all right, you're fit as a fucking fiddle.
L660759 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ No thanks. I'm fine without them.
L660758 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Looks like... our old friend Mr. Codeine. That should take the pinch out of my ankle.  Have one.
L660757 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Most of the time he is, James. Some of the time he isn't. Now what do we have here?
L660756 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Oh. So. Is -- is your friend Crabtree -- is he -- gay?
L660755 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ She is. Ah. Here we go...
L660754 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Can I ask you something about her?
L660753 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Miss Sloviak's.
L660752 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Whose tuba is that anyway?
L660751 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ That's just what they used to say in the ads. Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...
L660750 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ That's a big trunk. It fits a tuba, a suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost perfectly.
L660746 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I've got tenure.
L660745 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Does she want to hear it was one of her professors?
L660744 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Trust me, James, when the family pet's been assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman.
L660743 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ You?
L660742 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out how to tell the Chancellor I murdered her husband's dog.
L660741 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ What are we going to do with...
L660740 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Yea, James.
L660739 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Professor Tripp? Can I ask you a question?
L660736 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ He's dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead dog when I see one.
L660735 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Do you have a mirror? It's the best way to see if someone's breathing.
L660734 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Okay, okay. Take it easy. Don't freak out on me.
L660733 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ No! He was crazy. I didn't -- he looked -- I thought --
L660732 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Couldn't you've just pulled him off me?
L660731 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ I had to. Didn't I?
L660730 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Shit, James. You shot Dr. Gaskell's dog.
L660726 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Yes. Well. It's complicated, James. I think we should go now.
L660725 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ You mean, with your wife leaving you and all?  Hannah mentioned something about it. About a note.
L660724 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Maybe. I'm feeling a little sad myself tonight.
L660723 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ I'm sorry. Professor Tripp. Maybe it's seeing that jacket that belonged to her. It just looks... really lonely. Hanging there. In a closet. Maybe I'm just a little sad.
L660721 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Right.
L660720 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ I guess you must be, if you know the combination to his closet and he doesn't mind your being here in their bedroom like this.
L660719 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Pretty good. I'm friends with Dr. Gaskell, too.
L660718 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ You're really good friends with the Chancellor, aren't you?
L660717 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth about how much he pays for these things.
L660716 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ It's feels unreal, like butterfly wings or... something. It must've cost Dr. Gaskell a lot.
L660714 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Like the lady herself.
L660713 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ They're glass. The buttons.
L660712 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Really.
L660711 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Really?
L660710 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Go ahead.
L660709 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ So I'm told.
L660708 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ The one she wore on her wedding day?
L660707 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ That's really it.
L660706 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Is that really it?
L660680 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ This is worth it.
L660679 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ I'll miss my bus.
L660678 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ James.  Don't leave just yet. There's something I think you ought to see.
L660675 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ I saw a movie once. Part of it took place in heaven. Everyone wore white and lived in crystal houses. Like that. At least that's the way I remember it...
L660674 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Heaven?
L660673 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Actually, I saw the greenhouse. So I thought... I thought I'd come out here and take a look at it. You don't see one of those every day. It looks like heaven...
L660672 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ You're right.
L660671 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ It's colder in there.
L660670 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ So what are you doing out here?
L660669 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ A little.
L660668 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ You cold, James?
L660667 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ I have trouble sleeping. While I'm lying in bed I figure them out. The stories.
L660666 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Really? That's remarkable.
L660665 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to write.
L660664 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Well...
L660663 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ They really hated it. I think they hated it more than any of the other ones.
L660662 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Listen, James, about this afternoon. In workshop. I'm sorry. I think I let things get a bit out of control.
L660661 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ It's not bad.
L660660 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Sounds like a good one.
L660659 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ So did Gene Tierney. She's in it too.
L660658 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ She went crazy, Frances Farmer.
L660657 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Huh? Oh. Son of Fury. With Tyrone Power and Frances Farmer.
L660656 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ You're not like my other students, James. So what was the movie you two saw?
L660655 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ You're not like my other teachers, Professor Tripp.
L660654 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Maybe it's because she's beautiful and she knows it and try as she might to not let that screw her up, it's inevitable that it will in some way.
L660653 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ She likes old movies like I do, that's all.  Besides, she doesn't really know me. She thinks she does, but she doesn't. Maybe it's because she's Mormon and I'm Catholic.
L660652 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Relax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent her a room.
L660651 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ No! What gave you that idea?
L660650 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James?
L660646 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ ...You carry firearms.
L660645 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ It's just... for good luck. Some people carry rabbits' feet...
L660644 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ It used to shoot these little paper caps, but they don't make them anymore. The caps.
L660643 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ It's very convincing.
L660642 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ It was my mother's. She won it in a penny arcade in Baltimore when she was in Catholic school.
L661459 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Uh huh. Well, thanks for the thought, but, as shocking as this may sound, I'm not the first writer to sip a little weed. And furthermore, it might interest you to know that one book I wrote, as you say, 'under the influence,' happened to win a little something called the PEN award which, by the way, I accepted 'under the influence.'
L661458 +++$+++ u3500 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ HANNAH GREEN +++$+++ It's just that, you know, I was thinking about how, in class, you're always telling us 'that writers make choices -- at least the good ones. And, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the book isn't really great -- I mean, really great -- but at times it's, well, very detailed, you know, with the genealogies of everyone's horses and all the dental records and so on -- and I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but it sort of reads, in places, like, well, actually, like...  ...you didn't make any choices at all. And I was wondering if it might not be different if, maybe, when you wrote, you weren't always... under the influence.
L661457 +++$+++ u3500 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ HANNAH GREEN +++$+++ No, it's not that, it's...
L661456 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ That good, huh?
L661455 +++$+++ u3500 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ HANNAH GREEN +++$+++ I uh, I didn't finish, I... fell asleep.
L661454 +++$+++ u3500 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ HANNAH GREEN +++$+++ Sure. The keys are on the dresser next to... to your book.
L661453 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Right. Anyway, I was wondering if I could borrow your car. Mine's sort of out of commission.
L661452 +++$+++ u3500 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ HANNAH GREEN +++$+++ It beats 'What's your major?'
L661451 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ He cribbed that from Borges.
L661272 +++$+++ u3500 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ HANNAH GREEN +++$+++ I don't know, Grady. I just dropped him on a corner.
L661271 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ But where? I need the street.
L661270 +++$+++ u3500 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ HANNAH GREEN +++$+++ I told you, Sewickly Heights.
L661269 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James that day?
L661267 +++$+++ u3500 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ HANNAH GREEN +++$+++ Who does?
L661266 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
L661265 +++$+++ u3500 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ HANNAH GREEN +++$+++ Crabtree said it sounded like something James would be messed up in.
L661264 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Jesus.
L661263 +++$+++ u3500 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ HANNAH GREEN +++$+++ At first the police thought he just ran away, but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet --
L661262 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Actually, He's not the Chancellor's -- What?
L661261 +++$+++ u3500 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ HANNAH GREEN +++$+++ He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The blind one.
L661260 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Listen, Hannah. You don't remember where that aunt worked, do you? James' aunt.
L661259 +++$+++ u3500 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ HANNAH GREEN +++$+++ I don't know -- maybe -- I don't think so.
L661258 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it out in the open like that. Crabtree hasn't been in here, has he? Poking around?
L661257 +++$+++ u3500 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ HANNAH GREEN +++$+++ I know I shouldn't have, but there it was, just sort of lying out, and I couldn't resist and -- and -- I suck.
L661256 +++$+++ u3500 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ HANNAH GREEN +++$+++ Grady!
L661255 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Hey.
L660995 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Oh. Well. I...
L660994 +++$+++ u3500 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ HANNAH GREEN +++$+++ I thought we were going to talk. Last night.
L660891 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I don't think it really matters, Hannah. We could probably stand him up in the garage with the snow shovels at this point.
L660890 +++$+++ u3500 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ HANNAH GREEN +++$+++ The one in your office? It's the best one for naps.
L660889 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ All right. Take him to my place. He can crash on the sofa.
L660886 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Hh-uh. Last time I saw it was...
L660885 +++$+++ u3500 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ HANNAH GREEN +++$+++ His bag. You know that ratty green thing he's always carrying around. He must've left it inside.
L660882 +++$+++ u3500 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ HANNAH GREEN +++$+++ James is odd. I know he has an aunt in Sewickley Heights. I dropped him there once, but...  Come to think of it, it wasn't even his Aunt's house. He said she worked there. Or something. I don't remember.
L660881 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ That strikes me as odd.
L660880 +++$+++ u3500 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ HANNAH GREEN +++$+++ Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen it.
L660879 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Hannah, are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives?
L660878 +++$+++ u3500 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ HANNAH GREEN +++$+++ I would if I knew where I was taking him.
L660877 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Look, Hannah. When you get him home... make sure he's all right. Before you leave. Okay?
L660874 +++$+++ u3500 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ HANNAH GREEN +++$+++ I just mean, I -- I guess Emily isn't going to be there when you get home.
L660873 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Do?
L660872 +++$+++ u3500 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ HANNAH GREEN +++$+++ So what are you going to do?
L660871 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I hope that isn't true. We need all the downy innocents we can get.
L660870 +++$+++ u3500 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ HANNAH GREEN +++$+++ And I love the inscription you wrote to me. Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think I am.
L660869 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I thank you.
L660868 +++$+++ u3500 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ HANNAH GREEN +++$+++ I've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter. It's so beautiful, Grady. So natural. It's like all your sentences always existed, just waiting around in Style Heaven, or wherever, for you to fetch them down.
L660691 +++$+++ u3500 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ HANNAH GREEN +++$+++ James'll know about George Sanders.
L660690 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree.
L660687 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ The answer's yes. I think. Yes. I don't know. Where are they exactly?
L660686 +++$+++ u3500 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ HANNAH GREEN +++$+++ Ail right. By the way, his friend...?
L660685 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ He's going with me. You take Crabtree. And his friend. All right?
L660512 +++$+++ u3500 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ HANNAH GREEN +++$+++ Just checking.
L660511 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Me? Sure. Why?
L660510 +++$+++ u3500 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ HANNAH GREEN +++$+++ I think so... What about you?
L660509 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Thanks for that. He all right?
L660507 +++$+++ u3500 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ HANNAH GREEN +++$+++ I think maybe we're missing the point. It seems to me James' strength as a writer is that he doesn't take us by the hand. He treats us like adults. He respects us enough to forget us. That takes... courage.
L660506 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Yes, Hannah?
L661653 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ I know, but sometimes...
L661652 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ You don't deserve me, you know.
L661648 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ In the hospital. I was kind of excited about it at the time, but then I was on pretty heavy painkillers.
L661647 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Did you just make that up?
L661645 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ It didn't come up.
L661644 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Does he still love you?
L661643 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ I told Walter.
L661642 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Did you tell Walter?
L661641 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Some times...
L661640 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I guess you have to go on faith.
L661639 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Oh?
L661638 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I went and looked at some babies just now.
L661637 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Dozens. It's very sad.
L661636 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Ouch. How many?
L661635 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ And you're old.

L661633 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
L661632 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I lost it all.
L661631 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is it true? Did you lose it all?
L661630 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I'm through improvising.
L661629 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or is this you improvising again, Grady?
L661628 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I'm so glad to see you, Sara.
L661440 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ I said it didn't sound like you.
L661439 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ And what did you say?
L661438 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ He told me.
L661437 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ He told you.
L661436 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I think I might've said I was in love with you.
L661435 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ And what do you think you might have said?
L661434 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I think I might have.
L661433 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ You didn't happen to call the house last night, did you, Grady?
L661432 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ It's within the realm. He takes his souvenirs pretty seriously. And he was just a wee bit prickly this morning.
L661431 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Would Walter really press charges?
L661430 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ This is not what the university has in mind when it promises a liberal education, Grady.
L661390 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Of course, I'm sure. Ah, Christ, the puberty police are back.
L661389 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Are you sure you parked it there?
L661388 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Honestly. Someone stole my car. I parked it right there last night.
L661387 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Grady.
L661386 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Someone stole my car.

L661384 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ And the jacket?
L661383 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Inside.
L661382 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ I'm not very happy with you right now, Grady. But more importantly, Walter's not very happy and he's gotten the police involved. They seem to think James Leer is somehow responsible for all of this. You wouldn't happen to know where James is, would you, Grady?
L661381 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I'm sorry, Sara. I've been trying to tell you. It's all my --
L661380 +++$+++ u3504 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ It seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
