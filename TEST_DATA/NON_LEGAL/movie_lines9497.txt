L653209 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ It wasn't no fun, Lula. The wind was blowin' super-hard and I wasn't dressed warm. Only instead of freezin', I was sweatin' strong.
L653208 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ What was this one?
L653207 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ No, I like gettin' up around four a.m. and talkin' bout wild animals... Though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream. I kinda wish I didn't remember it. Up at Pee Dee, I couldn't remember any of my dreams.
L653206 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ You think so, baby? Does my talkin' bother you, honey?
L653205 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Too bad they don't give an award for talkin'... You'd win first prize. Especially with those tits.
L653204 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Talkin's good. Long as you got the other? I'm a big believer in talkin', case you ain't noticed.
L653203 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ We didn't do nothin' special I can remember. Just talked, is all.
L653202 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ I really do think it's the best night of my life.
L653201 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ I was hopin' you would. I know that night by heart. Sometimes, honey? I think it's the best night of my life.
L653200 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ I do.
L653199 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Recall the time we was sittin' one night behind the Confederate soldier? Leanin' against it. And you took your hand and put it on your heart and you said, 'You feel it beatin' in there, Lula?... Get used to it, 'cause it belongs to you now.' D'you recall that?
L653198 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ I ain't never met anyone come close to you, sugar.
L653197 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ You certain?
L653196 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ You got me, peanut.
L653195 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?
L653194 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Lula, sometimes I gotta admit, you come up with some weird thoughts...
L653193 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Shhhhh... It's four o'clock... That woman's laugh the other day had somethin' to do with this feelin'?... Like bein' ripped apart by a gorilla, maybe... Grabbed sudden and pulled apart real quick by a real powerful one.
L653192 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ My God,  it better be, darlin', cause it'd be the last... What time is it?
L653191 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Ever imagine what it'd be like to get eaten alive by a wild beast? Sometimes I think it would be the biggest thrill?
L653190 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Huh?
L653187 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ One person thinks he's doin' somethin' good and ever'body else gets upset about it.
L653186 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ What's that, peanut?
L653185 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ It's just another case, Sailor.
L653184 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ What lesson do get outta that story, Lula?
L653162 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ You really are dangerously cute, honey. I gotta admit it.
L653161 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ I love it when your eyes get wild, honey. They light up all blue almost and little white parachutes pop out of 'em. Oh, Sailor you're so aware of what goes on with me? I mean, you pay attention. And I swear, you got the sweetest cock. Sometimes it's like it's talkin' to me when you're inside? Like it's got a voice all it's own. You get right on me.
L653109 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ We sure don't, honey...  Get me a Mounds?
L653108 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ We're about dry bones, sweetheart. We don't wanna have to push this "bird" into New Orleans.
L653107 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Honey, we're goin' to bed now and it's time to change the subject.
L653106 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Honest, Lula. I prob'ly ain't precisely got all the facts straight, but it's about what they said.
L653105 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Sailor Ripley! You stop! You're makin' this shit up and I ain't gonna sit for it!
L653104 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ How they used to do it. Course they got more sophisticated ways now. Radio said the Chinese, I think it is, figured a better idea is by insertin' a balloon in the forehead and lettin' it hang down on the nose.
L653103 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Sailor? You expect me to believe a man'd be goin' around with a arm sewed to his nose?
L653102 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Yeah, well listen to this... Radio said back in the 1920s a I-talian doctor figured out that if, say, a fella got his nose cut off or bit off in, say, a barfight or somethin', they'd sew one of his forearms to his nose for a few weeks... Then put leeches on it.
L653101 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ I got one on me at Lake Lanier. Lifeguard poured salt on it and it dropped off. Felt awful. He was a cute boy, though, so it was almost worth it.
L653100 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Heard on the radio how doctors is usin' leeches again, just in old times. You know, when even barbers used 'em?
L653099 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Yeah, it's a real problem for me, Sailor, you know? When I went in that drugstore by the restaurant in Biloxi? I saw 'em by the register and the girl throw 'em in. I'm not big on resistin'. So what about a leech?
L653098 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Got you a pack of Mores again, huh?
L653097 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Say what? Honestly, sugar, you can talk more shit sometimes?
L653096 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Lula... I learned somethin' interestin' today on a science show I heard on the radio... How leeches is comin' back into style.
L653095 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ M-i-ss-i-ss-i-pp-i... You can almost hear that jazz blowin' up from the big N.O.
L653090 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Let's get fed, sweetheart. The light's fadin' fast.
L653089 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ It's huge. This musta been a grand old place at one time.
L653088 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ There ain't no water in the swimmin' pool. Just a dead tree fell in, prob'ly from bein' struck by lightnin'.
L653087 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ What's that, honey?
L653086 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Come look at this.
L653085 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ I H-A-T-E hotel bedspreads. They don't hardly never get washed, and I don't like the idea of lyin' on other people's dirt.
L653084 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Looks more like the Ghost of the Old South, but we'll try her.
L653083 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ How about that one? The Host of the Old South Hotel.
L653081 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ We oughta stay somewhere outta the way. Not in no Holidays or Ramadas or Motel Six. If Johnnie Farragut's on our trail he'll check those first.
L653080 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Got anyplace special in mind?
L653079 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat.
L653078 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ That's disgustin'. Those kinda sentiments shouldn't be allowed out in public. Is this Biloxi yet?
L653077 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ What it says on the bumper sticker up front. On that pickup.
L653076 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ What kinda trash talk is that?
L653075 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Life is a bitch and then you marry one.
L653073 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Thank the Lord. Well, you ain't let me down yet, Sailor. That's more'n I can say for the rest of the world?
L653072 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Okay, manslaughterer who's broke his parole and got in mind nothin' but immoral purposes far's you're concerned.
L653071 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Manslaughterer, honey, not murderer. Don't exaggerate.
L653070 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ You ain't gonna begin worryin' about what's bad for you at this hour, are you, sugar? I mean, here you are crossin' state lines with a A-Number One certified murderer.
L653069 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Yeah, I guess, but - and here's the lesson part - they ain't supposed to be so bad for you.
L653068 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ They sure do stink.
L653067 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ It ain't. It's part of the lessons of life. I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape?
L653066 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ That don't smell like a More.
L653065 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ We got through two states already.
L653064 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ You got about six more big states to go before we find out.
L653063 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ What'll it be like in California, Sailor, do you think? I hear it don't rain much there.
L653062 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ You guess? My parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt Portagee County.
L653061 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ I suppose so. She knew I was bound to see you soon as you was sprung, but I don't figure she counted on us takin' off together like this... I guess this means you're breakin' parole, then?
L653060 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ What do you mean by necessary? She's prob'ly already called the cops, my parole officer, her p.i. boyfriend Johnnie Farragut.
L653059 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ I'll drop mama a postcard from somewhere. I mean, I don't want her to worry no more'n necessary.
L653055 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Sorta brown, blonde, I guess. But dig this, sweetie. Then she turns over, peels off them orange pants, and spreads her legs real wide and says to me...
L653054 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Poor baby. She don't know what she missed. What color hair she have?
L653053 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Her face was half-pushed into the pillow, and she looked back over her shoulder at me and said, 'I won't suck you. Don't ask me to suck you.'
L653052 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ You're excitin' me, honey. What'd she do?
L653051 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ She just rolled over onto her stomach and stuck her ass up in the air. I slid my hand between her legs and she closed her thighs on it.
L653050 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ I guess.
L653049 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ You mean like pedal pushers?
L653048 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ That's just what she said. I had a boner with a capital "O." I went to kiss her but she broke off laughin' and ran down the hallway. I found her lyin' on a bed in a room filled with assault weapons and Penthouse magazines. She was a wild chick. She was wearin' bright orange pants with kind of Spanish lookin' lacy black stripes down the sides. You know, them kind that doesn't go all the way down your leg?
L653047 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Oh, baby. What a bad boy you are!
L653046 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ When she got almost to the top step I stuck my hand between her legs from behind.
L653045 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Told her my name. Then she said somethin' like, 'It's so noisy down here. Why don't we go upstairs so we can hear ourselves?' She turned around and led the way. I knew I had an important lesson to learn that day.
L653044 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ What'd you say to her?
L653043 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ She looked right at me and run her tongue over her lips and put her hand on my arm - told me her name was Irma.
L653042 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Maybe two, three months after Juarez. I was visitin' my cousin, Junior Train, in Savannah, and we were at some kid's house whose parents were out of town. A girl comes up to me that was real tall, taller than me.
L653041 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Sorry, baby... When's the first time you done it with a girl who wasn't hookin'?
L653037 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ You still got plenty energy for me, baby.
L653036 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Yeah, I had my first taste on that trip to Juarez. At that age you still got a lot of energy.
L653035 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ ...That's an awful long way to go, just to get some pussy.
L653034 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Those toenails dry yet? We got some dancin' to do.
L653033 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ I'd got to the far end of the world for you, baby... You know I would.
L653032 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ You up for that?
L653031 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Sailor!
L653017 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Yeah, maybe...
L653016 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much...
L653015 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ One thing puzzles my mind, sugar... You're twenty years old - aren't you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin' us apart? Puttin' a detective on us. I'll tell ya Lula... Well... It's more'n me killin' Bob Ray Lemon...
L653014 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ We gotta be careful, honey, my mama's gonna have Johnnie Farragut on us like a duck on a june bug, and he's one clever detective? You know how clever? He once told me that he could find an honest man in Washington. My toenails gotta dry first anyways, Sailor.
L653013 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Let's go dancin', peanut. I'm ready.
L653011 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Yeah, I suppose. But you know somethin' baby, hair does make a difference.
L653010 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ There's worse things that can happen to a man, honey.
L653009 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ He's twenty-four now? A year older than you? And must be 'bout bald.
L653008 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ So?
L653007 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ When he was about seventeen, he startin' losin' his hair.
L653006 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ What's that?
L653005 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Too bad we all can't, baby... One thing about Dell?
L653004 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Sound like ol' Dell's more'n just a little confused, peanut... Too bad he couldn't visit that ol' Wizard of Oz and get some good advice.
L653003 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ The private eye cost Aunt Rootie over a thousand dollars? Then a little while later Dell ran off a third time to some place he said would "give him peace of mind." Nobody's seen him since.
L653002 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ It ain't so funny now, though. December before Christmas? Dell disappeared again and Aunt Rootie hired a private eye to find him. He was missin' for almost a month before he wandered back in the house on mornin' dressed in some filthy Santa Claus suit.
L653001 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Prob'ly the rain boys from Outer Space.
L653000 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ ...are followin' him around.
L652995 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ One time - real late - like about two thirty a.m.? She found Dell up in the black of night all dressed and makin' sandwiches in the kitchen.
L652994 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Hell, peanut...
L652993 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ One time, Aunt Rootie caught Dell puttin' one big cockroach on his anus?
L652992 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie, Dell's mama? She found cockroaches in Dell's underwear.
L652991 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Actin' funny how?
L652988 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Dell disappeared. Dell was learnin' a hard lesson. What I learned from observin' Dell is I think people who are frightened want to disappear. He'd startin' behavin' weird? Like comin' up to people every fifteen minutes and askin' how they were doin'?
L652987 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ What's that, peanut?
L652986 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Oh, nothin'. I never let on to mama about Dell bein' the one. I just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was? I didn't tell Dell, neither. He was back home in Chattanooga by then, anyhow, and I didn't see the point. Somethin' terrible happened to him, though. Six months ago.
L652985 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ What happened to him?
L652984 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ It was my cousin, Dell, done it? His folks used to visit with us summers.
L652983 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ You tell the boy who knocked you up?
L652982 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ ...I hope you appreciate my spendin' six hundred dollars, not countin' what it cost us to get here and back... This man's the best damn abortionist in the South.
L652979 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ She got me an abortion...
L652978 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Musta been a lesson tellin' ya it was the wrong time... What did you do, your mama find out?
L652976 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ It ain't altogether terrible just to let things go along sometimes. Lula, I done a few things in my life I ain't too proud of, but I'll tell ya from now on I ain't gonna do nothin' for no good reason. All I know for sure is there's more'n a few bad ideas runnin' around loose out there.
L652975 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ I just think about things as they come up. I never been much of a planner.
L652974 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ At Pee Dee, all you think about is the future, you know? Gettin' out? And what you'll do and what you'll think about when you're on the outside again.
L652973 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Oh, you know exactly what I mean, honey? It'd make the future so simple and nice.
L652972 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ You think of the weirdest damn things to say sometimes, peanut. Ain't we been doin' a pretty fair job this far?
L652971 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Wouldn't it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives?
L652970 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Yeah?
L652969 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Sailor?
L652968 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Hell, why should the Datin' Game be different from real life? At least them boys is gonna get somethin' to eat.
L652967 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ That don't seem fair.
L652966 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken.
L652965 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Don't the reject guys get anythin'?
L652964 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Twenty-three months, eighteen days is all. Don't need to make more'n it was.  This couple's goin' on a date to Hawaii. The girl chose him over the other two guys.
L652963 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ I'm sorry, sweetie. I forget some moments where all you been the last two years.
L652962 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ We didn't have no TV up at Pee Dee, baby, you know?
L652961 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ What's that honey?
L652960 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ What you have to get personal about so quick? All I mean is you could possibly read a book.
L652959 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ That so?  You want to tell me what, if any, real thoughts you had lately?
L652958 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ What you want to watch this trash for? Ain't one of those people have a real thought in their brain.
L652955 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ That's good... Now go get yourself a beer.  You fellas have alotta the same power Elvis had... Y'all know this one?
L652954 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Hell, you just rubbed up against the wrong girl is all.
L652879 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ I'm always ready to dance. But I need me a kiss first, honey. Just one?
L652878 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Just sounded like an old gal havin' a good time to me... You ready to dance?
L652877 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ That woman's laugh creeps me out. I heard somethin' like that... somewhere before... Sound'd like the wicked witch...
L652876 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ You okay, honey?
L652874 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Sailor, that ozone layer is disappearin'. Seems to me the government could do somethin' about it. One of these mornings the sun'll come up and burn a hole clean through the planet like an X-Ray.
L652873 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Here she goes again...
L652872 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Uncle Pooch died in a car crash three years later while he was holidayin' in Myrtle Beach. They still got way too much traffic there for my taste... And another thing, baby... That government of ours should be keepin' us separated from outer space...
L652871 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ One hundred twenty decibels - head on collision of a '54 Ford Pick-Up and a '64 Chevy Station Wagon. No survivors. Balls of flame and grinding metal.
L652870 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Just you. Uncle Pooch never acted strange or different after. And he never did anything else to me. I always got a nice present from him at Christmas, like a coat or jewelry?
L652869 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ And you never told nobody about it?
L652868 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Well, sure. But he was super-gentle, you know? I mean, he raped me and all, but I guess there's all different kinds of rapes. I didn't exactly want him to do it but I suppose once it started, it didn't seem all that terrible. It was over pretty quick, and after Uncle Pooch just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there. I stayed in bed till I heard him drive off. Then I just went back into the kitchen and finished makin' my sandwich.
L652867 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ 'We' did it? Whattaya mean? Didn't he force you?
L652866 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ He was short but powerful. With hairy arms? Anyway, he carried me into the maid's dayroom which nobody used. We did it there on an old bed.
L652865 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ No, he picked me up.
L652864 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ So how'd he finally nail you? Right there in the kitchen?
L652862 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Didn't he say somethin'?
L652861 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Uncle Pooch came in the side door through the porch, you know? Where I was makin' a jelly and banana sandwich? I remember I had my hair in curlers cause I was goin' that night with Vicki and Cherry Ann, the DeSoto sisters. Uncle Pooch must have known nobody but me was home, cause he came right in and put both his hands on my butt and sorta shoved me up against the counter.
L652860 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Well, mama was at the Busy Bee havin' her hair dyed? And I was alone in the house.
L652859 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Sorry, sugar. Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed.
L652858 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ I said you can be too crude sometimes? I don't think I care for it.
L652857 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ I can't hardly understand you when you talk with one of them Mores in your mouth.
L652856 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ You're terrible crude sometimes, Sailor, you know?
L652855 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ How'd it happen, peanut? He just pull out the old toad and let it croak?
L652854 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more'n a little.
L652853 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen.
L652852 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Sailor, you are somethin' else, honey... When I was fifteen, Mama told me that pretty soon I'd be startin' to think about sex, and I should talk to her before I did anything about it.
L652837 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Grandmama Pace had a long, smooth white neck. It was like on a statue it was so white?
L652836 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ You have such a pretty, long neck, like a swan.
L652831 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Started he couldn't remember things? Got real violent? Mama kept tellin' me it was on account of lead poisoning from cleanin' the old paint off our house without usin' a mask... But I don't know. Seems like his brain just fell apart in pieces.
L652830 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ In a fire, as I recall.
L652829 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ You remind me of my daddy, you know? Mama told me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too big for their bodies. He had a long nose, too, like theirs. Did I ever tell you how he died?
L652828 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ You're perfect for me, too.
L652826 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Hell, peanut, you stuck with me after I planted Bob Ray Lemon. A man can't ask for more than that.
L652825 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ I'd stand by you, Sailor... through anything.
L652824 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ It's okay. I hardly used to see them anyway. I didn't have much parental guiding. The public defender kept sayin' that at my parole hearin'. He was a good ol' boy, stood by me... Even brought me some cartons of cigarettes from time to time.
L652823 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Gee, Sailor. I'm sorry, honey. I never would have guessed it.
L652822 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Camels, same as me... Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness.
L652821 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ What brand'd she smoke?
L652820 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ I guess I started smokin' when I was about six... My mama was already dead from lung cancer...
L652819 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Well, I was thinkin' about smokin' actually... My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools? I stole 'em from her beginnin' in about sixth grade. When I got old enough to buy my own, I bought those. Now I've just about settled on Mores, as you probably noticed? They're longer.
L652818 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee, honey. The rest of you, too, of course. But the way your head works is God's own private mystery. What was it you was thinkin'?
L652817 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Did you ever think somethin' like about the wicked witch of the east comin' flyin' in?... Did you ever think somethin' and then later think you've said it out loud to someone?
L652816 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Stab it and steer.
L652815 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ 'Bout fifty thousand times. I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?... I hear Powermad's at "The Hurricane."
L652814 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Hey, my snakeskin jacket... Thanks, baby... Did I ever tell you that this here jacket for me is a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom?
L652813 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Peanut...
L652812 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Hey baby...
L653406 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ HOLY SHIT!! IT'S THE NIGHT OF THE LIVIN' FUCKIN' DEAD!!!!

L653403 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Damn!
L653402 +++$+++ u3492 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ REPORTER +++$+++ The reptiles were supposed to be of a docile species, said a senior government official, but it seems the breeders bungled and reared attack crocodiles.

Police said they have identified and questioned at least four girls, all Asians twelve to fifteen years old, who have been living in the North Houston warehouse with a Vietnamese pimp since February. The girls are being treated as victims, said police Sergeant Amos Milburn. 'These are really just children,' he said, 'but they've been exposed to a lot already.
