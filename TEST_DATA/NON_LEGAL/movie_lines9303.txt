L421475 +++$+++ u2334 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ KISSINGER +++$+++ Can you imagine what this man would have been had he ever been loved?
L421215 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Yeah ...
L421214 +++$+++ u2334 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ KISSINGER +++$+++ Mr. Nixon, it is possible for even a president to go too far.
L421213 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Resent it all you want, Henry, but you're in it with the rest of us. Cambodia, Ellsberg, the wiretaps you put in.  The President wants you to know you can't just click your heels and head back to Harvard Yard.  It's your ass too, Henry, and it's in the wind twisting with everyone else's.
L421212 +++$+++ u2334 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ KISSINGER +++$+++ I had nothing to do with that, sir, and I resent any implication ...
L421211 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ That doesn't matter now, Henry.  The point is, you might lose some of your media-darling halo if the press starts sniffing around our dirty laundry.
L421208 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Idiotic?  Yes, I suppose it was.
L421207 +++$+++ u2334 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ KISSINGER +++$+++ I ... I heard something ... It sounded idiotic.
L421206 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ All kinds of shit would come out. Like the Ellsberg thing.  You knew about that, Henry, didn't you?
L421205 +++$+++ u2334 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ KISSINGER +++$+++ But it must be done; your government is paralyzed.
L421204 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Housecleaning?  It would be ugly, Henry, really ugly ...
L421116 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Jews and Negros don't win elections, Henry.  Better to hang them around the Democrats' necks.
L421115 +++$+++ u2334 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ KISSINGER +++$+++ You'll pick up the middle on this one - the Jews and Negros.
L420847 +++$+++ u2334 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ KISSINGER +++$+++ We have to entertain the possibility ...
L420846 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ That's right!  And if necessary, I'll drop the big one.
L420827 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ This is a major coup, gentlemen -- our own State Department doesn't even know.  And if it leaks out of here tonight ...
L420826 +++$+++ u2334 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ KISSINGER +++$+++ Mr. President, this cannot be breathed!  Especially to our secretary of state -- that cretin Rogers ... The Chinese would never trust us again. The only way, I emphasize only way, to pull this off is in secret.
L420825 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ This will get me a second term.  Damn it, without risk, there's no heroism. There's no history.  I, Nixon, was born to do this.
L420818 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ That's what geopolitics is about -- the whole world linked by self interest ... You tell me, Ron, how the hell I can explain that on television to a bunch of simple-minded reporters and weeping fucking mothers!
L420817 +++$+++ u2334 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ KISSINGER +++$+++ Exactly, yes, Mr. President.  That is my contention.
L420816 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ That's triangular diplomacy, gentlemen.
L420811 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ No one understands! -- even my own men.  What do you think the Communists respond to?  Honesty, liberal guilt, soul-wringing crap, fathers on TV crying?  Hell no!  I understand the Communist mind, I've studied it for thirty years.  They grasp "realpolitik" better than any of us, right, Henry?
L420810 +++$+++ u2334 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ KISSINGER +++$+++ Exactly, sir.  That is your historical contribution: to lead boldly in an era of limits.
L420782 +++$+++ u2334 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ KISSINGER +++$+++ What I think is ... they're cowards. Their opposition represents the cowardice of the Eastern Establishment.  They don't realize as you do, Mr. President, that the Communists only respect strength, and they will only negotiate in good faith if they fear the "madman," Richard Nixon.
L420781 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ I didn't ask what your staff thinks, Henry.  What do you think?
L420780 +++$+++ u2334 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ KISSINGER +++$+++ Well, as you know, most of my staff have weighed in against this "incursion."  They believe it will fail to achieve anything fundamental militarily, and will result in crushing criticism domestically ...
L420521 +++$+++ u2334 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ KISSINGER +++$+++ But they all got it back again, didn't they?  We should have lunch sometime.
L420520 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Churchill, DeGaulle, Disraeli.  They all went through the pain of losing power.
L420519 +++$+++ u2334 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ KISSINGER +++$+++ Finally someone who's noticed!  I'm a great admirer of yours, too, Mr. Nixon.  You are an unusual politician. We share a mutual idol -- "Six Crises" sounds like a page from Churchill.
L420518 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ ... as the old alliances crumble.
L420249 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ We're gonna hit him so hard he looks like everything that's sick and evil about the Eastern Establishment.  You and your "plumbers" are gonna find dirt on this guy -- let's see him going to the bathroom in front of the American public!  And when we finish with him, they'll crucify him!
L420248 +++$+++ u2334 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ KISSINGER +++$+++ There's no other choice.
L420247 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Alright, Henry -- we're gonna go your way.  Crush this Ellsberg character the same way we did Hiss!
L420226 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ ... and what do we get for it?  Gobs and gobs of bullshit, gossip, nothing! Someone is leaking. We've got to stop the leaks, Henry, at any cost, do you hear me?  Then we can go for the big play -- China, Russia.
L420225 +++$+++ u2334 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ KISSINGER +++$+++ Who are you talking to like this, you insignificant shit ...
L420215 +++$+++ u2334 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ KISSINGER +++$+++ He's turned into a drug fiend, he shot people from helicopters in Vietnam, he has sexual relations with his wife in front of their children.  He sees a shrink in L.A.  He's all fucked up. Now he's trying to be a hero to the liberals ... If he gets away with it, everybody will follow his lead.  He must be stopped at all costs.
L420214 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ No, Henry.  I don't.
L420213 +++$+++ u2334 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ KISSINGER +++$+++ He was, he was.  We taught a class together at Harvard.  But you know these back-stabbing Ivy League intellectuals, they can't ...
L420212 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ It's your people who are leaking to the Times.  Wasn't this Ellsberg a student of yours at Harvard?  He was your idea; why are you suddenly running for cover?
L420211 +++$+++ u2334 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ KISSINGER +++$+++ I beg your pardon --
L420210 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Fuck it!  He doesn't like me, John!  It's your fault, Henry.
L420204 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Here, Tim ... Tim.  I'm as frustrated as you, Henry, but don't you think this one's a Democrat problem.  They started the war; it makes them look bad.
L420203 +++$+++ u2334 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ KISSINGER +++$+++ Mr. President, we are in a revolutionary situation.  We are under siege -- Black Panthers, Weathermen; The State Department under Rogers is leaking like a sieve.  And now this insignificant little shit Ellsberg publishing all the diplomatic secrets of this country will destroy our ability to conduct foreign policy.
L421089 +++$+++ u2337 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ MAO +++$+++ How a fat man gets so many girls.
L421088 +++$+++ u2334 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ KISSINGER +++$+++ Secret, Mr. Chairman?
L421087 +++$+++ u2337 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ MAO +++$+++ Fung pi!   I've only managed to change a few things around the city of Beijing.  I want to know your secret.
L421086 +++$+++ u2334 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ KISSINGER +++$+++ But your writings have changed the world, Mr. Chairman.
L421085 +++$+++ u2337 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ MAO +++$+++ What a waste of time.  My writings mean absolutely nothing.
L421084 +++$+++ u2334 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ KISSINGER +++$+++ You know, Mr. Chairman, at Harvard I used your writings in my class.
L420993 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ How did he do that?  All those kids ... Why do they hate me so much?
L420992 +++$+++ u2336 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ MANOLO +++$+++ I don't know.  He made me see the stars ...
L420991 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Why?
L420990 +++$+++ u2336 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ MANOLO +++$+++ Yes.
L420989 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Did you cry when he died?
L420988 +++$+++ u2336 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ MANOLO +++$+++ He was a politician.
L420987 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ You don't think he was a hero?
L420986 +++$+++ u2336 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ MANOLO +++$+++ That was Mr. Kennedy.
L420985 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ We let you down, didn't we.  Your people.
L420984 +++$+++ u2336 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ MANOLO +++$+++ Yes, Mr. President.
L420983 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Do you miss Cuba, Manolo?
L420982 +++$+++ u2336 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ MANOLO +++$+++ Of course.
L420981 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Just ... uh ... you know.
L420980 +++$+++ u2336 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ MANOLO +++$+++ I was asleep, Mr. President.  What can I get you?
L421095 +++$+++ u2337 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ MAO +++$+++ The real war is in us.  History is a symptom of our disease.
L421094 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Civil war is always the cruelest kind of war.
L421093 +++$+++ u2337 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ MAO +++$+++ You're too modest, Nixon.  You're as evil as I am.  We're both from poor families.  But others pay to feed the hunger in us.  In my case, millions of reactionaries.  In your case, millions of Vietnamese.
L421092 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ I was the lesser of two evils.
L421091 +++$+++ u2337 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ MAO +++$+++ You know, I voted for you in your last election.
L421083 +++$+++ u2337 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ MAO +++$+++ That has the added virtue of being true.
L421082 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Mr. Chairman, there is an old saying: The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
L421081 +++$+++ u2337 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ MAO +++$+++ Don't ever trust them.  They never tell the truth or honor their commitments.  Vietnamese are like Russians.  Both are dogs.
L421079 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ We know you've taken a great risk in inviting us here.
L421078 +++$+++ u2337 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ MAO +++$+++ Looks can be deceiving ...
L421077 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ I must say you look very good, Mr. Chairman.
L421142 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Kissinger's misunderstood.  He pretends to be a liberal for his Establishment friends, but he's even tougher than I am ...
L421141 +++$+++ u2338 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ MITCH +++$+++ How about Kissinger along with him?
L421140 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ We're gonna get rid of him -- Allende, I mean -- just as fast as we can. He's on the top of the list.
L421139 +++$+++ u2338 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ MITCH +++$+++ What are you going to do about this Allende fellow nationalizing our businesses in Chile?  You gonna send Kissinger down there?
L421138 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Free, if you're the president.
L421137 +++$+++ u2338 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ MITCH +++$+++ So ... how's the food over there in China, Mr. Nixon?
L420581 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ I came down here to close a deal for Studebaker.
L420580 +++$+++ u2338 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ MITCH +++$+++ You just came down here for the weather, right, Mr. Nixon?
L420579 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Yes, well ... Gentlemen, I promised my wife.  I'm out of politics.
L420858 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Sure, I'd like to offer condolences.
L420857 +++$+++ u2339 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Get off that.  That leads nowhere. You should offer condolences to the families of those kids.
L420855 +++$+++ u2339 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ That was a long time ago.
L420854 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ It broke my heart when Harold died.
L420853 +++$+++ u2339 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ You're doing the right thing, Dick ... don't let 'em shake you.
L420852 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ They were throwing rocks, John, just rocks.  They don't think I feel ... but I feel too much sometimes.  I just can't let a whole policy get dominated by our sentimentality.
L420851 +++$+++ u2339 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ It wasn't your fault.  The soldiers were just kids, too.  They panicked.
L420850 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ My brother Harold was about the same age as those kids, John.  Tuberculosis got him.
L420849 +++$+++ u2339 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ You all right?
L420833 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ How do you know that, John?  Did we try?  Are we just giving up like the rest of 'em?  What's Hoover found, for God's sake?
L420832 +++$+++ u2339 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ This isn't '48, Dick.  They'll never buy it.
L420802 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Shit, the press doesn't care about the facts.  Cronkite's sticking it to me. It's their first big hit on Richard Nixon.
L420801 +++$+++ u2339 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ One of the fathers was on the TV saying, "My child was not a bum."  And it's playing like gangbusters.  Hell, Hoover told me one of the girls was a nymph.
L420800 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Jesus Christ!
L420799 +++$+++ u2339 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Four.  Two boys.  Two girls.  And eight wounded.
L420798 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ How many?
L420624 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Don't worry -- I'll use the old Nixon charm on her.
L420623 +++$+++ u2339 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ You need her, Dick -- in '60 she was worth five, six million votes.
L420622 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Uh, wait ...
L420529 +++$+++ u2339 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Make some money, Dick, prove yourself to the Wall Street crowd and let Goldwater and Rockefeller take the fall against Kennedy.
L420528 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Let's get out of here; it's too painful.  I hate it.  We went bowling last weekend.  Next weekend we're going to the zoo. Whoever said there was life after politics was full of shit.
L420527 +++$+++ u2339 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ That'll be the day.
L420526 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ You're the one who should be in politics, John.  You're tougher than I am.  You never crack.
L420525 +++$+++ u2339 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ The Jewboy's a Harvard whore with the morals of an eel -- sells himself to the highest bidder.
L420524 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Well, he seems to have bought Kissinger.
L420523 +++$+++ u2339 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Goes to show you all the moolah in the world can't buy you a brain.
L420522 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Rocky's full of shit!  No way he's going to get nominated west of the Hudson with a new wife.  He's gonna be drinking Scotches in retirement at some goddamn country club with the rest of the Republicans.
L420485 +++$+++ u2339 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ What the hell -- I love her.  And she's great in bed.
L420484 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Talks all day, too!  How the hell can you put up with her, John?
L420483 +++$+++ u2339 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ It's a thing she does.  She talks at night.
L420482 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ You mean smashed!  She called up at midnight last week.  Talking a bunch of crap.  Pat can't stand her.
L420481 +++$+++ u2339 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Sorry, Dick.  She's a little tipsy.
L420244 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ When they know you've got something to protect, that's when they fuck you!
L420243 +++$+++ u2339 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Hiss was protecting his wife.  I've always believed that.
L420242 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ But I wouldn't have if Hiss hadn't lied about knowing Chambers.  The documents were old and out of date, like these Pentagon Papers.  The key thing we proved was that Hiss was a liar.  Then people bought it that he was a spy.  It's the lie that gets you.
L420241 +++$+++ u2339 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ And Dick beat the shit out of them.
L420240 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ You remember, John, in '48 -- no one believed Alger Hiss was a communist. Except me.  They loved Hiss just like they loved this Ellsberg character. East Coast, Ivy League.  He was their kind.  I was dirt to them.  Nothing.
L420239 +++$+++ u2339 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ The lie?
L420235 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ You know, this kinda thing, you gotta be brutal.  A leak happens, the whole damn place should be fired.  Really. You do it like the Germans in World War II.  If they went through these towns and a sniper hit one of them, they'd line the whole goddamned town up and say: "Until you talk you're all getting shot."  I really think that's what has to be done.  I don't think you can be Mr. Nice-guy anymore ...
L420234 +++$+++ u2339 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ It was illegal, what he did.
L420220 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ ... but it's not, bottom-line, gonna change a goddamn thing, John.  The question is: How do we screw Ellsberg so bad it puts the fear of God into all leakers?
L420219 +++$+++ u2339 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ We can prosecute the New York Times, go for an injunction ...
L420720 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ ... Any information you have, Edgar. The sonofabitch is not gonna steal from me again!  Can you back me up on this?  Can I count on your support?
L420719 +++$+++ u2347 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ TOLSON +++$+++ ... Use his women.
L420718 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ I wanna fight just as dirty as he does.
L420717 +++$+++ u2347 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ TOLSON +++$+++ ... Somebody should shoot the little bastard.
L420695 +++$+++ u2347 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ TOLSON +++$+++ Mr. Nixon.
L420694 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Edgar, wonderful to see you.  Clyde ... hi.
L420675 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ ... but it was all we had.
L420674 +++$+++ u2347 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ TOLSON +++$+++ But it was all we had.
L420671 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ You all know me.  I'm one of you, I grew up a stone's throw from here on a little lemon ranch in Yorba Linda ...
L420670 +++$+++ u2347 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ TOLSON +++$+++ ... give me a break, Mary.
L421017 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ But change always comes slowly.  I've withdrawn more than half the troops. I'm trying to cut the military budget for the first time in thirty years.  I want an all-volunteer army.  But it's also a question of American credibility, our position in the world ...
L421016 +++$+++ u2345 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ STUDENT 2 +++$+++ Come on, man -- Vietnam ain't Germany. It doesn't threaten us.  It's a civil war between the Vietnamese.
L421011 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ That man up there lived in similar times.  He had chaos and civil war and hatred between the races ... Sometimes I go to the Lincoln Room at the White House and just pray.  You know, the liberals act like idealism belongs to them, but it's not true.  My family went Republican because Lincoln freed the slaves.  My grandmother was an abolitionist.  It was Quakers who founded Whittier, my hometown, to abolish slavery.  They were conservative Bible folk, but they had a powerful sense of right and wrong ... Forty years ago I was looking, as you are now, for answers.  But you know, ending the war and cleaning up the air and the cities, feeding the poor -- my mother used to feed hobos stopping over at our house - none of it is going to satisfy the spiritual hunger we all have, finding a meaning to this life ...
L421010 +++$+++ u2345 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ STUDENT 2 +++$+++ What you have to understand, Mr. Nixon, is that we are willing to die for what we believe in.
L421003 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Right, right.  I used to play a little ball myself at Whittier.  Of course, they used me as a tackling dummy.
L421002 +++$+++ u2345 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ STUDENT 2 +++$+++ Ernie Davis.
L421001 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ The Orangemen!  Now there's a football program.  Jim Brown.  And that other tailback ... The one with the blood disease ...
L421000 +++$+++ u2345 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ STUDENT 2 +++$+++ Syracuse.
L420999 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Where you from?
L420998 +++$+++ u2345 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ STUDENT 2 +++$+++ You're shittin' me.
L420997 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Hi, I'm Dick Nixon.
L420567 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ She must be very attractive.  Would she like an autograph?  She might remember me ... Where's Trini?
L420566 +++$+++ u2344 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Yeah, she lives in Dallas ...
L420565 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Uh, is your mother ... still alive?
L420564 +++$+++ u2344 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ ... but it depends on what I'm doing to the music, Dick ...
L420563 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Oh yeah, he's good.
L420562 +++$+++ u2344 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Elvis I like, too.
L420561 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
L420560 +++$+++ u2344 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ I like jazz ...
L420559 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ What kind of, uh ... music do you like?
L420558 +++$+++ u2344 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
L420557 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ ... I don't really know you yet, Sandy ... What do you like?  I mean, what kind of clothes do you like?  Do you like blue ... red?
L420550 +++$+++ u2344 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Oh yeah ... she really is ... wholesome.
L420549 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ That's Julie ... and that's Tricia. She, uh, reminds me a little bit of you ...
L420548 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Hello ...
L420547 +++$+++ u2344 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Hi.
L421024 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Maybe I am.
L421023 +++$+++ u2348 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ YOUNG WOMAN +++$+++ It sounds like you're talking about a wild animal.
L421022 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ No, no.  I'm not powerless.  Because ... because I understand the system. I believe I can control it.  Maybe not control it totally.  But ... tame it enough to make it do some good.
L421021 +++$+++ u2348 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ YOUNG WOMAN +++$+++ Then what's the point?  What's the point of being president?  You're powerless.
L421020 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ There's a lot more at stake here than what you want.  Or even what I want ...
L421019 +++$+++ u2348 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ YOUNG WOMAN +++$+++ Someone wants it ...  You can't stop it, can you?  Even if you wanted to.  Because it's not you. It's the system.  And the system won't let you stop it ...
L421015 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ I know.  I know.  I've seen a lot of kids die, too, in World War II.
L421014 +++$+++ u2348 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ YOUNG WOMAN +++$+++ No, we don't!  You're full of shit! You say you want to end the war, so why don't you?  My brother died over there last November.  Why?  What good was his death?
L421005 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Yes, I understand that.
L421004 +++$+++ u2348 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ YOUNG WOMAN +++$+++ We didn't come here to talk about football.  We came here to end the war.
L421466 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ ... and get rid of all these "goddamns" and "Jesus Christs"!
L421465 +++$+++ u2349 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ ZIEGLER +++$+++ Or we could write "expletive deleted."
L421461 +++$+++ u2349 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ ZIEGLER +++$+++ Well, we could delete it.
L421460 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ And this?!  Good Lord, have you lost your mind?  Nixon can't say this. "Niggers"!
L421429 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Now some people, we both know them, Al, think you can go stand in the middle of the bullring and cry, "Mea culpa, mea culpa," while the crowd is hissing and booing and spitting on you.  But a man doesn't cry.  I don't cry.  You don't cry ... You fight!
L421428 +++$+++ u2349 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ ZIEGLER +++$+++ No, sir ...
L421427 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ There's more ... there's more than just me.  You can't break, my boy, even when there's nothing left.  You can't admit, even to yourself, that it's gone, Al.  Do you think those POWs in there did?
L421416 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Fire him.
L421415 +++$+++ u2349 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ ZIEGLER +++$+++ Yes, yes.
L421414 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Of them.
L421413 +++$+++ u2349 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ ZIEGLER +++$+++ Sir?
L421412 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Proud?
L421411 +++$+++ u2349 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ ZIEGLER +++$+++ Compassionate.  Grateful.
L421410 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ So I'm supposed to be ...
L421409 +++$+++ u2349 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ ZIEGLER +++$+++ POWs.  And their families.
L421408 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ What's in there?
L421407 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ What I know about this country, I ... I could rip it apart.  If they want a public humiliation, that's what they'll get.  But I will never resign this office.  Where the fuck am I?
L421406 +++$+++ u2349 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ ZIEGLER +++$+++ That's right.
L421405 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Shit, plenty of people did their best writing in prison.  Gandhi, Lenin ...
L421400 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ They sell tickets to an impeachment. Like a fucking circus ... Okay, so they impeach me.  Then it's a question of mathematics.  How many votes do we have in the Senate?
L421399 +++$+++ u2349 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ ZIEGLER +++$+++ Sir?
L421398 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ You know, Fred, they sell tickets.
L421182 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Who the fuck are they?  Bob, are you working on revoking the Posts's television license?  Good.
L421181 +++$+++ u2349 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ ZIEGLER +++$+++ Bernstein.
L421126 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Gentlemen, I go now to discover the exact length, width and depth of the shaft.
L421125 +++$+++ u2349 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ ZIEGLER +++$+++ No, they want you, Mr. President.  I really think it would be a good move.
L421123 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ The hell with 'em.
L421122 +++$+++ u2349 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ ZIEGLER +++$+++ Mr. President, the press guys asked if you could come back for a minute.
L420820 +++$+++ u2340 +++$+++ m150 +++$+++ NIXON +++$+++ Tell 'em what you like; they'll never understand it anyway.
