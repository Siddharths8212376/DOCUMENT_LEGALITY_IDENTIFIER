L267200 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ You know she has no feet!  You want him to abandon his mother, who has no husband, who has no money of her own, who has no feet?
L267199 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Still lives with his mother.
L267198 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Not true.
L267197 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You're the only woman he ever took out.
L267196 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ That's an interesting piece of news.
L267195 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ A fairy--a queer.  Everybody in the building knows he's a queer.
L267194 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ A what kind of doctor?
L267193 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ A vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor.
L267192 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Thank you, kind sir.
L267191 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ If you have to go out with some guy--can't he be more like Dad?  Herb Shuttle and Norbert Woodly-- can't you do better than those two freaks?
L267190 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Not even Mutual of Omaha thinks so anymore.
L267189 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ He's alive!
L267188 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ He's a ghost!
L267187 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You're married!  You've already got a husband!
L267186 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Oh, Paul--
L267185 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Stay home tonight!
L267184 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I know.
L267183 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Maybe he'll come back tonight! It's his birthday.
L267182 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I told you this was a simple-minded play.
L267181 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ He's coming back, Mom!  He's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived.
L267180 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ And this is my son, Paul.  He was only four years old when his father disappeared.
L267721 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ No!
L267720 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ He is my father.
L267719 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ He isn't?
L267718 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ He isn't any friend of Father.
L267717 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I didn't get his name.  A friend of your father?
L267285 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Maybe it's supposed to end now. Maybe God wouldn't have it any other way.
L267284 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It came yesterday.  I haven't opened it yet.
L267237 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Keeps fairies away!
L267236 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I hate that thing.
L267233 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ It's jungle rot!  This room is making everybody sick!  This is your family doctor speaking now.  Here--I brought you something else to hang on your wall, for the sake of variety.
L267232 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It's fine!
L267231 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ How's the fungus around your thumbnail?
L267230 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Don't worry about it.
L267229 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I apologize.  But you didn't know him, and neither did I.  How's your asthma?
L267228 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ My father!
L267227 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat.
L267226 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Everything stays as it is!
L267221 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Oh?
L267220 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ We don't have a maid any more.
L267214 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ You're going out?
L267213 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You're taking Mom out tonight?
L267212 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Peace, everybody--Paul, Penelope.
L268120 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ He's the most wonderful guy I ever met, Penelope.  He's the most complicated guy I ever met.  I can't believe it, but he's going to take me to Africa with him.
L268119 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ You and Harold are friends?
L267663 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Well--it was nice while it lasted. Thanks for the memories.
L267662 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ It's true.
L267657 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ What's so wonderful if I lost the sale?  You poor kid.
L267656 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ You were wonderful.
L267655 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ I didn't make my move fast enough. That's it, isn't it?  I was too respectful.
L267654 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I'm saying no--and thank you.
L267653 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ You're saying no.
L267652 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Thank you, Herb.  You're a wonderful man.  You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League.
L267651 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Marry me instead.
L267650 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L267649 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ I feel as though I had been made a perfect chump of.
L267648 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ A week.  We were waiting for the right time to--
L267647 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ How long has this been going on?
L267646 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Possibly.
L267635 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ We got a birthday cake, kid.  Did you see the cake?
L267634 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ What's the matter now?
L267388 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon.
L267387 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ What was it?
L267386 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ He said one other thing.  It wasn't very nice.
L267385 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ We've got to find him.  I want you to show me exactly where you saw him last.  And you stay here, Norbert, in case he comes home.  That's all he said--the thing about the key?
L267384 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Before he started to run.  He said his father carried a key to this apartment around his neck--and someday we'd all hear the sound of that key in the door.
L267383 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Did you talk to Paul?
L267380 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ They had this cake somebody else hadn't picked up.  It says, "Happy Birthday, Somebody Else."
L267379 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ How nice.
L267378 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ For Harold.  When Paul comes home, we can have some birthday cake.
L267377 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ A what?
L267376 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Then I saw this bakery store that was still open, so I bought a birthday cake.
L267375 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ You figure!
L267374 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ I figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another.
L267373 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is!
L267372 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ The park!
L267371 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park.
L267370 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Is he coming home?
L267369 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Far as I know.
L267368 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Is he all right?
L267367 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Yeah.
L267366 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Did you see him?
L267328 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ We could have had some kind of birthday party for him.  We could have taken Paul to the fight with us.
L267327 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ What then?
L267294 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Seven jaguars' skins, I'm told. Harold shot every one.  Shall we go?
L267293 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Beautiful!  I've never seen that coat.
L267292 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Gentlemen!  Is this right for a fight?  It's been so long.
L267277 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Women are always late.  You'll find out.
L267276 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Coming.
L267267 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Good night.
L267266 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ If you'll pardon the expression, that's when you'll see the fur and feathers fly.  Good night.
L267265 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I see.
L267264 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ That's when I'll get my confidence back.
L267263 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I'm touched.
L267262 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ When Harold is definitely out of the picture, Penelope, when I don't have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or Paul wrong.  I'm going to ask you to be my wife.
L267261 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ This conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before Harold was declared legally dead.
L267260 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Something happens to my confidence.
L267259 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Yes?
L267258 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ You don't wrestle if you don't have supreme confidence, and I wrestled. But when I get with you, and I say to myself, "My God--here I am with the wife of Harold Ryan, one of the great heroes of all time--"
L267257 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I don't want to go to Vanderbilt.
L267256 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ If you want to wrestle, you got Lehigh.  If you want to play tennis, you go to Vanderbilt.
L267255 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I know.
L267254 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ I was captain of the wrestling team at Lehigh University.
L267253 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I'm glad.
L267252 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ All through the day I'm so confident.  That's why I'm such a good salesman, you know?  I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence.  People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman.  They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year.  I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence.  That's what charges them up.
L267251 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ That's something I suppose.
L267250 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ He'd assume we had.
L267249 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong, you know.
L267248 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.
L267247 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Doing what?
L267246 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ I keep having this nightmare--that he catches us.
L267244 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I'll get ready, Herb.  I didn't expect you this soon.  Please--won't everybody be nice to everybody else while I'm gone?
L267243 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ He's not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom.
L267242 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Please--
L268322 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Goodbye.
L268321 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Do it!
L268307 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ You fake!  You're no better than the dumbest general in the Pentagon.  You're not going to beat Harold. You're not going to beat anybody. You're not going to stay here, either--yammering and taunting until you're most gloriously killed. Go home!
L268306 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Everything's going to be beautiful.
L268257 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Oh--look at the poor, crucified violin, would you?
L268256 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ You fool, you fool.
L268255 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ It's really that bad?
L268254 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Get out of here.
L267826 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Thanks.
L267825 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Tell her to have a nice trip.
L267824 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I'm taking her to the airport a few minutes from now.  She's going to East St. Louis--to visit an aunt.
L267804 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I believe in miracles now.
L267803 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Thank you.  Thank you very much.
L267709 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ How neat.  How keen.
L267708 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ We met here earlier this evening.
L267707 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ You know each other?
L267364 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ He'd go to a movie.  I think that's what he'd do.  If I were sure he was in a movie, I could stop worrying.  We could have him paged.
L267363 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ That's been said before.
L267362 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ It's a jungle out there.
L267361 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ No.  But he's going to be.  If he is in the park and he comes out safely on the other side, I can say to him, "You and I are the only men with balls enough to walk through the park at midnight."  On that we can build.
L267360 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ He's not your son.
L267359 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ If he is in the park, luck is all that can save him now, and there's plenty of that.
L267358 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ We've got to rescue him.
L267357 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.
L267356 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Paul's only twelve years old.
L267355 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ They didn't murder me.
L267354 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ And maybe Paul.  What about the murderers?  They're in there!
L267353 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Me, too.  I know something not even the police know--what's in the park at midnight.  Nothing.  Or, when I'm in there, there's me in there. Fear and nobody and me.
L267352 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I'm amazed.
L267351 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ To show myself how brave I am.  The issue's in doubt, you know--since I'm always for peace--
L267350 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Why would you do that?
L267349 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Every night, Penelope, for the past two years, I've made it a point to walk through the park at midnight.
L267348 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Meaning?
L267347 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I'd be dead by now if that were the case.
L267346 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ It's suicide!
L267345 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I wish Paul luck.
L267344 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ No!  Oh no!  Three people murdered in there in the last six weeks! The police won't even go in there any more.
L267343 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ If you warned him against it as much as you say, it's almost a certainty.
L267342 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ He told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was. He made Eagle Scout when he was twenty-nine years old.  Oh, Norbert--promise me that Paul has not gone into the park!
L267341 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ What kind of a life is that?
L267340 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ It's an experimental model.  He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition.
L267339 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ The what?
L267338 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ That's the XKE.
L267337 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ We've got to dump Shuttle.  He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates?
L267336 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ The only thing I ever told him about life was, "Keep out of the park after the sun goes down."
L267335 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ After this explosion, I think, he'll be able to accept the fact that his mother is going to marry again.
L267334 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ As long as he keeps out of the park.
L267333 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ The wilder Paul is tonight, the calmer he'll be tomorrow.
L267332 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ It is?
L267331 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ This is very good for us.
L267323 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Tonight's the night.
L267322 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I never knew when to hold it--or who to ask, or what to say.
L267297 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Wear a coat of domestic mink.  For the love of God, though, Penelope, don't lightheartedly advertise that the last of the jaguars died for you.
L267296 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ What?
L267295 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Oh no!  Wear a coat of cotton--wear a coat of wool.
L267235 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ No doubt Paul thinks it stinks.
L267234 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ "War is not healthy for children and other living things." How lovely.
L267225 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Throw out all this junk.  Burn it! This room crawls with tropical disease.
L267224 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ They made her so sleepy she couldn't work.
L267223 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I'm glad somebody finally cried. Every time I come in here and see all this unnecessary death, I want to cry.  I don't cry, of course.  Not manly, you know.  Did she try antihistamines?
L267222 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ The animals made her sneeze and cry too much.
L267219 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ She quit this afternoon.
L267218 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I must take you to an emergency ward sometime--on a Saturday night. That's also fun.  I came to see Selma, as a matter of fact.
L267217 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ We made the date three months ago.
L267216 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Take plenty of cigars.
L267215 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.
L267171 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Would you like to say something about killing, Colonel?
L267170 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ I am Dr. Norbert Woodly--a physician, a healer.  I find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society.  Gentleness must replace violence everywhere, or we are doomed.
L267382 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ We can take off the "Wanda June" with a butter knife.
L267381 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ "Happy Birthday, Wanda June!"
L267330 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Then we'd stay home and eat venison or something, and look through the scrapbooks.  I've got a friend who has a whole freezer full of striped bass and caribou meat.  I'm going to bring that boy back.
L267329 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Minors aren't allowed at fights.
L267326 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ I feel like I've been double- crossed.  If you'd just told me it was Harold's birthday--
L267325 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ What a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage.
L267324 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ If he'd just get into scouting, and camp out some, and see how everybody roughhouses around the fire--
L267321 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Don't!  Let him have all the privacy he wants.  Let him grieve, let him rage.  There has never been a funeral for his father.
L267320 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ If he'd just come out for the Little League, the way I asked him, he'd find out we touch all the time--shove each other, slug each other, and just horse around.  I'm going to go get him--
L267319 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ It's good.  Let him go.
L267318 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Kid--kid--
L267291 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ You're preparing him for a career in the slaughterhouses of Dubuque?  Take care of your body, yes!  But don't become a bender of horseshoes and railroad spikes.  Don't become obsessed by your musculature.  Any one of these poor, dead animals here was a thousand times the athlete you can ever hope to be. Their magic was in their muscles. Your magic is in your brains!
L267290 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ You think you're so funny.  You're not even funny.  Right?  Right?  You don't hurt yourself if you start out slow.
L267289 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ He died of a massive rupture.
L267288 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ You ever hear the story about the boy who carried a calf around the barn every day?
L267287 +++$+++ u1248 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WOODLY +++$+++ Maybe God has let everybody who ever lived be reborn--so he or she can see how it ends.  Even Pithecanthropus erectus and Australopithecus and Sinanthropus pekensis and the Neanderthalers are back on Earth--to see how it ends. They're all on Times Square--making change for peepshows.  Or recruiting Marines.
L267286 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ Start with the smallest weights. Every week add a pound or two.
L267283 +++$+++ u1245 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ SHUTTLE +++$+++ You can believe that if you want. I talk to guys like you, and I want to commit suicide.  You get that weight-lifting set I sent you?
