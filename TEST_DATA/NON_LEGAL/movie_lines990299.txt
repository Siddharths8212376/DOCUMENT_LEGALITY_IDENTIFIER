L508166 +++$+++ u7638 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ O'HARA +++$+++ We can save this young woman's life, and imprison a parasite -- all in one gesture.
L508165 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Absolutely not.  I am very sorry, but no.
L509024 +++$+++ u7641 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ Find 'em!
L509023 +++$+++ u7642 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ WILLY +++$+++ Where?
L508975 +++$+++ u7641 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ Okay, so the problem is still the nun outfit, right?
L508974 +++$+++ u7642 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ WILLY +++$+++ We both missed.
L508949 +++$+++ u7641 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ Are you nuts?  She's not a nun.  It's Christy.  She's a babe!
L508948 +++$+++ u7642 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ WILLY +++$+++ She's... she's a nun.
L508937 +++$+++ u7642 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ WILLY +++$+++ She's acting weird, Vince.  Ever since we picked her up.
L508936 +++$+++ u7641 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ And who are you to talk?  You were nothing.  You couldn't even sing.  I must have been out of my mind.
L508933 +++$+++ u7641 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ I love you, Chris.  I always will.  I gave you so much.  My time.  My affection.  A big-time career.  And how do you repay me?  What's the thanks I get?  Where's the loyalty, huh?  Where's the love?
L508932 +++$+++ u7642 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ WILLY +++$+++ She's a nun, Vince.
L508380 +++$+++ u7641 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ Can you hold?  Can you try?
L508379 +++$+++ u7642 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ WILLY +++$+++ It's that call you were expecting, Vince.
L508378 +++$+++ u7641 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ Soon, you gorgeous thing... tell me... how lonely?
L508103 +++$+++ u7641 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ She did.  Bring her back.  Now.  For a talk.
L508102 +++$+++ u7642 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ WILLY +++$+++ I mean, won't she talk? She seemed kind of upset.
L511748 +++$+++ u7643 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ BALTUS +++$+++ He came to me.  He promised great violence.  Said I should cast you out for my own protection.  I must speak honestly.  There is no reason to think he will not meet with success.
L511747 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ How did you hear this?
L511746 +++$+++ u7643 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ BALTUS +++$+++ Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a meeting.  This time he is determined to have you forced out, or worse.
L511595 +++$+++ u7643 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ BALTUS +++$+++ Sarah has gone missing... my servant girl.  Her things are gone.  Damn it. She has joined the migration out of town.  What about breakfast, woman?  Or, am I to starve to death?
L511594 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Um... I... I did not... no.  Why?
L511363 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Well enough.  Your gathering does honor to the deceased.
L511362 +++$+++ u7643 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ BALTUS +++$+++ Hail, Constable.  How are you?
L511339 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ These woods of yours sound a bit crowded, what with all the witches, ghouls and Indians living there.
L511338 +++$+++ u7643 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ BALTUS +++$+++ Must have been the Redman.  A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods.
L511337 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Who took the meat?
L511285 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Then, name one person who has seen him with their own eyes.
L511284 +++$+++ u7643 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ BALTUS +++$+++ Many have.
L511283 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who has seen this Horseman?
L511260 +++$+++ u7643 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ BALTUS +++$+++ This is not a time for frivolity, Katrina, is it?  Am I mistaken?
L511259 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ If we could speak alone.
L511554 +++$+++ u7644 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ BROM +++$+++ I say... if the Horseman is solid enough to take the lives of our people, he's solid enough to feel this...
L511553 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ I hit him square.
L511552 +++$+++ u7644 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ BROM +++$+++ You must have missed your mark.
L511551 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.
L511550 +++$+++ u7644 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ BROM +++$+++ Constable Crane is not the only one who fights with science on his side.
L511447 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Two days... ?  For murder?
L511446 +++$+++ u7644 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ BROM +++$+++ They spend two days in chains.
L511345 +++$+++ u7644 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ BROM +++$+++ Never.  A shoe that size I would have remembered.
L511344 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
L511343 +++$+++ u7644 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ BROM +++$+++ What the hell are you doing?
L511254 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Well, unless your name is Baltus, you should not worry over mine.
L511253 +++$+++ u7644 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ BROM +++$+++ We haven't heard your name yet, friend.
L511250 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Excuse me, Miss...  They have a laugh at your expense.
L511249 +++$+++ u7644 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ BROM +++$+++ Certainly not.
L511843 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ When this cut was made, this person was already dead.  This is not Lady Van Tassel.
L511842 +++$+++ u7645 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ DOCTOR LANCASTER +++$+++ What?
L511841 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ No clotting or gathering of pus.  No healing at all.
L511838 +++$+++ u7645 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ DOCTOR LANCASTER +++$+++ What of it?
L511837 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Stains of blood.
L511836 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Would you stay, doctor?  I may need assistance.
L511835 +++$+++ u7645 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ DOCTOR LANCASTER +++$+++ ... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed.
L511815 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ You will stay at her side?
L511814 +++$+++ u7645 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ DOCTOR LANCASTER +++$+++ It has been a terrible jolt to her nerves.
L511666 +++$+++ u7645 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ DOCTOR LANCASTER +++$+++ You need rest.
L511665 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Bring him.
L511664 +++$+++ u7645 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ DOCTOR LANCASTER +++$+++ You need to sleep.
L511663 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Bring Young Masbath here.
L511662 +++$+++ u7645 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ DOCTOR LANCASTER +++$+++ He is dead.  You would be also, if your wound had not somehow shut.
L511661 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ ... Brom Bones...
L511660 +++$+++ u7645 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ DOCTOR LANCASTER +++$+++ Keep still, Constable.  You were half-drowned when they found you.
L511392 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ In time, doctor.  Soon as I finish.
L511391 +++$+++ u7645 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ DOCTOR LANCASTER +++$+++ I do not care.  You are welcome to use my work area, but I beg you... return her to her resting place.
L511390 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ The wounds are the same.  Cauterized. No chopping or half-measures either. One stroke took the head.  Have you seen, doctor... ?  Even the spinal bone... sliced as smooth as butter.
L511368 +++$+++ u7645 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ DOCTOR LANCASTER +++$+++ A diseased monster.
L511367 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ He is a behemoth.
L511366 +++$+++ u7645 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ DOCTOR LANCASTER +++$+++ The Lenape.  He comes to gawk at civilization from time to time.
L511365 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ What are you spying on?
L511364 +++$+++ u7645 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ DOCTOR LANCASTER +++$+++ We must be a curious sight to him.
L511354 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ This should have bled by the pint. Yet, no blistering or scorched flesh. How... ?  Whatever weapon was used... it cauterized somehow....
L511353 +++$+++ u7645 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ DOCTOR LANCASTER +++$+++ What is that?
L511352 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ No bleeding.
L511342 +++$+++ u7645 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ DOCTOR LANCASTER +++$+++ To place it inside its coffin.
L511341 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Why did you move the body, Doctor?
L511267 +++$+++ u7645 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ DOCTOR LANCASTER +++$+++ I was afraid of this.
L511266 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ I say, is there any one person suspect in these acts?
L511265 +++$+++ u7645 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ DOCTOR LANCASTER +++$+++ Excuse me?
L511264 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ An honor, gentlemen.  In time I will need every detail of the three murderings you've had, but, for now, I ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be?
L511767 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Climb to the top of the tallest ladder you can find, Father.  That is the closest you ever come to God.
L511766 +++$+++ u7646 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ FATHER STEENWYCK +++$+++ You cannot do this.  I am a man of God!
L511765 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ You are so upset now... and yet, you seemed in such good spirits last night.
L511764 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ He may.  But, not soon enough for you, and not on your behalf.
L511763 +++$+++ u7646 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ FATHER STEENWYCK +++$+++ Damn you, sir!  God damn you to hell!
L511762 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Wallowing quite literally in blood.
L511761 +++$+++ u7646 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ FATHER STEENWYCK +++$+++ They need guidance.
L511760 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Wallowing in sin and lust...
L511759 +++$+++ u7646 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ FATHER STEENWYCK +++$+++ I am the Lord's voice in this town.
L511758 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ It is only important what you are. An adulterer...
L511757 +++$+++ u7646 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ FATHER STEENWYCK +++$+++ Are you a deist?  Is that it?  A free thinker who does not believe in divinity.
L511756 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here.
L511755 +++$+++ u7646 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ FATHER STEENWYCK +++$+++ No.  You will not run me out.  No one will believe a word of what you say.
L511754 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Only if I repeat them outside this room.  And, I will if I must...  Out there, for all to hear.  Or... you may speak, as planned.  But, you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures.
L511449 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Does that look like an animal hanging?
L511448 +++$+++ u7646 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ FATHER STEENWYCK +++$+++ For poaching.  Or, would you remake our laws now that Magistrate Philipse has given up the ghost?
L511382 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Then, you should have left two days ago, because I have men willing to help me today.
L511381 +++$+++ u7646 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ FATHER STEENWYCK +++$+++ Your superiors are two days away!
L511380 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Protest to my superiors if you like.
L511379 +++$+++ u7646 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ FATHER STEENWYCK +++$+++ I will not allow it.  I will not!
L511377 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ I cannot proceed without examining the previous victims.
L511376 +++$+++ u7646 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ FATHER STEENWYCK +++$+++ It is sacrilege!
L511272 +++$+++ u7646 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ FATHER STEENWYCK +++$+++ The heads were not found severed. The heads were not found at all.
L511271 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies...
L511270 +++$+++ u7646 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ FATHER STEENWYCK +++$+++ Why not tell us what you have heard? Hmm?  How much have your superiors bothered to tell you?
L511694 +++$+++ u7647 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ HARDENBROOK +++$+++ Well... that might be... helpful.
L511693 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?
L511692 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Master Hardenbrook...
L511691 +++$+++ u7647 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ HARDENBROOK +++$+++ Damn... damn... damn...
L511688 +++$+++ u7647 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ HARDENBROOK +++$+++ A fine idea.
L511687 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Maybe you should take this.
L511686 +++$+++ u7647 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ HARDENBROOK +++$+++ Of course.  You want them... it shall not take long.  Wait here.
L511685 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ May we look at them now?
L511684 +++$+++ u7647 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ HARDENBROOK +++$+++ Hmm?  See them?
L511683 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ May I see them, Master Hardenbrook?
L511681 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Yes, sir... but, do you have these?
L511680 +++$+++ u7647 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ HARDENBROOK +++$+++ I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.
L511679 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Do you have these persons' wills?
L511280 +++$+++ u7647 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ HARDENBROOK +++$+++ When a goblin leaps from the nether world, others follow.  Poltergeists of the air, water and earth follow and cheer his desecrations!
L511279 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Just a moment...  Are you saying it is he?
L511274 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Pardon me?
L511273 +++$+++ u7647 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ HARDENBROOK +++$+++ Taken.  Taken by the Headless Horseman.  Taken back to hell.
L511240 +++$+++ u7648 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ HIGH CONSTABLE +++$+++ Excellent.  Then, you are excused till morning.
L511239 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ I shall, gladly.
L511238 +++$+++ u7648 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ HIGH CONSTABLE +++$+++ Just so.  Granted.  And so you take your experimentations to Sleepy Hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place.  Bring him here to face our good justice. Will you do this for me?
L511237 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Not for lack of trying.
L511236 +++$+++ u7648 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ HIGH CONSTABLE +++$+++ These "methods" of yours... there has been no practical application.
L511235 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Chosen me?
L511234 +++$+++ u7648 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ HIGH CONSTABLE +++$+++ There is a farming community upstate, Constable... ten days journey north in the Hudson Highlands.  It is named Sleepy Hollow.  Within a fortnight, three persons have been murdered there. Each with their head lopped cleanly off.  The elders of the Hollow have sent dispatches to me, requesting assistance, and now, just this very moment, I have chosen you.
L511232 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Not Liberalism.  Equanimity.
L511231 +++$+++ u7648 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ HIGH CONSTABLE +++$+++ For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.
L511230 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
L511229 +++$+++ u7648 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ HIGH CONSTABLE +++$+++ Very few, if any.
L511228 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ But, how many innocents rot here? And, how many victims are buried without reprisal while guilty men roam our streets?
L511227 +++$+++ u7648 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ HIGH CONSTABLE +++$+++ And, <u>with</u> disrespect, Constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure.
L511226 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Without disrespect, look around you.  We overflow.  As do our courts.
L511225 +++$+++ u7648 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ HIGH CONSTABLE +++$+++ Have they nothing to fear presently?
L511224 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence, but if we were more often able to ensure justice, after the fact, then criminals would truly have something to fear from law enforcement.
L511221 +++$+++ u7648 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ HIGH CONSTABLE +++$+++ Must we again hear these heretical rantings?
L511220 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ I could determine if he were dead <u>before</u> he went into the Hudson.
L511219 +++$+++ u7648 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ HIGH CONSTABLE +++$+++ He will be burned pursuant to statutes of health.
L511218 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ There are surgical ways of telling how he died... by the water in his lungs...
L511217 +++$+++ u7648 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ HIGH CONSTABLE +++$+++ He drowned.  Anyone could see.
L511216 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Just a moment... if I may.  It is possible this man was murdered.
L511386 +++$+++ u7651 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KILLIAN +++$+++ It's not something people speak of openly.  She did not remarry.
L511385 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Is that all you say?  Look at her.
L511384 +++$+++ u7651 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KILLIAN +++$+++ The Widow Windsor.
L511374 +++$+++ u7651 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KILLIAN +++$+++ Van Ripper and his wife agreed to take him.  They have children and a good home and good land.
L511373 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Tell me something.  What becomes of Young Masbath?
L511372 +++$+++ u7651 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KILLIAN +++$+++ No, sir, no.  If you ask me, I say you just laid eyes on our murderer through that glass.
L511371 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ More than enough, actually.  I beg you, no more, please.
L511370 +++$+++ u7651 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KILLIAN +++$+++ Master Crane, sir.  I'm glad we have time alone.  You've been told plenty about the Horseman, I'm certain.
L511426 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ At times I do.
L511425 +++$+++ u7654 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ PHILIPSE +++$+++ No, you listen!  You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards...
L511424 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Listen to what you say....
L511421 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ I know it.
L511420 +++$+++ u7654 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ PHILIPSE +++$+++ We are farmers here, not lawyers or bankers, or even constables.  Every penny we earn comes from what we send down the Hudson.
L511419 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Are you saying I should be frightened? Is this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck?
L511418 +++$+++ u7654 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ PHILIPSE +++$+++ Not more than a year ago, a mob hung a man for stealing a horse.  For stealing a horse!  And, you dig up our dead.
L511334 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Well... so much for common sense.
L511333 +++$+++ u7654 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ PHILIPSE +++$+++ My talisman.  It will, protect against the Horseman if I show a brave face.  But, I cannot run.  If I run in fear, it is worthless.
L511332 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ What is that you wear?
L511328 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Believe?
L511327 +++$+++ u7654 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ PHILIPSE +++$+++ ... found the body this morning.  You do believe now, don't you?
L511325 +++$+++ u7654 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ PHILIPSE +++$+++ He would not have gone into the Western Woods.  No sane man would.
L511324 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?
L511323 +++$+++ u7654 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ PHILIPSE +++$+++ And now Jonathan Masbath.
L511322 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ The Van Garretts died first; a man and his son, survived by a wife and two infants.  And the Widow Windsor was next...
L511269 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ The militia?
L511268 +++$+++ u7654 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ PHILIPSE +++$+++ Well, Constable... are you aware... to be honest, you are not what we expected.  We sent for the militia.
L511936 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ Tired.
L511935 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ How are you?
L511902 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ I doubt that's the end.
L511901 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ What now?
L511893 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Take the reins.
L511892 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ What can we do?
L511883 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ I know.  Hold on.
L511882 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ Lady Van Tassel...
L511881 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Climb up!
L511825 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ I cannot.  You should not worry.  Van Ripper and his wife will look after you.  They will.  You will be well cared for.
L511824 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ Take me with you.  There's nothing left for me here.
L511823 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ This is farewell.
L511821 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ You do not know all that has happened.  You cannot understand.
L511820 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ Why... why are you like this?
L511819 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Nothing.  To hell with this place and all the people here.
L511818 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ Won't you change your mind, sir? What can I say to convince you?
L511817 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ I need time for thinking.  Without you hanging on my coattails for a change.
L511816 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ She's the one who controlled the Horseman, isn't she, sir?  Sir? 
L511752 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Things have become complicated. Katrina is at the mill.  Ride ahead, find her and bring her to meet me outside the church.  Find her at all costs.  Quickly.
L511751 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ What now?  Where is she?
L511728 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ But, sir... what books?  Where are they?
L511727 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Fiction plays and novels.  Baltus does not approve.  Now, come.  It may not be long before Lady Van Tassel returns.
L511726 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ What books?
L511725 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.
L511724 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ There are no other doors.  This is as far as she could have gone.
L511720 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ No.  They are all missing.
L511719 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it.  Did you find the victims' loan agreements?
L511718 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ What was she doing?
L511717 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Lady Van Tassel.
L511716 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ I was getting worried.  Who was it?
L511714 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ There are none for Magistrate Philipse either.  "Paasch, James" "Pieter, Thomas" "Pos, William."
