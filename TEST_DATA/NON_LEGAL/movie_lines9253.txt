L370443 +++$+++ u2015 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ I'll see you at mass tomorrow. We'll sit down and we'll discuss the whole thing.
L370442 +++$+++ u2016 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ VIRGINIA +++$+++ Tommy!
L370438 +++$+++ u2016 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ VIRGINIA +++$+++ Tommy, I promised the babysitter six o'clock.
L370437 +++$+++ u2015 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ Marty, I don't know how to tell you how much I appreciate what you and your mother are doing, because the kinda thing was happening in our house was Virginia was in the kitchen making some milk for the baby. So my mother comes in...
L370414 +++$+++ u2015 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ How's Marty been lately, Aunt Theresa?
L370413 +++$+++ u2016 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ VIRGINIA +++$+++ That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
L370400 +++$+++ u2016 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ VIRGINIA +++$+++ We want you to do a very big favor for us, Aunt Theresa.
L370399 +++$+++ u2015 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ Okay.
L370398 +++$+++ u2016 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ VIRGINIA +++$+++ Lemme tell it, Tommy.
L370397 +++$+++ u2015 +++$+++ m130 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ Well, I'll tell you, Aunt Theresa...
L371642 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Didn't recognize you, Red. When you get the clamp all the way down, open it as wide as you can and see if you can close it on the artery.
L371641 +++$+++ u2017 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DAGO RED +++$+++ What do I do with it Hawk? This is a little out of my line.
L371619 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ He'll live if that's what you mean. But somebody better be around when he comes to and finds out there's nothing left between his legs.
L371618 +++$+++ u2017 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DAGO RED +++$+++ Nice looking kid. Going to be okay?
L371279 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Just use common sense. Your job is preventing sin, and the way to do that is give him your best Cross Action.
L371278 +++$+++ u2017 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DAGO RED +++$+++ I believe it takes both. I'd have to look it up.
L371277 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ What is, Red, the intention or the act?
L371276 +++$+++ u2017 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DAGO RED +++$+++ I don't think I can give absolution to a man who's about to commit suicide. It's a mortal sin.
L371275 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Put in one of your fixes. Walt knows he's loused himself with the Church, but it's part of our plan to make him think he has the keys to the kingdom. Which he will think if you grease the skids for him.
L371274 +++$+++ u2017 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DAGO RED +++$+++ What do you want me to do?
L371271 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ He's parted his moorings.
L371270 +++$+++ u2017 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DAGO RED +++$+++ You talked to Walt?
L371269 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ How they goin', Losing Preacher? What do you hear from the Pope?
L371222 +++$+++ u2017 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DAGO RED +++$+++ Well, sure, but I'm also worried about Walt Waldowski – Painless. His poker players got in an argument and asked him for a ruling, and he said what difference did it make, it was just a card game.
L371221 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ We wanted to tell you how you were helping us with your fixes.
L371212 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I don't care about the intention. I just know your Cross Action is a plus on our side. I've seen it come through four times.
L371211 +++$+++ u2017 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DAGO RED +++$+++ There's sort of a built-in prayer for the sick man to get well, but of course that's not the basic intention.
L371810 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Sure, you just blindfold him first and tie him to a stake.
L371809 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Stop him! Stop that man!
L371369 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Hey, that's great, Henry! Good thinking!
L371368 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Well...  I was going to name you Chief Surgeon...  To consult on both shifts, yours and Frank's.
L371367 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ What are you going to do with him?
L371157 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ You fixing to add overtime to a twelve- hour day? The union ain't gonna like it.
L371156 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ You boys'll have to go to work early.
L371154 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ How you, Radar?
L371153 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Yes, O'Reilly?
L371142 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I have been in this Army a long time. I know just what you guys are up to. But there are limits...
L371141 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Yeah, maybe move that nurse in. She don't seem the type to keep you awake praying.
L371021 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Just one for a start.
L371020 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I may need you to go to work practically immediately. But meanwhile perhaps you'd like to meet some of your fellow officers.
L371017 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ They've hit us on Cherry Hill. I just got word. We have our slack periods but when the action starts, you'll have more work in twelve hours than a civilian surgeon does in a week.
L371016 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Never this close.
L371015 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Good. You've both been working close to the front.
L371014 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ They give you copies to burn.
L371013 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ You're welcome to one of these, whatever they are.
L371012 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Reckon so, but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite.
L371011 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Don't you know the first thing you're supposed to do at a new post is present yourself to the commanding officer with your orders?
L371010 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Y'all were short a couple cutters and we're what the Army sent.
L371881 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Four goddam months. And they don't even give you time off for good behavior.
L371880 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Y'all mind the store.
L371823 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Hell, no, all you did was knock the wind out of him. But he won't be playing any more football today.
L371822 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ You really think we hurt him that bad?
L371821 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Well, he's taken care of. Scratch one hot dog.
L371748 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Or her figger.
L371747 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ It certainly isn't Henry's fault Hot Lips Houlihan doesn't like her name.
L371707 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ There's only one way.
L371706 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Okay, I'm a witness, but how do you prove who's right?
L371700 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ I've always had a hankering for blonde pussy myself. My wife's hair is a wonderful golden yellow, and this time of year it gets even lighter.
L371699 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ She had this shiny black hair piled up on her head, but later on she let it hang loose and I'll be damned if it didn't come all the way down to her ass.
L371624 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Not enough to be a pro.
L371623 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ I don't know what else. You've been that route a little, haven't you?
L371622 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Epidural hematoma?
L371621 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Look at that right eye.
L371620 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Pulse, slow, very little pressure.
L371255 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ He said it for us all, Walt.
L371254 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Miss you, Walt.
L371252 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Pour one for Painless.
L371251 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ How you, Walt? We was just fixing to have a nightcap.
L371186 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Where you think you are, boy? They probably never seen a olive in this country.
L371185 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Don't you use olives?
L371181 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ No.  Or why you should.
L371180 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?
L371179 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Back home.
L371178 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Which hospital?
L371177 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Hospital.
L371176 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Where?
L371175 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ That's right.
L371174 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ I mean, what were you doing? Were you a resident or on a staff someplace?
L371173 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Home.
L371172 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Now I got you for a witness, I'm going to try again. So far all I dragged out of him is he's from Bahston and he's only been in the Army two months.  Where were you when they drafted you?
L371864 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ No, Ho-Jon, we're not going to open you up.
L371863 +++$+++ u2023 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HO-JON +++$+++ You – must – open – me – up – again?
L371412 +++$+++ u2023 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HO-JON +++$+++ That's okay. Live a little, learn a little.
L371411 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ I don't think I should have opened my big mouth. Sorry, Ho-Jon.
L371103 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Good, because we got a fine old American custom we want to teach you. You know what these are?
L371102 +++$+++ u2023 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HO-JON +++$+++ I have great interest for America, his peoples and his custom.
L371101 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Hey, you been sneaking some reading outside the frigging Bible!
L371100 +++$+++ u2023 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HO-JON +++$+++ Because is not democrash? All peoples created equal?
L371124 +++$+++ u2019 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ ...No cases over the age of temptation but deliver us eight. from evil. For Thine is the kingdom, the power and...
L371123 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Us. Lead us not into...
L371118 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ You make a mean martini, kid.
L371117 +++$+++ u2019 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ So long, Ho-Jon.
L371114 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Same general idea.
L371113 +++$+++ u2019 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Wisconsin.
L371112 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ The door, Frank, the door! Where you from anyhow, Alaska?
L371111 +++$+++ u2019 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I don't believe it's right for you to involve a boy who's not seventeen years old yet...
L371108 +++$+++ u2019 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I don't drink intoxicants.
L371107 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ But first will you please kindly shut the goddam door?
L371052 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Where's he gonna use that kind of talk? 'The valley of the shadow of death.' Wait a minute, Ho-Jon...  I got something for you.
L371051 +++$+++ u2019 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ This is Ho-Jon, my houseboy. Our houseboy. I'm teaching him English.
L371050 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ What the hell's going on here?
L371049 +++$+++ u2019 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Thou. For Thou art with me.  Welcome, welcome, welcome!
L371876 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Perfectionist.
L371875 +++$+++ u2033 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ SPEARCHUCKER +++$+++ There might be another tiny piece we missed. I want to look around before we close up.
L371874 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ What's there to do? You found the sliver.
L371873 +++$+++ u2033 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ SPEARCHUCKER +++$+++ You mind if we get out of this guy's brain first?
L371835 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ And get ourselves another touchdown to win.  I wish to hell we knew what they were plotting.
L371834 +++$+++ u2033 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ SPEARCHUCKER +++$+++ We got to stop them right here.
L371800 +++$+++ u2033 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ SPEARCHUCKER +++$+++ When he sees a little running room, he likes to make a show... you know, stutter steps and cross-overs and all that jazz. Also he never learned to button up when he gets hit, so if you two can get a good shot at him once, you can hurt him.
L371799 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ What?
L371928 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Like the Spearchucker said, that's possible. Anyway, it's been an interesting association.
L371927 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Let's hear from you, you goddam Yankee. Be nice to see you some time.
L371918 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Plus running the opium concession for the whole Eighth Army.
L371917 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Hell, man, that don't matter. We're loaded. We were big wheels in the black market in Seoul.
L371899 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Screw it. We been earning our keep as respectable knife artists. Why should we do work any pill-rolling punk could handle?
L371898 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ But no short-arm inspection. I'm with you there.
L371897 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ We got to start rehabilitating, Duke, if we want to be halfway human by the time we get back to our wives.
L371896 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ I thought we were heading for trouble putting on all these trinkets.
L371879 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I looked. Suspicious bastards got them all locked up.
L371878 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ We could steal one of the choppers.
L371877 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ There's no transportation anyway this time of night.
L371872 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Be right with you.
L371871 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Any time. Whenever we want.
L371870 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ When?
L371869 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Henry's got our orders! We're going home!
L371853 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Same here. You can retire my number.
L371852 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Me, too. Y'all just seen me play my last game.
L371817 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Yeah, if I can.
L371816 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Don't try to get it far down. Kick it up high so we can get there and surround that son-ofa-bitch.
L371806 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I don't think I could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer.
L371805 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Look at the size of those two beasts.
L371776 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Don't tell me about your problems, boy. Explain them to Ho-Jon.
L371775 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Now wait a minute, Hawkeye. I come a long way, learning to put up with a couple of crazy Yankees, but...
L371770 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I worked with Spearchucker my first month over here, at the 72nd Evac in Taegu. Most of the colored guys know who he is but they're not talking because he asked them not to.
L371769 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ How come nobody knows about him? And you do?
L371766 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ The nigra boy with the Philadelphia Eagles?
L371765 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.
L371764 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Never heard of him.
L371761 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ All three of us played for our schools. And there are at least four other guys...
L371760 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Where the hell we going to get us a football team?
L371705 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ You got yourself a bet, Georgia boy.  You're a witness.
L371704 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ I not only say it, I'll back it up twenty buck's worth.
L371703 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ How can you say a thing like that about an officer in the United States Army?
L371702 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ You know damn well I nearly puke when I look at her. I don't even think she's a real blonde.
L371701 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ I guess that's why you go for Hot Lips Houlihan.
L371694 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ An application to Androscoggin College.
L371693 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ What's he got to write, for God's sake?
L371692 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ When will he be able to write?
L371408 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ A native is someone who is born in a particular place.
L371407 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Never mind. Forget it.
L371403 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Good thinking, Duke. How about it, Ho-Jon? Can you round up a few of the boys?
L371402 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Hail to the chief! We-all got a responsibility, men. He's crowned like a king ought to be, but he can't just walk to the Mess Hall by himself. He has to be carried by native bearers.
L371364 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ This time he did it to a kid who's simple enough to believe him. Why don't you dump the mother, Henry? He creates more work than he gets done.
L371363 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ That there Frank Burns is a menace. Whenever a patient croaks on him it's either God's will or somebody else's fault.
L371250 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Get out the scotch, Ho-Jon.  Don't mention the sex thing unless he brings it up.
L371249 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Y'all just act natural.
L371215 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ What do you think, Trapper?
L371214 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Not without lots of praying and kissing the dice.  It's a different ritual but it works the same.
L371213 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ And you've had a natural four times in a row in a crap game. Right? Does that mean...?
L371206 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Call Dago Red.
L371205 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ This kid looks like a loser. Maybe we better get the bead-jiggler to put in a fix.
L371203 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Way we hear it, the Pride is supposed to have run up the highest lifetime batting average ever recorded in Wayne County.
L371202 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Best equipped dentist in the whole goddam Army. Care to have a look, a man with your background?
L371199 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Nice guy, for an enamel surgeon.
L371198 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ You met him. Walt Waldowski, the Dental Officer.
L371197 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Must be Painlees Pole Day in the Shower Tent.
L371191 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ We didn't have a chance, little Androscoggin College against the Big Green, but there was this blizzard and we held then nothing nothing till the last twenty seconds. Then this great passer of theirs let one go, snow and all...
L371190 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Sixteen times.
L371189 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Jesus to Jesus and eight hands around! Duke, did I ever tell you how I beat Dartmouth by intercepting a pass?
L371151 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ And it's the ninth inning.
L371150 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ This outfit needs somebody who can find his way around the pulmonary anatomy when the bases are loaded.
L371149 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Yeah, that's right.  You better get us a chest-cutter before there's trouble.
L371148 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ The chest-cutter.
L371147 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ What's that?
L371146 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Except we forgot one other small thing.
L371145 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ No, Hawkeye just said it all.
L371137 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ We sure don't aim to cause any trouble... Yeah, she seems to grow on you.
L371136 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ We've stuck it out for a whole week now... Pretty girl.
L371110 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ We been had.
L371109 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Christ Almighty, I think he means it!
L371094 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ So we got to cut him fast. I figure from the X-ray it ain't just the spleen. We also got to snatch his right kidney.
L371093 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ He can't take much more time on the table.
L371092 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Now that's what I call real pretty. We can close up here and go into his belly.
L371062 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Nothing can't wait. Shall we check it out with the Major?
L371061 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ This kid's ready but we won't know all the damage till we get in and see what's happened. What have you got?
L371055 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ And gets the wind every time it opens. No, thanks. I'll take that one.
L371054 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Well, southern boy, I suppose you want the sack that's convenient to the door.
L371053 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Little light reading matter. Just right for his age.
L371019 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ That's right, pal. You just sit up front and sign the mail, and leave the cutting to us.
L371018 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Colonel Blake, have no fear. Hawkeye and Duke are here.
L371007 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Finest kind. We'll sit where we can get the best view.
L371006 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ What do you think of that piece of scenery, Yankee boy?
L371005 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ The spot we picked to spend the winter. Maybe we ought to look a little harder.
L371004 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Well, there it is. Jesus!
L371002 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ I done my shopping in Seoul last night.
L371001 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Must be the Famous Curb Service Whore –  House. You in the market Duke?
L371000 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ Shore Patrol, Duke. Let's go!
L370999 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ What's the initials 'MP' stand for, Hawkeye?
L370997 +++$+++ u2021 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HAWKEYE +++$+++ We got to head them off, right at the start. Push them around first.
L370996 +++$+++ u2018 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ C.O. is Colonel Blake. Lieutenant Colonel Henry Braymore Blake. One of them regular army clowns. Push you around so it's hard to get any decent work done.
