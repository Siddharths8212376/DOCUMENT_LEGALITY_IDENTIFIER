L99413 +++$+++ u4174 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Andrew loved this old cabin.  He always dreamed about moving to Tahiti -- living in a hut and becoming a beach-bum.  I could never imagine myself doing that -- but somehow when he talked about it, he made it sound so alive - - so wonderful.  Soft ocean breezes and beautiful sunsets -- leaving the world and it's problems behind.  I wish he'd had a chance to do it.
L99412 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Yeah.
L99410 +++$+++ u4174 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ No -- not at the office.  I've got a better idea.
L99409 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Great.  I'll see you at the office at nine.
L99408 +++$+++ u4174 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Yes -- she did.
L99407 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow.
L99406 +++$+++ u4174 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Hi, Frank.
L99405 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Hi.  It's Frank.
L99404 +++$+++ u4174 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Hello?
L99397 +++$+++ u4174 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Not true.  Shall I tell you what you were thinking?  You were wondering if I was wearing anything under my skirt.
L99396 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Nothing.
L99393 +++$+++ u4174 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Tastes can change.
L99392 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ It's not my taste.
L99391 +++$+++ u4174 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ That's not an answer.
L99390 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Oh -- Well, they're different.
L99389 +++$+++ u4174 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ I'm the photographer.
L99388 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ I think the photographer's probably a voyeur.
L99387 +++$+++ u4174 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ What do you think?
L99385 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ No -- it just doesn't look right.
L99384 +++$+++ u4174 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Is it against the law?
L99383 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Because, I'm your attorney.  I shouldn't be going to your house.
L99382 +++$+++ u4174 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Why not?
L99380 +++$+++ u4174 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ I know.
L99379 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ This is your house.
L99378 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Sure.  Where to?
L99377 +++$+++ u4174 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Can we get out of here?
L99375 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Why didn't you live together?
L99374 +++$+++ u4174 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ We started talking.  In fact, we talked until four in the morning.  We discovered we shared a lot of the same interests.  After that we were together all the time until he left. He used to call me every night after he came back.  Then after a few weeks he invited me to come visit him. I've never left.
L99373 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ -- And then?
L99372 +++$+++ u4174 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ I was at a cocktail party.  Very trendy.  Andrew was in Chicago on business.  He had broken his wrist the week before and was wearing it in a sling.  He looked so helpless.
L99371 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ How'd you meet Marsh?
L99336 +++$+++ u4174 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Because -- somehow the fruit always tasted that much sweeter because of the pain it took to get to it.
L99335 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard?
L99334 +++$+++ u4174 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ When I was growing up we had a strawberry patch in our backyard. So did this family down the road.  I used to sneak in their yard and steal their strawberries.  It wasn't easy. The stone walls were high and I'd scrape my knees as I climbed over. On the other side were wild rose bushes.  The thorns would dig into my legs and cut my thighs as I lowered myself down.
L99333 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Try.
L99332 +++$+++ u4174 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Because -- it's beyond intellect. It's emotion.  It's passion.  It has to be experienced -- it can't be imagined.
L99331 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Why not?
L99330 +++$+++ u4174 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ I don't know if it's something I can explain to you.
L99329 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ How?
L99328 +++$+++ u4174 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Yes.
L99327 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ As it pertains to you -- not me.  Did you always know you had different... tastes?
L99326 +++$+++ u4174 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ I thought the subject was sex?
L99325 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ I think we're getting a little off the subject here.
L99323 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ We're not animals.
L99322 +++$+++ u4174 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Something like that.
L99321 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ No pain, no gain?
L99320 +++$+++ u4174 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Have you ever seen animals make love, Mr. Dulaney?  They have such passion -- such savage emotion.  They struggle, and snarl, and claw, but neither hurts the other.  Not really.
L99319 +++$+++ u4174 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ I am who I am.  I can't deny it, anymore than you can deny who you are.  I like sex different -- I like it wild.  That's not a crime.  I loved Andrew.  We made love together.  We made it differently, but we still made love.  It was our way.  It was private -- and now the whole world wants to look in through the pretense of justice.  If I was some middle-aged divorcee who screwed him once a week do you think this would be happening to me?
L99318 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Those same men will be sitting on the jury.
L99317 +++$+++ u4174 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ I'm used to being on the outside looking in.  The same men who will publicly profess their moral outrage for my sexual tastes are the same ones who privately rest their sweaty little hands on my legs and talk about weekend trips together.
L99316 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ This is a very small town -- people here have very straight views on sex.
L99315 +++$+++ u4174 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Andrew hardly needed leading.  He was a very passionate man.  He was eager to explore.  I gave him what he wanted.  We fulfilled each others needs.
L99314 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ I want you to know right now that the trial's going to be nasty.  Your sex life is going to be dragged through the mud.  They're going to say that you enticed Marsh -- led him down a dark path.
L99294 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ I'll have you out in a few hours.
L99293 +++$+++ u4174 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Frank!
L99243 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ You still haven't answered my question.
L99242 +++$+++ u4174 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ He'll file.  He's an ambitious man. Ambitious men build their careers on the bodies of others.
L99241 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ You're assuming the District Attorney is going to file charges.
L99240 +++$+++ u4174 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ And that's exactly what the jury will see when they look at me.  That's why I need a very good lawyer, Mr. Dulaney.
L99239 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Not a very good one I'm afraid.
L99238 +++$+++ u4174 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ You must have some feeling.  Some immediate impression.  A young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will.  And the things that went on in that house.  Such wild sex.  What kind of picture does that paint?
L99237 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ I don't know.  That's why I'm asking you.
L99236 +++$+++ u4174 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Do you think I did it?
L99234 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ There are no charges against you. I'm here to decide if I'm going to represent you should that occur.  Did you kill him?
L99233 +++$+++ u4174 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Are you going to represent me?
L99229 +++$+++ u4177 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ SATTLER +++$+++ She's waiting in the conference room.
L99228 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Alright, I'll talk to her
L99227 +++$+++ u4177 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ SATTLER +++$+++ Well, I guess that makes you the best.  Look, Frank -- she stands to inherit three million dollars.  As executors of the estate and her attorneys that could generate a lot of legal fees for us.  All I'm asking you to do is talk to her.
L99226 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Raymond, I'm the only criminal attorney you have.
L99225 +++$+++ u4177 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ SATTLER +++$+++ Because I told her you were the best criminal attorney we have.
L99224 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Why?
L99223 +++$+++ u4177 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ SATTLER +++$+++ I know -- but she wants you to represent her if Cardenas files.
L99222 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ I'm supposed to be on vacation.
L99221 +++$+++ u4177 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ SATTLER +++$+++ We've already got press arriving from over the country and she hasn't even been charged yet. Cardenas wants to see her in his office tomorrow at ten.  I'd like you to go with her.
L99220 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Andrew Marsh was a very wealthy man. A trial like this is going to put Cardenas in the spot-light.
L99482 +++$+++ u4172 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I gotta go.  I'll call you later.
L99481 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ I know what day it is!  Get off the phone.
L99480 +++$+++ u4172 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ -- But it's Sunday.
L99479 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Because I'm expecting a call.
L99478 +++$+++ u4172 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Why?
L99477 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Michael -- get off the phone.
L99358 +++$+++ u4172 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I love you too, Dad.
L99357 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ I love you.
L99355 +++$+++ u4172 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Is Mom yelling at you too?
L99354 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Well, that's kind of how I am right now.
L99353 +++$+++ u4172 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Yeah.
L99352 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ You know how it is sometimes when you're out playing ball with your friends?  How you're really concentrating on what you're doing -- and you lose track of time and you come home late and Mom yells at you?
L99217 +++$+++ u4172 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ She allegedly humped him to death?
L99216 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Hey, you know better than that.  What did I teach you to say when someone is accused of doing something?
L99215 +++$+++ u4172 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ The kids at school say she humped Mr. Marsh to death.
L99214 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ What are they saying?
L99912 +++$+++ u4169 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ JUDGE BURNHAM +++$+++ You better.  Please answer the question.
L99911 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ I can back it up.
L99910 +++$+++ u4169 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ JUDGE BURNHAM +++$+++ Are you able to back up this allegation -- or are you fishing?
L99909 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Your Honor -- the prosecution has introduced cocaine as one of the contributing reasons Mr. Marsh died. How it may have been introduced into the household is of vital importance.
L99904 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ How often do you use cocaine?
L99903 +++$+++ u4169 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ JUDGE BURNHAM +++$+++ Miss Braslow, I'd like to remind you that you are still under oath.
L99807 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Mr. Roston?
L99806 +++$+++ u4169 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ JUDGE BURNHAM +++$+++ The witness will answer the question.
L99775 +++$+++ u4169 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ JUDGE BURNHAM +++$+++ Mr. Cardenas, I suggest you move on to another line of questioning.
L99774 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Objection.  The witness has already stated that Miss Lawson left without an explanation.
L99746 +++$+++ u4169 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ JUDGE BURNHAM +++$+++ That's it, Mr. Dulaney.  Take a seat.
L99745 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ But Your Honor--
L99694 +++$+++ u4169 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ JUDGE BURNHAM +++$+++ Maybe you don't know what it's like where Mrs. Crawford comes from -- but I do.  I came from a neighborhood just like hers.  This is a whole other world for her.  She's a poor working woman who has been thrust into a room full of highly educated and mostly unsympathetic people.  So, she puts on her best dress, fixes her hair and tries to present herself as intelligently as possible.  Being poor and having pride is not a crime, Mr. Dulaney -- and before you attempt to impeach another witness' testimony in my courtroom -- your foundations better be based on something other than semantics.
L99693 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ No, Your Honor.
L99692 +++$+++ u4169 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ JUDGE BURNHAM +++$+++ Mr. Dulaney, before you cast aspersions on the District Attorney's Office by suggesting they've coaxed this witness to say things that aren't true -- you better have more than a hunch.  Do you?
L99682 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ "Discourteous insinuations about his sexual abilities."  Who told you to say that?
L99681 +++$+++ u4169 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ JUDGE BURNHAM +++$+++ Do it quickly, Mr. Dulaney.
L99967 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Is this what you want -- huh?  Is it?
L99966 +++$+++ u4178 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ Frank -- stop it!  Stop it!
L99965 +++$+++ u4178 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ I don't want our lives ruined because of this.  I love you, Frank.  I want this to work -- but you have to help me.  You have to come back from where ever it is you are.
L99964 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ You think that's the answer?  Sex? Is that what you want?  You want me to make love to you?
L99963 +++$+++ u4178 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ It was a place to start.
L99962 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ It's more involved than that.
L99961 +++$+++ u4178 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me.
L99960 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ I don't know.
L99959 +++$+++ u4178 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ Why didn't you come to me?
L99958 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Please -- not now.
L99957 +++$+++ u4178 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ We can't pretend this isn't happening.
L99956 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ You wouldn't like what you'd see. You don't know me anymore.  I don't know me anymore.
L99952 +++$+++ u4178 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ Talk to me.
L99951 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ I know.
L99898 +++$+++ u4178 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ Maybe it would be a good idea if you just took Michael.
L99897 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ I was thinking that when the trial is over we'd all go skiing for a weekend.
L99657 +++$+++ u4178 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ It's bad enough that you are.  It's even worse that you can stand here and lie to me.
L99656 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ No.
L99655 +++$+++ u4178 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
L99654 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ I'm not.
L99653 +++$+++ u4178 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ This isn't a courtroom.  Don't try to turn this around on me.
L99652 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Because I knew you'd think exactly what you're thinking.
L99651 +++$+++ u4178 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ Why did you lie to me?
L99650 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Yes.
L99649 +++$+++ u4178 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you.  You were with her, weren't you?
L99648 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Working.  Charlie and I were going over some statements.
L99647 +++$+++ u4178 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ Where have you been?
L99646 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Sharon, it's late.  Can we get to the point?
L99645 +++$+++ u4178 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ That's what I was hoping you'd tell me.
L99644 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ What's wrong?
L99643 +++$+++ u4178 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ We have to talk.
L99642 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Yeah -- what are you doing up?
L99403 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Yeah -- fine.  Excuse me.  I'll be right back.
L99402 +++$+++ u4178 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ Is that alright, Frank?
L99350 +++$+++ u4178 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ No one's asking you not to work.  I just think you could make some time for your son.
L99349 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Because I go to trial in seven weeks. I've got a lot of preparing to do.
L99348 +++$+++ u4178 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ Why don't you talk to him now?
L99347 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ I'll talk to him later.
L99346 +++$+++ u4178 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ Frank -- I know you're busy, but Michael asked me after dinner if you were angry with him.  He wanted to know why you weren't talking to him.
L99260 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ I can think of worse ways to go--
L99259 +++$+++ u4178 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ Yes.
L99258 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Humped
L99256 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Yeah -- but can she cook?
L99255 +++$+++ u4178 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ She sounds like quite a woman.
L99254 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Attractive.  Bright.  Distant. Charming when she wants to be.
L99253 +++$+++ u4178 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ What's she like?
L99252 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ I don't know yet.  I want to hear what she says at her statement tomorrow.
L99251 +++$+++ u4178 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ If he files are you going to take the case?
L99250 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ He must have something or he wouldn't be pressing so hard.
L99249 +++$+++ u4178 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ How can Cardenas possibly think he can build a case against two consenting adults?
L99219 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Some example you set.
L99218 +++$+++ u4178 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ I swear -- the both of you.  Some example you set.
L99212 +++$+++ u4178 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ He could let you have your vacation.
L99211 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ I know.  What can I do?  He is the boss.
L99210 +++$+++ u4178 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ We're supposed to go to the lake.
L99209 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Hello?... Hi Raymond.... What?... Well, I was sort of planning on... Alright... Okay, goodbye.  That was Sattler.  He thinks the D.A.'s going to file on Rebecca Lawson.  He wants me in the office tomorrow morning.
L99206 +++$+++ u4178 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ No -- it has to be done by tomorrow.
L99205 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Can't it wait?
L99202 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ I'm always open to learning new things.
L99201 +++$+++ u4178 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ If you want me to.
L99200 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ And I suppose you're going to show me how to relax?

L99198 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Really?

L99344 +++$+++ u4178 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ Don't use language like that at the dinner table.
L99342 +++$+++ u4178 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ Not even if they're a dork.  You should go by and see how he's feeling.
L99341 +++$+++ u4172 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Not even if they're a dork?
L99340 +++$+++ u4178 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ SHARON +++$+++ Michael, you shouldn't be happy when someone else isn't feeling well.
L99339 +++$+++ u4172 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ No, it's not.  Now I get to pitch.

L100152 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Well, there's a lot of boring stuff to do. Lists of people we have to write to. Find mama's relatives addresses in Italy -- stuff like that.
L100151 +++$+++ u4180 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I don't mind waiting.
L100134 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Why are there two deeds here?
L100133 +++$+++ u4180 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ It's a beautiful picture of her.
