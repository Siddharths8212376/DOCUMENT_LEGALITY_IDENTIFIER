It ain't white boy day, is it?
L628131 +++$+++ u8648 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Naw. It don't feel too good but it's alright.
L628130 +++$+++ u8639 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DREXL +++$+++ You OK? That stupid dumb-ass didn't break your nose, did he?

L628117 +++$+++ u8648 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Rock whores.
L628116 +++$+++ u8639 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DREXL +++$+++ What was I sayin'?
L627695 +++$+++ u8639 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DREXL +++$+++ With that terrible mug of yours if Jayne Kennedy told you to eat her pussy, kiss her ass, lick her feet, chow on her shit, and suck her dog's dick, nigger, you'd aim to please.
L627694 +++$+++ u8642 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ If it came down to who eats who, damn skippy.
L627693 +++$+++ u8639 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DREXL +++$+++ You tell Jayne Kennedy to fuck it?
L627687 +++$+++ u8642 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ I tell Jayne Kennedy, "Suck my dick or I'll beat your ass!"
L627686 +++$+++ u8639 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DREXL +++$+++ Why you trippin'? We jus' fuckin' with ya. But I wanna ask you a question. You with some fine bitch, I mean a brick shithouse bitch - you're with Jayne Kennedy. You're with Jayne Kennedy and you say "Bitch, suck my dick!" and then Jayne Kennedy says, "First things first, nigger, I ain't suckin' shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush!" Now, what do you say?
L627685 +++$+++ u8642 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Well fuck you guys then! You guys are fucked up!
L627677 +++$+++ u8642 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Then, after a while sisters use to gettin' their little pussy eat. And because you white boys had to make pigs out of yourselves, you fucked it up for every nigger in the world everywhere.
L627676 +++$+++ u8639 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DREXL +++$+++ - Because it's good!
L627675 +++$+++ u8642 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Yeah, that's right, laugh. It's so funny, oh it's so funny.  There used to be a time when sisters didn't know shit about gettin' their pussy licked. Then the sixties came an' they started fuckin' around with white boys. And white boys are freaks for that shit -
L627672 +++$+++ u8642 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Look here. If I ever did eat some pussy - I would never eat any pussy - but, if I did eat some pussy, I sure as hell wouldn't tell no goddamn body. I'd be ashamed as a motherfucker.
L627671 +++$+++ u8639 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DREXL +++$+++ Preach on, Big D.
L627664 +++$+++ u8639 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DREXL +++$+++ Nigger, you lie like a big dog.

L627662 +++$+++ u8639 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DREXL +++$+++ That's bullshit.
L627661 +++$+++ u8642 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Naw man, I don't be eatin' that shit.
L627660 +++$+++ u8639 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ DREXL +++$+++ Nigger, get outta my face with that bullshit.

L628321 +++$+++ u8640 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Fuck! I knew it! I fucking knew it! I should have my head examined, driving like this!  Kandi, you gotta help me.
L628254 +++$+++ u8652 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ VIRGIL +++$+++ You're right. It is.
L628253 +++$+++ u8642 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ No, I ain't been there. But I heard him say. Hollywood Holiday Inn. Kinda easy to remember.
L628252 +++$+++ u8652 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ VIRGIL +++$+++ How do you know? You been there?
L628251 +++$+++ u8642 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Naw, they ain't stayin' here. But, I know who you're talkin' about. They're stayin' at the Hollywood Holiday Inn.
L628250 +++$+++ u8652 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ VIRGIL +++$+++ Maybe you can help me. Actually, who I'm looking for is a friend of ours from Detroit. Clarence Worley? I heard he was in town. Might be travelling with a pretty girl named Alabama. Have you seen him? Are they stayin' here?
L628249 +++$+++ u8642 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Exactly room-mates.
L628248 +++$+++ u8652 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ VIRGIL +++$+++ Sorta room-mates?
L628247 +++$+++ u8642 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Yeah, I live here.
L628246 +++$+++ u8652 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ VIRGIL +++$+++ Do you live here?
L628245 +++$+++ u8642 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Naw, he ain't home right now.
L628244 +++$+++ u8652 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ VIRGIL +++$+++ Hello, is Dick Ritchie here?
L628509 +++$+++ u8642 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Well, you go down Beechwood...
L628508 +++$+++ u8646 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Where's that?
L628507 +++$+++ u8642 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ He's at the Beverly Wilshire.
L628506 +++$+++ u8646 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Do you know where we can find him?
L628505 +++$+++ u8642 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Yes.
L628504 +++$+++ u8646 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Do you know a Clarence Worley?
L628503 +++$+++ u8642 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ No.
L628502 +++$+++ u8646 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Are you Dick Ritchie?
L628501 +++$+++ u8642 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ FLOYD +++$+++ Yes.
L628540 +++$+++ u8649 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ MARVIN +++$+++ Donowitz, he said.
L628539 +++$+++ u8646 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ What was the Jew-boy's name?
L628386 +++$+++ u8646 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Shut your mouth. Nick Cardella was provin' what his words was worth before you were in your daddy's nutsack. What sun do you walk under you can throw a shadow on Nick Cardella? Nick Cardella's a stand-up guy.
L628385 +++$+++ u8649 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ MARVIN +++$+++ I didn't mean -
L628384 +++$+++ u8646 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Then where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk?
L628383 +++$+++ u8649 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ MARVIN +++$+++ No.
L628382 +++$+++ u8646 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Excuse me, Mr. Coccotti.  Do you know Nick Cardella?
L630037 +++$+++ u8654 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ ASTROPHYSICIST +++$+++ We're going to think about it, Cole. Among ourselves.  We'll get back to you.
L630036 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ I understand.  There'd be no point.
L630029 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Well, sir, I don't think the human mind was built to exist in two different... whatever you call it..."dimensions." It's stressful, you said it yourselves, it gets you confused.  You don't know what's real and what's not.
L630028 +++$+++ u8654 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ ASTROPHYSICIST +++$+++ You said we weren't "real," Cole...
L630025 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ No, sir!  I just want to do my part. To get us back on top...in charge of the planet.  And I have the experience, I know who the people are...
L630024 +++$+++ u8654 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ ASTROPHYSICIST +++$+++ The food, the sky, the certain, uh, sexual temptations -- you haven't become "addicted" have you, Cole?  To that "dying" world'
L630006 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ I DON'T WANT YOUR "WOMEN," YOU BRAINLESS TWIT! I WANT TO BE WELL!
L630005 +++$+++ u8654 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ ASTROPHYSICIST +++$+++ Women will want to get to know you...
L629711 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Uh, I think so.  In the mental hospital.
L629710 +++$+++ u8654 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ ASTROPHYSICIST +++$+++ Him?  You saw that man?
L629694 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Uh, what?
L629693 +++$+++ u8654 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ ASTROPHYSICIST +++$+++ Well?
L629498 +++$+++ u8654 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ ASTROPHYSICIST +++$+++ We have a very advanced program, something very different, requires very skilled people.
L629497 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ No, sir!
L629489 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Uh, I didn't hear the...
L629488 +++$+++ u8654 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ ASTROPHYSICIST +++$+++ Wake up, Cole.
L629479 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ I went to the surface and I collected specimens like I was told.
L629478 +++$+++ u8654 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ ASTROPHYSICIST +++$+++ We want you to tell us about last night.
L630002 +++$+++ u8660 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ ENGINEER +++$+++ This is it, James...what you've been working for.
L630001 +++$+++ u8654 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ ASTROPHYSICIST +++$+++ We're very close!  Because of you!
L629993 +++$+++ u8660 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ ENGINEER +++$+++ You're still a little... disoriented.
L629992 +++$+++ u8654 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ ASTROPHYSICIST +++$+++ But just until you recover your, uh,... equilibrium.
L629696 +++$+++ u8654 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ ASTROPHYSICIST +++$+++ Cole, did you or did you not record that message?
L629695 +++$+++ u8660 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ ENGINEER +++$+++ He's drugged out of his mind!  He's completely zoned out.
L629502 +++$+++ u8654 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ ASTROPHYSICIST +++$+++ For a man in your position...an opportunity.
L629501 +++$+++ u8660 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ ENGINEER +++$+++ We want tough minded people.  Strong mentally.  We've had some...misfortunes with "unstable" types.
L629496 +++$+++ u8660 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ ENGINEER +++$+++ You don't want to jeopardize that reduction, do you, Cole?  Have it taken away?
L629495 +++$+++ u8654 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ ASTROPHYSICIST +++$+++ To be determined by the proper authorities.
L630089 +++$+++ u8661 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ FALE +++$+++ Hey, no problem, it's probably just another kidnapping featuring Jeffrey's shrink, pardon me, make that ex-shrink.  This is your leader, a certifiable lunatic who told his former psychiatrist all his plans for God knows what whacko irresponsible schemes, and now who knows what she's painted out there on our wall?
L630088 +++$+++ u8655 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Wow, a guy in a Chevy is chasing her and some other guy I can't see.
L630056 +++$+++ u8661 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ FALE +++$+++ She's drawing attention to us, that's what she's doing. ... I don't know what you're up to this time, Mason, but you're gonna get us in deep shit!
L630055 +++$+++ u8655 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ What's she doing?
L630054 +++$+++ u8661 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ FALE +++$+++ It's the kidnap woman -- the one who was with the guy who tied us up.
L629850 +++$+++ u8655 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ What are you going to do with us?
L629849 +++$+++ u8661 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ FALE +++$+++ That's him.
L629842 +++$+++ u8661 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ FALE +++$+++ Shut up!
L629841 +++$+++ u8655 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I told you that fuckhead Mason would get us into something like this.
L630052 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Uh, so that a vaccine can be developed that will, uh, allow mankind to reclaim the surface of the earth.
L630051 +++$+++ u8656 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ BOTANIST +++$+++ So that...???
L630050 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus.
L630049 +++$+++ u8656 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ BOTANIST +++$+++ And your only goal is...???
L630048 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to San Francisco, then to New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
L630047 +++$+++ u8656 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ BOTANIST +++$+++ Meaning...???
L630046 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ San Francisco, New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
L630045 +++$+++ u8656 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ BOTANIST +++$+++ And it appeared sequentially after that in...?
L630044 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ It was released in Philadelphia, probably on June 14, 1995.
L630043 +++$+++ u8656 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ BOTANIST +++$+++ Let's consider again our current information -- if the symptoms were first detected in Philadelphia on June 28, 1995, that makes us know that...?
L629705 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ I got into trouble.  I got arrested. But I still got you a specimen -- a spider -- but I didn't have anyplace to put it, so I ate it.  It was the wrong year anyway, so I guess it doesn't matter.
L629704 +++$+++ u8656 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ BOTANIST +++$+++ Forced you!  Why would someone force you to take drugs?
L629703 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ They forced me to take drugs.
L629485 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ I think it was...I'm sure it was 2nd Street.
L629484 +++$+++ u8656 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ BOTANIST +++$+++ It's important to observe everything.
L630221 +++$+++ u8666 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ RAILLY +++$+++ I'll get the tickets and meet you... in the Gift Shop.
L630220 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Right!  You're right.  I have to fix this.
L630219 +++$+++ u8666 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ RAILLY +++$+++ James, if we're identified, they're going to send us someplace...but not to Key West!
L630218 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ I was here...as a kid.  I think you were here, too.  But you...looked just like you look now.
L630217 +++$+++ u8666 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ RAILLY +++$+++ They may be looking for us, James.  Use this.  You can fix it in the Men's Room.
L630215 +++$+++ u8666 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ RAILLY +++$+++ Airports all look the same.  Maybe it's...  James!  Your moustache!  It's slipping.
L630214 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ I know this place! ... This is my dream.
L630209 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ On the walls -- they meant the animals when they said, "We did it."
L630208 +++$+++ u8666 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ RAILLY +++$+++ That's what they were up to!  Freeing animals!
L630200 +++$+++ u8666 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ RAILLY +++$+++ I remember you...like this.  I feel I've known you before.  I feel I've always known you.
L630199 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize it was you.  Then...I woke up and I...I thought you were gone.
L630198 +++$+++ u8666 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ RAILLY +++$+++ Well, you look pretty different, too.
L630197 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ You were in my dream just now.  I didn't recognize you.
L630191 +++$+++ u8666 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ RAILLY +++$+++ In a few weeks, it will have started or it won't.  If there are still baseball games and traffic jams, armed robberies and boring TV shows -- we'll be so happy, we'll be glad to turn ourselves in to the police.
L630190 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ But maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe you're wrong.  Maybe we're both crazy.
L630189 +++$+++ u8666 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ RAILLY +++$+++ So we can stick our heads out the window and feel the wind and listen to the music.  So we can appreciate what we have while we have it.  Forgive me, psychiatrists don't cry.
L630188 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Why are we doing this?
L630186 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Flowers!  What flowers?
L630185 +++$+++ u8666 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ RAILLY +++$+++ If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
L630184 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ I have seen it, but I don't remember this part.  Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.  The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.
L630183 +++$+++ u8666 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ RAILLY +++$+++ Shh -- don't talk.  Hold still.
L630182 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ I think I've seen this movie before. When I was a kid.  It was on TV.
L630153 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ They got your message, Kathryn.  They played it for me.  It was a bad recording...distorted.  I didn't recognize your voice.
L630152 +++$+++ u8666 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ RAILLY +++$+++ You... you couldn't have heard me.
L630150 +++$+++ u8666 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ RAILLY +++$+++ I couldn't resist.  I was so relieved. Wait'll they hear this nutty woman telling them...they better watch out for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys...
L630149 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ You... you left them a message?
L630148 +++$+++ u8666 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ RAILLY +++$+++ No superiors!  No scientists.  No people from the future.  It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company.  They have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned.
L630147 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ A Carpet Cleaning Company?
L630146 +++$+++ u8666 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ RAILLY +++$+++ It's a Carpet Cleaning Company...
L630133 +++$+++ u8666 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ RAILLY +++$+++ I...I...We need cash, James.
L630132 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ You want me to rob him?
L630123 +++$+++ u8666 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ RAILLY +++$+++ James...do you remember...six years ago...you had a phone number!  You tried to call and...
L630122 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ I want to be here.  In this time.  With you.  I want to become...become a whole person.  I want this to be the present. I want the future to be unknown.
L630121 +++$+++ u8666 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ RAILLY +++$+++ Well, I can't. ... I mean...I'm trying to.  I can't believe that everything we do or say has already happened, that we can't change what's going to happen, that I'm one of the three billion people who are going to die...soon.
L630120 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ You said I had delusions -- that I created a world -- you said you could explain everything...
L630119 +++$+++ u8666 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ RAILLY +++$+++ You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James!  How did it get there?
L630118 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ ...I had a dream about...something like that.
L630117 +++$+++ u8666 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ RAILLY +++$+++ What does this mean to you?
L630115 +++$+++ u8666 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ RAILLY +++$+++ IT WASN'T A TV SHOW!  IT WAS REAL!
L630114 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ I think I saw a TV show like that when I was a kid.  Where a boy...
L630113 +++$+++ u8666 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ RAILLY +++$+++ James, you said he was hiding in the barn...
L630112 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ It was?  I didn't...know.
L630111 +++$+++ u8666 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ RAILLY +++$+++ The boy in the well.  How did you know that was just a hoax?
L630110 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ I don't know -- I don't remember.
L630109 +++$+++ u8666 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ RAILLY +++$+++ You disappeared!  One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods?
L630108 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ No, not really.  It's...it's in my mind.  Like you said.
L630107 +++$+++ u8666 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ RAILLY +++$+++ Just like that?  You were in prison?
L630106 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ I thought I was in...prison again.
L630105 +++$+++ u8666 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ RAILLY +++$+++ Okay...you were standing there looking at the moon...you were eating grass... then what?
L630098 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ You mean, treat me?  Cure me?  Kathryn, those words on the wall -- I've seen them before...  I...I...dreamed them.
L630097 +++$+++ u8666 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ RAILLY +++$+++ We're avoiding the police until I can....talk to you.
L630096 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ I don't understand what we're doing.
L630082 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ No, I want to turn myself in.  Where is he?  Don't worry -- it's all okay now.  I'm not crazy any more!  I mean, I am crazy, mentally divergent, actually, but I know it now and I want you to help me.  I want to get well...
L630081 +++$+++ u8666 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ RAILLY +++$+++ James!  That's a policeman.  Pretend you don't know me.  If he sees you...
L629962 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ No gun!  Stars!  Air!  I can live here.  Breathe!
L629961 +++$+++ u8666 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ RAILLY +++$+++ You're sure?
L629960 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ The gun! ... I lost it
L629959 +++$+++ u8666 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ RAILLY +++$+++ Give me the gun.
L629958 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ It would be great if I'm crazy.  If I'm wrong about everything...the world will be okay.  I'll never have to live underground.
L629957 +++$+++ u8666 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ RAILLY +++$+++ First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running.  Okay?
L629956 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ I need help all right.  They're coming after me.
L629955 +++$+++ u8666 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ RAILLY +++$+++ It can be dealt with, but only if you want to.  I can help you.
L629954 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ I'm..."mentally divergent".  I would love to believe that.
L629953 +++$+++ u8666 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ RAILLY +++$+++ Nobody is going to wipe out the human race.  Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else.  You've created something in your mind, James -- a substitute reality. In order to avoid something you don't want to face.
L629952 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about the virus.  And suddenly, I wasn't sure.  We talked when I was in the institution, and it was all...fuzzy. The drugs and stuff.  You think maybe I'm the one who wiped out the human race?  It was my idea?
L629951 +++$+++ u8666 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ RAILLY +++$+++ What made you think that?
L629950 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ Yeah, sort of, I guess.  I...I'm sorry I locked you up.  I thought...I thought... I think maybe I am crazy!
L629949 +++$+++ u8666 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ RAILLY +++$+++ See -- you can drive after all!
L629948 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car and they chased me.  I hit a tree.
L629947 +++$+++ u8666 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ RAILLY +++$+++ What have you done?  Did you...kill someone?
L629887 +++$+++ u8666 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ RAILLY +++$+++ You have to give yourself up, you know.
L629886 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ You smell so good.
L629880 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ That has your name on it.  Give him cash.
L629879 +++$+++ u8666 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ RAILLY +++$+++ No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you.
L629878 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ You were going to run out off gas on purpose, weren't you?
L629877 +++$+++ u8657 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ COLE +++$+++ It was some kind of...war.  Never mind, you wouldn't believe me.  Turn off here.
L629876 +++$+++ u8666 +++$+++ m587 +++$+++ RAILLY +++$+++ Shot!  Who shot you?
