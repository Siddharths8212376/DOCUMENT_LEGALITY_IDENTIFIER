L612924 +++$+++ u8424 +++$+++ m572 +++$+++ GLASS +++$+++ No, ninety-ninety percent of them are full of baloney. They're into the power trip, not the damage. What scares me is that this guy is so sophisticated he could blow up whatever he wants, then disappear. The worst of the bunch, they love the challenge of creating the wildest device ever... and they love the carnage.
L612923 +++$+++ u8428 +++$+++ m572 +++$+++ REILLY +++$+++ Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.
L612922 +++$+++ u8424 +++$+++ m572 +++$+++ GLASS +++$+++ Typical profile, usually losers, nobodies that're afraid to confront their victims. They like scaring people. That's why they call in their threats. Same mentality as obscene phone callers.
L612920 +++$+++ u8424 +++$+++ m572 +++$+++ GLASS +++$+++ With a little training, you could go into a house and just from stuff in the bathroom and kitchen make something that'd finish off that alleged car of yours. Heck, didn't you ever watch MacGyver?
L612919 +++$+++ u8428 +++$+++ m572 +++$+++ REILLY +++$+++ Just how easy is it to build a... device?
L612918 +++$+++ u8424 +++$+++ m572 +++$+++ GLASS +++$+++ There were a few guys in my class with names like John Smith, Bill Jones. I'd see them up ahead in the hall, call their name, but they wouldn't turn around. C.I.A. Funny thing, they'd always disappear after the first half of the course.
L612917 +++$+++ u8428 +++$+++ m572 +++$+++ REILLY +++$+++ Sounds like terrorist heaven.
L612916 +++$+++ u8424 +++$+++ m572 +++$+++ GLASS +++$+++ Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.
L612915 +++$+++ u8428 +++$+++ m572 +++$+++ REILLY +++$+++ Cream of the crop, huh? You?
L612914 +++$+++ u8424 +++$+++ m572 +++$+++ GLASS +++$+++ Redstone's the army training center in Alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers.
L612913 +++$+++ u8428 +++$+++ m572 +++$+++ REILLY +++$+++ You mentioned something called Redstone.
L612912 +++$+++ u8424 +++$+++ m572 +++$+++ GLASS +++$+++ An abandoned machine shop... nice place to build devices. Low rent, too. But, you and Rice ruined their perfect hideout.
L612911 +++$+++ u8428 +++$+++ m572 +++$+++ REILLY +++$+++ I don't know. You tell me?
L612910 +++$+++ u8424 +++$+++ m572 +++$+++ GLASS +++$+++ So what were they doing here?
L612909 +++$+++ u8424 +++$+++ m572 +++$+++ GLASS +++$+++ Then let's go see what they missed.
L612908 +++$+++ u8428 +++$+++ m572 +++$+++ REILLY +++$+++ The place has already be combed. Forensics pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside.
L612907 +++$+++ u8424 +++$+++ m572 +++$+++ GLASS +++$+++ Drive.
L612906 +++$+++ u8428 +++$+++ m572 +++$+++ REILLY +++$+++ Oh yeah? Prove it.
L612905 +++$+++ u8424 +++$+++ m572 +++$+++ GLASS +++$+++ No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
L612904 +++$+++ u8428 +++$+++ m572 +++$+++ REILLY +++$+++ Hey, look--
L612903 +++$+++ u8424 +++$+++ m572 +++$+++ GLASS +++$+++ Nice performance back there. Where'd you learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar?
L612893 +++$+++ u8428 +++$+++ m572 +++$+++ REILLY +++$+++ Where...?
L612892 +++$+++ u8424 +++$+++ m572 +++$+++ GLASS +++$+++ Only once, at Redstone.
L612891 +++$+++ u8428 +++$+++ m572 +++$+++ REILLY +++$+++ She's not talking. But, she could be. So, obviously, you've seen one of these devices before?
L612890 +++$+++ u8424 +++$+++ m572 +++$+++ GLASS +++$+++ I.R.A. device. Deadliest class of tickers in existence. Computerized, multiple sensors, booby traps, the works. First showed up in a series of I.R.A. bombings in London couple years ago. One of their boys tripped it on himself and they went back to a less complicated timers. The Girl, is she Irish?
L612848 +++$+++ u8424 +++$+++ m572 +++$+++ GLASS +++$+++ Don't push it, slick.
L612847 +++$+++ u8428 +++$+++ m572 +++$+++ REILLY +++$+++ Anything else I should know?
L612846 +++$+++ u8424 +++$+++ m572 +++$+++ GLASS +++$+++ Treat. We treat devices.
L612845 +++$+++ u8428 +++$+++ m572 +++$+++ REILLY +++$+++ So you're the "Device Squad"... and you defuse "devices"?
L612844 +++$+++ u8424 +++$+++ m572 +++$+++ GLASS +++$+++ We don't use the b-word. Bad luck.

L612832 +++$+++ u8424 +++$+++ m572 +++$+++ GLASS +++$+++ This isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery. You wanna work with us, you do it our way, understand?
L612831 +++$+++ u8428 +++$+++ m572 +++$+++ REILLY +++$+++ What?
L612828 +++$+++ u8424 +++$+++ m572 +++$+++ GLASS +++$+++ That cop who bought it... you didn't tell us he was your partner.
L612827 +++$+++ u8428 +++$+++ m572 +++$+++ REILLY +++$+++ What was-? Why...?
L612800 +++$+++ u8428 +++$+++ m572 +++$+++ REILLY +++$+++ We've got one hour. Are you coming or not?
L612799 +++$+++ u8424 +++$+++ m572 +++$+++ GLASS +++$+++ When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department.
L612798 +++$+++ u8428 +++$+++ m572 +++$+++ REILLY +++$+++ What're you talking about?
L612793 +++$+++ u8428 +++$+++ m572 +++$+++ REILLY +++$+++ We can start in the area where the robbery occurred.

L612750 +++$+++ u8424 +++$+++ m572 +++$+++ GLASS +++$+++ High-grade det cord. This girl, either she's got strange taste in jewelry or she's into serious demolition.
L612747 +++$+++ u8428 +++$+++ m572 +++$+++ REILLY +++$+++ Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...
L612746 +++$+++ u8424 +++$+++ m572 +++$+++ GLASS +++$+++ Where did you get this?

L612958 +++$+++ u8427 +++$+++ m572 +++$+++ POOCH +++$+++ Exactly my thinking. Except, none of the targets can actually be linked to government, political or special interest concerns. They seem to be just unrelated industrial companies. Some insured, some not. 
L612957 +++$+++ u8424 +++$+++ m572 +++$+++ GLASS +++$+++ Political.
