L336718 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ But you said you didn't know her.
L336717 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ Because she's the type.
L336716 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Why her?
L336715 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ Not really.
L336714 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You know her?
L336713 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter?  I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight.
L336712 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Hello?
L336547 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ "Wee Willie Winkie runs through the town.  Upstairs and downstairs in his nightgown.  Crawling through the window.  At the end of Miss Emma's street.  Her God has gone and left his home.  So her and I can meet."
L336546 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You're not going to tell me that.
L336545 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ I suppose you want to know where I'm going to kill tonight, Peter?
L336542 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ If you got something to say to me, just come out and say it!
L336541 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ You'll find her.
L336540 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Where is she?
L336539 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ I did another one last night.  You might have saved her, but you didn't want to play.
L336538 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What?
L336537 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ You don't want to think and that's why I'll win!  I'm already two points ahead.
L336536 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Why not?
L336535 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself.  Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions.
L336534 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Why did you write remember on the wall?
L336533 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ We all have paths to follow.  You hope yours will lead you to me.
L336532 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ And -- what path is that?
L336531 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ No, only the path she chose to travel.
L336530 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Did you know her?
L336529 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ To get your attention.
L336528 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yes.  Why did you kill Debi Rutlege?
L336527 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ Very amateurish, Peter.  I'm surprised you would use such an obvious tactic.  I'm not an idiot!  Don't treat me as one!  I'll call you everyday... You get one minute, whether you put me on hold or talk is up to you!  Are you ready to play?
L336526 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Just a second.  Hello?
L336525 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ Hello, Peter.
L336412 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I haven't got time for this.
L336411 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ Someone who's going to become an important part of your life.  I want to play a game with you.
L336410 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Who is this?
L336409 +++$+++ u1699 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ CALLER +++$+++ Hello, Peter.
L337254 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I think your mother knows that now. Why don't you put the knife down.  Put it down, David.
L337253 +++$+++ u1700 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Don't you see?  I had to make it right. I ignored my mother's crossing.  I sat with them all.  I held their hands.  I stroked their hair.  I was with them to the end.  I took away the blood.  I washed them.  Their crossing was peaceful.
L337252 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I know, but this isn't going to bring her back.
L337251 +++$+++ u1700 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ They took away the game because of him. My father left and my mother...  There was so much blood... It covered everything.
L337250 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Yes, I do.  I found your file.  I know what happened.
L337249 +++$+++ u1700 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You don't understand.
L337248 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ This isn't going to help, David. You're mother's dead.  You can't undo it.
L337243 +++$+++ u1700 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ The scars on your chest.  From where I stabbed you with my fountain pen.
L337242 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What scars?
L337241 +++$+++ u1700 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You still haven't figured it out, have you?   You think that I've put you through an ordeal.  My scars run so much deeper than yours.
L337240 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Computers.  That's how you got into Homesearchers records.  You can get into anything.  But why?  Why?
L336961 +++$+++ u1700 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ New York.  1986.  Viktor Yurilivich.
L336960 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What is it?
L336959 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ He's in his seventies and lives in Holland.
L336958 +++$+++ u1700 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ 1985.  Hans Korshaud.
L336957 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Never mind.  He died two years ago.
L336956 +++$+++ u1700 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ There's three.  The first is 1983. Lionel Baines.  The Boston...
L336955 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Have computer search for anyone that's used that opening against me.  There can't be more than a handful.
L336954 +++$+++ u1700 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Now what?
L336952 +++$+++ u1700 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Mister Sanderson, they'll be hundreds of thousands of games.
L336951 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ D2-d4...  b1-c3... and c1-f4.  It's the number two variation of the Tarakoss opening.  David, can you bring up the tournament records for the last ten years.
L336948 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Set up some pieces on the big board?
L336947 +++$+++ u1700 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Nope.  Nothing.
L336946 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Okay.  Run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the Island.
L336945 +++$+++ u1700 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ No problem.  We're in.
L336944 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
L336943 +++$+++ u1700 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Sure.  We've got a modem line hooked up with the data base in New York.
L336680 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Of course not.
L336679 +++$+++ u1700 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter.  I hope you don't mind.
L336678 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What's this?
L336677 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Thanks.
L336676 +++$+++ u1700 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Naw, it's all fixed.  I also loaded up a program that'll analyze your games three hundred percent faster.
L337189 +++$+++ u1701 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ DOCTOR FULTON +++$+++ You're losing me.
L337188 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Yeah -- that's what we've always thought -- but what if he wasn't?  What if I had nothing to do with the reason he came here?
L337187 +++$+++ u1701 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ DOCTOR FULTON +++$+++ He was watching you.
L337186 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Come here.
L337185 +++$+++ u1701 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ DOCTOR FULTON +++$+++ Why did he what?
L337184 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Why did he?
L337183 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ He already did once.
L337182 +++$+++ u1701 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ DOCTOR FULTON +++$+++ You're safe.  He wouldn't come here.
L337181 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I'm just nervous.  Sorry.
L337180 +++$+++ u1701 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ DOCTOR FULTON +++$+++ Kathy, please.  You're going to wear a hole in the carpet.
L337151 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ How come the police never had a record of Sanderson before.  This doesn't come out of nowhere, there has to be a history.
L337150 +++$+++ u1701 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ DOCTOR FULTON +++$+++ You don't want to believe it.  It's a normal reaction.
L337149 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I just can't believe it.
L337148 +++$+++ u1701 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ DOCTOR FULTON +++$+++ Feeling better?
L336509 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Fuck off!
L336508 +++$+++ u1701 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ DOCTOR FULTON +++$+++ It worked out alright, didn't it?
L336507 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Don't patronize me!  You sent me into a potentially dangerous situation and didn't warn me!
L336506 +++$+++ u1701 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ DOCTOR FULTON +++$+++ They asked who would be best suited for this and you--
L336505 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ --the same type as the girl who got killed.  Jesus, Alan, the guy could be a psychopath.
L336504 +++$+++ u1701 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ DOCTOR FULTON +++$+++ I admit I handled it badly.  Sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive--
L336503 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ You could have been honest with me for starters.  We work together.  I have to be able to trust you.
L336502 +++$+++ u1701 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ DOCTOR FULTON +++$+++ The police came to me for help.  What could I do?
L336501 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Oh, well we wouldn't want to disturb your guests, would we?
L336500 +++$+++ u1701 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ DOCTOR FULTON +++$+++ Would you mind keeping your voice down? I have guests.
L336499 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ You're damn right!  I'm a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer!
L336498 +++$+++ u1701 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ DOCTOR FULTON +++$+++ You might not have done it had you known.
L336893 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Nice meeting you.
L336892 +++$+++ u1702 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ERICA +++$+++ Okay.  Nice meeting you.
L336890 +++$+++ u1702 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ERICA +++$+++ No... but I can tell.  A woman knows these things.
L336889 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ How do you know that?  Did he say something?
L336888 +++$+++ u1702 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ERICA +++$+++ I know he really likes you.
L336886 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Of course.
L336885 +++$+++ u1702 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ERICA +++$+++ Do you like my dad?
L336884 +++$+++ u1702 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ERICA +++$+++ Boys.
L336883 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ That's only because you don't know where to go.  You like hiking?  Fishing?  Sailing?  What do you like?
L336882 +++$+++ u1702 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ERICA +++$+++ Not really.  It's pretty boring.
L336881 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ So, are you having a good time on the Island?
L336880 +++$+++ u1702 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ERICA +++$+++ He went down to the lobby for a minute. He should be right back.  Would you like come in?
L336879 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Is your dad here?
L336878 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I'm Kathy.
L336877 +++$+++ u1702 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ERICA +++$+++ Uh huh.
L336876 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ You must be Erica.
L336849 +++$+++ u1702 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ERICA +++$+++ Who's Kathy?
L336848 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ It isn't Kathy.
L336689 +++$+++ u1702 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ERICA +++$+++ But you promised.
L336688 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I'm sorry, honey, I can't.  Not today.
L336687 +++$+++ u1702 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ERICA +++$+++ You told me you'd take me over to Seattle today.
L336686 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ For what?
L336685 +++$+++ u1702 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ERICA +++$+++ You ready?
L336683 +++$+++ u1702 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ERICA +++$+++ Thanks, David.
L336682 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Don't you have something you want to say to David?
L336416 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Nothing.
L336415 +++$+++ u1702 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ERICA +++$+++ What is it, dad?
L336406 +++$+++ u1702 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ERICA +++$+++ No, but he did contact a dead parcheesi champion from Ohio.
L336405 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Has he gotten through to any?
L336404 +++$+++ u1702 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ERICA +++$+++ Mrs. Lutz.  She also told me that Mr. Lutz goes to a medium to try and contact great Grandmasters in the spirit world.
L336403 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Who told you that?
L336318 +++$+++ u1702 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ERICA +++$+++ Okay.
L336317 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You want to sleep in my bed tonight?
L336316 +++$+++ u1702 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ERICA +++$+++ That has nothing to do with it.
L336315 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I see.  You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?
L336314 +++$+++ u1702 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ERICA +++$+++ I can't sleep.  My beds lumpy.
L336313 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What are you doing up?
L336304 +++$+++ u1708 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ My cheering section.
L336303 +++$+++ u1702 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ ERICA +++$+++ Congratulations, dad.
L336670 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ That means she was dead before we even finished figuring out the message.
L336669 +++$+++ u1707 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ NOLAN +++$+++ I'd say at least eighteen hours.
L336668 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ How long she been dead?
L336667 +++$+++ u1707 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ NOLAN +++$+++ Yeah.
L336666 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Same as the others?
L336659 +++$+++ u1707 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ NOLAN +++$+++ Wait, I've saved the best for last. Andy, hit the lights, will you?
L336658 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ That's great.
L336657 +++$+++ u1707 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ NOLAN +++$+++ This is where he forced his way in.  We found some fibers on the windowsill, probably particles of clothing that rubbed off when he climbed through. I'll know more once I get it under the microscope.
L336564 +++$+++ u1707 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ NOLAN +++$+++ Not a drop.  Maybe the guy works for the Red Cross.
L336563 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ There's only two hardware stores on the whole Island.  We'll check that out. What about the blood?
L336562 +++$+++ u1707 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ NOLAN +++$+++ He tapes their mouths shut.  We found traces of adhesive around the victims mouths.  We're doing a chemical analysis for components, but it's probably a standard brand you can buy in any hardware store.
L336362 +++$+++ u1707 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ NOLAN +++$+++ No Frank.  No prints.
L336361 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You mean, no prints but hers?
L336360 +++$+++ u1707 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ NOLAN +++$+++ No prints.
L336359 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What about prints?
L336358 +++$+++ u1707 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ NOLAN +++$+++ Not much.  I don't think she was raped. There's no bruising, or any signs of trauma to the pelvic region -- and no trace of sperm which makes sense because she took a bath.
L336357 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Anything?
L336342 +++$+++ u1707 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ NOLAN +++$+++ Bingo.
L336341 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ There's no blood.  Where's the fuckin' blood?
L336337 +++$+++ u1707 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ NOLAN +++$+++ Not that I can see.  We'll know more once I get the lab reports back from Seattle.
L336336 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Any sign of rape?
L336335 +++$+++ u1707 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ NOLAN +++$+++ Six, eight hours tops.
L336334 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ How long has she been dead?
L336333 +++$+++ u1707 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ NOLAN +++$+++ Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in.
L336332 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Whaddaya got, Nolan?
L337128 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Okay.  Why don't you go out there. We'll check in with you later.
L337127 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I've got a room at the institute I use when I stay late.
L337126 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist.  Do you have someone you can stay with tonight?
L337125 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ No.  He was wearing a mask... but I saw the cut on his wrist.  It was Peter.
L337124 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Did you see his face?
L337091 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ You don't have a shred of evidence!
L337090 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ The most logical choice.
L337089 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ This stinks!  You want to know what I think?  I think there have been five murders and you've got shit to go on. You need to blame someone and he's the easiest choice.
L337088 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ We're going to work on the message.
L337087 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ And what if he's wrong.  If you were one hundred percent sure it was Peter you would've arrested him.  If it is someone else then he's going to kill again tonight and you're sitting here ignoring the message.
L337084 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ What does that mean?
L337083 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ We can't rely on your judgement anymore.
L337082 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ What are you saying?  That I'm seeing what I want to see?  That I'm protecting a murderer?  What?
L337081 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ He's right, Kathy.
L337050 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ About a quarter to one.
L337049 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What time did he get there?
L336985 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Yes.  Why not just say a building if he meant any general type of structure?
L336984 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ As large as castles.
L336971 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ That's a big area to cover.
L336970 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Each of those grids represents almost a square mile.
L336933 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ He moves around a lot.  Why?
L336932 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It can't be a coincidence.  The woman that owns it has a son.  She says he's been on vacation in Montana for the last ten days.  We're trying to locate him.  There's also a cleaning service that comes in once a week.  We're checking that out too.
L336931 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I thought that Homesearchers was a dead end?
L336930 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Maybe we should back up a minute and take a look at what we do have.  All the girls that have been killed have been killed at night.  They're all the same type.  All moved into their homes within the last three months -- and all of them found their homes through Homesearchers.
L336748 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What did he mean by Huxley?
L336747 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Well, I think you have to play to his ego.  He thinks he's superior.  The more secure he feels, the more chances he'll take.
L336741 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Peter's right, Captain.  He's got to be forced into making a mistake.
L336740 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You never know how you're going to catch a suspect.
L336665 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ This ain't no photo.
L336664 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I know that.  I've seen the photo's.
L336663 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Before we go in I gotta tell you this isn't going to be pretty.
L336619 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Call dispatch.  Double the patrols.  I want that area blanketed.
L336618 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ His home would be... Mount Olympus.
L336597 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Meaning?
L336596 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I don't think it matters.  Last nights victim, Christie Eastman was found in a warehouse on the outskirts of town. The night before, Debi Rutlege was found in the center.
L336572 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I would think it's some type of clue as to where he's going to kill next?
L336571 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I was thinking the same thing.  He must be local.  It's logical for him to assume that the police would be there, but he recognized Andy's voice and called him by name.  What about this?
L336570 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Yes.  Why disguise your voice if no one knows it?
L336569 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Anything else?
L336568 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ That would indicate he's playing out a fantasy.  Power-control killers usually fantasize about their actions long before they commit them.  Once they become a reality though, they reach a sense of euphoria and need to repeat the act to sustain it.  But, in all the research I've read on Serial Killers, I've never heard of one moving so fast. It's as if the game is the catalyst for the murders -- not the other way around.
L336567 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What about the way he arranged the body?
L336566 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Well, the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority -- and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim.
L336565 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Kathy?
L336559 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It could have been a tape.  A prerecorded conversation between Sanderson and himself.
L336558 +++$+++ u1706 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ But we heard him.
L336557 +++$+++ u1703 +++$+++ m112 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ No.  I told him to.  I wanted to make sure there was someone on the other end.
