The Devil's Chimney it was called -  The Devil's Chimney, I don't know why.  Darling.  My darling.
L184715 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Tell me about your garden.
L184714 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Every night I cut out my heart but in the morning it was full again.
L184713 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ I know.
L184712 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ I'm sorry, Katharine.
L184711 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Thank you.  Will you bury Geoffrey?  I know he's dead.
L184710 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ And a good read.  Don't waste it.
L184709 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ I promise I'll come back.  I promise I'll never leave you.  And there's plenty of water and food. You can have a party.
L184708 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Do you promise?  I wouldn't want to die here.  I wouldn't want to die in the desert. I've always had a rather elaborate funeral in mind, with particular hymns.  Very English.  And I know exactly where I want to be buried.  In our garden.  Where I grew up. With a view of the sea.  So promise me you'll come back for you.
L184707 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Listen to me, Katharine.  You've broken your ankle and I'm going to have to try and bind it.  I think your wrist might be broken, too - and some ribs, which is why it's hurting you to breathe.  I'm going to have to walk to El Taj.  Given all the traffic in the desert these days I should bump into one army or another before I reach there - or Fenelon-Barnes and his camel.  And then I'll be back and we'll be fine, and I'll never leave you.
L184706 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Oh dear.

L184701 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ I know.  I'm sorry.  I'll make a fire. I'll be back.
L184700 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ It's so cold.
L184699 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Of course.  You idiot.  I always wear it. I've always worn it.  I've always loved you.
L184698 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ You're wearing the thimble.

L184694 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ What?
L184693 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Why did you hate me?
L184692 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ I know, darling, I'm sorry.
L184691 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ It hurts too much.
L184690 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ We've got to get you out of here.
L184689 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Please don't move me.  It hurts too much.

L184686 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Why did he bring you?
L184685 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ I can't move.  I can't get out.
L184684 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Katharine!  Oh dear God, Katharine - what are you doing here?
L184592 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Do you think you're the only one who feels anything?  Is that what you think?
L184591 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Dance with me.  I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine. Which belong to me.
L184590 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ No.
L184589 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Dance with me.

L184587 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ I've watched you - on verandahs, at Garden Parties, at the Races - how can you stand there?  How can you ever smile?  As if your life hadn't capsized?
L184586 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Don't do this.
L184585 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Is he next?  Do you drag him into your little room?  Where is it?  Is this it?
L184584 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Would you let me pass?
L184583 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ What?  What?  That boy, that little boy, you were holding his collar, gripping his collar, what for?
L184582 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ What?
L184581 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Why did you hold his collar?
L184487 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ You will.  You will.
L184486 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ I just wanted you to know. I'm not missing you yet. She nods, can't find this funny.
L184484 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Don't go over it again, please.
L184483 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ I just know - any minute he'll find out, we'll barge into somebody we'll - and it will ill him.
L184482 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ I'm not agreeing.  Don't think I'm agreeing, because I'm not.
L184481 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ I'd better get back.  Say goodbye here.
L184406 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Yes.  Yes.  Absolutely.
L184405 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Shall we be all right?
L184404 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Of course.  You didn't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you'd slapped my face.
L184403 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ That day, had you followed me to the market?
L184402 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ I don't care to bargain.  It's full of saffron, just in case you think I'm giving it to you to encourage your sewing.
L184398 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Yes.  A different wife.
L184397 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ This is a different world - is what I tell myself.  A different life. And here I am a different wife.
L184396 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Madox knows, I think.  He's tried to warn me.  He keeps talking about Anna Karenina.  I think it's his idea of a man-to-man chat.  Its my idea of a man-to-man chat.
L184395 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ I thought we were against ownership?  I can stay tonight.
L184394 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ This - what's it called? - this place, I love it - this is mine!  I'm asking the King permission to call it the Almasy Bosphorous.
L184392 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ You bastard, I was believing you!
L184391 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Ouch!  See - you're always beating me..!
L184390 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ It's a long song - Szerelem means loveand the story - there's a Hungarian Count, he's a wanderer, a fool.  For years he's on some kind of quest, who knows what? And then one day he falls under the spell of a mysterious English woman - a harpy - who beats him and hits him and he becomes her slave.  He sews her clothes, he worships the hem of -
L184389 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ It's beautiful.  What's it about?
L184388 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ No, no, it's Hungarian.  My daijka sang it to me.
L184387 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Arabic?
L184386 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ It's a folk song.
L184385 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ This is - what is this?
L184320 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ I'm trying to write with your taste in my mouth.  Swoon.  I'll catch you.
L184319 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ This is empty, just coming!
L184318 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ I can still taste you.
L184315 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ I can't work.  I can't sleep. Lady Hampton calls impatiently.
L184314 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ No.
L184313 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Say you're feeling faint - the sun.
L184312 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ What?  No!
L184311 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Say you're sick.
L184271 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Ownership.  Being owned.  When you leave, you should forget me.
L184270 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ A lie.  What do you hate most?
L184269 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ What do you hate most?
L184268 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Marmite - addicted!  Baths - not with other people!  Islands.  Your handwriting.  I could go on all day.  My husband. Almásy nods.
L184267 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ What else?
L184266 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ What do I love?  I love rice pudding, and water, the fish in it, hedgehogs! The gardens at our house in Freshwater - all my secret paths.
L184265 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Okay.  And what do you love? Say everything.
L184264 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Now.
L184263 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ When were you least happy?
L184262 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Now.
L184261 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ When were you most happy?
L184260 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ That makes it harder still.
L184259 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ A woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she should never admit to it.  Close your eyes.
L184258 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ You don't sew at all!
L184257 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ You sew very badly.
L184256 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Good.
L184255 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ I'm impressed you can sew.
L184253 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ I believe you still have my book.
L184252 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Don't.
L184251 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.
L184250 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Will you please come in?
L184249 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ No.
L184248 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Will you not come in?
L184242 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ No, but I think I do.
L184241 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Do they know them?
L184239 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ No, the marriage isn't a fiction.
L184238 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ And the marriage - is that a fiction? 
L184237 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Geoffrey's not in Cairo.  He's not actually a buffoon.  And the plane wasn't a wedding present. It belongs to the British Government.  They want aerial maps of the whole North Africa. So I think he's in Ethiopia.  In case you were counting on his sudden appearance.
L184235 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Find that plant.  Cut out its heart.
L184234 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Water?  Yes, we have water, we have a little in our can, we have water in the radiator which can be drunk. Not at all cowardly, extremely practical.  Come on, come on!  There's also a plant - I've never seen it but I'm told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the next day it will be filled with a delicious liquid.
L184233 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Of course.  Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
L184232 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Could I ask you, please, to paste you paintings into my book?  I should like to have them.  I should be honored.
L184231 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Oh my God, the others!
L184230 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Madox will have calculated how many miles, they'll soon turn around.
L184228 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ All true.  Herodotus, your friend, tells of a wind - the Simoon - so evil that a nation declared war on it and marched out to fight it in full battle dress, their swords raised.
L184227 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Fiction.  We had a house on that coast and it never rained blood. Go on.  More.
L184226 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ - there is the Harmattan, a red wind. Which Mariners called the sea of darkness.  Red sand from this wind has flown as far as the south coast of England, producing showers so dense they were mistaken for blood. Almasy checks to see if Katharine is still awake.
L184224 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Yes is a comfort.  Absolutely is not.
L184223 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Yes.  Absolutely.
L184222 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Shall we be all right?
L184221 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ No.
L184220 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ This is not very good, is it?
L184219 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ In an hour there will be no stars. The air is filling with sand.
L184218 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ They're so untidy.  I'm just trying to rearrange them.
L184217 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ See what's happening to them - the stars.
L184216 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ What am I looking at?
L184215 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Look over there.
L184214 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ I'm quite all right, thank you.
L184213 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ You should come into the shelter.
L184212 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ And that would be unconscionable, I suppose, to feel any obligation? Yes.  Of course it would.
L184211 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ There's really no need.  This is just a scrapbook.  I should feel obliged.  Thank you.
L184210 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ I'd like you to have them.
L184209 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ We took several photographs, there's no need.
L184208 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ I thought you might paste them into your book.
L184207 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ What's this?
L184190 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Ask Al Auf. Almásy asks Al Auf in Arabic.
L184189 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ I do not.
L184188 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ You sing.  All the time.
L184187 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Pardon?
L184186 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Actually, you sing.
L184157 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Her or me?
L184156 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Be careful?  You mean you - or me? Who?
L184155 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ He said - be careful.
L184154 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ What is he saying?  Come on, what did he say?
L184152 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ The Ostrich is a detour.  A poor man hunts an ostrich, it's the method.  Nothing to do with Zerzura.  To catch an ostrich you must appear not to move.  The man finds a place where the ostrich feeds, a wadi, and stands where the ostrich can see him, on the horizon, and doesn't move, doesn't eat - otherwise the ostrich will run.  At nightfall, he moves, fifty, sixty yards.  When the ostrich comes the next day, the man is there, but he's nearer.  Haunting the ostrich.
L184151 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Sounds perfectly clear.  Where does the Ostrich come in?
L184150 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ A mountain curved like a woman's back, a plateau the shape of an ear.
L184149 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ What do you mean, poetry?
L184148 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ This is an incredible story - about a man hunting an Ostrich, he's been telling me about Zerzura, he thinks he's been there, but his map, the route he's describing, he couldn't survive the journey now, but he's a poet, so his map is poetry - and now we're onto an Ostrich.  I'm telling her your map is poetry. The Arab shrugs.
L184081 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ So why follow me?  Escort me, by all means.  Following me is predatory, isn't it?
L184080 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ As the wife of one of our party.
L184079 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ You felt obliged to.
L184078 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ I was concerned.  As I said, women in that part of Cairo, a European women, I felt obliged to.
L184077 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ After the market, you followed me to the hotel.
