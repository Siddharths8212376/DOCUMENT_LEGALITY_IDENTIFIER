L464151 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ I love you, Nick...
L464150 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Don't say my name...
L464149 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ I'm sorry, Nick... I'm so sorry...
L464146 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ I saved you because I love you, Nick.  Why'd you save me?
L464145 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ You saved me.
L464144 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ You saved my life.  You could have run, but you didn't. You saved me.
L464143 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Shh, now. Rest now. Two years, Nick. You haven't had cranberry buns in two years.
L464142 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ ...Haven't had cranberry buns... in five whole years...
L464141 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ We'll get there, baby... we'll get there...
L464140 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ All I wanted... was to make it home... for a little of Dad's turkey, and Mom's stuffing... Aunt Lisbeth's acorn gravy... Aunt Mary's cranberry buns...
L464139 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Jesus Christ, stay here, don't move, stay right here --
L464102 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Get to the bridge!  HEY! HEY! DOWN HERE!
L464101 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Nick, the ice is --
L464100 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ We get to the bridge, we're all right!
L464066 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ There went my... damn... well, doesn't seem like security's all that switched... Ash, shit, this mustache is starting to fall off. I gotta fix this thing --  -- drink this for me.
L464065 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Nick, what happened --
L464041 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Yeah, uh. Mike. That's Mike.
L464040 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ That guy knows you?
L464039 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Here and there. Restaurant, uh, that's the main expansion. Tables've been moved around; the big man's office, I dunno, might be upstairs now.
L464038 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ So does it look a lot different?
L463987 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Get your own room.
L463986 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Nick...
L463985 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Get your own room, Ashley.
L463984 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ We? What "we"...
L463983 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this...
L463982 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Then they do need me, don't they. They really need me...
L463981 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ They're truck drivers.
L463980 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ They've never done a robbery?
L463978 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Gabriel and his guys. What's the last place they robbed?
L463977 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ What?
L463976 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ And I'm his ticket.  What's the last place they took down?
L463975 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ No. He wants to be working for himself someday.
L463974 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ He working for them on this one?
L463973 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ They run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows some guys in New York, Miami, guys he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides 'em with his regular loads.
L463972 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Since when do some trucker pals start thinking big, anyway?
L463971 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Not without you.
L463970 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ So get him outta your life. Get out of Michigan. They got perfume counters in Chicago, don't they?
L463969 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Nick! He wants to know how to rob it, and he'll leave you alone! That's all he wants!  I hate him, Nick... you know how...
L463968 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Well, shit, Judas, you shoulda at least gotten that --
L463967 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ No!
L463966 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ For what? You to talk me into "helping"? What, he promise you a share of the winnings?
L463965 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ I thought we'd have a few more days.
L463964 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ But you knew why. Knew why, didn't ya.
L463963 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ He said he wanted to talk to you. When he found the letters... he said "when your boyfriend gets out, I wanna talk to him." I thought he meant back in Detroit. I thought he meant --
L463939 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Right, Jack Bangs. Uh... guy was always talking bout fixing the place up. Maybe get a better crowd. Musta gone and done it while I was in the Mountain.  I don't know this map, man. How the hell am I supposed to tell you what door goes where?
L463938 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Jack. Jack Bangs.
L463937 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ They changed the layout -- whadda they call you? Mr. Monster? They remodeled the place. When I worked there -- listen to me -- guy that managed the joint, guy who ran it--
L463880 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Canada.
L463879 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Gabriel!
L463835 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Just tell him what you know, Nick! That's all they want! And we'll get out of this!
L463834 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ ...maybe I die for Nick...
L463833 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ I won't let him hurt you! He just wants what you know!
L463832 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Nick died for me....
L463831 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ If you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. If they think you're not you, they will kill you. Don't you see? I know what you're doing, but it won't work!
L463830 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Your pen palls dead, lady.
L463828 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ I love you!
L463827 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ You're in on this.
L463826 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ No, Nick, no --
L463825 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ You told him about Nick's letters.
L463824 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Nick, please, it's me --
L463823 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ He didn't "find" Nick's letters, did he.
L463822 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ My brother's killed people, I know he has. Truckers. If you talk him into thinking you're not you, you'll only get yourself dead.
L463821 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ You're not hearing me here --
L463820 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ He'll kill you.
L463819 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Nick, it won't work. It won't work!
L463818 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Get the hell off of me!
L463815 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ JESUS CHRIST!
L463814 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Nick, I love you --
L463813 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ I'M NOT NICK!  You thought you'd fuck him over?! Well he's fucked you! I've never worked at some casino! I can't help you! Because he's not me!
L463812 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Nick, what are you --
L463811 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ When'd you decide to do it, Ash? After which of his letters, huh? The fortieth? The fiftieth? The first?!
L463810 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Nick --
L463809 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ You sold him out.
L463808 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Nick, no --
L463807 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ You motherfucker.
L463805 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ What's going ON!!!
L463804 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ He read the letters, Nick. Some day I wasn't there. He went through my room. He found your letters.
L463803 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ What the fuck is going on.
L463802 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Since Janey moved in... Gabriel... he's come over more and more. To the apartment. Janey's the divorced one, 'member, with the tit job --
L463800 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ He's not a bad person, Nick... he's not...
L463799 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ ...the truck driver...
L463798 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Your brother...
L463797 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ I won't let 'em, Nick. They won't hurt you anymore.
L463766 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Nick...
L463765 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ I'm not him. I...  You want something from Nick, you got the wrong guy.
L463747 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ NICK!
L463746 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ NO!
L463731 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ No, lover. I'll see what you can do.
L463730 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ I'll see what I can do.
L463729 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Baby, I'm gonna go tell 'em not to disturb us for the rest of the year. I get back in that room, you better be wearing nothing but a candy cane.
L463725 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Ashley. We're not going anywhere I used to work.
L463724 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ We could live it up and --
L463723 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ We'll have more fun in Detroit.
L463722 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ And the slots, slots I'm good at too. Wouldn't that be fun?
L463721 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --
L463720 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good at. I mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? Since you worked there?
L463719 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Well, I don't know about that --
L463708 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Fifty percent off, motherfucker. Ho ho ho.
L463707 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Beauty and fragrances.
L463706 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ You forget where I work?
L463704 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ You got out, Nick. You're here. You're my Christmas.
L463703 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Baby, c'mon, all this stuff... I haven't gotten you anything --
L463702 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ No boyfriend of mine is going to walk around in negative-five degree wind chill without a goddamn good- looking coat!
L463701 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Ash, you've gotten me enough --
L463700 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ You need a COAT!
L463699 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Yeah, well you wrote me you were six- foot-four, baby.  So don't talk to me about little white lies.
L463698 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Ash... didn't you write me that you don't eat chocolate?
L463697 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Can't survive on our bodies alone, Nick.  Hurry up!
L463696 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Ashley, Jesus --
L463693 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Provisions! We are not leaving that motel room again till after New Year's: we need ten days worth of provisions!  What's good?!
L463692 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Where the hell are you going?
L463690 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Then he shoulda signed his name.
L463689 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Y'know, some of the heart mighta been his too...
L463688 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ I'm talking about the heart, Nick. I'm not talking about the words.
L463687 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Guy I was in with... he helped sometimes... some of the romantic stuff, actually... you'd like him --
L463686 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Yes it was all you --
L463685 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Well, wasn't all me, y'know.
L463684 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Not bad. Just regular.  You wrote me wonderful things, Nick. Personal things.
L463683 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Had some bad relationships, didn't you.
L463682 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn.  A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
L463681 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Tell me again.
L463680 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ I told you, Nick. Remember?
L463679 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Yeah. Me too.  Why? I mean I know why for me, why I paid for the ad. But you... why start writing to some guy -- some con -- you don't even know?
L463678 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
L463677 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ No, not that, no...  I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth.
L463676 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean --
L463675 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Tell me something. This the first time you've ever done this?
L463673 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ I've been dreaming about that smile, Ashley Mercer. For a long time.
L463672 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ No, c'mon --
L463671 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ One more. Smile. One more.
L463670 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ No --
L463669 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Smile.
L463668 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ What.
L463667 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Do that again.
L463666 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ No, no, no. Be like you want to be.
L463665 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
L463664 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Thought you wrote you had a mustache.
L463663 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ You are to me.
L463662 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Ashley, no. That was me, that's what I was scared of. I mean, be serious... I ain't exactly looking like Mr. Universe here.
L463661 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Saw me --
L463660 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ No, hey, I like your coat --
L463659 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Saw my outfit or something, my coat --
L463658 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ No, no --
L463657 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ I figured you walked outta there and saw me and walked right the other way --
L463654 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Radio said.
L463653 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ I don't think it's negative five.
L463652 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Yeah.
L463651 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Negative five?
L463650 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Radio said negative five.
L463649 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Gotta be ten degrees out there.
L464434 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ How'd you know my name.
L464433 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Ash?
L464432 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ How'd you know my name was Rudy.
L464431 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Ash?
L464420 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ How'd you know my name...
L464419 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Get in the CAR!
L464407 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Was it your plan, Monster? Or was it hers.
L464406 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Buncha guys in red suits busted in, they'll say. Started shooting. They won't be able to remember... if it was three, or four... or five. Four dead Santas and some burned-up cash. Merry Christmas, The End.
L464387 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Hey! HEY! THERE IS A POWWOW SAFE!
L464386 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ You are lucky, convict. You're spending Christmas with the birthday boy himself --
L464214 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ What, we walking in there and delivering toys?
L464213 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Can't be attracting attention, right?
L464212 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ 'Tis the season, convict.
L464211 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ You gotta be kidding me.
L464209 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Not cowboys, Nick. Not cowboys.
L464208 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys?
L464207 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ That part, Nick... was planned out the day I read your letters.
L464206 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Well. What you guys have to plan out, then... is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. Running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it.
L464205 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ No gun.
L464203 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ There'll be people in that casino. I can't keep them from leaving if I don't get a gun. I don't need bullets, Monster... but I gotta be a threat.
L464202 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ No, you're not.
L464201 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ I'm no threat without a gun.
L464200 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ No way.
