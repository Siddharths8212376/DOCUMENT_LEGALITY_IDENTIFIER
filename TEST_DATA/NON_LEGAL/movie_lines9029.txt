L154478 +++$+++ u748 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ What're you looking for?
L154477 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Thought I'd let you have first crack... Later.
L154476 +++$+++ u748 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Same old story.  Not interested.
L154475 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Thought so.  Turned out he wanted me for something else though.
L154474 +++$+++ u748 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Must think you're pretty special laying this on you.
L154473 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I didn't.  It was a present from a guy.
L154472 +++$+++ u748 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ INGA +++$+++ Where'd you clip this?
L154191 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Every week.
L154190 +++$+++ u749 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ KENDRA +++$+++ You didn't...
L154189 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.
L154188 +++$+++ u749 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ KENDRA +++$+++ What's with you?  Every week this scumbag puts the squeeze on us and every week you roll out the welcome wagon like he's family.
L154179 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ And for all his cattin' around, not much of a stick man either.
L154178 +++$+++ u749 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ KENDRA +++$+++ What a creep.
L154159 +++$+++ u749 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ KENDRA +++$+++ Yech...
L154158 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ He's a mistake I made about six months before you did.  But don't feel bad. Justine made the same mistake, along with Renee, Jada, Tia, Brooke--
L153967 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Yeah, me too.
L153966 +++$+++ u749 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ KENDRA +++$+++ Thanks, it's starting to kick in.  I feel almost human.
L153965 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I made you coffee.  That oughta help you cope with the injustice of the world a little.
L154611 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Hang on, Lauren.  We're conferencing in Sophy.
L154610 +++$+++ u750 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LAUREN +++$+++ Hello...
L154609 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Look, we gotta keep the momentum up here, not give her a chance to think.  If she hears her kid's voice...
L154557 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Like I said-- This isn't my regular line of work so I'm making it up as I go.
L154556 +++$+++ u750 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LAUREN +++$+++ What else can we do?
L154555 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ We're not going that route.  Sonrisa's not someone you make deals with.
L154554 +++$+++ u750 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LAUREN +++$+++ If I give myself up in exchange for Sophy, would you make sure she's okay?
L154551 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Look, I'd really like to...
L154550 +++$+++ u750 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LAUREN +++$+++ Can you help me get her back?
L154549 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Your daughter's the only leverage they have to keep you quiet.
L154547 +++$+++ u750 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LAUREN +++$+++ I couldn't get to her.  It all happened so fast.  Logan had her, and I saw him fall...then Peter told me to run.  And then he...and I remember so clearly, thinking it's me they want.  If I run, maybe they'll come after me.  Maybe they won't think about her... So I ran...
L154546 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I know.
L154545 +++$+++ u750 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LAUREN +++$+++ They took my daughter.
L154544 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Damn... Are you alright?
L154123 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ SHHH!  Don't do that!
L154122 +++$+++ u750 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LAUREN +++$+++ Oh my God!  In here!  IN HERE!
L154621 +++$+++ u750 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LAUREN +++$+++ There's nothing to be afraid of. Everything's going to be alright.
L154620 +++$+++ u758 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ SOPHY +++$+++ Mommy, I'm scared.
L154619 +++$+++ u750 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LAUREN +++$+++ Soon, baby.
L154618 +++$+++ u758 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ SOPHY +++$+++ When?
L154617 +++$+++ u750 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LAUREN +++$+++ Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.
L154616 +++$+++ u758 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ SOPHY +++$+++ Mommy, where are you?
L154615 +++$+++ u750 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LAUREN +++$+++ Sophy?  Are you okay?
L154442 +++$+++ u758 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ SOPHY +++$+++ Then I'm gonna do what you do to make me feel better when I'm sad.
L154441 +++$+++ u750 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LAUREN +++$+++ Pretty much the same reasons I was crying.  But things will be better when we move to a new place.
L154440 +++$+++ u758 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ SOPHY +++$+++ If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me.
L154439 +++$+++ u750 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LAUREN +++$+++ What makes you cry?
L154438 +++$+++ u758 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ SOPHY +++$+++ Then how come last night I heard you talking to Logan and you were crying?
L154437 +++$+++ u750 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LAUREN +++$+++ No...
L154436 +++$+++ u758 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ SOPHY +++$+++ Are we in some kind of trouble?
L154435 +++$+++ u750 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LAUREN +++$+++ Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.
L154434 +++$+++ u758 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ SOPHY +++$+++ But why can't we stay here?
L154433 +++$+++ u750 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LAUREN +++$+++ I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends--
L154432 +++$+++ u758 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ SOPHY +++$+++ I don't want to move away.
L154431 +++$+++ u750 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LAUREN +++$+++ Goodnight Bears.  Goodnight chairs. Goodnight kittens.  Goodnight mittens. Goodnight clocks.  And goodnight socks. Goodnight little house.  And goodnight--
L154748 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Zack... He made it... He's alive...
L154747 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ That was taken nine years ago... I.D.'d as Michael Hanover.  Sentenced to 18 months in the state penn at Rawlins, Wyoming for armed robbery.  He escaped from custody after 4 days.  Hasn't been seen or heard from since.
L154746 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ And whether you want to believe it or not, you already fired the first shot.  On another matter, Federal Corrections used to keep records on distinguishing marks-- scars, tattoos.  I did a search and came up with this.
L154745 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Civilization as we know it is unraveling before our eyes.  But Logan and Max, with a song in their hearts are gonna march into battle to keep that from happening.
L154744 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ With your help.
L154743 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ And you still think you can do something to change that.
L154742 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe, sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation.  But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden.  Wasn't s'posed to, but it did.  And it's back to the law of the jungle.  You got your predators and you got your victims.
L154741 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ We're quoting Mom again.
L154740 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ You are involved.  By being alive you're involved.
L154739 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ And I feel real bad about all that but it doesn't mean I need to get involved.
L154738 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ These girls, kidnapped during the last month and sold overseas to the highest bidder.  The oldest is twelve.  The youngest about the same age you were when you escaped.
L154737 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Look, thank you for this but--
L154736 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Forty-seven people drowned last night off the coast of Vancouver after paying smugglers twenty thousand apiece to get into Canada so they could get work in order to eat.  Only they got marched overboard at gunpoint instead.
L154735 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Deeds, not words.  I need your help.
L154734 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I don't know what to say.
L154733 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ It turned up on the black market.  One of my sources thought I might be interested.
L154732 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Open it.
L154731 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ What's this?
L154730 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ That's what soldiers do, right?
L154729 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ On accounta you, Sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. He's gone.  Once and for all.  It was war, Max, and you won.
L154728 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Well, not me personally.
L154727 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I've never been much for trying to understand why bad things happen, I just know they do.  So the job's to figure out how to deal with the consequences.  Which you did... You took that sonuvabitch out.
L154726 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You believe that?
L154725 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ My mother used to say the universe is right on schedule.  Everything happens like it's supposed to.
L154724 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L154723 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.
L154722 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I would've come sooner, but...I didn't... How're you doin'?
L154721 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Somebody's got to.
L154720 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ See you're back and still rocking the boat.
L154471 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ That's deep.  But before you lecture me about the meaning of life maybe you oughta get one...ta ta.
L154470 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ You're a soldier, Max.  That's what you were put here for.  But soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up.
L154469 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ They've lost track of me and I plan to keep it that way.
L154468 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ They want me...bad.  Or at least they don't want me grabbed up by the Chinese or whoever.  Best case, I wind up back in that facility.  More likely, it's a long drive out in the country, if you know what I mean.
L154467 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
L154466 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
L154465 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ So, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... I'm turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow.  They'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down.
L154464 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Yeah, I catch your hacks.  He's Satan's lap dog, or something.
L154463 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ She's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa's managers.  You know who Sonrisa is?
L154462 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ That's low, but this effects me how exactly?
L154461 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ The woman you met, Lauren.  She supervised workers removing cortodiazapine from gel caps by hand and replacing it with powdered sugar.  The real drug was shipped out of the country. The placebos were distributed to County VA Hospital and six veterans' clinics in the area.
L154460 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I already don't like the sound of this.
L154459 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Your help.
L154458 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ What's in it for you?
L154457 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I need to find this technician, or anyone else who knows about Project Manticore. They would've used surrogate mothers to carry you after the in-vitro work... If I can track down one of them.
L154456 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You said you could help.
L154455 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Like extra virgin olive oil, the best of the best.
L154454 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Christmas is a snap when you got no parents or relatives, just a bunch of gene sequences from probably twenty different people.
L154453 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Hardly...
L154452 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Your basic hodge-podge.
L154451 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ A girl.
L154450 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Yeah...a made-up creature.  Like in mythology...with the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of...
L154449 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ The technical term for you is "chimera"...
L154448 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I know they made me.  Even got the label on my neck to prove it.
L154447 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ How much do you know?
L154446 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.
L154445 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ How well do you remember the lab?
L154444 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ We got separated right away.  I never knew how many made it.
L154427 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ The bar code on your neck, Max.  I know who you are and I know who you're running from.
L154426 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Not that I don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me?
L154425 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ He was working on something called Project Manticore, which was using recombinant DNA to produce a superior human...a warrior...an advanced infantry soldier.
L154424 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I don't know what kind of game you're playing here but I'm out because you are a whack-job.
L154422 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You did go through my stuff.
L154421 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ L-Triptophane...a neurotransmitter sometimes used in homeopathy to control seizures.  Then the lightbulb went off.
L154420 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ C'mon, Max.  First I watch you dive headfirst out the window fifteen stories up like you're Rocky the flying squirrel. Then, I found this in your apartment.
L154419 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You lost me.
L154418 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ The other one like you...
L154417 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ The other ones?
L154416 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Suppose I could help you locate the other ones.
L154413 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Only when I meet someone I have to know everything about.
L154412 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Expensive gifts, surprise late-night visits, over-the-top flattery... You always come on this strong?
L154410 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ No, I meant this.
L154409 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Gold leaf, art nouveau, French, early nineteen hundreds... I could probably fence this for three or four grand.
L154408 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ C'mere, I want to show you something.
L154407 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You need to get out more.
L154406 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I haven't been able to get you off my mind.
L154405 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You'd think a guy who's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl.
L154404 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I'm sorry.  It wasn't my intention.  But I had to see you.
L154403 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Yes on all counts.
L154402 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Look, if I made you nervous or uncomfortable or creeped you out--
L154399 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ We are not fine.
L154398 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ It's alright, Peter, we're fine.
L154397 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Whoa there, Tex!  We've been through all this.
L154396 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ You're that nervous, you're welcome to stay here.
L154395 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ How'm I s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched everything I own?
L154394 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ That would be appropriate, yes.
L154393 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Am I s'posed to be grateful?
L154392 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ So saw my hands off, I left you a present.
L154391 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ How do I know you didn't?
L154390 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ You make it sound I pawed through your priceless collection of underwear.
L154389 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Bent.
L154388 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Bent?
L154387 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Completely different situation.  I steal things in order to sell them.  For money. It's called commerce.  But some stranger sneaking into a girl's bedroom is...bent.
L154386 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Me?  You're the one who tried to rip off this piece.
L154385 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You got a lotta nerve.
L154384 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ It was open.
L154383 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Like following me around and pestering the people I work with wasn't bad enough, but breaking into my apartment--
L154382 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I'm not a half bad cook.
L154381 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I won't be staying.
L154380 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time?
L154313 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Yeah...
L154312 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Is the social studies class over for today?
L154311 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.
L154310 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about.
L154309 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Something.
L154308 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ So what are you gonna do about it?
L154307 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ People had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  And now they don't.
L154306 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You miss the good ol' days.  Even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn't have to. And rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat.  Those good ol' days?
L154305 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Look around at all this...  Built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life.  Then the bomb happened and everyone got scared.  They blinked and before they knew it they'd given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands.  Overnight the government, the police, everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them.
L154304 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?
L154303 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
L154302 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ What's your shot in all this?  Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.
L154301 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ One of my sources.  Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.
L154300 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Girlfriend?
L154299 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Lauren's not my wife.
L154298 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?
L154297 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Too early to tell.
L154296 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ So now you tracked me down.  What d'ya think?
L154295 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Now you know who I am, where I live.  I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me.
L154294 +++$+++ u753 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?
L154293 +++$+++ u751 +++$+++ m48 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Wasn't that hard.
