L95176 +++$+++ u4128 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ What can I do for you guys?
L95128 +++$+++ u4128 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ It's your grass.
L95127 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What the fuck is that?
L95126 +++$+++ u4128 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ I guess not.  Okay.  You know, you're very lucky you're friends of Barbie's. If you weren't, I'd never talk to you.
L95125 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
L95124 +++$+++ u4128 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
L95123 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ No.
L95122 +++$+++ u4128 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?
L95121 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ We want some grass.
L95120 +++$+++ u4128 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ What can I do for you guys?
L95858 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Get me a six pack.
L95857 +++$+++ u4129 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DETECTIVE #1 +++$+++ What's that?
L95856 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Oh hey, one more thing?
L95855 +++$+++ u4129 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DETECTIVE #1 +++$+++ George?  You better get yourself a good lawyer this time.  We're gonna nail your ass to the wall on this one.
L95853 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Fuck you, then.  I sign nothing.
L95852 +++$+++ u4129 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DETECTIVE #1 +++$+++ No fucking way.
L95851 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I want my kid out of protective custody. Now.  No fucking around.  My wife and my kid on a plane tonight.  I sign when they call me safe and sound.
L95778 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ George, don't be so emotional.  This is business.  Besides, I can't kill you, you are my brother.
L95777 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You'd better kill me now, Diego, because you're a dead man.
L95774 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I talked to Foreal, Diego.
L95773 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ No, I never.  I would not do that, George.  Never.
L95772 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You went behind my back and you cut me out.
L95771 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ I did not.
L95770 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You fucked me, Diego.
L95769 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ Of course we are brothers.  Why do you say that?   You hurt me, George.
L95768 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ No more brothers, Diego.
L95767 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ George, I am happy to see you.  How are you, my brother?
L95724 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Derek Foreal.  Derek Foreal.  Derek fucking Foreal.  Alright?  The answer to all your dreams.  Are you happy now?
L95723 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ What?
L95722 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Derek Foreal.
L95720 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ Es un Ford blanco junto a una pick-up.
L95719 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Estoy bien, okay?  Everything is alright.  There's no problem.  Okay? This never happened.  No one has to know anything about this.  Diego, I want you to calmly tell them where the fucking coke is.  Do it now.
L95717 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ Que es lo que quieren de me, hijueputas campesinos?
L95716 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Take it easy!  Everything's okay!
L95708 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ This is not the time, Diego.
L95707 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ Everything is not alright.  I bring you in, and you slap my fucking face!
L95706 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Nothing.  Todo esta bien.
L95700 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ I'm driving you crazy?  No.  You're driving me crazy.  We had a dream.  What happened to our dream?
L95699 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Jesus fucking Christ, Diego.  I ain't telling you.  It's just business.  Now, shut up.  You're driving me crazy.
L95698 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ What do I do with it?  Nothing.  It's for peace of mind.  It's for the principle.
L95697 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What do you need my connection for, Diego?  What are you going to do with it?
L95696 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ I'm very angry with you, George.  Very angry.  You don't take me to California, but you take your bitch wife?  A woman? I understand you love her, but it was you and me who started this.  You and me.
L95695 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Shut up, Diego.  They're going to be here any minute.  I'm trying to concentrate.
L95694 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ Three years.  How long have we been in business?  Three years.  Does she get to meet your connection?  Was she good enough?
L95644 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I love you too, man.
L95643 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ I love you, my brother, do you know that?
L95642 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You're a lucky man, Diego.
L95641 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ I'm married, George.  Me.  I can't believe it.  Can you believe I'm married, George?
L95637 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ Then relax.  It's a federal bank. Guaranteed by the government.  And Senor Noriega has very lenient banking principles.  No questions.  No problems. All the pesados keep their money here. Even El Padrino.  What do you worry? Everyone knows we are with Escobar.  Who is going to fuck with us?
L95636 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks.
L95635 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ George, we've got sixty-one million dollars.  It's either here or someplace else.  We've got to put it somewhere. Unless you want to launder it.
L95634 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Are you comfortable with this?
L95632 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ Try the closet.
L95631 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ There's no room.
L95630 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ Try the back bedroom.
L95629 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Where do I put this!?
L95628 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I don't give a shit.  Close enough.
L95627 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ Weight it.  If it's sixty pounds, it's three.  If it's fifty, it's two-point five.
L95626 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Fuck it.  I'm not counting it again.
L95625 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ We're half a million off.
L95624 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'm calling it three.
L95623 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ It's two-point-five, George.  I am sure.
L95622 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Three million.  I counted it twice.
L95579 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yeah.  You do the talking.
L95578 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ Who?  I need to know.  Ah, never mind. We'll talk about it later.
L95577 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Just a friend.
L95576 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ Right.  Now who is the person in California?  The connection?
L95575 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yeah.  Keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking.
L95574 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ Pablo used his influence.  Now, George, watch what you say.  Everybody hears everything.  A lot of things get said and done that, well, let's just say this isn't America.  Life is cheap here, you know?  No offense, but you know what I'm saying?
L95573 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What the fuck is going on?  When did you get out of jail?
L95572 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ George, good to see you, my brother.
L95564 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ But to the victor belong the spoils.
L95563 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ Touche.
L95562 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I think it's fair to say you underestimated the market there, Derek.
L95561 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ Thirty-six hours.  I can't believe it. Everything is gone in thirty-six hours.
L95559 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Just sell it, Derek.
L95558 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ Jesus Christ, George, I don't see you in two years, and you show up at my door with a hundred and ten pounds of cocaine?
L95546 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Well, you better get here fast.  I'm sitting on...
L95545 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ Bad news, George.  I'm in Colombia.
L95544 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you? It's been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money.
L95543 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ George.
L95533 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ I need you to go to Miami.
L95532 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What is it, George?  Because I have to get home.  I've got a parole officer waiting for me.
L95531 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ This is only part of the business, George.  A very small part.  Don't worry, there is so much more to do. Which reminds me, I need a favor from you.  I must go to Colombia.
L95530 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ That's my George, always thinking.
L95529 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ And what happens when these guys stop paying?  Sooner or later, these guys are going to cut us out.  Then where are we?
L95528 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ I know.
L95527 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ It is bad.  It's chump change.  We might as well be hauling suitcases across the border.  We're getting screwed.
L95526 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ A million dollars for our first run is not bad, George.
L95525 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What's the matter?  We're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we're making dogshit.
L95524 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ What's the matter, George?
L95502 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ We make the pick-up, refuel once more in the Bahamas, and fly back on Sunday with the mom and pop traffic.
L95501 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ Please, continue.
L95468 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Okay.
L95467 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ Fifteen kilos.  Seven and a half in each suitcase.  You receive a hundred thousand dollars upon delivery.
L95466 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ Yes.  Look around you.  The sun.  The water.  The women.  It's better than Danbury, no?  Come on.  I have some friends I would like you to meet.
L95465 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Good to see you, Diego.
L95464 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ George, are we gonna do this or not?
L95463 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I just got released five minutes ago.
L95462 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ But you must.  It's the only way.
L95461 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I can't go anywhere, Diego.  I'm on parole.  I can't leave the state.
L95460 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ You need to come down here, everybody meets everybody.  Ho ho ho.  Ha ha ha. We do one for good faith and then we talk about airplanes.
L95459 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ Slow down, George.  Slow down.
L95458 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Do we need a plane?  How does this work? When do I see you?
L95457 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ Perfect, George.  Perfect.  Everything is fine down here.  Everything is all set up.
L95456 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ How are we doing?
L95455 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ Congratulations, brother.  I've been waiting for you.
L95454 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yeah, I'm out.
L95453 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ George, hallo!  Today is the day, ah? Are you out?
L95452 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Diego?  It's George.
L95451 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ Allo?
L95450 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Diego Delgado, please?
L95449 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ Great.  I love the Bahamas.
L95448 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ We'll refuel in the Bahamas.  I know someone there.
L95447 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ Fifteen hundred.  We'll have to stop somewhere to refuel.
L95446 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I don't know.  A hundred, hundred and fifty.  How many miles is it from Colombia to Miami?
L95445 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ How many kilos can we fit in these planes?
L95444 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Four passenger, single engine Cessna.
L95443 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ What type of planes do you have?
L95442 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ Don't worry.  We will talk of everything.  We have the time.  You arrive here with a Bachelor of Marijuana, but you will leave with a Doctorate of Cocaine.
L95441 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Getting it here is no problem.  Trust me.  I'll fly it in myself if I have to. What about supply?  How much can we get?
L95440 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ Now do you see what I am saying?
L95439 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Jesus Christ.  Jesus fucking Christ.
L95438 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ Yes.  And a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana. Everything is the same, George, except instead of thousands, you are making millions.
L95437 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Oh my G-d.
L95436 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ And that's wholesale.  Cut it a few times and retail, you're looking at two, three-hundred thousand.
L95435 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ That's over fifty-thousand dollars profit per kilo.
L95434 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ No, no.  That is where you are wrong. For us, it is cheap.  In Medellin, we buy for six-thousand dollars a kilo.  IN Miami, we sell for sixty.
L95433 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good thing going already.  Everybody smokes pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich man's drug.  It's too expensive.
L95432 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ George?  What do you know about cocaine?
L95431 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ You failed because you had the wrong dream.
L95430 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Because they caught me?
L95429 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ No, my brother.
L95428 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Because I got caught.
L95427 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ Yes, you have a dream.  And maybe you accomplish your dream.  But yet you failed.  Why?
L95426 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I would if I could get some sleep.
L95425 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ In my country, I am a magico.  A man with a dream.  A man on the rise.  To take nothing and make it something, okay?  I have failed my dream, but I will accomplish.  That is why I am in your country.  Yes, I lose my freedom. But they do not take my dream.  Do you have a dream, George?
L95424 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Good night.
L95423 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ You like to make the boundaries disappear.  It's not only the money, is it, George?  The adventure is part of the victory.  It's the thrill, ah?
L95422 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'm tired, Diego.  Go to bed.
L95421 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ I never believed you were a murderer.  I knew.  I knew you are a magico.  I have seen it in you.  It's in your spirit.
L95404 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What's the other one?
L95403 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ Only two ways I know to leave here early.  One is to escape.
L95402 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I've got to get out of here, Diego.
L95401 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ Twenty-six months?  For murder?  I must be your lawyer.
L95400 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Twenty-six months.
L95399 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ You have your intrigues.  I have mine. This is a happy day for me, George. Nine months from today, I will be in Medellin sipping champagne.  In nine months, I am free.  How much time do you have?
L95398 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I thought you said we were roommates. That we should talk about everything.
L95397 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ Never mind.  Not for you to worry.
L95396 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What kind of project?
L95395 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ Nothing.  Just a little project.
L95394 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What do you got there, Diego?
L95393 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ Ah, yes.  The murder.
L95392 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Murder.
L95391 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ Oh, come on, George.  If we are to be friends, we must trust each other.
L95390 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ Me, too.  Too much blah, blah, blah, blah is no good.  But we are roommates, okay?  And we must talk to each other. I am arrested for stealing cars.  For the grand theft auto.  Okay?  So, now it is your turn.  Now you will tell me, okay?  You will tell me why you are here?
L95389 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I don't like a lot of conversation, Diego.
L95388 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ No?
L95387 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Not really, no.
L95386 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ Intriguing.  I see.  Would you like to know my crime?
L95385 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I don't want to talk about it.
L95384 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ Your offense?  Why are you here?
L95383 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What?
L95382 +++$+++ u4130 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DIEGO +++$+++ If you don't mind me asking, what is the reason you are in this place?
L95811 +++$+++ u4131 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DR. BAY +++$+++ Oh, Jesus, Get me a 12-lead e.k.g. and start an i.v. stat!  This man is having a heart attack.
L95810 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Today.
L95809 +++$+++ u4131 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DR. BAY +++$+++ In how long?  A week?
L95808 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.
L95807 +++$+++ u4131 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DR. BAY +++$+++ Cocaine?  How much?
L95806 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Coke.
L95805 +++$+++ u4131 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ DR. BAY +++$+++ He's in tachycardia.  George, your heart is racing.  Have you been using drugs?
L95863 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Mom.
L95862 +++$+++ u4132 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ ERMINE +++$+++ Tell him I don't want to see him.  Tell him he's not welcome here.
