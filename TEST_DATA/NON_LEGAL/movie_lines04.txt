L2258 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ ... and also to bring medicine.
L2257 +++$+++ u25 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ UTAPAN +++$+++ Chief says -- he has a God.
L2256 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ To bring the word of God.
L2255 +++$+++ u25 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ UTAPAN +++$+++ Why?
L2254 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Thousands.
L2253 +++$+++ u25 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ UTAPAN +++$+++ Chief says -- how many?
L2251 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
L2250 +++$+++ u25 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ UTAPAN +++$+++ Chief knows.
L2249 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Tell the Chief we thank him.
L2248 +++$+++ u25 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ UTAPAN +++$+++ You come!  You speak first!
L2239 +++$+++ u25 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ UTAPAN +++$+++ Island.  Far.
L2238 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
L2237 +++$+++ u25 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ UTAPAN +++$+++ Say not here!  Cuba!
L2535 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ I don't know... I have the impression that I didn't change that much.  I still can't accept the world as it is!
L2534 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ Oh?  So you are a new man?
L2533 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ New worlds create new people.
L2532 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ I knew you would.
L2531 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ I have to disagree.
L2526 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ You'll always be older than me, Father.
L2525 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ I suppose we're both old men now.
L2145 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Give me absolution.
L2144 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ I believed in you...
L2143 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ You are bound by an oath, Father.
L2142 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
L2141 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...
L2140 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!
L2139 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
L2138 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ How long?
L2137 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
L2136 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ What are you saying?
L2135 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
L2134 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ I am listening, my son.
L2133 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Forgive me, Father.  For I have sinned.
L2132 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
L2046 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ Colon!  Don't!
L2045 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ All of them!  Just lies!
L2042 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Damn all of you!  You all set up theories based on what?  You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out!  Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to!
L2041 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ Colon!
L2040 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Damn God!
L2039 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ If God intends you to go, then you will go.
L2038 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
L2037 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
L1969 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son.
L1968 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
L1967 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
L1966 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Passion is something one cannot control!
L1965 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ Father Marchena!
L1964 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
L1963 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.
L1962 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ So was Christ!
L1961 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ Esdras is a Jew.
L1960 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
L1959 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ How can you be so certain?
L1958 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
L1957 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.
L1952 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ To open a new route to Asia.  At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...
L1951 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ Why do you wish to sail west?
L1950 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
L1949 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ How did you manage it?
L1948 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ That's what it says.
L1947 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ God... That's in a week!
L1943 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him.  And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.
L1942 +++$+++ u19 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MARCHENA +++$+++ Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers...
L2459 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am.
L2458 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
L2457 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Thank you.
L2456 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ But without your brothers.  Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies.  You may explore the continent.
L2280 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
L2279 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ Do they have such thoughts?
L2086 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
L2085 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ How old are you, Senor Colon?
L2082 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ A woman?
L2081 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
L2080 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
L2079 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ May I speak freely?
L2077 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Surely you can do anything you want.
L2076 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
L2075 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ That she was impregnable.
L2074 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ What did they say about Granada before today?
L2073 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ The ocean is uncrossable?
L2072 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
L2071 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.
L2389 +++$+++ u21 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MOXICA +++$+++ You will regret this.
L2388 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
L2387 +++$+++ u21 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MOXICA +++$+++ Savagery is what monkeys understand.
L2386 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!
L2348 +++$+++ u21 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MOXICA +++$+++ You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not my horse.
L2347 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Don Moxica -- we all have to work.
L2346 +++$+++ u21 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MOXICA +++$+++ My horse doesn't work.
L2345 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ We can't raise the wheel without it.
L2333 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ We came here to stay!  To build! Not to start a crusade.  In this forest, there is enough danger to sweep us away in days!  So we will be brave and swallow our grief.  And in the name of those who died, we will accomplish what we came for.
L2332 +++$+++ u21 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MOXICA +++$+++ We don't need to know.
L2331 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ You want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill?  Which tribe?
L2329 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
L2328 +++$+++ u21 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MOXICA +++$+++ We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood.
L2278 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
L2277 +++$+++ u21 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MOXICA +++$+++ And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
L2492 +++$+++ u20 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MENDEZ +++$+++ We can't be.
L2491 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
L2490 +++$+++ u20 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MENDEZ +++$+++ What's he doing?
L2165 +++$+++ u20 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MENDEZ +++$+++ Twenty eight.
L2164 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ What do you read?
L2160 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Come over here.
L2159 +++$+++ u20 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MENDEZ +++$+++ Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.
L2158 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ And what do you think Mendez?
L2157 +++$+++ u20 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MENDEZ +++$+++ Well... It's the men, Sir.  They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...
L2155 +++$+++ u20 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ MENDEZ +++$+++ God be with us admiral.
L2154 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us...
L2211 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ You're right.  Let the men decide.
L2210 +++$+++ u22 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ PINZON +++$+++ You tell that to them!
L2209 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!
L2208 +++$+++ u22 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ PINZON +++$+++ You bloody...
L2207 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
L2206 +++$+++ u22 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ PINZON +++$+++ Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
L2205 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
L2204 +++$+++ u22 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ PINZON +++$+++ You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
L2203 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ The land is there.  I know it!
L2202 +++$+++ u22 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ PINZON +++$+++ We're lost!
L2201 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ You think I don't know that?
L2200 +++$+++ u22 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ PINZON +++$+++ We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
L2199 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
L2198 +++$+++ u22 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ PINZON +++$+++ You must be mad...!
L2197 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Six days ago, yes.
L2196 +++$+++ u22 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ PINZON +++$+++ You lied!  You cheated!  We're way past 750 leagues!
L2065 +++$+++ u22 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ PINZON +++$+++ Immediately.
L2064 +++$+++ u16 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ COLUMBUS +++$+++ Where can I meet this man?
L2462 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ Because he is not afraid of me.
L2461 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Then why?
L2460 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.
L2419 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ And who would you think of, for such a task?
L2418 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ He must be replaced.
L2417 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?
L2415 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ Is this true, Brother Buyl?
L2414 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ ... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
L2377 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we?  We must have faith.  We must give time for time.
L2376 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.
L2116 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!
L2115 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ ... Into a monk...
L2113 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Never, Your Majesty.  Although...
L2112 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.
L1931 +++$+++ u24 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ SANCHEZ +++$+++ Yes, Your Majesty.
L1930 +++$+++ u18 +++$+++ m1 +++$+++ ISABEL +++$+++ Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
L3546 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!
L3545 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ ...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...
L3497 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.
L3496 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ I'm abused.  Don't you think?
L3493 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ Can I see your back?
L3492 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Out on my back when I was a small boy.
L3491 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ Your father put cigarettes out on you?
L3490 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ That's what he did to me.  He put cigarettes out on me.
L3489 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?
L3488 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
L3487 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...
L3486 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ Back in the Czech Republic?
L3485 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
L3484 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ Your mother was blind?
L3483 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
L3482 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.
L3481 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Give me another one, please.
L3480 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
L3479 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ What else do you need?
L3478 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.
L3477 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
L3476 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ But it's...
L3475 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ No.  No way.
L3474 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ I would say...half.  Half is fair.
L3473 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ What's your cut?  How much?
L3472 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
L3471 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
L3470 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
L3469 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ No, he is here.  Shit...
L3468 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
L3467 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ What about Oleg?
L3466 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
L3465 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ I was all of these.
L3464 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ ...delusions and paranoia.
L3461 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ Oh, sure.
L3460 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ You bring the cigarettes?
L3459 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ I brought you some letters.  It's really fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check.
L3396 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ I'm invoking rights - this man is represented by counsel.  I'm coming with him.
L3395 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Yes.  Yes, come with me!
L3394 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ I'm coming with you.
L3393 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Where are we going?
L3392 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ Don't say anything.
L3385 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ He has the camera!  He took the movie!
L3384 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?
L3383 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Oh no!  No!  Shit!
L3382 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Here.  I have your money.
L3381 +++$+++ u26 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ CUTLER +++$+++ I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
L3380 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil.  I'm insane.
L3517 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Daphne, I...
L3516 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ I don't want to drag you down with me.
L3515 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ ...Do you really want me to forget about you?
L3514 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.
L3330 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ Pouring it out!
L3329 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ What are you doing?
L3318 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ I'll get my clothes.
L3317 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ I'll make some for us.
L3316 +++$+++ u27 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ DAPHNE +++$+++ In the kitchen.
L3315 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Do you have coffee?
