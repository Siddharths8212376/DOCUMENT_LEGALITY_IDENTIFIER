L352256 +++$+++ u6302 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.
L352255 +++$+++ u6313 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What can I do for you?
L352254 +++$+++ u6302 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ Sure is.
L352253 +++$+++ u6313 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Is that you, Dean?
L352252 +++$+++ u6302 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ That's no way to answer the phone.
L352251 +++$+++ u6313 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Yeah?
L352312 +++$+++ u6306 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Furry muff, let's go.
L352311 +++$+++ u6302 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.
L352310 +++$+++ u6306 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there.
L352309 +++$+++ u6302 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ We gotta get those guns.
L352270 +++$+++ u6302 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ We're in the spite. They were his fucking guns that we sold; we gotta find 'em.
L352269 +++$+++ u6306 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Jesus, I have heard about him.
L352268 +++$+++ u6302 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ That was Hatchet Horrible Harry.
L352267 +++$+++ u6306 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Who was that?
L351891 +++$+++ u6306 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ It just cost me fifty quid to have this done.  If you think I am going to ruin it for a couple of old bastards you're mistaken, Kenny.
L351890 +++$+++ u6302 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ Can't you pull that stocking down further, Kenny?
L351889 +++$+++ u6306 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ All right, Kenny.
L351888 +++$+++ u6302 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ OK Gary, we call each other Kenny, all right?
L352275 +++$+++ u6310 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ But...  Give it us here, you dozy sod. You hide and get the guns ready. Wait until they are well in, then give it to 'em.
L352274 +++$+++ u6303 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DOG +++$+++ We're not going next door until we've flayed these dead men walking. Count it out the back. I don't want them seeing you fingering that money as soon as they walk in.
L352273 +++$+++ u6310 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Shit, Dog, there's a lot. Don't you want to do this next door?
L352272 +++$+++ u6303 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DOG +++$+++ The stupid bastards! Count it!
L352271 +++$+++ u6310 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Dog, I have found the cash!
L352240 +++$+++ u6303 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DOG +++$+++ In fact it is a little more than a bit of a problem, isn't it? You could say that in the scale of these things this is the Mount fucking Everest of problems, couldn't you? . . . And the reason it is such a mon fucking-strosity of a problem is because you don't have the first fucking idea who did this to us, do you?
L352239 +++$+++ u6310 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Er well, yes we do.
L352238 +++$+++ u6303 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DOG +++$+++ So we have a bit of a problem, don't we?
L352229 +++$+++ u6303 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DOG +++$+++ It is too late for you to start thinking John. It is a possibility and that is good enough for me. And after you strip the house, I want you to get every thieving slag this side of Ceylon and torture them, badly. I want to know who is responsible, otherwise I will hold you responsible.
L352228 +++$+++ u6310 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em.
L352227 +++$+++ u6303 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DOG +++$+++ I want you to search the house for bugs. I mean I want you to strip it.
L352161 +++$+++ u6303 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DOG +++$+++ How about you? All right?
L352160 +++$+++ u6315 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ PLANK +++$+++ My neck, Dog.  That's the last bag?
L352135 +++$+++ u6303 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DOG +++$+++ OK, open the gate.
L352134 +++$+++ u6315 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ PLANK +++$+++ Yeah, one of them's out.
L352118 +++$+++ u6303 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DOG +++$+++ Who are you going to kill Plank? There's no one there.
L352117 +++$+++ u6315 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ PLANK +++$+++ Don't you stags move or I'll kill the lot of ya.
L352114 +++$+++ u6303 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DOG +++$+++ Just give me the keys.
L352113 +++$+++ u6315 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ PLANK +++$+++ It must be this one.
L352110 +++$+++ u6315 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ PLANK +++$+++ I didn't touch him, he just passed out.
L352109 +++$+++ u6303 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DOG +++$+++ What the fuck did you do to Fauntleroy?
L352108 +++$+++ u6315 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ PLANK +++$+++ Just hold on, I got the keys.
L352107 +++$+++ u6303 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DOG +++$+++ 
L352058 +++$+++ u6303 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DOG +++$+++ And it better bloody not be. Once he is firmly in place, he gets the rest of us in. We'll get nasty with a couple of them, shit 'em up, scare and gag 'em. I can't see these wankers giving us a problem, but they might have a couple of tools hanging around like any cowboy. When the job is done we'll come straight back here. It's dark by then, unload and Robert's your father's brother. Everybody savvy?
L352057 +++$+++ u6315 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ PLANK +++$+++ No.
L352056 +++$+++ u6303 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DOG +++$+++ What's that idiot doing next door?  We use your van. It's up some stairs this place, so we'll stick out like balls on a bulldog. Plank is going up first. There is a cage but it is never locked, is it Plank?
L352055 +++$+++ u6303 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DOG +++$+++ There is no such thing as easy in my experience and, if you think this is going to be easy, you're a dick. It may be easier than most but it's not going to be easy.
L352054 +++$+++ u6315 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ PLANK +++$+++ There's nothing to worry about, it's going to be easy.
L351983 +++$+++ u6315 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ PLANK +++$+++ Even if they could they'd be too shit scared. They have got no muscle; they're gutless faggots.
L351982 +++$+++ u6303 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DOG +++$+++ Is there no way they can get back to you?
L351981 +++$+++ u6315 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ PLANK +++$+++ I must have been there fifty times, it's never been locked; they're not suspicious. Everybody who goes there are toffs. They're all into that karma crap: `If I don't harm nobody, nobody harms me' stuff.
L351980 +++$+++ u6303 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DOG +++$+++ What do you mean, never? Well what have they got it for, then?
L351979 +++$+++ u6315 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ PLANK +++$+++ There's one steel gate as you go in but they never lock it.
L351972 +++$+++ u6315 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ PLANK +++$+++ Poofs. Nothing heavy, four public school guys. Soft as shite.
L351971 +++$+++ u6303 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DOG +++$+++ What they like then?
L351970 +++$+++ u6315 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ PLANK +++$+++ Well enough. I have been buying gear off one of them for a couple of years.
L351969 +++$+++ u6303 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DOG +++$+++ So do you know these geezers well?
L352140 +++$+++ u6321 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ Out the back.
L352139 +++$+++ u6303 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DOG +++$+++ And the weed?
L352138 +++$+++ u6321 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ Out the back.
L352137 +++$+++ u6303 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DOG +++$+++ Where?
L352133 +++$+++ u6303 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DOG +++$+++ Plank?
L352132 +++$+++ u6321 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ I mean it, there is only three of us here.
L352131 +++$+++ u6303 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DOG +++$+++ Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?
L352130 +++$+++ u6321 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ There is only three of us here.
L352129 +++$+++ u6303 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DOG +++$+++ And all your friends, there's a good lad.
L352128 +++$+++ u6321 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ All right, all fucking right, I am coming.  Willie, he doesn't know you are here, just sort something out, OK.
L352127 +++$+++ u6303 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DOG +++$+++ Right, his leg's going now.
L352112 +++$+++ u6303 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DOG +++$+++ Get the sodding gate open now, Plank.
L352111 +++$+++ u6321 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ J, what's going on out there?  Get the rifle out, Charles. We're being fucked.
L352094 +++$+++ u6303 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DOG +++$+++ What the fuck is going on?
L352093 +++$+++ u6321 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ WINSTON +++$+++ Willy, this is the last time, and don't let him know that you're here, otherwise he will be here all day, and get rid of him quick. We have work to do.
L351844 +++$+++ u6304 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DOORMAN +++$+++ Hold on bollocks, no one but card players in here tonight sonny, and I do mean no one.
L351843 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . .
L351842 +++$+++ u6304 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DOORMAN +++$+++ All right, just you; the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door.
L351841 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?
L351840 +++$+++ u6304 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DOORMAN +++$+++ Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it.
L351839 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ Invitations?
L351838 +++$+++ u6304 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DOORMAN +++$+++ Invitations.
L352390 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ I mean it's fucking empty.
L352389 +++$+++ u6317 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ SOAP +++$+++ What do you mean?
L352388 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ There's nothing in it!
L352370 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ Tom, go and throw those guns off a bridge.
L352369 +++$+++ u6317 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ SOAP +++$+++ I don't think we will take the risk for seven hundred quid.
L352354 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ I don't know, but what I do know is that there's no more Harry, which means there's no more debt, and if there's no more debt there's no more problem, and there's no more problem with our neighbours because they are all dead. I think, if I get this right, we haven't done anything wrong anyway, which means we are in the clear.
L352353 +++$+++ u6317 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ SOAP +++$+++ Well, what's going on?
L352328 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ Listen, if he has the guns he might have the money . . . I think we should go and see him.
L352327 +++$+++ u6317 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ SOAP +++$+++ You what? What are you on about?
L352314 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ It's either that, my old boy's place, and we lose a digit daily. I am going to call him.
L352313 +++$+++ u6317 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ SOAP +++$+++ I hope this is the right move.
L352199 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ There is nowhere else to keep it, and it's the last place they are going to look. Anyway the battle's over and the war is won.
L352198 +++$+++ u6317 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ SOAP +++$+++ You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?
L352197 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ That's it all done, we are off.
L352172 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ If you think I am going to war without one, you're mistaken, mate.
L352171 +++$+++ u6317 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ SOAP +++$+++ And look what happened to that.
L352170 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ Why not? The whole of the British Empire was built on cups of tea.
L352169 +++$+++ u6317 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ SOAP +++$+++ No I fucking don't! You can't make a cup of tea, Edward.
L352077 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ Where did they get those outfits from? Haven't we got some like that, Tom?
L352076 +++$+++ u6317 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ SOAP +++$+++ Where the fuck are they going? To butcher a sheep? I thought this was a robbery.
L352009 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ No, just one of them is in charge of them going to the job. So I assume he will still
L352008 +++$+++ u6317 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ SOAP +++$+++ Carrying them. They could all be carrying them for what we know.
L352007 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ And we will just have to find out who's going to be carrying them.
L352006 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ Jesus, Soap, stop being such a mincer. I thought about that and...
L352005 +++$+++ u6317 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ SOAP +++$+++ Guns! You never said anything about guns. A minute ago this was the safest job in the world, now it's turning in to a bad day in Bosnia . . .
L352004 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ Er, bad breath, colourful language and a feather duster! . . . What do you think they will be armed with? Guns, you tit!
L352003 +++$+++ u6317 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ SOAP +++$+++ What was that, armed? What do you mean, armed? Armed with what?
L351997 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ Hit the fuckers.
L351996 +++$+++ u6317 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ SOAP +++$+++ Well, what do you want us to do about it?
L351726 +++$+++ u6317 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ SOAP +++$+++ Well that depends on how you look at it. I can afford it as long as I see it again, if that's what you mean. You got the rest from the fat man and Bacon?
L351725 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ Are you sure you can afford twenty-five?
L352368 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ We paid seven hundred quid for those guns. They could hardly trace them to you, could they?
L352367 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ The only item that connects us with the crime is sitting in your car which is sitting outside?
L352341 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I'll only be a minute.
L352340 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ Tom?
L352339 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I'11 meet you in the car.
L352338 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ Tom, don't mess around, let's go.
L352336 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ This is our money, Tom! . . . Now I think we should go.
L352335 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ . . . What?
L352334 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ Tom, this is our case.
L352332 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ What do you mean, me?
L352331 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ You and me, Tom.
L352326 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ He said he thinks we have paid him, and he wants to talk about those guns . . . now.
L352325 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Well, what did he say?
L352167 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ Where the hell are we supposed to hide?
L352166 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Right as rain.
L352165 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ Everything all right out there, Tom?
L352072 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ Top of the list of priorities, how nice they look.
L352071 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I dunno, but they look nice. I rather like ' em.
L351822 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Er, let me guess, my foot in your arse? A game of cards and Hatchet Harry. You're supposed to be getting some rest, boy!
L351821 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ Why, what's up?
L351820 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ What the hell are you doing here?
L351765 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ He means they're thieving dogs.
L351764 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ What do you mean?
L351732 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ The man who decides if you can play is this man Harry, or Hatchet Harry as some including himself like to call him.
L351731 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ You see it's not easy to take a seat at this table; the money involved has to be a hundred grand upwards and there is no shortage of punters.
L351728 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ Bacon, the fat man and myself, and it's time to make a call to Harry.
L351727 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Who's this fat man, then?
L352322 +++$+++ u6307 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ HATCHET +++$+++ I bet you did. I have got half a million nicker sitting in front of me, which means that some poor sod doesn't. You must have upset a few people, boy . . . but that isn't really my concern, is it? But what does concern me is the guns you had. I want to talk to you about that. Get your arse over here now, and I do mean now!
L352321 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ I wanted to talk to you about that.
L352320 +++$+++ u6307 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ HATCHET +++$+++ It's pay day, ain't it?
L352319 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ It's Ed, if that's what you mean.
L352318 +++$+++ u6307 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ HATCHET +++$+++ That you, boy?
L351929 +++$+++ u6307 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ HATCHET +++$+++ And still got a sense of humour. That's not monkey nuts son; you can still fold.  OK, before I loan you this, I expect, if you lose of course, my money back within a week, Crystal? That's Sunday, OK?
L351928 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ Unless you are going to accept twenty quid.
L351927 +++$+++ u6307 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ HATCHET +++$+++ For half a million?
L351926 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ I'll see ya.
L351924 +++$+++ u6307 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ HATCHET +++$+++ Well, you're going to have a problem carrying on, aintcha.
L351923 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ That's if I want to see you.
L351922 +++$+++ u6307 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ HATCHET +++$+++ No, you need five hundred grand to see me.
L351921 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ I need two hundred and fifty grand.
L351920 +++$+++ u6307 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ HATCHET +++$+++ I am not interested in what you would rather; I want to keep going. I am also offering you the money, so we don't have to turn them over because you can borrow.
L351919 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ I think I would rather just turn them over.
L351918 +++$+++ u6307 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ HATCHET +++$+++ I will loan you the money.
L351917 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ You will what?
L351916 +++$+++ u6307 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ HATCHET +++$+++ I will.
L351914 +++$+++ u6307 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ HATCHET +++$+++ Yes . . . and is there something else you want to say? EDDY
L351913 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ That is quite a raise, one hundred and fifty on my hundred.
L351850 +++$+++ u6307 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ HATCHET +++$+++ Never mind son, you just might meet him if you carry on like that.
L351849 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ Yup, you must be Harry? Sorry, I didn't know your father.
L351848 +++$+++ u6307 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ HATCHET +++$+++ You must be Eddy. JD's son.
L351730 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ A hundred grand.
L351729 +++$+++ u6307 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ HATCHET +++$+++ You got it all?
L352052 +++$+++ u6309 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ JD +++$+++ And you do have a reputation, so I'll choose my words carefully. But not to put too fine a point on it, fuck yourself, Harry!
L352051 +++$+++ u6307 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ HATCHET +++$+++ What, and I care? Remember, you do have the luxurious advantage of being able to sustain your son's life.
L352050 +++$+++ u6309 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ JD +++$+++ Harry, that boy doesn't know his arsehole from his ear-hole, or you from a hoodwink. This bar is mine, and he has nothing to do with it.
L352049 +++$+++ u6307 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ HATCHET +++$+++ Do you want me to draw a picture?
L352048 +++$+++ u6309 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ JD +++$+++ And?
L352047 +++$+++ u6307 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ HATCHET +++$+++ I want your bar.
L352046 +++$+++ u6309 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ JD +++$+++ Yes?
L352045 +++$+++ u6307 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ HATCHET +++$+++ I like your bar.
L352044 +++$+++ u6309 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ JD +++$+++ Go on.
L352105 +++$+++ u6315 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ PLANK +++$+++ What do you think I am doing? Hold on. What are you doing? Unlock that gate. Oi! I said unlock that fucking gate.
L352104 +++$+++ u6308 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ J +++$+++ What are you doing, Plank?
L352103 +++$+++ u6315 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ PLANK +++$+++ I know.  Now shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left.
L352102 +++$+++ u6308 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ J +++$+++ Sorry, got to do business like this now; can't be too careful these days.
L352101 +++$+++ u6315 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ PLANK +++$+++ Lives and learns doesn't one.
L352100 +++$+++ u6308 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ J +++$+++ I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank.
L352099 +++$+++ u6315 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ PLANK +++$+++ I thought you were going to leave me out there all day.
L352088 +++$+++ u6308 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ J +++$+++ Hold on. OK.  Look Willie, it's Plank outside asking for you, he says it's in our interest.
L352087 +++$+++ u6315 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ PLANK +++$+++ I think you'll find it is in your interest.
L352086 +++$+++ u6308 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ J +++$+++ I can't help you, Plank.
L352085 +++$+++ u6315 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ PLANK +++$+++ Look, could you just open the door so I could talk without shouting?
L352084 +++$+++ u6308 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ J +++$+++ Well, perhaps I can't, Plank, if you know what I mean.
L352083 +++$+++ u6315 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ PLANK +++$+++ Well, perhaps you can help?
L352082 +++$+++ u6308 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ J +++$+++ No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment.
L352081 +++$+++ u6315 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ PLANK +++$+++ All right, it's Plank. Is Willie there?
L352080 +++$+++ u6308 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ J +++$+++ Hello, can I help you?
L352042 +++$+++ u6313 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Rory Breaker is standing by. You stand to make a lot of money, Tommy boy.
L352041 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ All right, let's forget about them for the time being. What about your weed man?
L352040 +++$+++ u6313 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Of course you will look mean, Tom, you will look really scary.
L352039 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look fucking mean.
L352038 +++$+++ u6313 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Sawn-offs are out, Tom; people like to have a bit mare range nowadays.
L352036 +++$+++ u6313 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Seven hundred each.
L352035 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ They look nice, I agree . . . but lacking in criminal credibility, aren't they? I might get laughed at. How much do you want for these muskets?
L352034 +++$+++ u6313 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I got contacts. Listen Tom, if you pointed them at me I'd shit myself or do whatever you said to do. Either way you still get the desired effect.
L352033 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Jesus, if I pick them up, will they stay in one piece? Where did you get them from?
L352020 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I think you're Nick the Greek.
L352019 +++$+++ u6313 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Bloody hell, Tom! This is a bit heavy. This is London, not the Lebanon' Who do you think I am?
L352018 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Never mind that now. I also need some artillery, you know, a couple of sawn-off shotguns.
L352017 +++$+++ u6313 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Jews don't celebrate Christmas, Tom.
L352015 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Neither me, but it depends on what flicks your switch, and the light's on and burning bright for the masses.
L352014 +++$+++ u6313 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Doesn't sound very good to me.
