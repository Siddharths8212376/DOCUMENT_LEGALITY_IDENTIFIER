L633869 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Kill him.
L633868 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ If the key's on him, how do we get the key?
L633867 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ It takes a key.  He keeps it on himself all the time.  I mean <u>all the time</u>.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
L633866 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of-a-bitch.
L633865 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Oh yeah. There's nothing else with Jake. He don't trust banks. He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed. He loves it so much, he wouldn't think of spending any of it on me. I never seen it but I know he's got more than a hunnert thousand at least...
L633864 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ In <u>cash</u>?
L633863 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ At night. He just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it. I heard him. My Mom told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there. Maybe more.
L633862 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What do you mean?
L633861 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Jake hides it. In a safe. In the floor. In the bedroom. He counts it. He loves to sit there and count it.
L633860 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Where?
L633858 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ ...you could get me money. I'll get you out of here.
L633857 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at a time, like a bird in a cage, he don't want me goin' anywhere...
L633856 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You don't have any money put away, do you?
L633855 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Darrell?  You know he and Jake are...
L633854 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Honey, baby, I <u>can't</u>. I can't even get out of here <u>myself</u>. Believe it or not, I need a lousy hundred and fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic...
L633853 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Please. I won't hang on you. As soon as we get there you can dump me. I don't care. I just want to get out of here.
L633852 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Oh yeah. It's beautiful, beautiful beaches. Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
L633851 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Is it pretty?
L633850 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Oh yeah. It's far, it's another world.
L633849 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Yeah.
L633848 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Yeah. What do you want. Life, right?  Have you ever been to California?
L633847 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I'm sorry...
L633846 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ After he got his divorce, he forced me to marry him...but when I saw her body, I swore to her on my soul that some day I'd get Jake for what he did to her...
L633845 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You're sick too...he loved to do things to me. Control me. My Mom...it tore her up cause she couldn't do nothing about it. She become alcoholic...and the funny thing is-- I liked it. I liked being controlled by Jake. The truth was as far out and crazy as he got, I wanted <u>more</u>. I wanted to go all the way. Women say they don't want to be taken like, <u>really taken</u> -- that's bullshit -- they do. The first time he finished with me, he said I was a woman now. I was 14. Then he started crying like a baby...wanted me to hold him. It's a strange feeling to hate someone so much for so many years, but still want to hold him, comfort him... They found my Mom right down there  at the bottom of Apache Leap. She had cactus needles stuck all over her body and Virgil...Sheriff Potter said she was drunk and went insane. But I'll never believe she ran off that cliff by accident. She was born on this earth and she loved it. She was like me. She just wanted to fly away.
L633844 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Yeah.
L633843 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ He <u>was</u> a Shaman...in the mine. We had nothin' after he died. Jake took us in, gave us a little money. He used to call me his "little halfbreed"... He kept Mom on the side y'know, cause he was married someplace else. He had kids in Phoenix I think, no one knew him around here...but the thing was...you see...  ...he was raping me the whole time...for years. He loved to do things to me. Believe it or not, he used to say he was in love with my ass. Y'ever been in love with a woman's ass?
L633842 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You mean the Shaman?
L633841 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Nothing I understand better than a mess.
L633840 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...
L633839 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Try me.
L633838 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You'd never understand.
L633837 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Grace, I've been fucked over too many times, by too many women.  You're becoming the queen of hot and cold.
L633836 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Get out of town, Bobby, as quick as you can.
L633835 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Don't feel like nothing.
L633834 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Nothing.
L633833 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What's the matter?...Grace?
L633827 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway. I mean, I would ... do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said: You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
L633826 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You need a meal ticket is what you mean. Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
L633825 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't. I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
L633824 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Walk away.
L633823 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I don't know how.
L633822 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You could leave him.
L633821 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ All this nothing? It doesn't get to Jake like it gets to me.  He says he don't mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
L633820 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
L633819 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
L633818 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Yeah, I guess you're right.
L633817 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I'm guessing no.
L633816 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line. I wanted him. I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him. Is that love?
L633815 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Is that why you're with him?
L633814 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That's where they stick Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us to die. My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me.
L633813 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Did you ever?
L633812 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ No.
L633811 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You love him?
L633810 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
L633809 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Doesn't the isolation bother you?
L633808 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ They hear you comin'.  They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.
L633807 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Are there snakes out here?
L633804 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Guys like me take those chances. Let's go.
L633803 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ How do you know he's still not here?
L633802 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Yeah, well I said I was an idiot. Whatta you say we get out of here, take a drive somewhere, talk...
L633503 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Maybe I just want to hear you say it.
L633502 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You know what I want.
L633501 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
L633500 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Still playing?
L633499 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You never did answer my question.
L633498 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I'm just flesh and blood, baby.  That and a few memories of bad women; just like most guys.  But you already know that.  You read my mind, remember? Thanks for the lemonade.
L633497 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
L633496 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I think I can find my own way back to into town.
L633495 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
L633494 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
L633492 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ And what would that be?
L633491 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I have an idea.
L633490 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?
L633489 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Nothing like a little liveliness.
L633488 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
L633487 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Beautiful?
L633486 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Like you.
L633485 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look?
L633484 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Lift me down.
L633483 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What?
L633482 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ There.  All done.  Lift me down.
L633478 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ The same thing you do.
L633477 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
L633476 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ My face tell you all that?
L633474 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Come here.
L633473 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Nice house for a shaman's daughter.  You must be good.
L633472 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Those are white words, not ours.
L633471 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ A medicine man?
L633470 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ From my father.  He was the tribe's shaman.
L633469 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Where'd you learn to do that?
L633468 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ A little of this, a little of that.  Mostly I tell fortunes.
L633467 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What do you do anyway?
L633466 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I guess it must.
L633465 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
L633462 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Thank you.
L633461 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Nice place.
L633460 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
L633459 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
L633458 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Did you like it; me watching you?
L633457 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I didn't say it bothered me.
L633456 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
L633455 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
L633446 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I pack up and go somewhere else.
L633445 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ What happens when you lose?
L633444 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
L633443 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby-- no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
L633442 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... .
L633441 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ So, what is it you do, Mister...?
L633440 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some action there.
L633439 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Where you headed?
L633438 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I guess I've got wander in my blood.
L633437 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You've been around.
L633436 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ All over.  Chicago, Houston, Detroit.  Just lately Dallas.
L633435 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Where you coming from?
L633422 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
L633421 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
L633420 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert.  Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving?
L633419 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
L633418 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Drove into Superior?  What for?
L633417 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I just drove in this morning.
L633416 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
L633415 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?
L633414 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You're not from around here, are you?
L633413 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You're welcome, Grace.
L633412 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Thank you, Bobby.
L633407 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ That's all right.  I got it.
L633406 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways. I should have parked closer.  I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
L633405 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Wasn't nothing.
L633404 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ No trouble at all, really.
L633403 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ It's very nice of you to help me.  That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.
L633402 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You should be more careful.
L633401 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Accident.
L633400 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ What happened to your hand?
L633399 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ No, I've got it.
L633397 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
L633396 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I got it.
L633395 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You sure you can manage?
L633394 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Jesus.
L633393 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ May I carry your package, Grace?
L633392 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ It's Grace.
L633391 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I like that about me, beautiful.
L633390 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
L633389 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
L633388 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Maybe I don't want you to.
L633387 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I don't know your real name.
L633386 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Do you have to call me that?
L633385 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ My name is Bobby.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
L633384 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
L633383 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ That's right on my way.
L633382 +++$+++ u8687 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I'm just going to my car?
L633381 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
L633948 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Sounds like it. I wish I could help Sheriff, but I just want to get my car and get on up the road.
L633947 +++$+++ u8692 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ There was a young fellow over at Jamilla's today when it got hit.  Way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers.
L633946 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Yeah, fell down and hit a rock. Not as bad as it looks.
L633945 +++$+++ u8692 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ That's a nasty cut you got there.
L633944 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ No, sir. I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
L633943 +++$+++ u8692 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Seen you popping up a little bit of everywhere today.  You're not planning on staying are you?
L633942 +++$+++ u8692 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Get in.
L633941 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Harlin's.
L633940 +++$+++ u8692 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Where ya goin'?
L633429 +++$+++ u8692 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Son.  Little excitement out at the reservation this morning. Wayne and Dale Elkhart were up drinking all night and then Wayne starts chasing Dale around the desert with his shotgun. BIA handled it. I went by for backup.
L633428 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Morning, officer.
L633743 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Shit I'm sorry!...you can't believe the strain I'm under. I'm just under a lot of strain here.
L633742 +++$+++ u8690 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ MR. ARKADY +++$+++ What'd you say to me!
L633740 +++$+++ u8690 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ MR. ARKADY +++$+++ A hundred and ... Now you listen to me you deadbeat little punk:  I don't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller.  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and <u>I want it</u>.  I don't care how you get it, or where from, but I want it on my desk tomorrow, or I'll show you what real bad luck is.
L633739 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ A hundred-forty-five would probably cover it.
L633738 +++$+++ u8690 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ MR. ARKADY +++$+++ ...Now, let me get this straight. Two years you give me problems with your fuckin' payoffs. Now you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
L633737 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Yeah, if you could send it care of...
L633736 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ But which I can get. No problem. Look, I can sell my car in Vegas. Blue book it's worth 16 at least. I just need the 150, uh...
L633735 +++$+++ u8690 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ MR. ARKADY +++$+++ Which you don't have.
L633734 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Mr. Arkady, honest, I ad to beat it outta there before the cops showed. So now I don't have a cent to my name. I can't even get my car out of the garage.  I tell you, Mister...  if it weren't for bad luck I wouldn't have nay fuckin' luck at all, you know?   So, I was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so I could get my car out of this garage, see?  The bus depot here has a Western Union thing.  And of course I'll pay it back with the rest of the money.
L633733 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ With a <u>shotgun</u>!  She kills <u>both</u> of 'em, and... and the money in my bag gets all shredded to bloody pieces. Not one bill is left alive.  I mean, what are the odds?
L633732 +++$+++ u8690 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ MR. ARKADY +++$+++ The old lady?
L633731 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ No. Two of them. Two robbers. And they <u>both</u> get nailed... get shot by the old lady.
L633730 +++$+++ u8690 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ MR. ARKADY +++$+++ ...And let me guess.  This robber -- he gets your money.
L633729 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half of it. I got your money, and I go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then... well, it gets <u>robbed</u>!
L633728 +++$+++ u8690 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ MR. ARKADY +++$+++ "Arkady"
L633727 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin...
L633726 +++$+++ u8690 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ MR. ARKADY +++$+++ That's a shame, Bobby.  A real shame.
L634012 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I'm sorry.  It's just ... you know ...

L634002 +++$+++ u8683 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ How much?
L634001 +++$+++ u8684 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ How about Ciudad Juarez? You could take a local, arrives in two hours, and transfer in Albuquerque. It'll get you across the border.

L633642 +++$+++ u8686 +++$+++ m589 +++$+++ FLO +++$+++ No.  Just plain ol' Miller. Now you can fuckin' take it or you can fuckin' leave it.
