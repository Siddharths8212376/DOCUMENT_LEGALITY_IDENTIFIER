L624134 +++$+++ u8602 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ There was a young student, exceptionally gifted, possessing of great intelligence. It was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of Vulcan. But he was a revolutionary.
L624133 +++$+++ u8598 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Who is it he reminds you of?
L624132 +++$+++ u8602 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I do not often think of the past.
L624131 +++$+++ u8602 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ He reminds me of someone I knew in my youth.
L624130 +++$+++ u8598 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ But he does seem familiar?
L624129 +++$+++ u8602 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I cannot be certain.
L624128 +++$+++ u8598 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock, what is it? Do you know this Vulcan?
L624127 +++$+++ u8602 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Perhaps I have, Captain. Perhaps I have.
L624126 +++$+++ u8598 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What is it? You look like you've seen a ghost.
L624123 +++$+++ u8598 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ General Korrd's military strategies were required learning when I was a cadet at the Academy. When they put me out to pasture, I hope I fare better than Korrd.
L624122 +++$+++ u8602 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The same. He's apparently fallen out of favor with the Klingon High Command.
L624121 +++$+++ u8598 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Not General Korrd.
L624072 +++$+++ u8602 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes.
L624071 +++$+++ u8598 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I could use a shower.
L624040 +++$+++ u8602 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Goodnight, Doctor.
L624039 +++$+++ u8598 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Goodnight, Spock.

L624037 +++$+++ u8602 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes, Captain.
L624036 +++$+++ u8598 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Go to sleep, Spock.
L624035 +++$+++ u8602 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Life is not a dream.
L624034 +++$+++ u8598 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes, Spock?
L624033 +++$+++ u8602 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Jim.
L624032 +++$+++ u8598 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock, we're on leave. You can call me Jim.

L624027 +++$+++ u8602 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words.
L624026 +++$+++ u8598 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Come on, Spock. Why didn't you jump in?
L624025 +++$+++ u8598 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ The lyrics are - are very simple. It's, er, "Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream.." The Doctor and I will start it off, and then when we give you the signal, you jump in.  Doctor, if you please.
L624024 +++$+++ u8602 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That song did not come up in my research, Captain.
L624023 +++$+++ u8598 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ "Row, row, row your boat..." I love "Row..."  Do - do you know "Row, Row, Row, Row, Row Your Boat?"
L624021 +++$+++ u8602 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Are we leaving, Captain?
L624020 +++$+++ u8598 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ "Pack Up Your Troubles."
L624019 +++$+++ u8598 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ That's great. I haven't sung around a campfire since I was a boy in Iowa. What are we going to sing? What... Bones, what are we going to sing?
L624018 +++$+++ u8602 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Oh. I believe we are required to engage in a ritual known as the singalong.
L624015 +++$+++ u8602 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I am preparing to toast a marsh melon.
L624014 +++$+++ u8598 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What are you doing?
L624012 +++$+++ u8598 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I've always known... I'll die alone.
L624011 +++$+++ u8602 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I don't understand.
L624010 +++$+++ u8598 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Oh, no. It isn't that. I knew I wouldn't die because the two of you were with me.
L623941 +++$+++ u8602 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Perhaps "because it is there" is not sufficient reason for climbing a mountain.
L623940 +++$+++ u8598 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Oh, God
L623939 +++$+++ u8598 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock, I appreciate your concern, but if you don't stop distracting me, I'm liable to be one...
L623938 +++$+++ u8602 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Concentration is vital. You must be one with the rock.
L623937 +++$+++ u8602 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I believe Dr McCoy is not in the best of moods.
L623936 +++$+++ u8598 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ On the contrary. Gravity is foremost on my mind. Look, I'm trying to make an ascent here. Why don't you go pester Dr McCoy for a while?
L623935 +++$+++ u8602 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I do not think you realize the gravity of your situation.
L623934 +++$+++ u8598 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ MM.?
L623933 +++$+++ u8602 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Ah, Captain?
L623932 +++$+++ u8598 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Because it's there.
L623931 +++$+++ u8602 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ And that is?
L623930 +++$+++ u8598 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I'm not trying to break any records. I'm doing this because I enjoy it. Not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain...
L623929 +++$+++ u8602 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I regret to inform you that the record for free-climbing El Captain is in no danger of being broken.
L623928 +++$+++ u8602 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I'm flattered. Twelve hundred points of interest in Yosemite and you pick me.
L623927 +++$+++ u8598 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock - What are you doing in this neck of the woods?
L624531 +++$+++ u8604 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SYBOK +++$+++ Spock...
L624530 +++$+++ u8598 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully...
L624529 +++$+++ u8604 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SYBOK +++$+++ What have I done?
L624475 +++$+++ u8604 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SYBOK +++$+++ Because you, too, must know.
L624474 +++$+++ u8598 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What makes you think I won't turn us around?
L624473 +++$+++ u8604 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SYBOK +++$+++ No conditions.
L624472 +++$+++ u8598 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ No special conditions?
L624471 +++$+++ u8604 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SYBOK +++$+++ The ship needs its Captain.
L624470 +++$+++ u8598 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ About the ship...
L624456 +++$+++ u8604 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SYBOK +++$+++ Am I? We'll see.
L624455 +++$+++ u8598 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You are mad!
L624454 +++$+++ u8604 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SYBOK +++$+++ Given to me by God.  He waits for us on the other side.
L624453 +++$+++ u8598 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Your vision?
L624452 +++$+++ u8604 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SYBOK +++$+++ But if we do, will that convince you that my vision was true?
L624451 +++$+++ u8598 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Wait!  You know we'll never make it through the Great Barrier.
L624438 +++$+++ u8598 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ No. I refuse.
L624437 +++$+++ u8604 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SYBOK +++$+++ Now learn something about yourself.
L624436 +++$+++ u8598 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ No... I didn't.
L624435 +++$+++ u8604 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SYBOK +++$+++ I've done nothing. This is who they are. Didn't you know that?
L624434 +++$+++ u8598 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock...  What have you done to my friends?
L624405 +++$+++ u8604 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SYBOK +++$+++ I don't control minds. I free them.
L624404 +++$+++ u8598 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ The only realty I see is that I'm a prisoner on my own ship. What is this power you have to control the minds of my crew?
L624403 +++$+++ u8604 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SYBOK +++$+++ Sha Ka Ree. "The Scource." "Heaven." "Eden." call it "Qui'Tu." To the Romulans, it's "Vorta Vor." The Andorian word is.. unpronounceable. Still, every culture shares he common dream of a place from which creation sprang. For us, that place will soon be a reality.
L624392 +++$+++ u8598 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I'm afraid of nothing.
L624391 +++$+++ u8604 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SYBOK +++$+++ What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken. They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. It's an extension of personal fear.  Captain Kirk, I so much want your understanding. I want your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out?
L624390 +++$+++ u8598 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You can't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the Great Barrier.
L624389 +++$+++ u8604 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SYBOK +++$+++ I trust your message was received?
L624267 +++$+++ u8598 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I'll take you to the bridge.
L624266 +++$+++ u8604 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SYBOK +++$+++ We must change our course at once.
L624250 +++$+++ u8598 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ In order to lower and raise the shields as quickly as possible, we're going to forego the tractor beam and fly her in manually.
L624249 +++$+++ u8604 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SYBOK +++$+++ What are you doing?
L624233 +++$+++ u8598 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Sybok, listen to me. In order for this craft to enter the landing bay, Enterprise must lower the shields and activate the tractor beam. To get us inside and re-raise the shields will take-
L624232 +++$+++ u8604 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SYBOK +++$+++ No! No reply. Remain on course.
L624214 +++$+++ u8604 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SYBOK +++$+++ But I thought Captain Chekov..  I see. Very clever, Captain.  Spock, it would appear that you've been given a second chance to join me. What do you say?
L624213 +++$+++ u8598 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise.
L624212 +++$+++ u8604 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SYBOK +++$+++ Who are you?
L624211 +++$+++ u8598 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You staged all this to get your hands on my ship?
L624210 +++$+++ u8604 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SYBOK +++$+++ I must have your starship.

L624401 +++$+++ u8605 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ No, no, no. Scotty - Scotty... There's so much I want to tell you.
L624399 +++$+++ u8605 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ No. Sybok has simply put us in touch with feelings we've always been afraid to express.
L624398 +++$+++ u8601 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SCOTTY +++$+++ He's not?
L624397 +++$+++ u8605 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ Scotty, dear, he' not a madman.
L624396 +++$+++ u8601 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SCOTTY +++$+++ Uhura, I had the strangest dream. I dreamt that a madman had taken over the Enterprise.
L624395 +++$+++ u8605 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ Easy, easy,  easy, Scotty. Easy. You're back with us.
L623979 +++$+++ u8605 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ Starfleet, are you aware of our currant status?
L623978 +++$+++ u8601 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SCOTTY +++$+++ They can't be serious. The ship's in pieces and we've less than a skeleton aboard.
L623969 +++$+++ u8605 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ I had a feeling you would say something like that. So I brought us dinner.
L623968 +++$+++ u8601 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SCOTTY +++$+++ Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.
L623967 +++$+++ u8605 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ And I thought we were supposed to be going together.
L623966 +++$+++ u8601 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SCOTTY +++$+++ Uhura, I thought you were on leave.
L623965 +++$+++ u8605 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ I know you'll whip her into shape, Scotty. You always do.
L623964 +++$+++ u8601 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SCOTTY +++$+++ "Let's see what she's got," said the Captain. And then we found out, didn't we?
L623963 +++$+++ u8601 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SCOTTY +++$+++ Borgus Frat.
L624535 +++$+++ u8604 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SYBOK +++$+++ No. You must save yourselves. Forgive me, brother. Forgive me.
L624534 +++$+++ u8602 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Sybok, we must find a way...
L624533 +++$+++ u8604 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SYBOK +++$+++ This is my doing. This is my arrogance... my vanity...

L624523 +++$+++ u8604 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SYBOK +++$+++ I don't understand..  Reveal yourself to me!
L624522 +++$+++ u8602 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Sybok - this is not the God of Sha Ka Ree - or any other God!
L624449 +++$+++ u8602 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Sybok, you are my brother, but you do not know me. I am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago. Since that time I have found myself and my place. I know who I am. And I cannot go with you.
L624448 +++$+++ u8604 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SYBOK +++$+++ I don't understand...
L624447 +++$+++ u8602 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I belong here.
L624446 +++$+++ u8604 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SYBOK +++$+++ Why not?
L624445 +++$+++ u8602 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I cannot go with you.
L624444 +++$+++ u8604 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SYBOK +++$+++ Spock?
L624428 +++$+++ u8602 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Do you?
L624427 +++$+++ u8604 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SYBOK +++$+++ I know you better than that.
L624426 +++$+++ u8602 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I hide no pain.
L624425 +++$+++ u8604 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SYBOK +++$+++ Each man's pain is unique.
L624275 +++$+++ u8604 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SYBOK +++$+++ You know I'm right.
L624274 +++$+++ u8602 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No. I will not.
L624273 +++$+++ u8604 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SYBOK +++$+++ Put him in the brig with Captain Kirk.  Spock, you will accompany me to the bridge?
L624270 +++$+++ u8604 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SYBOK +++$+++ No. You must kill me.
L624269 +++$+++ u8602 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Sybok, you must surrender.
L624216 +++$+++ u8604 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SYBOK +++$+++ Of course. Of course. Then I'll take the ship without your help.
L624215 +++$+++ u8602 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I am a Starfleet Officer.
L624209 +++$+++ u8604 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SYBOK +++$+++ I'm sorry, Spock. I can't surrender now. I'm not through violating Neutral Zone Treaty. In fact, I'm just getting started. And now for my next violation I intend to steal something. Something very big.
L624208 +++$+++ u8602 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. However, if you surrender now-
L624207 +++$+++ u8604 +++$+++ m583 +++$+++ SYBOK +++$+++ Spock, you've developed a sense of humor after all.
L625846 +++$+++ u8611 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ FLYNN +++$+++ Nah...I decided...I've had enough of video games to last me a good long time. I feel like gettin' into some real life...
L625845 +++$+++ u8607 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ ALAN +++$+++ Shouldn't you wait till your lawsuit's settled?
L625837 +++$+++ u8607 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ ALAN +++$+++ Oh, that is beautiful. You've got the goods...
L625836 +++$+++ u8611 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ FLYNN +++$+++ And Dillinger's instructions to divert them -- it's all there - look, even his home phone number, when he logged on.
L625835 +++$+++ u8607 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ ALAN +++$+++ Your old files -- ?
L625833 +++$+++ u8611 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ FLYNN +++$+++ I know, I met him.
L625832 +++$+++ u8607 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ ALAN +++$+++ Flynn! I made it. I worked out some new codes for Tron, put 'em on a disk, and -- it's running.
L625456 +++$+++ u8607 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ ALAN +++$+++ Uh... got any cinnamon?
L625455 +++$+++ u8611 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ FLYNN +++$+++ Want one?
L625454 +++$+++ u8607 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ ALAN +++$+++ I was wondering where you got that glow of good health.
L625453 +++$+++ u8611 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ FLYNN +++$+++ My dinner.
L625452 +++$+++ u8607 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ ALAN +++$+++ Hi, Flynn.
L625451 +++$+++ u8611 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ FLYNN +++$+++ Hi, Alan.
L625435 +++$+++ u8611 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ FLYNN +++$+++ Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge us a Group 6 access...
L625434 +++$+++ u8607 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ ALAN +++$+++ Not if my Tron program was running. That would seal the system off. If your file's in there...
L625431 +++$+++ u8611 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ FLYNN +++$+++ Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it. Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. Just Eddie and his Master Control Program, runnin' things from on high..
L625430 +++$+++ u8607 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ ALAN +++$+++ Dillinger?
L625426 +++$+++ u8611 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ FLYNN +++$+++ Because somewhere... in one of those memories ... is the evidence. If I got in far enough, I could reconstruct it.
L625425 +++$+++ u8607 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ ALAN +++$+++ I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
L625424 +++$+++ u8611 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ FLYNN +++$+++ Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime.
L625423 +++$+++ u8607 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ ALAN +++$+++ Senior exec.
L625422 +++$+++ u8611 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ FLYNN +++$+++ Yepper. And Vice Squad, and Meltdown... whole slew of 'em. I was this close  to starting my own little enterprise. But: enter Ed Dillinger. Another software engineer -- not so young, not so bright, but very, very sneaky. One night, our boy Flynn goes to his terminal, tries to read up his file, and ... nothing. A big blank. We now take you to three months later. Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five video games he has "invented" -- the slime didn't even change the names -- and he gets a big fat promotion. Thus begins his meteoric rise to...what is he now, Executive V.P.?
L625421 +++$+++ u8607 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ ALAN +++$+++ You invented Space Paranoids?
L625420 +++$+++ u8611 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ FLYNN +++$+++ Sherman, set the Wayback Machine for...oh, 1973. Kevin Flynn  is one of the brightest young software engineers at ICOM. He's so bright that he starts going in there at night, and sets up a private memory file, and begins writing a program for a video game he is inventing, called...  ...Space Paranoids.
L625419 +++$+++ u8611 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ FLYNN +++$+++ You haven't told him?
L625418 +++$+++ u8607 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ ALAN +++$+++ I don't get it.
L625417 +++$+++ u8611 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ FLYNN +++$+++ "Embezzling" is such an ugly word, Mister Bailey...  No, actually I'm trying to get a legal brief together.
L625416 +++$+++ u8607 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ ALAN +++$+++ Are you embezzling?
L625415 +++$+++ u8611 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ FLYNN +++$+++ Tried to.  Can't quite make the connection with that sucker, though. If I had a direct terminal ...
L625414 +++$+++ u8607 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ ALAN +++$+++ You did break in.
L625459 +++$+++ u8607 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ ALAN +++$+++ I'm certainly not.
L625458 +++$+++ u8613 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ LORA +++$+++ I don't think I'm cleared for this.
L625411 +++$+++ u8607 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ ALAN +++$+++ Uh, no ... I mean, not that often -
L625410 +++$+++ u8613 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ LORA +++$+++ Flynn!
L625400 +++$+++ u8607 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ ALAN +++$+++ What -- ?
L625399 +++$+++ u8613 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ LORA +++$+++ For being on to Dillinger.
L625398 +++$+++ u8607 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ ALAN +++$+++ For what?
L625397 +++$+++ u8613 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ LORA +++$+++ That Dillinger's on to him.
L625396 +++$+++ u8607 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ ALAN +++$+++ Of what?
L625395 +++$+++ u8613 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ LORA +++$+++ To warn him.
L625394 +++$+++ u8607 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ ALAN +++$+++ What for?
L625393 +++$+++ u8613 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ LORA +++$+++ I mean I want both of us to go.
L625392 +++$+++ u8607 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ ALAN +++$+++ You call that getting over it?
L625391 +++$+++ u8613 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ LORA +++$+++ I want to go to his place.
L625390 +++$+++ u8607 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ ALAN +++$+++ Okay, okay...
L625389 +++$+++ u8613 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ LORA +++$+++ Oh, I wish you'd forget about that. It was all so long ago. I've totally gotten over it.
L625388 +++$+++ u8607 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ ALAN +++$+++ Flynn had access to you, too. I'm not interested in talking about him.
L625387 +++$+++ u8613 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ LORA +++$+++ Flynn had Group 7 access.
L625386 +++$+++ u8607 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ ALAN +++$+++ Something about tampering. Some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget into his checking account, I don't know. Why are you so interested?
L625385 +++$+++ u8613 +++$+++ m584 +++$+++ LORA +++$+++ Did he say why?
