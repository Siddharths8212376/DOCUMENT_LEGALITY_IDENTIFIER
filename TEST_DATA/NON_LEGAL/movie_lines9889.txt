L262349 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this.
L262348 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Uh, uh, this is great.  I mean, I love e.e. cummings, but I can't let you get this.
L262347 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ I-I read a poem of you and thought of his last week.  A poem of  his and thought of you last--  You'll be fine, though.  Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle.  She looks at the book.
L262346 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ No, I don't think so.
L262345 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Oh, oh, yes.  I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much.
L262344 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.
L262343 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ e.e. cummings.  I'd like to get you this.
L262342 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Oh, yes.  Who doesn't?  Look!
L262341 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Fine.  Oh, we went to the Caravaggio exhibition at the Met.  It's such a treat to go through a museum with Frederick.  I mean...you learn so much.  Do you like Caravaggio?
L262340 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ How-how's Frederick?
L262339 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I'm...all right.
L262338 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Yeah.  How are you?
L262337 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Everything's okay? 
L262336 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Yes.
L262335 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Yes?
L262334 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Uh, yes!
L262333 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ No?
L262332 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ No!  No...
L262331 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ You seem tense.  Is everything all right?  You feel okay?
L262330 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ No, no.  I-I-I understand completely. No problem.  Y-you're busy.  I-I-I...
L262329 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ No, I don't have time.
L262328 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Unless, of course, if-if you had some time, I mean, we could get some coffee.
L262327 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Well, you sure picked the right place.  I mean, you can stay here all afternoon, not buy anything and just read.
L262326 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Oh, book?  Oh, no, I...  I'm killing time.  I...I-I just, uh, w-want to browse, uh...
L262324 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ What book did you want to buy? ELLIOT  What?  Book?
L262323 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Yes, it's-it's wonderful.
L262322 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Isn't this great?  They have everything here.
L262320 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Yeah, sure. 
L262319 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Well, i-if-if you have some free time...
L262318 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Yeah, you would.
L262317 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Yes?
L262316 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Yes? LEE  A couple of blocks from here.  If you don't know about it, you should. You'd really love it.
L262315 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Don't let me get started on my childhood.  Oh, you know what?  There is a bookstore.
L262314 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ I think to myself  what problems could she possibly have?
L262313 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Oh, God.
L262312 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ I'll never understand it.  You're so bright and charming and beautiful.
L262311 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Yeah, unhappy and fat.  And I still find the meetings very comforting, you know.
L262310 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Oh.  You must have been, uh, very unhappy.
L262309 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Well, listen, you didn't know me before Frederick.  I'd...I'd start with a beer at about ten in the morning, and...go on.
L262308 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Oh, I was just going to my AA meeting. ELLIOT Oh, my goodness.  Well, why do you still go to those?  You never tough alcohol.
L262307 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Where are you headed?
L262306 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Yes, I do.
L262305 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Oh, yes!  You live near here, don't you?
L262304 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Oh.  Well, I live--
L262303 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ How about you?
L262302 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Ohhhh!
L262301 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Well, yes, I'm killing time.  I have a client near here and I...I'm quite early.
L262300 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ You're out looking here?
L262299 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Yes.  Yeah, I-I'm kill--
L262298 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Oh, what, in this section of town?
L262297 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.
L262296 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L262295 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Hi.
L262294 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Oh, Elliot!
L262293 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Oh, my goodness!
L261924 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ ...ex-husband on the street the other day.
L261923 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Yeah.
L261912 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I don't know exactly.
L261911 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Like, uh...?
L261910 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Oh, I don't know.  My unemployment checks are running out.  Um, I was thinking of taking some courses at Columbia with the last of my savings.
L261909 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Really?  So, so, what else?  Wh- what are you up to?
L261906 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Oh, great.
L261905 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Oh, well, you know Frederick.  One of his moods.  Although it wasn't a bad week.  He  uh, sold a picture.
L261904 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ How's Frederick?  He didn't come.
L261903 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Oh, you know, I, I love that book you lent me.  The Easter Parade? You were right.  It had very special meaning for me.
L263081 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ You're not lost.
L263080 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ It's so pitch-black tonight.  I feel lost.
L263077 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ It's hard to be around someone who gives so much and-and needs so little in return!
L263076 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ You matter to me.  Completely.
L263074 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Leave me alone, can you?!
L263073 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Well, what do you do?  Do-do-do you talk to Holly, or Lee, or what?  Do you, do you, do you phone them?
L263072 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Well, maybe I've asked advice once or twice or-or made a joke.
L263071 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind my back?  Do you?  You must.  They- they seem to know so much about us.
L263069 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Hannah, my head is throbbing. HANNAH  You never want to talk about it. I-- Every time I bring it up, you- you change the subject.  What is it? Do you-- We're communicating less and less.  You sleep with me less and less.
L263068 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Well, what is it then?  What?  Eh, what's come between us?  How have I alienated you?
L263067 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ No.
L263066 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ I'm not accusing.  I'm asking.  Do you...do you find me too...too giving?  Too-too-too competent?  Too-too, I don't know, disgustingly perfect or something?
L263064 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Me?  Of course not. HANNAH There's things Holly wrote about in her script about us that are so...personal they could only have come from you.
L263063 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Have you been talking to Holly or Lee about us?  About our-our personal life?
L262784 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ What, you, of c-- What are you talking about?  Of course not.  I'd be destroyed!
L262783 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ No!  But you keep asking these, these awful questions.  My God, it's-it's like you want me to say yes!
L262782 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Are you?
L262781 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ What kind of interrogation... Su- supposing I said yes?  I-I-I am disenchanted.  I am in love with someone else.
L262780 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Well, what?  What, wh-what are you not telling me?
L262779 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ My God!  Wha-what is this?  The Gestapo?  No.
L262778 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Are you in love with someone else?
L262777 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ I didn't say that.
L262776 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?
L262775 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ No!
L262774 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Are you angry with me?
L262773 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Oh, let's not--I, I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
L262772 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ I-I-I know, but there's got to be some give and take.
L262771 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that.  When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.
L262770 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ You know, y-you have some very set plans on how your life should be structured.  A-a house, uh, kids, certain schools, a h--, a home in Connecticut.  I-it's all very...preconceived.
L262769 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ But what do, what do you--  what's that mean?  W-w-we've been, we've been married for four years. How settled can things get?
L262768 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.
L262767 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ I want one with you.
L262766 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ But, you got four children!
L262765 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Well, tell me.  Should I be worried?
L262764 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ I don't know.
L262763 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?
L262762 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
L262761 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Why not?
L262760 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Well, I-I don't think it's a very good idea.
L262759 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Yes, you were.  A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.
L262758 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Was I?
L262757 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Yes.  I know.  The last few weeks, you haven't been yourself.  And tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of curt with me.
L262756 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ I don't know.  Um...I'm just antsy.
L262755 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Are you in a bad mood?
L262690 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Yeah, I know.  I-I can't believe I forgot.
L262689 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ It's so late.
L262688 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk.  I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.
L262687 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Where're you going?
L261946 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Holly and April, thanks for helping.
L261945 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ You bet.
L261929 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Mmm.
L261928 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Let's go have dinner, shall we?
L261927 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ God, Mickey's such a hypochondriac. I wonder how he'd handle it if there was ever anything really wrong with him?
L261811 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ That's where your talent lies.
L261810 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ I know.
L261809 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Great idea.
L261802 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Ohhh, but I've eaten five of these.
L261801 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ No, she doesn't, either.  You've got tons as well.
L261800 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ She has all the cooking talent.
L261799 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ I know!  I know!
L261798 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
L261797 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Aren't they great?
L261796 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ They're fantastic.
L261795 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Have you tried these?  These are wonderful.  Holly and her friend made them.
L261794 +++$+++ u5741 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ ELLIOT +++$+++ Mm-hm?
L263233 +++$+++ u5742 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Oh, honey!
L263232 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Oh, Mom!
L263224 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ It's on the table, Dad.
L263223 +++$+++ u5742 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ I want ice!  Who's got some--  Oh, there it is.
L262553 +++$+++ u5742 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ We were making a commercial down at the mayor's office, and there was this young, good-looking salesman...
L262552 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Hi, Mom.  How you doing?  Here, let me get you some coffee.  That's enough of that.  What triggered it?
L262551 +++$+++ u5742 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Always.
L262550 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Don't make it worse, Dad.
L262548 +++$+++ u5742 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ I am glad to see you.
L262547 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Hi.  How's she doing?
L261957 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ ...just for a second.  So, now I got that out of my system and I can go back to the thing that makes me happiest.
L261956 +++$+++ u5742 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ Yeah.
L261955 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ I don't know about that.  Oh, no, I just, see, I-I've been very, very lucky.  W-when I had the kids, I decided to stop working and just, you know, devote myself to having the family, and I've been very, very happy  but...I've always secretly hoped that maybe some little gem would come along and tempt me back on the stage...
L261950 +++$+++ u5742 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ And we drink to her, and we all congratulate her on her wonderful accomplishment during this last year...her great success in A Doll's House!
L261949 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ I am... I did slave all day.
L261940 +++$+++ u5742 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ This is a toast.  You know this beautiful Thanksgiving dinner was all...
L261939 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Get his wine away.
L261938 +++$+++ u5742 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ EVAN +++$+++ ...this is a toast!  This is a toast.
L262889 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Mom, come out!
L262888 +++$+++ u5743 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ I'll either be unconscious or I won't.  If not, I'll deal with it then.  I'm not gonna worry now about what's gonna be when I'm unconscious.
L262886 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Well, it certainly doesn't look promising.
L262885 +++$+++ u5743 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ How do you know?
L262884 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Yeah, I know.  But never to exist again!
L262883 +++$+++ u5743 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Of what?  I'll be unconscious.
L262882 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I don't understand.  Aren't you frightened?
L262881 +++$+++ u5743 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Who thinks about such nonsense? Now I'm alive.  When I'm dead, I'll be dead.
L262880 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ That thought doesn't terrify you?
L262879 +++$+++ u5743 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ So?
L262878 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
L262877 +++$+++ u5743 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Why should I be afraid?
L262874 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ So, just 'cause I was born that way... You know, I'm old enough to make a mature decision.
L262873 +++$+++ u5743 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ But why?  We raised you as a Jew.
L262872 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna try.
L262871 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Because I got off to a wrong foot with my own thing, you know.  B-b- b-but I need a dramatic change in my life. FATHER  You're gonna believe in Jesus Christ?
L262870 +++$+++ u5743 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ But Catholicism?  Why not your own people?
L262869 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Well, because I never thought of God in my life.  Now I'm giving it serious thought.
L262868 +++$+++ u5743 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ How can we be happy?
L262867 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I don't understand.  I thought that you would be happy.
L262681 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Tch, oh, what do you get out of me, anyway?  I mean...  it's not sexual anymore.  It's certainly not intellectual.  I mean, you're so superior to me in every way that--
L262680 +++$+++ u5744 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ FREDERICK +++$+++ Oh...
L262679 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.
L262678 +++$+++ u5744 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ FREDERICK +++$+++ Jesus...Jesus!
L262677 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me.  It's not fair!  I want a less complicated life, Frederick.  I want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late.
L262676 +++$+++ u5744 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ FREDERICK +++$+++ You are, you are my only connection to the world!
L262675 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ It doesn't make a difference!  I have to move out!
L262674 +++$+++ u5744 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ FREDERICK +++$+++ But who?  Where did you meet him?
L262673 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ What's the difference?!  It's just somebody I met!
L262672 +++$+++ u5744 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ FREDERICK +++$+++ Who is it?
L262671 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ But you, God, you knew that was going to happen sooner or later.  I can't live like this!
L262670 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Yeah.
L262669 +++$+++ u5744 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ FREDERICK +++$+++ So you met somebody else?
L262668 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I'm saying it now!
L262667 +++$+++ u5744 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ FREDERICK +++$+++ Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!
L262666 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L262665 +++$+++ u5744 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ FREDERICK +++$+++ Oh, Christ!  What's wrong with you?!
L262662 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Stop accusing me!
L262661 +++$+++ u5744 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ FREDERICK +++$+++ You've been with someone!
L262660 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ No.
L262659 +++$+++ u5744 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ FREDERICK +++$+++ Oh, yes, you have!
L262658 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ No.
L262657 +++$+++ u5744 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ FREDERICK +++$+++ Oh...Lee, you are my whole world.  Good God!  Have you been kissed tonight?!
L262656 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.
L262655 +++$+++ u5744 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ FREDERICK +++$+++ Tch, oh.  I always told you you would leave me.  But...does it have to be now?
L262654 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I don't know.  I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
L262653 +++$+++ u5744 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ FREDERICK +++$+++ What are you going to use for money?!
L262652 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Because I have to!
L262651 +++$+++ u5744 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ FREDERICK +++$+++ Why?
L262650 +++$+++ u5749 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Yes, we're going to have this conversation again.  I...I have to leave.  I have to move out.
L262649 +++$+++ u5744 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ FREDERICK +++$+++ Oh!  Are we going to have this conversation again?
