L346827 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ ...Composer.
L346826 +++$+++ u1731 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ RECEPTIONIST +++$+++ Yeah, true.  But what does your father exactly do for living?
L346825 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ I'm used to it.  Not everyone likes music.
L346824 +++$+++ u1731 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ RECEPTIONIST +++$+++ Huh? That's smart!
L346823 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise.
L346822 +++$+++ u1731 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ RECEPTIONIST +++$+++ I see. You're good, because I didn't hear anything.
L346821 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ I'm sick with practicing, that's it...
L346820 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ Fine...
L346819 +++$+++ u1731 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ RECEPTIONIST +++$+++ How are you, Miss?
L347050 +++$+++ u1734 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ THE BOSS +++$+++ Huh... Yeah, yeah... Of course.
L347049 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ Can I sit on the stairways now?
L347048 +++$+++ u1734 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ THE BOSS +++$+++ ...OK... Good.
L347045 +++$+++ u1734 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ THE BOSS +++$+++ Ten dollars... A month.
L347044 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ ...And how much is it?
L347043 +++$+++ u1734 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ THE BOSS +++$+++ Because you have to pay.  It's like a parking meter: if you stay, you pay. It's the rule...
L347042 +++$+++ u1730 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ MATHILDA +++$+++ Huh? Why?
L347041 +++$+++ u1734 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ THE BOSS +++$+++ You can't sit here like that.
L346971 +++$+++ u1732 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ RINALDI +++$+++ Salute.
L346970 +++$+++ u1735 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Salute.
L346969 +++$+++ u1732 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ RINALDI +++$+++ ...Yeah.
L346968 +++$+++ u1735 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ You're right, son. You must care the links with your family, always.  It's the only important thing in the world.
L346967 +++$+++ u1732 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ RINALDI +++$+++ I think I will get back in Messina this summer... It's too long I haven't been there.
L346965 +++$+++ u1735 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ It's a specialty down there.  It's a fishing boat with, in front, a long pole near the surface. Then, near the cabin, a very tall mast with a little cabin for the lookout.
L346964 +++$+++ u1732 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ RINALDI +++$+++ No...
L346963 +++$+++ u1735 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Did you fish in Messina? The "pesce spada"?
L346962 +++$+++ u1732 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ RINALDI +++$+++ Yes... Twice.
L346961 +++$+++ u1735 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Have you ever been in Messina, son?
L346959 +++$+++ u1732 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ RINALDI +++$+++ No... Dino's.
L346958 +++$+++ u1735 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
L346957 +++$+++ u1732 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ RINALDI +++$+++ Yeah... And still in Messina.  He's my uncle.
L346956 +++$+++ u1735 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Is he still alive?
L346955 +++$+++ u1732 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ RINALDI +++$+++ Giancarlo... Rinaldi.
L346954 +++$+++ u1735 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ ...Who sent you?
L346953 +++$+++ u1732 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ RINALDI +++$+++ I know... But I'm a little pressed.
L346952 +++$+++ u1735 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ It's a little out of the world coming to visit me this way, on mid afternoon.  It really isn't the usual procedure...
L346951 +++$+++ u1732 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ RINALDI +++$+++ Yeah, but I don't give a shit about.  I trade at left, at right and that's dangerous in there...
L346950 +++$+++ u1735 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ But... He works for your same employer?
L346948 +++$+++ u1735 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Emilio? Due grappe!  ...Why the hell did you come here?
L346947 +++$+++ u1732 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ RINALDI +++$+++ Messina.
L346946 +++$+++ u1735 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Rinaldi... Rinaldi...  What region do you come from?
L347030 +++$+++ u1735 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ These guys have no place.  They change virtually everyday. And his name...  It's a surname.
L347029 +++$+++ u1733 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ STANSFIELD +++$+++ May we have this wolf's name and address?
L347028 +++$+++ u1735 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Listen, son, you know as well as me this kind of hitmen: they come from nowhere, get the contract and disappear. They're lonely, worse than wolves.
L347025 +++$+++ u1735 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ ...Even his mother wouldn't.
L347024 +++$+++ u1733 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ STANSFIELD +++$+++ Do you recognize him?
L347023 +++$+++ u1735 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Then...
L347022 +++$+++ u1733 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ STANSFIELD +++$+++ I respect your business, Mister Tony. Every time we asked your help, we were very happy with the result.  It's right this that makes me nervous, now.  I hope you'll excuse my temporary bad mood?
L347021 +++$+++ u1735 +++$+++ m114 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ You'd better talk good, son, because, for the moment, I've got a quite bad opinion about you.  Norman smiles.
L339816 +++$+++ u1736 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ADELLE +++$+++ I received my B.S. from the University of Pennsylvania, my P.H.D. from Bryn Mawr College.  I worked three years at the Boston University School of Medicine, during which time I had articles printed in the "Journal of Educational Psychology", "American Journal of Psychology", "Psychology Review" and "Science"... So I think it's safe to say my opinion is valid.
L339815 +++$+++ u1743 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ GERALD +++$+++ Here comes the resume.
L339814 +++$+++ u1736 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ADELLE +++$+++ Why am I such an authority?
L339813 +++$+++ u1743 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ GERALD +++$+++ This smells good.
L339696 +++$+++ u1743 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ GERALD +++$+++ Adelle... Maurice is in the paper.
L339695 +++$+++ u1736 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ADELLE +++$+++ What is it?
L339683 +++$+++ u1743 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ GERALD +++$+++ For a walk.  I don't know.
L339682 +++$+++ u1736 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ADELLE +++$+++ Where?
L339681 +++$+++ u1743 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ GERALD +++$+++ He probably just went somewhere.
L340174 +++$+++ u1736 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ADELLE +++$+++ I won't let you die.
L340173 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ I have to finish first.
L340025 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ I'm completing the walk.  I'm almost there.
L340024 +++$+++ u1736 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ADELLE +++$+++ Listen to me very carefully, because I don't want you to misunderstand me... The walk is over Uncle Maurice.  Done. Finished.  You've made it to California, it was a miracle, now let's try to save your life.
L340023 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ I finish the walk, and then we may take all the chances we want.
L340022 +++$+++ u1736 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ADELLE +++$+++ What?
L340021 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Then it'll have to wait until I finish.
L340010 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ How serious is it?
L340009 +++$+++ u1736 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ADELLE +++$+++ I don't think you realize how serious this is Uncle.
L340008 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ You should definitely have children.  They're really special.
L340007 +++$+++ u1736 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ADELLE +++$+++ Maybe later.
L340006 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Are you two planning kids?
L339790 +++$+++ u1736 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ADELLE +++$+++ Uncle, the way I was told, if that police car didn't happen down that road, you would be dead right now. That guy Denny, had jumped bail in another state, he's dangerous... They'll be other Dennys, if you don't plan.
L339789 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Nothing's going to happen.
L339788 +++$+++ u1736 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ADELLE +++$+++ If you can't redo these six hundred miles when you're rested and ready, how are you possible going to walk another two thousand-five hundred miles in your present condition?
L339787 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ I've all ready gone six hundred miles... I can't do it again.
L339786 +++$+++ u1736 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ADELLE +++$+++ Why did you take the back roads here?  They're not safe.  You'd know that if you'd planned.
L339785 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ No it's not.
L339784 +++$+++ u1736 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ADELLE +++$+++ If you really want to do this... plan it out.  Rest up.  Train for it.  Build up your body.  Plan every stop along the way.  How much money?  Time?  Really do it properly.  This is all so -- by the seat of your pants.
L339783 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ I'll make it.
L339782 +++$+++ u1736 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ADELLE +++$+++ What if you don't make it?
L339781 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ You'd be visiting me at Nasa.
L339780 +++$+++ u1736 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ADELLE +++$+++ She was being symbolic.  What if she asked you to fly to the moon?
L339779 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ It's what she asked for... It's what I'm going to do.
L339778 +++$+++ u1736 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ADELLE +++$+++ It's impossible.
L339777 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ I have to walk -- by myself -- all the way -- every inch.
L339776 +++$+++ u1736 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ADELLE +++$+++ Uncle Maurice -- I spent all our frequent flyer miles on a one way ticket here... I have a rented car outside, just listen to me.  Come back with me now, and if you still want to do something like this in a year -- maybe we'll plan a car trip across the country -- Gerald and I will come along --
L339775 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Maybe one day -- after you've been married twenty years you'll understand.
L339774 +++$+++ u1736 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ADELLE +++$+++ I don't accept that.
L339773 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ I have new dreams now.
L339772 +++$+++ u1736 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ADELLE +++$+++ And your store?  What about your new store?  What about all your dreams?
L339761 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ High-top Nike Cross-Trainers with heel support and air-cushioned soles.  They're nasty.
L339760 +++$+++ u1736 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ADELLE +++$+++ Uncle Maurice, you're wearing sneakers?
L339709 +++$+++ u1737 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ DALLY +++$+++ Don't wait by the phone.  If he's really been walking this whole time, he's out of our jurisdiction...
L339708 +++$+++ u1736 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ADELLE +++$+++ Thank you.
L339707 +++$+++ u1737 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ DALLY +++$+++ Look, I'll see if anyone has spotted him recently.  If I get any information, I'll call you.
L339706 +++$+++ u1736 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ADELLE +++$+++ A couple days to a few months if untreated.
L339705 +++$+++ u1737 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ DALLY +++$+++ How long does this... Mania last?
L339704 +++$+++ u1736 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ADELLE +++$+++ I think my uncle is suffering from a condition called Mania which is linked with depression.  It is a time when an individual will act over-confident, and will act out impractical, grandiose plans. Sometimes these plans can be dangerous.
L339703 +++$+++ u1737 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ DALLY +++$+++ We're very sorry about that.  Some of our men were on the scene of the accident.
L339702 +++$+++ u1736 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ADELLE +++$+++ Sergeant, I'm a psychologist and I know the difference between normal whims people have and actions that clearly display psychological problems... My uncle lost his wife and it devastated him.
L339701 +++$+++ u1737 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ DALLY +++$+++ A.P.B.... He isn't breaking any law.  He's a grown man... He can crawl on his hands and knees to China if that's what he wants to do.
L339700 +++$+++ u1736 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ADELLE +++$+++ Put out a P.B.S.... Or whatever it's called.
L339699 +++$+++ u1737 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ DALLY +++$+++ What would you like us to do?
L339752 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ I'll kill you!
L339751 +++$+++ u1738 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ DENNY +++$+++ Oh the preacher's getting angry again...  Tell me something.  Did she die instantly or did she feel every torn muscle and shattered bone? Were you there to help her?  Or were you safe at home when the windshield sliced into her face --
L339750 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ That's enough.
L339749 +++$+++ u1738 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ DENNY +++$+++ A wife?... Did someone piss drunk run into your wife?  Crushed her like a bug.  Snapped her bones?
L339742 +++$+++ u1738 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ DENNY +++$+++ You need a ride, Preacher?
L339741 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ This is Indiana -- nothing's going to happen to you.
L339739 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ No, I just don't want anybody dying because I didn't say something when I had the chance.
L339738 +++$+++ u1738 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ DENNY +++$+++ Are you a preacher?
L339735 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Are you and your friends planning on driving soon?
L339734 +++$+++ u1738 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ DENNY +++$+++ Mine.
L340020 +++$+++ u1739 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ DR. RAY +++$+++ It's hard to say.  It's a delicate surgery.  There's no getting around the fact that it's a very high-risk situation.
L340019 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ What are the odds?  Do I have a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the operation?
L340018 +++$+++ u1739 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ DR. RAY +++$+++ We operate.  We find the artery in the brain and close the bleeding... I just did this procedure on a Senator and he's doing fine.
L340017 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ What steps do we take now?
L340014 +++$+++ u1739 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ DR. RAY +++$+++ It can, but it'll have to wait in line.
L340013 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Can it kill me?
L340012 +++$+++ u1739 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ DR. RAY +++$+++ The normal amount of build up in your arteries has been aggravated by over exertion.  This is called, "Claudication,"  As a result, there isn't enough circulation to your body.  That accounts for the discoloration in your extremities and the muscle spasms I'm sure you've encountered.
L339599 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Twenty miles?  I see.
L339598 +++$+++ u1740 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ DR. ROYCE +++$+++ I don't know -- maybe twenty miles... Of course I'm not recommending that... if someone like you had to I mean... that's how far they'd probably get before encountering serious physical walls.
L339597 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Just for curiosity sake that's all?
L339596 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ No.  How far in one attempt -- what's the farthest someone like myself could walk?
L339595 +++$+++ u1740 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ DR. ROYCE +++$+++ You should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.
L339594 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Okay.
L339593 +++$+++ u1740 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ DR. ROYCE +++$+++ You're feeling old and you want to start exercising.  A lot of men your age feel the need to recapture their youth.  Don't feel embarrassed about it.
L339592 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ You have?
L339591 +++$+++ u1740 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ DR. ROYCE +++$+++ I've seen it before.
L339590 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ You do?
L339589 +++$+++ u1740 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ DR. ROYCE +++$+++ I know what you're getting at.
L339587 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ I'm going to ask you a question that may sound peculiar.
L339586 +++$+++ u1740 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ DR. ROYCE +++$+++ Yes -- you are.
L339585 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Routine, I assure you.  I just wanted to gage my health.  Am I healthy?
L339584 +++$+++ u1740 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ DR. ROYCE +++$+++ I mean why the sudden voluntary visit  -- usually it takes gun- point to get you in here...
L339583 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Pardon?
L339582 +++$+++ u1740 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ DR. ROYCE +++$+++ So what's the deal Maurice?
L340170 +++$+++ u1741 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Good.
L340169 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ The beach of Pacifica, California.
L340168 +++$+++ u1741 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ No really, if God takes us away from each other, you know where to look now?
L340167 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Go to sleep Ellen.
L340166 +++$+++ u1741 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ If I die, you'll know where to look for me?
L340165 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Yes.
L340164 +++$+++ u1741 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Maurice?
L340163 +++$+++ u1741 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ When I was ten, my family lived in Pacifica for a year.  I used to go to the beach everyday that summer. I never felt so happy, carefree. It was a magic place for me... That's where my heaven will be.
L340162 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Why there?
L340161 +++$+++ u1741 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Pacifica, California.
L340160 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Where?
L340159 +++$+++ u1741 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ I know where my heaven is.
L340158 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Did you have a dream?
L340157 +++$+++ u1741 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ I think it's a different place for each person.
L340156 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ I don't know.
L339966 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ No it's not.  He should be here with me now, not trying to find some fucking bottle of Johnny Walker.  He's never been there for me.  I've always been alone.
L339965 +++$+++ u1741 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ That's okay -- really it is.
L339964 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ He's plastered.
L339963 +++$+++ u1741 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Your father?
L339805 +++$+++ u1741 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ It'll make it.
L339804 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ It isn't going to make it Ellen. Let the poor thing go quietly.
L339803 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Don't bring it in here -- it probably has all kinds of diseases.
L339802 +++$+++ u1741 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ It must've hit the window... I think its neck is broken.
L339725 +++$+++ u1741 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Don't be so sure.
L339724 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Face it Ellen, I'm not the type of person who reads bedtime stories. But you love me anyway.
L339723 +++$+++ u1741 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ You can change.
L339722 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ ... People that were made to be parents, and people who were not made to be parents... My parents, were people who were not made to be parents but had kids anyway.  I don't want us to be that way Ellen.
L339721 +++$+++ u1741 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Please not, 'The two kinds of people' speech.
L339720 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Ellen, there are two kinds of people in the world --
L339719 +++$+++ u1741 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Yes.
L339718 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ You've just decided, is that right?
L339717 +++$+++ u1741 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ I want children.
L339716 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ You can't change your mind.
L339715 +++$+++ u1741 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ I've changed my mind.
L339714 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ I thought we both wanted the same things.
L339654 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Please tell me.
L339653 +++$+++ u1741 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ It's one of those thoughts you keep to yourself.
L339650 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ No.  But I want to take a walk with you.
L339649 +++$+++ u1741 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ You like to take walks?
L339648 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Walk with me?
L339540 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ I will -- I promise.
L339539 +++$+++ u1741 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Show me.
L339538 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ I do love you... very, very much.
L339531 +++$+++ u1741 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Exactly.  No reason.  No occasion. It just makes you feel good to do something for it, to express your pride and affection for it some how...  How come you'd do that for a piece of metal and not for me?
L339530 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ There's no reason.
L339529 +++$+++ u1741 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Then why?
L339528 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ No.
L339527 +++$+++ u1741 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Why are you polishing it -- in bed -- in your pajamas -- at 11:15 at night?  Are you going to show it to someone?
L339526 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ A Book Society Award is a very prestigious thing.
L339525 +++$+++ u1741 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Why do you polish it?
L339524 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ You're talking to me?
L339523 +++$+++ u1741 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Why do you polish that thing all the time?
L339521 +++$+++ u1741 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ No I don't.  I don't even know if you'd walk across the street for me.
L339520 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ What do you want from me?  Would I swim across an ocean for you?... Would I walk across the United States for you?  Yes... Yes I would.  You know that.
L339519 +++$+++ u1741 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Anything?
L339518 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Yes.
L339517 +++$+++ u1741 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ I want to be shown...  Maurice would you do anything for me?
L339516 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ You don't think I love you?
L339515 +++$+++ u1741 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Sometimes people need to see things done for them -- because sooner or later they don't believe the words anymore.
L339514 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Is this going to be similar to the flower incident?
L339512 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ I don't follow.
L339511 +++$+++ u1741 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ What it is -- is the truth.
L339510 +++$+++ u1748 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ What's that?  That's not a fortune... You will be rich... That's a fortune.  What you have is a statement.
L339509 +++$+++ u1741 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ ... Love is shown through actions not just words.
L339507 +++$+++ u1741 +++$+++ m115 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ We can do it together.
