L55927 +++$+++ u374 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ RADAR OPERATOR +++$+++ It appears to be in the shape of Bob's Big Boy, sir.
L55926 +++$+++ u365 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ COMMANDER GILMOUR +++$+++ What are you saying, son?
L55925 +++$+++ u374 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ RADAR OPERATOR +++$+++ No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir.
L55924 +++$+++ u365 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ COMMANDER GILMOUR +++$+++ Is it one of ours?
L55923 +++$+++ u374 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ RADAR OPERATOR +++$+++ Commander, this is Slater in SoWest Com Three. We have a potential bogey with erratic vectoring and an unorthodox entry angle.
L56058 +++$+++ u372 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MUSTAFA +++$+++ You shot me right in the arm!  Why did--
L56057 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Right. Okay. Moving on.
L56056 +++$+++ u372 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MUSTAFA +++$+++ Ow! You shot me!
L56054 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ You've all been gathered here to form my Evil Cabinet. Excuse me.
L56053 +++$+++ u372 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MUSTAFA +++$+++ Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.
L56052 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
L56051 +++$+++ u372 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MUSTAFA +++$+++ Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
L56050 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ We've got a lot of work to do.
L56047 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure.
L56046 +++$+++ u372 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MUSTAFA +++$+++ Ahhhhhhhhh!
L56045 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Silence!
L56044 +++$+++ u372 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MUSTAFA +++$+++ We could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation process&emdash;
L56043 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ And look what you've done to Mr. Bigglesworth!
L56042 +++$+++ u372 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MUSTAFA +++$+++ But Dr. Evil, all you need to do is--  --work with this tennis ball. Squeeze it for twenty minutes a day. A few months of that and it'll be just as strong as the other arm...
L56041 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Can't you see I'm only half a man? Look at me, I'm a freak!
L56040 +++$+++ u372 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MUSTAFA +++$+++ But my design was perfect!  Your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left.
L56496 +++$+++ u368 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ FRAU FARBISSINA +++$+++ Please allow me to demonstrate.
L56495 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Really? Are they ill-tempered?
L56494 +++$+++ u368 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ FRAU FARBISSINA +++$+++ They're mutated sea bass.
L56493 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Right.
L56492 +++$+++ u368 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ FRAU FARBISSINA +++$+++ Sea bass.
L56491 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have?
L56490 +++$+++ u368 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ FRAU FARBISSINA +++$+++ Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.
L56489 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ What is it now?
L56488 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Right.  Mr. Powers, we're going to lower you in a tank of piranhas with laser beams attached to their heads.
L56487 +++$+++ u368 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ FRAU FARBISSINA +++$+++ It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
L56486 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
L56485 +++$+++ u368 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ FRAU FARBISSINA +++$+++ Dr. Evil?
L56484 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Release the sharks!  All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
L56288 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ I like to see girls of that caliber. By caliber, I mean both the barrel size of their guns and the high quality of their character... Forget it.
L56287 +++$+++ u368 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ FRAU FARBISSINA +++$+++ Thank you, Herr Doctor.
L56286 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Quite impressive.
L56285 +++$+++ u368 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ FRAU FARBISSINA +++$+++ These are the latest word in android replicant technology.  Lethal, efficient, brutal. And no man can resist their charms. Send in the soldiers!
L56284 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Breathtaking, Frau. These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers.
L56283 +++$+++ u368 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ FRAU FARBISSINA +++$+++ Ya wohl-- I mean, yes wohl, Herr Doctor. I have created the ultimate weapon to defeat Austin Powers. Bring on the Fembots!
L56282 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions?
L56090 +++$+++ u368 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ FRAU FARBISSINA +++$+++ Yes.  Scott!
L56089 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ My son?
L56088 +++$+++ u368 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ FRAU FARBISSINA +++$+++ Well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you to meet your son.
L56087 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Yes.
L56086 +++$+++ u368 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ FRAU FARBISSINA +++$+++ Remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever?
L56391 +++$+++ u376 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ That's not true, Doctor. Please, tell us about your childhood.
L56390 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ The details of my life are quite inconsequential.
L56389 +++$+++ u376 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.
L56388 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Actually, the boy's quite astute. I am trying to kill him. My Evil Associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive.
L56385 +++$+++ u376 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ Don't be so hard on yourself. You're here, that's what's important. A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.
L56384 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ No, the boy's right. I really am evil.
L56364 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Evil, actually, Doctor Evil.
L56363 +++$+++ u376 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave. Thank you. OK, group, we have two new member. Say hello to Scott and his father, Mr.... Ehville?
L56607 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Scott, don't say that...
L56606 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.
L56605 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.
L56604 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group!
L56545 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ Show me.
L56544 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ What did you say?
L56543 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ Blow me.
L56542 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?
L56541 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ I don't want to.
L56540 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Come, everyone, let us repair to the main chamber. Project Vulcan is about to begin. Scott, are you coming?
L56501 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ No, Scott. You just don't get it, do you?
L56500 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.
L56499 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.
L56498 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!
L56497 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Fine. Whatever. Mutated, ill-tempered sea bass it is.  Come, let's return to dinner. Close the tank.
L56480 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ One more peep out of you and you're grounded. Let's begin.
L56479 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
L56478 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
L56477 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
L56476 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ In due time.
L56475 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
L56474 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers.
L56473 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ Yeah. What?
L56472 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ And that's how you want to live your life, is it?
L56471 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
L56470 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
L56469 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'.
L56468 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Scott my boy, come here. How was your day?
L56380 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ You always do that!  Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil.
L56379 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ An evil petting zoo?
L56378 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
L56377 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ An evil vet?
L56374 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ Not me.
L56373 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?
L56093 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ I haven't seen you my whole life and now you show up and want a relationship? I hate you!
L56092 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil.  I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son!  Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.
L56091 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ Hi.
L56085 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Oh, really?  One-hundred billion dollars.  OK, make it happen. Anything else?
L56084 +++$+++ u373 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ NUMBER TWO +++$+++ Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.
L56083 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ All right then...  ...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!
L56082 +++$+++ u373 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ NUMBER TWO +++$+++ Don't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars? A million dollars isn't that much money these days.
L56081 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Right.  Oh, hell, let's just do what we always do. Let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage.  Gentlemen, it's come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days. Here's the plan. We get the warhead, and we hold the world ransom...  ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!
L56080 +++$+++ u373 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ NUMBER TWO +++$+++ Umm, that also has already happened.
L56079 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ People have to tell me these things. I've been frozen for thirty years, throw me a bone here.  OK, no problem. Here's my second plan. Back in the Sixties I had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a "laser."  Using this laser, we punch a hole in the protective layer around the Earth, which we scientists call the "Ozone Layer." Slowly but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the risk of skin cancer. That is, unless the world pays us a hefty ransom.
L56078 +++$+++ u373 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ NUMBER TWO +++$+++ Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did have an affair. He admitted it, and they are now divorced, actually.
L56077 +++$+++ u367 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ DR. EVIL +++$+++ Gentlemen, I have a plan. It's called blackmail. The Royal Family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world. Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money, or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce.
L56076 +++$+++ u373 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ NUMBER TWO +++$+++ We also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors.  Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved.
L56179 +++$+++ u371 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MRS. KENSINGTON +++$+++ I love you, Vanessa.
L56178 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.
L56177 +++$+++ u371 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MRS. KENSINGTON +++$+++ No, it's been too long. Best to leave things alone.
L56174 +++$+++ u371 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MRS. KENSINGTON +++$+++ I know. Let me just say this: Austin was the most loyal and caring friend I ever had.
L56173 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ You didn't answer my question, Mum.
L56172 +++$+++ u371 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MRS. KENSINGTON +++$+++ Austin is very charming, very debonair. He's handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines, sophisticated, a world-renowned photographer. Women want him, men want to be him. He's a lover of love-- every bit an International Man of Mystery.
L56171 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Did you ever want to?
L56170 +++$+++ u371 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MRS. KENSINGTON +++$+++ Of course not. I was married to your father.
L56169 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Did you ever...
L56168 +++$+++ u371 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MRS. KENSINGTON +++$+++ Just wait. Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out.
L56167 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I just don't see it.
L56166 +++$+++ u371 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MRS. KENSINGTON +++$+++ You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
L56165 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ What about his teeth?
L56164 +++$+++ u371 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MRS. KENSINGTON +++$+++ You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.
L56163 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Well, God knows he tried, but I've been rather firm with him, Mummy. You didn't tell me he was so obsessed with sex. It's bizarre.
L56162 +++$+++ u371 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MRS. KENSINGTON +++$+++ Because you managed to resist Austin Power's charms.
L56161 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Why?
L56160 +++$+++ u371 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MRS. KENSINGTON +++$+++ I'm proud of you.
L56159 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the couch.
L56158 +++$+++ u371 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MRS. KENSINGTON +++$+++ You didn't...
L56157 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ He's asleep.
L56156 +++$+++ u371 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MRS. KENSINGTON +++$+++ How's Austin?
L56155 +++$+++ u377 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Great.
L56154 +++$+++ u371 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ MRS. KENSINGTON +++$+++ Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?
L56387 +++$+++ u376 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ OK, Scott, no one really wants to "kill" anyone here. They say it, but they don't mean it.
L56386 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me.
L56383 +++$+++ u376 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ Scott.
L56382 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ No, he's really evil.
L56381 +++$+++ u376 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ We don't label people here, Scott.
L56376 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ I don't know. I was thinking, maybe I'd be a vet or something, cause I like animals and stuff.
L56375 +++$+++ u376 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ What do you want to do, Scott?
L56372 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ I don't wanna take over the family business.
L56371 +++$+++ u376 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ And how do you feel about that?
L56370 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
L56369 +++$+++ u376 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ We don't judge here.
L56368 +++$+++ u375 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ SCOTT EVIL +++$+++ Well, it's kind of weird.
L56367 +++$+++ u376 +++$+++ m22 +++$+++ THERAPIST +++$+++ So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here?
L57766 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ No need. I'll call again.
L57765 +++$+++ u378 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ BAILEY +++$+++ The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.
L57764 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ There are limits?
L57763 +++$+++ u378 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ BAILEY +++$+++ As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.
L57762 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ You don't say. How real does it feel?
L57761 +++$+++ u378 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ BAILEY +++$+++ Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods.
L57760 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Seriously?
L57759 +++$+++ u378 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ BAILEY +++$+++ Normally, we'd be eager to oblige --
L57758 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?
L57757 +++$+++ u378 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ BAILEY +++$+++ Really?
L57756 +++$+++ u387 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ STEED +++$+++ Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
L57755 +++$+++ u378 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ BAILEY +++$+++ We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid.
L58080 +++$+++ u379 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ DR. DARLING +++$+++ Ah, but you haven't see the real me. Watch closely ...
L58079 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Would that I could say the Same.
L57889 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ So I'm still ...
L57888 +++$+++ u379 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ DR. DARLING +++$+++ He said if it vanished, he'd know it was ... you who betrayed him. He took a huge risk. The ultimate test.
L57862 +++$+++ u379 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ DR. DARLING +++$+++ Three days.
L57861 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ How long have I been here?

L57715 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Sir August...?  What now?
L57714 +++$+++ u386 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ SIR AUGUST +++$+++ Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly. Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell you everything ... The weather's getting worse and worse ... they're after me ... coming for me ... come quickly!
L57650 +++$+++ u386 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ SIR AUGUST +++$+++ There, look!
L57649 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Promised? Who promised?
L57648 +++$+++ u386 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ SIR AUGUST +++$+++ Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.
L57644 +++$+++ u386 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ SIR AUGUST +++$+++ You mean you don't recall??
L57643 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Have we met?
L57642 +++$+++ u386 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ SIR AUGUST +++$+++ You
L57641 +++$+++ u386 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ SIR AUGUST +++$+++ Out in India. So character-forming for the British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen inches overnight. A whole week of lovely rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ...
L57640 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ I so agree. How did you acquire a taste for it?
L57639 +++$+++ u386 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ SIR AUGUST +++$+++ You don't get rain like you used to in England. A good shower that's the ticket. Stiffens resolve, puckers the spirit, quells the namby-pamby in a man.
L57638 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ I've come to apply for membership in Brolly --
L57504 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Really -- what happened in 1922?
L57503 +++$+++ u385 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ PORTER +++$+++ No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
L57502 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ I have an appointment.
L57501 +++$+++ u385 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ PORTER +++$+++ Then you can't come in.
L57500 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ As you see.
L57499 +++$+++ u385 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ PORTER +++$+++ You are female?
L57498 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Impossible?
L57497 +++$+++ u385 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ PORTER +++$+++ I'm afraid that's impossible.
L57496 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Mr. John Steed, please.
L57495 +++$+++ u385 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ PORTER +++$+++ May I help you, madam ...
L58072 +++$+++ u389 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ You and I. Together. But first you must confront your greatest enemy. Who could that be, Mrs. Peel? The answer is obvious ...
L58071 +++$+++ u380 +++$+++ m23 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Then who wins?
