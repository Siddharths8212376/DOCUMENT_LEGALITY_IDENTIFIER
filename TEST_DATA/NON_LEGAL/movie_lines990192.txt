L438875 +++$+++ u7020 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MADDY +++$+++ Maybe they'll be the next Dion and the Belmonts.
L438874 +++$+++ u7016 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Charlie really has a great voice.
L438860 +++$+++ u7016 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Why do guys do such stupid things?
L438859 +++$+++ u7020 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MADDY +++$+++ Can you believe I want to marry that dork.
L438519 +++$+++ u7020 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MADDY +++$+++ Michael Fitzsimmons! Is he here?
L438518 +++$+++ u7016 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Lucky lady. Hi.
L439412 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Listen, I don't expect all the troubles between us can just vanish away. But I would do what I can...
L439411 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell.
L439410 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I loved you since the day I met you, and I haven't stopped.
L439409 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Then hold me.
L439408 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I'll never give up.
L439407 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ You were terrific.  And I kept trying to push you away but you wouldn't give up.
L439406 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Oh, God, Dion.
L439405 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Charlie, I had a strange experience.  I went back to high school. And I spent a lot of time with you.  And you and Walter and Leon were singing "I Wonder Why".
L439404 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I'll just set it right here.
L439403 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ It couldn't be me.  I hardly knew him.
L439400 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ That's over. I got tired of translating everything. She thought the Big Hopper was a hamburger.
L439399 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ What about Janet?
L439398 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.
L439397 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you.
L439396 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
L439395 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.
L439394 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I thought you were...for a while.
L439393 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Charlie? Was I dead?
L439392 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ . Peggy Sue, I love you, and I need you Peggy Sue...
L439388 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I'm trying.
L439387 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Come back to me.
L439386 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll love you for twenty years.
L439385 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ But I love you. I'll love you forever.
L439384 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I've got to go now.
L439383 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Peggy! Where're you going? Come back!
L439382 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What the hell is that?
L439381 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?
L439380 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I think we should get out of here. It's going to rain.
L439379 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I know.
L439378 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I love you.
L439374 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ It opens, too. Look inside.
L439373 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Oh, Charlie.
L439371 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Of course.
L439370 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Will you take me back to my grandparents?
L439368 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I might be crazy, but I'm not crazy enough to marry you twice. There's a lot of things I can't change. I can't even think about them. I tried. But I couldn't even help Rosalie.  I don't want to be bitter. I'm a naturally optimistic person. But you took advantage of that.
L439367 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You're crazy! You're really out of your mind!
L439366 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ You betrayed me, Charlie. You were never there for me or the children. And now you come and tell me, "Peggy, you're scared." Of course I'm scared. If you knew what I knew you'd be scared shitless.
L439365 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What?
L439364 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice.
L439362 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ How could you possibly know what I've been going through?
L439361 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Look. I wanna tell you. I forgive you for everything. I know what you've been going through. You're just scared. I was scared, too, but I'm not anymore.
L439360 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Right here. Now sit down.
L439359 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Let me got! Where are you taking me?
L439357 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You're going to listen to me.
L439356 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
L439355 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.
L439354 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here?
L439293 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Okay. Listen, I cancelled the tickets for Fabian. I thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant, Chez Tres.
L439292 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Forget it, it'll never work.
L439255 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ That's all I wanted to hear. 'Cause I'm never going to give up on us. It's easy to fall apart in a crisis. It's easy to be selfish and say goodbye and good luck. But this is more than love. This is a mental decision. Just wait till tomorrow, when you see your birthday present. Then you'll understand.
L439254 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ It means I care about you and what happens to you.
L439253 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Does this mean you like me again?
L439252 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ If you took the trouble to write it, then sure, I'll take a look at it. But I'm beginning to think that maybe there's more to life than music. I wonder if people would still like me if I stopped being Mr. Excitement?
L439251 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Just take a look at it. 
L439250 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it.
L439249 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Not exactly, but with your great voice, it'll be a huge hit. Honest.
L439248 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You're kidding. You wrote a song? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why?
L439247 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
L439246 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ That's real big of you.
L439245 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I'd forgotten how much music meant to you.
L439244 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Hey. I guess there's a lot of things we don't know about each other.
L439243 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group.
L439242 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Not terrific enough. What were you doing in that part of town? Who were you with?
L439241 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.
L439240 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ How'd you know about that?
L439239 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
L439238 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while.
L439237 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Oh. I guess I always liked Rusty better.  Could you give me a ride to school?
L439236 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Rusty's dead. That's Ajax
L439235 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to...  Good dog, Rusty. Good dog.
L439234 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What're you doing here?
L439129 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You don't know zip! You think I'm going to end up selling appliances like my father? Chasing women around the store. I've got to give it a shot. Why are you trying to kill the two things that mean the most to me? Until yesterday you loved me and you loved us.  ) What the hell has changed? For two years I've done nothing but love you. I'll show you, I'm going to be just like Fabian!
L439128 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I'm trying to save you years of frustration... waiting for a big break... no. Waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me.
L439127 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What! What about the group and my singing career? What about me?
L439126 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. And finish.
L439125 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ But what has to be different?
L439124 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ That's just it. You can always get to me. There's this window in my heart and every time I leave it open, you climb in. Unless I close it now, nothing's ever going to be different!
L439123 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What about everything I said to you this afternoon...
L439122 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I just can't trust you anymore.
L439121 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What are you talking about? Who's Janet?
L439120 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ That won't make any difference. We just can't live together. And you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo Janet.
L439119 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I will be happy if I have you. I love you.
L439118 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Charlie,. I've been trying to postpone this. But what's the point? It's over.  I don't want to hurt you. This is very hard for me. I'm doing this for both of us. I really want you to be happy.
L439117 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car. I'm the lead singer, I'm the man.
L439116 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?
L439115 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this.
L439114 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ You know I never could stand your sarcasm.
L439113 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did "Book of Love —— Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..." I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted?
L439112 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night. I didn't feel like going home, so we went for a ride.
L439111 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I want to know what's going on. Dolores told me that you and that scuzzball Michael Fitzsimmons...
L439110 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Let's go down to the basement.
L439109 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L439108 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I have to talk to you..
L439107 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Charlie. I just had the strangest dream.
L439040 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
L439039 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ What am I going to do with you?
L439038 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Because nothing else matters. That's the great thing about love. Every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and I know that I'm not perfect either, things just work out better in the end. Cause you're my baby and I love you.
L439037 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Why?
L439036 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?
L439035 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand.
L439034 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts.
L439033 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Charlie. About last nights..
L439032 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Nothing.. Selling is selling.
L439031 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ What do you know about classical music?
L438915 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Save it.
L438914 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I'm sorry Charlie.
L438913 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You're damn right! Jesus! Peggy! You sure know how to spoil a mood.
L438912 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ This is a mistake. We better forget it.
L438910 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You mean my wang? Listen, it's running real late.
L438909 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ You know. Your love machine... the throbbing thrill hammer... your thing!
L438908 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Who?
L438907 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I probably meant it when I said it.  Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?
L438906 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ But you're the one who wanted to wait till we got married. And you were right. We should wait.
L438905 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ A lot's happened since last weekend.
L438904 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What?! You mean sex?! Intercourse?  You want to have intercourse! Last weekend you said... What time is it?
L438903 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Charlie, let's make love.
L438902 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You know I do.  I even wrote you into my will.
L438901 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ You really love me, don't you?
L438900 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight.  And the tide rushes in.
L438899 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Mmm. This is nice.  I always loved the way you kiss.  I missed you.
L438896 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Yeah I know.  But I don't have to flatter you.  It just feels right. You're the perfect girl for me.  As in is, was and always will be.  I'm glad dancing was invented.  You know the first dances were rituals. Like fertility rites.
L438895 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ You're pretty charming when you want to be.
L438894 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ There isn't a girl in school that can hold a candle to you..
L438892 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Come on, let's dance.
L438891 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
L438890 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ He's trying.
L438889 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Is he gonna help you with that physics stuff?
L438888 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Charlie, what do you think of Richard Norvik?
L438841 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Seriously. What's it like to be eighteen?
L438840 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I'm fine Peggy Sue. And how are you? Are we talking on the phone? Are we pen pals?
L438839 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Charlie, how are you?
L438838 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Is this slow enough for you?
L438837 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Right. I promised my mother.
L438836 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Hey! What's the fun of being a teenager if you can't dress weird? And we're going to have fun tonight, right?
L438835 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ It's really Fifties. You sort of clash with the world.
L438834 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Great, isn't it?
L438833 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Where did you get that sweater?
L438743 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Good.
L438742 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Yeah. Like that.
L438741 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Rejected, worthless, miserable.
L438740 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah...
L438739 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I thought it had a lot of merit.
L438738 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch. I guess I deserved it. I've been thinking about my three year plan and I think it's unworkable. I must have been delirious.
L438737 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Thanks.
L438736 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Looking good out there.
L438683 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Would I?!! Why I oughta...
L438682 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Would you?
L438681 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Want me to drive you home later?
L438679 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ They'll learn to live with it.
L438678 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents?
L438677 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Why wait?
L438676 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ It's not going to be forever. I figure three years is long enough. I can see it the music pans out.  And right after graduation we should start seeing other people. Kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married. Know what I mean?
L438675 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I can understand that.. But please don't start crying again.
L438674 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Maybe I blocked it out.
L438673 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
L438672 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Refresh my memory.
L438671 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You know. About what we said on Tuesday. It makes a lot of sense.
L438670 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Oh yeah?
L438669 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Not that I'm glad you were sick, but I had a chance to do some thinking last night.
L438668 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I call this the staccato. 
L438667 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ You drive like a maniac!
L438666 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Hey, I can take a hint. You look great today.
L438665 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Not now, Charlie. I've got a headache. Get used to the word. Roll it around your tongue for a years.
L438663 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Pretty strange.
L438662 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ How do you feel?
L438558 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ No. You are the undead. You will live forever if you give me your Twinkie.  Come on, let's have it. You hate them anyway.
L438557 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Charlie! Am I dead?
L438556 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I vant to suck your blood. I also vant to suck your Twinkie.
L438392 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I'm not going.
L438391 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Are you taking Janet to the reunion tonight?

L438389 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I know. Put Scott through college.
L438388 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You don't want them? They're going to make a big comeback any minute. Mark my words, these lamps are going to...
L438387 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I don't buy them anymore. You were the only one who drank them.
L438386 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You got a Tab?
L438384 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Jesus, Peggy. Take it easy. I'm not used to that stuff. You always did the bills. Blame the damn post office.
L438383 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here.
L438382 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I mailed it to you on Wednesday.

L438380 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Come off it, Peggy. And what do you mean your house? This is my house. I paid for it, I'm still paying for it.
L438379 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ There's something pathetic parked in front of my house.
L438369 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ And nothing will ever change that.
L438368 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.
L438367 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ But you love me don't you?
L438366 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I can't. I'm too embarrassed.
L438365 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Come on Peggy. Say what we rehearsed.
L438364 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ ...to record how much we love each other. Sitting beside me is the cutest majorette in the history of the world. And she would Like to say something.
L438363 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Charlie...
L438362 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ We're here on the sofa bed...
L438361 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Don't say that...
L438360 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ And we're here on the couch...
L438832 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Of course.
L438831 +++$+++ u7022 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MR. KELCHER +++$+++ Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself.
