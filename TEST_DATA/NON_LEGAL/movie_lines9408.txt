L535891 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ It's his way.
L535890 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ He's just going to hang around the bushes while we eat?
L535888 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ How did you know Gracie's pregnant? Nobody knows that.
L535887 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Just a little joke. See you later, old friend.
L535831 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Very likely. You're not exactly catching us at our best.
L535830 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ Or believe, I'll bet.
L535829 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ In fact, we may be able to help -- in ways that, frankly, you couldn't possibly imagine.
L535828 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ Then --
L535827 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ We can't tell you.  Please, just -- let me finish. I can tell you that we're not in the military and that we intend no harm to the whales.
L535826 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ All right. Who are you? and don't jerk me around any more. I want to know how you know that.
L535824 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ Well, that's something. I'da let you off right here.
L535823 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ No, ma'am. No dipshit.
L535817 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ It means that they will be at risk from whale hunters -- same as the rest of the humpbacks.  What did you mean when you said all that stuff back at the Institute about extinction?
L535816 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What does that mean, exactly? Take their chances.
L535815 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ They're gonna hafta take their chances.
L535814 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What's going to happen when you release the whales?
L535813 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ Go ahead.
L535812 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Can I ask <u>you</u> something?
L535811 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ A landlubber. Come on, what the hell were you boys really trying to do back there? Was it some kinda macho thing? If that's all, I'm gonna be real disappointed. I hate that macho type.
L535810 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Iowa.
L535809 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?
L535808 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Memory problems, too.
L535805 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ Don't mention it. And don't try anything, either. I got a tire iron right where I can get at it.
L535804 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Thanks.
L535803 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ You've already been that. C'mon.
L535802 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ We don't want to be any trouble.
L535801 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ LDS?? Are you dyslexic on top of everything else? Come on, Lemme give you a lift. I have a notorious weakness for hard luck cases -- that's why I work with whales.
L535800 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ He's harmless.  Back in the sixties he was part of the Free Speech movement at Berkeley. I think he did too much LDS.
L535799 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ I buy that. What about him?
L535798 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ There's really very little point in my trying to explain.
L535797 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ Came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies, huh?
L535796 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Back to San Francisco.
L535740 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ The hell you were, buster. Your friend was messing up my tank and messing up my whales...
L535739 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help...
L535738 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ Ohhh<u>kay</u>. I don't know what this is about, but I want you guys outta here right now or I call the cops.
L535726 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ Soon... It's too bad because they're very friendly as you can see. I've grown quite attached to them... This way.
L535725 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ How soon?
L535724 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ Well, for one thing, we simply don't have the money to keep feeding them a couple of tons of shrimp a day!
L535723 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Why's that?
L535722 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ Despite all the things they are teaching us we have to return George and Gracie to the open sea.
L535720 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ It's perfect, Spock: a male, a female, together in a contained space can beam them up together and consider ourselves damn lucky...
L535719 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ They are mature humpbacks, weighing 45,000 pounds each. They wandered into San Francisco Bay as calves and were brought here. We call them George and Gracie.
L535714 +++$+++ u2957 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ GILLIAN +++$+++ To put it mildly. Since the dawn of time, men have harvested whales for a variety of purposes, most of which can be achieved synthetically at this point. A hundred years ago, using hand-thrown harpoons, they did plenty of damage -- but that was nothing compared to what they've achieved in this century.
L535713 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You mean man...
L536257 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I will, Admiral.
L536256 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You got us to the right place, Spock. Now all we have to do is get the whales out before we <u>sink</u>.  Mr. Scott, come in!... Scotty...?!  Damn... Mr. Spock, see to the safety of all hands.
L536244 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No data, Admiral. Computers are non-functional.
L536243 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock: Condition report!
L536234 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Then... Where the hell are we?
L536233 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ They did, Admiral.
L536232 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock... Did braking thrusters fire?
L536227 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Hardly, Admiral, I cannot even guarantee we will escape the Sun's gravity! I will attempt to compensate by altering our trajectory.
L536226 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Can we make breakaway speed!?
L536207 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ <u>You?</u>  Spock, that's extraordinary.
L536206 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Mr. Scott cannot give me exact figures, Admiral. So I will...  Make a <u>guess</u>.
L536205 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'm taking our guest down to see her whales.  Mr. Spock: have you accounted for the variable mass of whales and water in your time re-entry program?
L536130 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Admiral, you must wait one damn minute.
L536129 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mr. Spock, where the hell is the power you promised me?
L536061 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Right.  Will you help us?
L536060 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do.
L536059 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...?
L536058 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Admiral, may I suggest that Dr. McCoy is correct. We must help Chekov.
L536047 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Thank you, Spock.
L536046 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Admiral. Full power is restored.
L535962 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Our <u>mission</u>! Goddam it, Spock, you're talking about the end of every life on Earth! You're half human, haven't you got any goddamned feelings about <u>that</u>!!
L535961 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ In that event, the probabilities are that our mission would fail.
L535960 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Damn.... Damnit! We've been so lucky. We have the two perfect whales in our hands, but if we don't move quickly, we'll lose them!
L535959 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.
L535958 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
L535957 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The tank will be finished by morning...
L535956 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Status?
L535819 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ He meant what you were saying on the tour: that if things keep on the way they're going, humpbacks will disappear forever.
L535818 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I meant --
L535793 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ How will playing cards help?
L535792 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ It's her -- from the Institute. If we play our cards right, we may learn when those whales are really leaving.
L535760 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ ... I see.
L535759 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.
L535758 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ They have a right to be...  Do you think they'll help us?
L535757 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.
L535756 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What else did you learn from your mind meld?
L535755 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The hell I can't
L535754 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You've done it before. Can't you remember?
L535753 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Exaggerate.
L535752 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You don't have to lie... You could exaggerate.
L535751 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I cannot tell a lie.
L535750 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ And another thing... It is not always necessary to tell the truth.
L535749 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I see.
L535748 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.
L535747 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Why not?
L535746 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ About those colorful metaphors we discussed. I don't think you should try to use them.
L535745 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yes?
L535744 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock...
L535737 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Admiral, if we were to assume these. whales are ours to do with as we please, we would be as guilty as those who caused their extinction.
L535736 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Come on, fellah -- speak up!
L535708 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Ah... The giants.
L535707 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Oh, the complete works of Jacqueline Susan, the novels of Harold Robbins....
L535706 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ For example?
L535705 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You mean profanity. That's simply the way they talk here. Nobody pays any attention to you if you don't swear every other word. You'll find it in all the literature of the period.
L535704 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Your use of language has altered since our arrival. It is currently laced with -- shall I say -- more colorful metaphors: "Double dumb ass on you" -- and so forth...
L535703 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock, don't call me Admiral. Don't you remember: you used to call me Jim... Now what's your question?
L535702 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Admiral, may I ask you a question?
L535701 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Yes.
L535700 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ As you observed, a primitive Culture.
L535687 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ ... Simple logic.
L535686 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ How do you know this...?
L535685 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I think we'll find what we're looking for at the Cetacean Institute in Sausalito. Two Humpbacks called George and Gracie.
L535683 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Simple logic will suffice. We need a map.  That one should do.
L535682 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Well, Spock, thanks to your restored memory and a little bit of luck, we are in the streets of San Francisco looking for a pair of humpback whales.  How do you propose to solve this minor problem?
L535678 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ And they will be again, Spock. That's the beauty of it.  How much?
L535677 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Weren't those a birthday present from Dr. McCoy?
L535641 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Nuclear power was widely used in naval vessels...
L535640 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Where would we find these reactors... Theoretically.
L535639 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We could rig a device to collect their high energy photons safely; we could then inject the photons into the dilithium chamber, causing crystalline restructure.... Theoretically.
L535638 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ But you said toxic.
L535637 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ If memory serves, there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors resulting in toxic side effects. By the beginning of the fusion era, these reactors had been replaced, but at this time, we should be able to find some.
L535636 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Explain.
L535635 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ There is a 20th Century possibility.
L535621 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Quite right, Spock. Mr. Chekov, engage cloaking device!
L535620 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Admiral, if I may: we're probably already visible to the tracking devices of the time.
L535619 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Home in on the strongest signal. Descend from orbit.
L535616 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Well done, Mr. Spock.
L535615 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere, I believe we have arrived at the late 20th Century.
L535614 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Earth... But when?... Spock?
L535591 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I have.
L535590 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You've programmed that from memory...?
L535589 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Availability of fuel components; Mass of the vessel through a time continuum, and the probable location of Humpbacks, in this case, the Pacific basin.
L535588 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What are the variables...?
L535587 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Not with this equipment. I have had to program some of the variables from memory.
L535586 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Surely you can be more specific...
L535585 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The late 20th Century.
L535584 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What is our target in time?
L535583 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Ready to engage computer, Admiral.
L535575 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Uhura. Get me through to Starfleet Command.
L535574 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ In progress, Admiral.
L535573 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Mr. Spock, your computations?
L535546 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ There is one, but I cannot guarantee its success. We could attempt to find some Humpback Whales.
L535545 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative?
L535544 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily.
L535543 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth.
L535542 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past.
L535541 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Is there any other planet where this species exists?
L535540 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.
L535539 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock, could the Humpback's answer to this call be simulated?
L535533 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Whales?
L535532 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ As suspected, the Probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales.
L535531 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock...?
L535528 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ To the on-board computer room. To confirm my suspicion.
L535527 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Where are you going?!
L535521 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Uhura... Can you modify the Probe's signals by accounting for density temperature and salinity factors?
L535520 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ A distinct possibility, Admiral. The President did say the transmission was directed at the Earth's Oceans
L535519 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Spock -- you're suggesting the transmission is meant for life form other than man?
L535472 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Well, I... find that understandable  I mean, you've been through a lot.  Station, please.
L535471 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It would be improper to refer to you as Jim while you are in command, Admiral... Also, I must apologize for my attire.  I seem to have misplaced my uniform.
L535470 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
L535469 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Thank you, Admiral.
L535468 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Permission granted.
L535467 +++$+++ u2967 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Permission to come aboard.
L536303 +++$+++ u2968 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ Aye, sir!
L536302 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Let's see what she's got, Mr. Sulu.
L536254 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Ground cushion! Keep the nose up if you can --
L536253 +++$+++ u2968 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ Sir -- I've got some back pressure on manual --
L536248 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Picture, Uhura!
L536247 +++$+++ u2968 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ I have no control, sir!
L536184 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Hover on my mark, Mr. Sulu! Mr. Chekov, stand by de-cloaking -- Scotty, ready for power build up!  Mark, Mr. Sulu...
L536183 +++$+++ u2968 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ 10 seconds, sir!
L536148 +++$+++ u2968 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ Aye, sir... Three-one-zero to the Bering Sea. E.T.A.: 12 minutes.
L536147 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
L536146 +++$+++ u2968 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ 10,000 M.S.L., Admiral.
L536144 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Uhura, scan for the whales. 401 megahertz!
L536143 +++$+++ u2968 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ Three-one-zero, aye!
L536142 +++$+++ u2958 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero.
L536141 +++$+++ u2968 +++$+++ m194 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ Maintaining impulse climb. Wing five by zero, helm steady.
