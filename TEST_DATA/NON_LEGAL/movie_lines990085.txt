L355513 +++$+++ u6367 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ And he didn't have them?
L355512 +++$+++ u6373 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ SWANN +++$+++ Oh, I was going to discover the secret of the universe.  That's why I liked Nix.  He promised me all these explanations.
L355511 +++$+++ u6367 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ And you're not?
L355510 +++$+++ u6373 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ SWANN +++$+++ I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service.  It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die.
L355509 +++$+++ u6367 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Is that all?
L355508 +++$+++ u6373 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ SWANN +++$+++ I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...
L355507 +++$+++ u6367 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Didn't know you read minds.
L355506 +++$+++ u6373 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ SWANN +++$+++ You think I'm an asshole.
L355499 +++$+++ u6373 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ SWANN +++$+++ Will that do?  No?
L355498 +++$+++ u6367 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Oh Jeez.
L355491 +++$+++ u6367 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Help me.
L355490 +++$+++ u6373 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ SWANN +++$+++ I don't know what else to do.
L355489 +++$+++ u6367 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ And she shot him I  I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix.
L355488 +++$+++ u6373 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ SWANN +++$+++ It's me betrayed him.
L355487 +++$+++ u6367 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ So Nix won't come looking for her?
L355486 +++$+++ u6373 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ SWANN +++$+++ Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's off her.
L355485 +++$+++ u6367 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Oh yeah?
L355484 +++$+++ u6373 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ SWANN +++$+++ I did it for Dorothea.
L355483 +++$+++ u6367 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Maybe he doesn't see it that way. Maybe he's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now.  That's what you're hiding away from, isn't it?
L355482 +++$+++ u6373 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ SWANN +++$+++ He deserved it.
L355481 +++$+++ u6367 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Or murdered, like Nix.
L355480 +++$+++ u6373 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ SWANN +++$+++ Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get burned.
L355479 +++$+++ u6367 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You know, it's such a fucking waste.  You can do shit most of us can only dream about, and you go around pretending it's some trick.
L355477 +++$+++ u6373 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ SWANN +++$+++ Why?  So you can fuck my wife?
L355476 +++$+++ u6367 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I don't think so.  You need me alive.
L355475 +++$+++ u6373 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ SWANN +++$+++ Now I'm going to have to kill you.
L355474 +++$+++ u6367 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ How the fuck do you do that?
L355473 +++$+++ u6373 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ SWANN +++$+++ You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
L355472 +++$+++ u6367 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Look, Ma, no wires.
L355471 +++$+++ u6373 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ SWANN +++$+++ They'll never find out.
L355470 +++$+++ u6367 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ A lot of people are going to be really pissed off when they discover you're still alive.
L355102 +++$+++ u6369 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ Who is she?
L355101 +++$+++ u6367 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What?
L355100 +++$+++ u6369 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ One question.
L355099 +++$+++ u6367 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ A couple of weeks.
L355098 +++$+++ u6369 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ Yeah.  But not as cheap.  Call me.
L355097 +++$+++ u6367 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.
L355096 +++$+++ u6369 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ Call me tomorrow.
L355095 +++$+++ u6367 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I got to go.  I'm late.
L355094 +++$+++ u6369 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ You never took a fucking vacation in your life, Harry. What's going on?
L355093 +++$+++ u6367 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ No.  I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation.
L355092 +++$+++ u6369 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ LOOMIS +++$+++ The case is closed. Harry. Tapert's given us a full confession.  Get your ass back to Mew York.
L355307 +++$+++ u6368 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ No.  He's coming back.  He's digging his way out!
L355306 +++$+++ u6367 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ And he's dead?
L355305 +++$+++ u6368 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Yes! Yes!
L355304 +++$+++ u6367 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Is he the Puritan?
L355303 +++$+++ u6368 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Nix! Nix!
L355302 +++$+++ u6367 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Who's not?
L355301 +++$+++ u6368 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ He's not!  He's not!
L355296 +++$+++ u6367 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Swann?
L355295 +++$+++ u6368 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I don't want to think about it. If I think about it he'll hear me. He'll find me.
L355294 +++$+++ u6367 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What is?
L355293 +++$+++ u6368 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ He said he knew how to protect us. But he didn't know anything.  He made us think it was over and done with.
L355292 +++$+++ u6367 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Why's that?
L355291 +++$+++ u6368 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I knew Swann.  He's a fucking liar.
L355290 +++$+++ u6367 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What about Philip Swann?
L355289 +++$+++ u6368 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Maybe... I... don't...
L355288 +++$+++ u6367 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Well, you didn't forget me.  I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield.
L355287 +++$+++ u6368 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Only I forget.  They give me pills, you know, to keep me... even... and... I forget things,
L355286 +++$+++ u6367 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ No.
L355285 +++$+++ u6368 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Have we met before?
L355646 +++$+++ u6371 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ NIX +++$+++ Liar!
L355645 +++$+++ u6373 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ SWANN +++$+++ No!
L355644 +++$+++ u6371 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ NIX +++$+++ Wait... you still feel something for that bitch?
L355643 +++$+++ u6373 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ SWANN +++$+++ Yes.
L355642 +++$+++ u6371 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ NIX +++$+++ But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.
L355641 +++$+++ u6373 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ SWANN +++$+++ Yes.
L355640 +++$+++ u6371 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ NIX +++$+++ You know I'll kill you when we're done.  I have to.
L355633 +++$+++ u6371 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ NIX +++$+++ The woman has a new love in her life.  Your friends are dead. Nobody's left to save you, but me
L355632 +++$+++ u6373 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ SWANN +++$+++ Not true.
L355631 +++$+++ u6371 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ NIX +++$+++ Because you've got nothing else to live for.
L355630 +++$+++ u6373 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ SWANN +++$+++ Why would I want to?
L355629 +++$+++ u6371 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ NIX +++$+++ You could still help me do that.
L355628 +++$+++ u6371 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ NIX +++$+++ I should have been honest with you, right from the start.  I wasn't born to show people the error of their ways.  I was born to murder the world.
L355627 +++$+++ u6373 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ SWANN +++$+++ And?
L354908 +++$+++ u6373 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ SWANN +++$+++ Binding you.
L354907 +++$+++ u6371 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ NIX +++$+++ Swann?  What are you doing?
L354898 +++$+++ u6371 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ NIX +++$+++ You want to be like that, Swann? Mud and shit?
L354897 +++$+++ u6373 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ SWANN +++$+++ Don't touch me.  He's got... got into my head.
L354884 +++$+++ u6373 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ SWANN +++$+++ No!
L354883 +++$+++ u6371 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ NIX +++$+++ You don't think I've got it to give?
L354882 +++$+++ u6373 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ SWANN +++$+++ Fuck you.
L354881 +++$+++ u6371 +++$+++ m424 +++$+++ NIX +++$+++ I've got so much power to give you, Swann.  All you have to do is...beg.
L356762 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Yeah, I'll stay.
L356761 +++$+++ u6380 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ You'll do it?
L356760 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Ok.
L356759 +++$+++ u6380 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ So, we got you on an earlier flight, but I really think you should think about staying for that talk show.
L356758 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Oh, hi, Elaine.
L356757 +++$+++ u6380 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Bob, it's me.
L356756 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Hello?
L356472 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Oh, great. I'll talk to you later, bye.
L356471 +++$+++ u6380 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ok, you're scheduled to leave Saturday, but we'll hold a seat Thursday in case, but first class is full, you're waitlisted for an upgrade... there might be a seat on Lufthansa...
L356470 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Just get me out of here as soon as you can.
L356469 +++$+++ u6380 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ These people are paying you a lot, do you think you could consider it?
L356468 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Yeah, they told me.
L356467 +++$+++ u6380 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ We're looking into it Bob, but they really want you to stay to do that talk show Friday, apparently it's a really big deal, he's the Johnny Carson of Japan.
L356466 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Can you get me on a flight Thursday night?
L356880 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ I'll miss you.
L356879 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Why are you crying?
L356876 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ Ok, bye.
L356875 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Thanks.
L356874 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ Well... have a good flight.
L356873 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Yes.
L356872 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ You're leaving right now?
L356869 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Yes, no.
L356868 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ Just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave?
L356862 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ That'd be great.
L356861 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down.
L356860 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ I'm just leaving.... do you have my jacket?
L356859 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ Hi, Bob.
L356858 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Charlotte?
L356850 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ I don't know, it just doesn't, reality changes things....we can't stay here forever, unless maybe we started a Jazz band.
L356849 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Why can't it last?
L356848 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ I know. But, it doesn't last, you have to go back sometime.
L356847 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ I don't want to go back tomorrow.
L356844 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ Well, I mean it more now.
L356843 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ That's what you said the other night.
L356842 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ I'm going to miss you.
L356841 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Tomorrow.
L356840 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ When are you leaving?
L356839 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ That lunch was the worst, huh.
L356838 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L356836 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ Around.
L356835 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ So, where'd you go today.
L356834 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ A coke.
L356833 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ What do you want to drink?
L356830 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ You're a brat, wasn't there anyone else around to lavish you with attention?
L356829 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ Well, I guess she's more around your age...  You guys could talk about things in common, like growing up in the fifties.
L356827 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ No, we'll find something around here.
L356826 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan after 2 o'clock. Did you know that?
L356805 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ I don't want to be.
L356804 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ Oh, I guess you're busy, huh.
L356803 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Yes, but no, I can't right now.
L356802 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ I'm going to Daikanyama, do you want to come walk around?
L356795 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ No.
L356794 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Do you know where we are?
L356793 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ Yeah.
L356792 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Do you ever see him?
L356791 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ Working.
L356790 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Where's your husband?
L356747 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Yeah, look at that thing.
L356746 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ You think so?
L356745 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ We should get you to the doctor.
L356744 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ It's bad isn't it?
L356742 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ I don't know, I think maybe I broke it? I knocked into something the other day...
L356741 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ What happened to your toe?
L356740 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ Fuck off.
L356739 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Nice one.
L356738 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ Oh, she'll love it.
L356737 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Four.
L356736 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ How old is she?
L356735 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ It's for my daughter.
L356733 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ They really have to work on that street name thing.
L356732 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ You made it.
L356724 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Because that would be too easy.
L356723 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ Why do you have to be with your opposite, why cant similar people be together?
L356722 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ I know, but that's what you like about me.
L356721 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ You are.
L356720 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ John thinks I'm so snotty.
L356719 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ I know.
L356718 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ In D.C., my dad was the Ambassador to France in the eighties, so we went to school in Paris for a few years... but we mostly lived in D.C., and they were never around... and then I moved to Los Angeles when John and I got married... it's so different there.
L356717 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Where'd you grow up?
L356716 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
L356715 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ But, it's great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you.
L356714 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ No one ever tells you that...
L356713 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.
L356712 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ That's too scary.
L356711 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ We used to have fun, she used to like to go to places with me for my movies and we would laugh at all the weirdos, but now she's tired of it all. She never wants to leave the kids, she doesn't need me, and they don't need me, I feel like I'm in the way. It gets complicated when you have kids... that changes everything.
L356710 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ Oh.
L356709 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ We established that we have no communication.
L356708 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ Did that help? Did you learn anything?
L356707 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ It's hard. We started going to a marriage counselor.
L356706 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ And marriage, does that get easier?
L356705 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ That's ok.
L356704 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ But, I'm mean.
L356703 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ You'll figure it out. I'm not worried about you. Keep writing.
L356702 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ I just don't know what I'm supposed to be. I thought maybe I wanted to be a writer... but I hate what I write, and I tried taking pictures, but John's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre... and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet...
L356701 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Thanks. It does, the more you know who you are... you don't care about things the same way...
L356700 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ Yeah? But look at you.
L356699 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ No, yes, it does...
L356698 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ I'm stuck. Does it get easier.
L356697 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ I know.
L356696 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ You're possessive.
L356695 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ Oh.
L356694 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ No, for a candlelight dinner, yes, for her show.
L356693 +++$+++ u6379 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ CHARLOTTE +++$+++ Oh, for her show?
L356692 +++$+++ u6378 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ I got a fax today from your friend Hiromix.
