L141629 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Egg Foo Young.  Stand up.
L141627 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ That's what I like about you, Lupus. You're a free thinker. Don't let the King tell you different.
L141626 +++$+++ u717 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LUPUS +++$+++ You really like that bitch don't you? I gotta tell you, I was pretty convinced that the whole thing before was blowing her off for her cut. You know how it is, get her to do some shit for you, throw her a bang to keep her happy. But, if you're into her... That's cool.
L141623 +++$+++ u717 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LUPUS +++$+++ Keep it up.
L141622 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ What's up with you? Bladder infection?
L141616 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ That was fucking deep.
L141615 +++$+++ u717 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LUPUS +++$+++ Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.
L141614 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ He's wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom. You believe this?
L141588 +++$+++ u717 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LUPUS +++$+++ You're a weasel.
L141587 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Let me ask you something... You really think I'm going to come this close, this fucking close and let my guard down? I'll get square with your boss. I'll get square with whoever did Al. I'll get square with everybody. Then I'm going going to cash in my chips and be on my way to a new and better me far away from here.
L141586 +++$+++ u717 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LUPUS +++$+++ So that's it, huh? You get the cops to give you a safe ride.
L141532 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Oh, you know... Don't fuck this up. I'll kill you. I'll kill your family. I'll shoot your dog... All the usual. Then he said good luck.
L141531 +++$+++ u717 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LUPUS +++$+++ What'd he say?
L141514 +++$+++ u717 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LUPUS +++$+++ Point is, you don't go through with this, he's going to go after you next. And he don't even like you, Jake.
L141513 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Point, Lupus. Give us a point.
L141512 +++$+++ u717 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LUPUS +++$+++ Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business.
L141511 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ My fucking heart bleeds.
L141510 +++$+++ u717 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LUPUS +++$+++ Exactly. 'Cept this Gillette guy. He gets to walk around in three piece suits, hob knob with the Mayor, own a bank, that kinda shit. Meanwhile, the King sits holed up in the steam, afraid to even take a leak without me or Harlin watching the door.
L141509 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Of what? They're both crooks.
L141508 +++$+++ u717 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LUPUS +++$+++ What I'm saying is, is that the King ain't gonna care. See he had a real thing with getting this Gillette guy, If you ask me I think he's jealous.
L141507 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.
L141506 +++$+++ u717 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LUPUS +++$+++ King ain't gonna like this.
L141376 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I'll find the time.
L141375 +++$+++ u717 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LUPUS +++$+++ You going to have the time?
L141374 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ When this is all over, you're going to tell me who the King put on Al.
L141185 +++$+++ u724 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ SUITS +++$+++ Okay. Here's the thing... You fall flat, you might not get anything short of stiffed. Then it's Blue River Land for everybody. Papers like these are dangerous because papers tend to multiply, then they start to take shape. Usually it's the shape of an arrow. I hate to do it, but after this, I gotta give you the blowoff. We Jake, Jake?
L141184 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Can't do it Suits. I can't lay down for this one.
L141183 +++$+++ u724 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ SUITS +++$+++ Still time.
L141181 +++$+++ u724 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ SUITS +++$+++ Then I gotta say, in my opinion, you can't get what you want.
L141180 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it.
L141179 +++$+++ u724 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ SUITS +++$+++ So what do you want?
L141178 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ It's not history.
L141177 +++$+++ u724 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ SUITS +++$+++ I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame?
L141176 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I can handle it.
L141175 +++$+++ u724 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ SUITS +++$+++ The King? Jake, you play the heavy rackets like that... They put the lug on for nothing at all.
L141174 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ The King.
L141173 +++$+++ u724 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ SUITS +++$+++ Then who's the Banker?
L141172 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Can't say.
L141171 +++$+++ u724 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ SUITS +++$+++ I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and I thought, "the kid's a prodigy." But I know that if you're using these goods... So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark?
L141170 +++$+++ u724 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ SUITS +++$+++ Hey, I been on the ramp all my life, so I got no problem with the way you help yourself, Jake.
L141169 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ A little bit of both.
L141168 +++$+++ u724 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ SUITS +++$+++ Try and keep up... You ask for the Advantage Goods, then you guys come in looking to be Bean Traps. So I gotta think you're either working the mace or playing the Jug Mob.
L141167 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Huh? Oh. She's alright.
L141166 +++$+++ u724 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ SUITS +++$+++ Can I speak to you in confidence?
L141165 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Pretty much.
L141164 +++$+++ u724 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ SUITS +++$+++ In over your head?
L141163 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Pretty much.
L141162 +++$+++ u724 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ SUITS +++$+++ Not easy pickin's. Papers like these speak to larger issues. Sorry about Alfonse.  You into something big?
L141161 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Aces, Suits.
L140934 +++$+++ u723 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ SOBOZINSKI +++$+++ What are we gonna do with this stuff anyway? Heroin? What the hell do you do with heroin?
L140933 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Just a tip.
L140884 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I try.
L140883 +++$+++ u723 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ SOBOZINSKI +++$+++ The King, huh? Nice going.
L140811 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ We got a good thing going here. You want to blow it over an overbite?
L140810 +++$+++ u723 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ SOBOZINSKI +++$+++ Do you have any idea what those monks charge for that medieval torture?
L140805 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Confidence. It's just confidence.
L140804 +++$+++ u723 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ SOBOZINSKI +++$+++ You guys got sack, I'll give you that much.
L140803 +++$+++ u713 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Ten percent.
L141621 +++$+++ u714 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ KING PIN +++$+++ Good. Good. Do not let Vig out of your sight.
L141620 +++$+++ u717 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LUPUS +++$+++ I got it figured out... He's got this thing with bathrooms. If he makes it through Customs, he'll be heading for the john.
L141619 +++$+++ u714 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ KING PIN +++$+++ So do half the other people in this place. How do I know which one?
L141618 +++$+++ u717 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LUPUS +++$+++ He's landing. He's got a suitcase on wheels.
L141617 +++$+++ u714 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ KING PIN +++$+++ Speak.
L141526 +++$+++ u717 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LUPUS +++$+++ I don't think so. Their Fix gave us the heads up and Jake's got a plan that'll probably keep him off.
L141525 +++$+++ u714 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ KING PIN +++$+++ A Fed? Is he close?
L141524 +++$+++ u717 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LUPUS +++$+++ Coupla things. They got this Fed looking around and the girl just split.
L140924 +++$+++ u714 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ KING PIN +++$+++ Consider him part of your crew. Consider him a part of me.
L140923 +++$+++ u717 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ LUPUS +++$+++ What?
L141605 +++$+++ u721 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ ROTTOVICH +++$+++ We're here.
L141604 +++$+++ u719 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MOONAN +++$+++ You guys awake?
L141468 +++$+++ u719 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MOONAN +++$+++ Let's just say he burned me once.
L141467 +++$+++ u721 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ ROTTOVICH +++$+++ I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?
L141466 +++$+++ u719 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MOONAN +++$+++ Did he buy it?
L141260 +++$+++ u719 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MOONAN +++$+++ Look, I'm not a confrontational person by nature.
L141259 +++$+++ u721 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ ROTTOVICH +++$+++ Like we told you before, we think he's into something with the King Pin --
L141085 +++$+++ u719 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MOONAN +++$+++ I want him for something big and to do that, we have to catch him in the act.
L141084 +++$+++ u721 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ ROTTOVICH +++$+++ If you Feds are so hot for him, why don't we just bring him in right now?
L141074 +++$+++ u721 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ ROTTOVICH +++$+++ Look Special Agent Moonan... We don't know what you're talking about.
L141073 +++$+++ u719 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MOONAN +++$+++ Preliminary forensics suggests he was sitting there, bloated and purple in his egg foo young for at least seventy two hours. Alfonse was not a small man and there was a lot of food ordered, so you can imagine the smell. Bad for the neighbors, good for me because in all the time I've been looking for Jake, this is only the second time I've even gotten a whiff of him.
L141070 +++$+++ u719 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MOONAN +++$+++ You are Officer Richard Rottovich. And this would be Officer Walter Sobozinski. I'm looking for Jake Vig.
L141069 +++$+++ u721 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ ROTTOVICH +++$+++ Special Agent?
L141652 +++$+++ u723 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ SOBOZINSKI +++$+++ Roger that.
L141651 +++$+++ u719 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MOONAN +++$+++ He's headed towards the eastern most exit. Do not, under any circumstances approach. I want to follow this all the way down to Vig.
L141258 +++$+++ u719 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MOONAN +++$+++ You guy's are not working with me here. I just got off the phone with my boss. After he got done ripping me a new Lincoln Tunnel size asshole, he let me know exactly how little I'm welcome back if we come up short. And now here you guys are, WASTING MY FUCKING TIME!
L141257 +++$+++ u723 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ SOBOZINSKI +++$+++ Whaddya mean? We got dick.
L141256 +++$+++ u719 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MOONAN +++$+++ Good... I gotta go.  So, what do you have for me?
L141087 +++$+++ u719 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MOONAN +++$+++ Literally. It's not a bad deal, gentleman. I get peace of mind. You get Detective Sheilds. But this is the best part, Walter... Walter, your daughter will get to keep her braces and have that winning smile. Capice?
L141086 +++$+++ u723 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ SOBOZINSKI +++$+++ This guy must have been a real pain in your dick.
L141083 +++$+++ u719 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MOONAN +++$+++ Not everyone's on the take, Walter.
L141082 +++$+++ u723 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ SOBOZINSKI +++$+++ That's it?
L141081 +++$+++ u719 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MOONAN +++$+++ Peace of mind.
L141080 +++$+++ u723 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ SOBOZINSKI +++$+++ What do you get out of it?
L141079 +++$+++ u719 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MOONAN +++$+++ You help me catch him. Whatever he's into next, I want you to be into. And what you're into, I'm into. If it all goes well, those two guys from IAD will never have to hear this tape. I'll clear you guys of anything you've ever done with Vig under the guise of some cross- departmental investigation. This prick's been on the wish list for so long, you'll probably get gold shields out of it.
L141078 +++$+++ u723 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ SOBOZINSKI +++$+++ What do you want?
L141077 +++$+++ u719 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MOONAN +++$+++ Do you want to know the first time I had a line on Vig? He sent me a birthday card.  Belated, but it's the thought, right? Oh, this prick's got a sense of humor. But, then again you guys probably know him better than I do. In fact, I've only met the guy once. But now, now I have you. The next best thing. His partners. His "Fix."
L141072 +++$+++ u719 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ MOONAN +++$+++ I've been looking for this Jake Vig for some time now. Problem is, the guy's the invisible man. A spook, a spectre, a ghost. Then, like a gift, Jake's good buddy and member of his crew, Alfonse Moorely, is found the other day with a hole in his head.
L141071 +++$+++ u723 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ SOBOZINSKI +++$+++ Who?
L141603 +++$+++ u721 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ ROTTOVICH +++$+++ Put your hand down. I don't high five.
L141602 +++$+++ u723 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ SOBOZINSKI +++$+++ High five.
L141601 +++$+++ u721 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ ROTTOVICH +++$+++ What are you doing?
L141600 +++$+++ u723 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ SOBOZINSKI +++$+++ I'm down!
L141599 +++$+++ u721 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ ROTTOVICH +++$+++ That's what I'm talking about.
L141598 +++$+++ u723 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ SOBOZINSKI +++$+++ It's just insurance.
L141597 +++$+++ u721 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ ROTTOVICH +++$+++ I don't trust anybody. You see how bad this guy wants Vig? It's like a sickness. I say we collar Vig ourselves. We got Vig, then we got leverage. And we trade; Vig for that tape. I want to see it right in front of my face.
L141596 +++$+++ u723 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ SOBOZINSKI +++$+++ You trust this Moonan guy?
L140943 +++$+++ u723 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ SOBOZINSKI +++$+++ Whoa, whoa... There he is.
L140942 +++$+++ u721 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ ROTTOVICH +++$+++ Bullshit it's cosmetic! My fucking tooth was cracked in half. I made the son of a bitch write it in as a cavity. The department's dental is for shit.
L140941 +++$+++ u721 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ ROTTOVICH +++$+++ It's cosmetic. They don't cover cosmetic. Last year I had a tooth capped. The dentist tells me I'm not covered for caps. It's cosmetic.
L140940 +++$+++ u723 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ SOBOZINSKI +++$+++ Hope so. Those fucking orthodontist bills are killing me. One fifty every time they tighten those bitches up. One fifty! It's not even covered.
L140939 +++$+++ u721 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ ROTTOVICH +++$+++ What's he going to do? File a missing drugs report? If it works out, this guy might be good for a few more turns.
L140938 +++$+++ u723 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ SOBOZINSKI +++$+++ You think this is a good idea? We never did this kinda shit before.
L140937 +++$+++ u721 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ ROTTOVICH +++$+++ Don't be an idiot. How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer? If Vig's right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand...
L140936 +++$+++ u723 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ SOBOZINSKI +++$+++ To who?
L140935 +++$+++ u721 +++$+++ m45 +++$+++ ROTTOVICH +++$+++ You sell it.
L149002 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ A couple I know are getting married.
L149001 +++$+++ u725 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ What are you laughing at? Who was that on the phone?
L148672 +++$+++ u725 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ You're all scumbags.
L148671 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Look Bella, I don't know anything about this. You should talk to Matt.
L148670 +++$+++ u725 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ Your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, then shopped me. What do you think of that? I can't get a job now.  You bastard. You're no different from Matt. A pair of vicious little shits, that's what you are.
L148669 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I don't know anything about it.
L148668 +++$+++ u725 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ Reynolds got a doctor in. They forced me to take a dope test. It was positive. As you knew.
L148667 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L148666 +++$+++ u725 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ You fucking little shit! You shopped me.
L148615 +++$+++ u725 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ Sorry.
L148614 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Ouch.
L148613 +++$+++ u725 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ Now he's a real shit. Don't get friendly with him. I'm sure he's got his hand in the till. You know what he said to me once? "I want to fuck the whole world over. That's my mission." The shit!
L148612 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Not like Matt, you mean.
L148611 +++$+++ u725 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others.
L148610 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ The Indian rope-trick.
L148607 +++$+++ u725 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ Ah, we all say that. But if we hate it, why do we do it?
L148606 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I despise the job.
L148605 +++$+++ u725 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ I've been watching you work. You're the best in the place. But you know that.
L148604 +++$+++ u725 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ Well it is. But I know where I am.
L148603 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You called the casino a cesspit.
L148602 +++$+++ u725 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ Can you? I'm happy being a dealer. At least the punters keep their hands to themselves.
L148601 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I can imagine.
L148600 +++$+++ u725 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ I got scared.
L148599 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Why did you quit?
L148598 +++$+++ u725 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ But don't worry, I'm clean as a whistle. I only did S & M.  No blow jobs. No screwing.
L148596 +++$+++ u725 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ All men are cheats.
L148595 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I hate cheats.
L148590 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ It's the tension.
L148589 +++$+++ u725 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ You're shaking.
L148580 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Goodnight.
L148579 +++$+++ u725 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ I'll take you up on that.
L148578 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Maybe another time.
L148577 +++$+++ u725 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ My car's in the garage.
L148576 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No. Thanks.
L148575 +++$+++ u725 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ Jack. Do you need a ride?
L148394 +++$+++ u725 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ How do I look?
L148393 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Is it that bad?
L148392 +++$+++ u725 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ Hi, Jack.  Welcome to the cesspit.
L148391 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Jack Manfred.
L148390 +++$+++ u725 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ BELLA +++$+++ I'm Bella.
L148338 +++$+++ u726 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ DEALER +++$+++ Seven-fifty.
L148337 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Eight-fifty.
L148336 +++$+++ u726 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ DEALER +++$+++ I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.
L148335 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Is that your idea of arithmetic?
L148334 +++$+++ u726 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ DEALER +++$+++ How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
L148333 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What?!
L148332 +++$+++ u726 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ DEALER +++$+++ How about five hundred.
L148331 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ How about fifteen hundred?
L148328 +++$+++ u726 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ DEALER +++$+++ That's not relevant. An old car like this, it depends on the condition.
L148327 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What's the Blue Book price?
L148326 +++$+++ u726 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ DEALER +++$+++ What kind of deal you looking to?
L148829 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You said it was going to be social, Giles. No business.
L148828 +++$+++ u727 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ GILES +++$+++ How's that football story corning along?
L148827 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Not entirely.
L148826 +++$+++ u727 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ GILES +++$+++ A bit unexpected, wasn't it?
L148825 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ She had to leave early. She asked me to thank you.
