L292486 +++$+++ u5938 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JP +++$+++ It doesn't bother me.  I'm just not interested.
L292484 +++$+++ u5938 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JP +++$+++ Unh-unh.
L292483 +++$+++ u5941 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Do you mind me talking about your stuff?
L292471 +++$+++ u5938 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JP +++$+++ No.  Thank you.
L292470 +++$+++ u5941 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Wow.  Thank you.
L292469 +++$+++ u5938 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JP +++$+++ Yes really.
L292468 +++$+++ u5941 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ No.  Really?
L292467 +++$+++ u5938 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JP +++$+++ ... Let it define you.  Whatever it is. Most of the roses die behind the bar. This is the first I've given out for nearly a month.
L292466 +++$+++ u5938 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JP +++$+++ Don't do that!  Don't put yourself down. If you have a quality, be proud of it...
L292465 +++$+++ u5941 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Oh come on.  There're lots of girls here who look better than ...
L292464 +++$+++ u5938 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JP +++$+++ Everyday I have my friend Rick here bring a newly-cut red rose in with him and keep it behind the bar.  And I award it to a woman of exceptional beauty.
L292463 +++$+++ u5941 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L292462 +++$+++ u5938 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JP +++$+++ He's a barman.  Whatever.  Do you mind if I continue?
L292461 +++$+++ u5941 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ The barman?  I thought he was called Rick?
L292460 +++$+++ u5938 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JP +++$+++ You see, everyday I have my friend John here bring ...
L292459 +++$+++ u5941 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ A prize?  For what?
L292458 +++$+++ u5938 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JP +++$+++ It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.
L292457 +++$+++ u5941 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ Thank you for the drink.  And the rose. Wow.  That's ... really nice.
L292456 +++$+++ u5938 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JP +++$+++ Thank you.
L292455 +++$+++ u5941 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ And this is your club.  Great club.  I really love it here.  Great club.
L292454 +++$+++ u5938 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JP +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L292453 +++$+++ u5941 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ SANDY +++$+++ You're JP Monroe, right?
L292452 +++$+++ u5938 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JP +++$+++ Welcome. 38
L292521 +++$+++ u5940 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ PINHEAD +++$+++ It has already begun.
L292520 +++$+++ u5938 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JP +++$+++ How do we start?
L292519 +++$+++ u5940 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ PINHEAD +++$+++ God?  My God was diamond and black light.  And I was his Dark Pope.  All that is changed.  A terrible beauty is born.  With a place at my right hand for a man of your tastes.
L292518 +++$+++ u5938 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JP +++$+++ But how in God's name ...
L292517 +++$+++ u5940 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ PINHEAD +++$+++ You see, we're not so dissimilar.
L292516 +++$+++ u5938 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JP +++$+++ Hey, that's what makes the world go round.
L292515 +++$+++ u5940 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ PINHEAD +++$+++ A dark star rising.  I was bound to another's system by a soul I once possessed.  A friend relieved me of that inconvenience.  Now I'm free.  Born again of Blood and Desire.
L292513 +++$+++ u5940 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ PINHEAD +++$+++ Because you want to.  You've always wanted to.  Look at your pictures.  Look at your sculptures.  Look at those tawdry representations and then ... Imagine.  Imagine a world of the body as canvas.  The body as clay.  Your will and mine as the brush and the knife. Oh, I have such sights to show you.
L292512 +++$+++ u5938 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JP +++$+++ What!?  What are you talking about?  Why should I help you?
L292511 +++$+++ u5940 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ PINHEAD +++$+++ Don't flee from yourself.  If you have a quality, let it define you.  Cultivate it.  It is you.  By helping me, you will help yourse...
L292509 +++$+++ u5938 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JP +++$+++ Fuck you!
L292508 +++$+++ u5940 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ PINHEAD +++$+++ I understand.  Their fortune was so tempting, their affection so conditional.  What else could you do?
L292503 +++$+++ u5938 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JP +++$+++ No!  No.  It's not the same ... I ... No.  What you did ... it was ... evil.
L292502 +++$+++ u5940 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ PINHEAD +++$+++ Good.  So did I.  And that's all ...
L292501 +++$+++ u5938 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JP +++$+++ Yes.
L292500 +++$+++ u5940 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ PINHEAD +++$+++ On the contrary.  It has everything to do with the world.  And our dreams of how it will succumb to us.  You enjoyed the girl?
L292499 +++$+++ u5938 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JP +++$+++ That had nothing to do with the world. Not this one, anyway.
L292498 +++$+++ u5940 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ PINHEAD +++$+++ What did you see?  The same as I. Appetite sated.  Desire indulged.  You saw the working of the world in miniature.
L292497 +++$+++ u5938 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JP +++$+++ What ... What ... ?
L292583 +++$+++ u5938 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JP +++$+++ Yes!  God, yes.  I ... I just want to hug you.  To hold you.  To tell you it's alright.
L292582 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ Really?
L292581 +++$+++ u5938 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JP +++$+++ Hey, you didn't fuck it up with me.  You know that.  It was my fault, babe, it really was.  And you know I'm sorry. And I'm sorry to see you upset now.  I hate to see you in pain like this.
L292580 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ No.  It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's like I must have done something wrong, you know?  Freaked her out.  Just fucked up something good again.
L292579 +++$+++ u5938 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JP +++$+++ That's terrible.  What a bitch.  She was obviously just using you, Terri.  Ready to dump you the second she had what she needed, interfering little whore.
L292578 +++$+++ u5938 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JP +++$+++ Sure.  Sure.  I understand.  It's cool. I mean, we've got all night.
L292577 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ I don't think so.  Not yet.  I'm not ready yet.
L292576 +++$+++ u5938 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JP +++$+++ Terri, listen.       Why don't you come here and kiss me?  I mean, it's probably ticking away in both our minds, right?  Is it going to happen?  Isn't it going to happen?  Let's get it out of the way.  See how we feel.  Then we can relax.  Talk.  You know.
L292575 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ Yeah right.  Look ...
L292574 +++$+++ u5938 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JP +++$+++ Not now, no.  I mean - now that you're here, it's like she doesn't even exist, you know what I mean?
L292573 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ A girl?  Anyone I should know?
L292572 +++$+++ u5938 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JP +++$+++ Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it up.  Put her heart and soul into it.
L292571 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ Yeah ... yeah, it looks different.
L292570 +++$+++ u5938 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JP +++$+++ No.  But, as you can see, I'm having some work done on it.  You found a real treasure for me, Terri.  I hope I can show you how grateful I am.
L292569 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ Not quite.  This wasn't here.
L292547 +++$+++ u5938 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JP +++$+++ C'mon.  It'll be great.
L292546 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ Oh, I don't ...
L292545 +++$+++ u5938 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JP +++$+++ Good ... Good ... Look, why don't you come over?  You know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk.  Just see how we both feel?
L292544 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ Yes. 53
L292543 +++$+++ u5938 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JP +++$+++ That's so good to hear, sweetheart.  It really is. You know, I .. are you alone?
L292542 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ I miss you too.
L292541 +++$+++ u5938 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JP +++$+++ I know.  I know.  It's bad.  I'm a bad person.  But I try not to be, Terri.  I really do.  And I really miss you.
L292540 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ Well ... of course I have.  I've thought.  I've ... Oh, JP, you were so horrible.  You really hurt me ...
L292539 +++$+++ u5938 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JP +++$+++ Hey, it has been known.  C'mon Terri, I'm not that bad a guy.  I have regrets. I'd like to put things right.  Don't tell me you haven't thought about me. Huh?
L292538 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ You're apologizing?
L292537 +++$+++ u5938 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JP +++$+++ No.  I mean, really?  Because I'm concerned for you, sweetheart.  I care about you.  I guess I miss you.  I'm sorry we split up.  I'm sorry I ...
L292536 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ Yeah really.  I'm ...
L292535 +++$+++ u5938 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JP +++$+++ Really?
L292534 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... I'm fine. Things are great here.  Joey's going to get me a job at the TV station.  I'm meeting lotsa new people.  It's really great.
L292533 +++$+++ u5938 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JP +++$+++ Will you relax?  Your little girlfriend left a card, remember?
L292532 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ Yeah right.  How'd you get this number?
L292530 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ What do you want?
L292529 +++$+++ u5938 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JP +++$+++ Live and in the flesh.  How're you doing, babe?
L292528 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ JP?
L292527 +++$+++ u5938 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ JP +++$+++ Not quite.
L292526 +++$+++ u5942 +++$+++ m393 +++$+++ TERRI +++$+++ Joey?
L293229 +++$+++ u5946 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Guards come exactly every three minutes....
L293228 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Eighth room down, babe...
L293219 +++$+++ u5946 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Gum.
L293218 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Delivery Entrance.  Low Security.
L293211 +++$+++ u5946 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ It doesn't have to be.  Everybody knows that if you mess with the Kremlin, you'll end up in a Siberian gulag eating your own fingernails.
L293210 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ The security's actually not that severe.
L293197 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I laughed, I cried.
L293196 +++$+++ u5946 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ That was beautiful.
L293190 +++$+++ u5946 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Hudson, God's given you a gift for cat burglary, you can t just...
L293189 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Well, forget about it.  Hawk and I are going to Rio.  We're hurt, we're tired, and a hero ain't nothing but a sandwich.  Right, buddy?...
L293188 +++$+++ u5946 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Something like that.
L293187 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ You're saying you want us to beat them to the crystal and save the world from financial disarray.
L293175 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ It was so beautiful!  When the blanks went off, they...
L293174 +++$+++ u5946 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Oh thank God, you're dead...
L293303 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Get em....
L293302 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Let's just forget it, I mean...
L293301 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Get 'em.  They went down the hallway.
L293281 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ You're a reed, man.  I gotta get Anna.  Hang in there...
L293280 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I can't believe you didn't notice. My weight.  I lost ten pounds in Rome
L293279 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Alex, are you....
L293262 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ I don't want to sound immature, but we were here first...
L293261 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I'm a ghost.  Boo.
L293254 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ "But we'll be the same as we started...
L293253 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ "We all had our quarrels and parted..."
L293249 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ You can be lookout!.....  Take Alex's gun.
L293248 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Anna, I think you better stay....
L293247 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ That was close....
L293243 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ "How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt"
L293242 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ "Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt"
L293236 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Don't worry, we'll get it...
L293235 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Now that's a lock.
L293232 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ "Maybe we're ragged and funny."
L293231 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ "Oh, we ain't got a barrel of money.
L293222 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Okay.
L293221 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Why not just go now?
L293220 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Count of three?
L293214 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Yeah, I mean, come on, going through the Iron Curtain is supposed to be crawling underneath barbed wire, it's supposed to be strangling a guard...
L293213 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ You sound disappointed.
L293212 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Shwoof, that makes me feel better. I can't believe this is the Iron Curtain.  All the guy at Airport customs wanted to know was "Who Shot J.R.?"
L293206 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Geez, this Art Treasures Room looks like a burnt diaphragm.
L293205 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ We're going in from the ground floor.
L293199 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Damn travel agency.  That Kremlin thing is in Moscow, isn't it?
L293198 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Rio, Alex?  After all they've done to...Hey, these tickets are for Moscow!
L293179 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Don't act like you've never committed a crime before, Hawkins?  I know, I made call, when Anna tracked me down I...
L293178 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ No sweat, Alex, you only made the biggest mistake of <u>my</u> life.  What was your per-diem?
L293177 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ But I said I was sorry....
L293176 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ You bastard.  You fucked my freedom for a lousy job.
L292888 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Alex, my man, it's time to play a little offense.  Where's your tux?
L292887 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ You re not thinking of going to...
L292886 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Because I'm tired of not understanding things.  Cops, Mafia, and butlers forcing me to bust my ass to steal something, which it turns out I really didn't steal--it's fucked up.
L292885 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Why try?
L292884 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Boing.  Uh, this I don t understand...
L292883 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ "Attempted."  At-tempt-ted!  I'm not happy about having to steal that horse, but I do have my pride.  Face it, when it comes to burglary, and sex, I....
L292882 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Morning edition.  Seems two thieves "attempted" to steal it last night, but thanks to three "courageous" guards, it will be ready for tonight.
L292881 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Okay, you got me, Mr. PBS.
L292880 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Ah yes, a rare Renaissance piece. Da Vinci's "Sforza," an equestrian model of a never executed statue. I consider it to be the prize of tonight's auction of objets d'equestrian.  Horse things.
L292879 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ The Butler did it.  Guy was a cross between Alistair Cook and a Cuisinart. Dude took Mr. Ed and humptied dumptied it over Gates's head.  He said it was made by, get this, Leonardo..
L292878 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Geez, Gates was killed.  Who do we send the thank you note to?
L292877 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Oh, not much.  Gates just had his tonsils taken out.  The hard way.
L292876 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Did I miss anything?
L292846 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Paint a woman in a lighthou--I don't want to steal a horse. Life is...
L292845 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ "You could be swinging on a star."
L292844 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ What am I doing here?  There are so many things I wanna do that aren't this.  Paint a lighthouse. Kiss a woman in Italy.
L292843 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ The song's over!  Come on! "You could be swinging on a star."
L292840 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ "Every day you meet quite a few."
L292839 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ "And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo."
L292835 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ "And though he's slippery, he still gets caught."
L292834 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ "He can't write his name or read a book.  To fool people is his only thought."
L292827 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ "He kicks up at anything he hears.
L292826 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ "A mule is an animal with long funny ears."
L292825 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ You know they invented something while you were inside.  Called a watch.
L292824 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ 5:32.  "Swinging on a Star."
L292823 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ You got about five minutes and change.
L292820 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Yes, master-thief, I can see that. You said something about a plan...
L292819 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ They record everything their video surveillance takes in...
L292818 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ No need.  Guards' station's right there.
L292817 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Cameras?
L292816 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Hey, you promised......Don't worry, I'm wearing my girdle.
L292815 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Whoa, you better cut a bigger hole than that.
L292811 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Don't wet your diapers.  I'll have to change them.  "Witchcraft." What's the running time?
L292810 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Alex!
L292809 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Rutherford Auction... that name...
L292808 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ I'm sorr--Goddamn Mario Brothers. Goddamn Gates.  Goddamn Rutherford Auction House.  By the way, how many seconds?
L292807 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ You're not...LISTENING!
L292806 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ There goes five seconds...My record's eighteen.
L292805 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ This isn't funny.  I'm not into this.  I...
L292804 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Hey, I'm sorry, man.  I'm putting out a fire with kerosene.
L292803 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ But you got three guards who... Shit, what am I doing?  Where's the want ads?  Gonna sell some spatulas.
L292802 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Just means it'll take you an extra 31 seconds to seduce.  You re still the best, I know it.
L292801 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ The safe's a Simpson 71.  Last time I played the game, Simpson only had a 40.
L292800 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Hmmm, nasty little safe on the 7th.
L292799 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ It's Captain Bob's steering wheel! Remember when the Captain.....
L292798 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Yo Pandora, quit hummm-ing... look at this.
L292797 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Hmmmm.....
L292794 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Sure.  That's why his meatballs are made out of marinated Chuck Wagon.
L292793 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Alex, did you know this ape was going to be here...
L292768 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Hey, get this irritable guy a cappuccino.  I gotta go be a boss.
L292767 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ I read about these people in Newsweek.  Where's all the regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain Bob's steering wheel?
L292766 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I didn't know how to tell you.  A couple brokers stopped in for Stoley Spritzers one night.  Next thing I know Fast Track Digest votes us "Watering Hole of the Month."  Now, I'm shopping for Aqua Salmon wallpaper.
L292765 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Ah, had the perfect amount of foam.  Just get me to the bar... It's the one good thing in my life that'll never change....

L292763 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Oh, not much.  Mario Brothers want me to do a job.
L292762 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ So Mr. Coffee, what went down outside the prison?
L292760 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Oh man, you still got a thing for those unmasculine European coffees? Who's your buddy?
L292759 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Come on, Alex, let's just get to Alex's.  Your bar's the only place that's going to cheer me. God, I'd kill for a damn cappuccino.  What the hell's a Nintendo?
L292758 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Now that you're born again,what do you wanna do?  Statue of Liberty?  Entertain some ladies? Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some chicks?
L292757 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Not anymore.  Now I'm the laziest damn cat burg--I'm going to take it so straight that I won't tape a Mets game without the expressed written consent of the National Baseball League.
L292756 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Still do the puzzles, still know the running times of songs, and I'll bet you're still the best damn cat burg--
L292755 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Three minutes, 51 seconds.

L292753 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ That's your definition of "Hard?"
L292752 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ My next word was gonna be "consciousness."  Swear to God... tubby.
L292751 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Don't say it, Hawkins.  I'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure.
L292750 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Looks like you've been expanding your...
L292748 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Lousy day?  The man's getting out of prison and he's having a lousy day.  What, you missing out on the Cell Block Water Ballet pageant?  Believe me, it's overrated.
L292747 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Your timing, and your shoes, are impeccable...  Good to see you, Alex, been having a lousy day.
L292746 +++$+++ u5943 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ That's the first thing I did. Smooch the ground and taste the freedom.  Sorry I was late.  Miss anything?
L293354 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Ooh-kay...
L293353 +++$+++ u5944 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ My plan is just beginning.  I'll forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers, but I'm afraid the birth of the new British Empire can have no witnesses!
L293352 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ You're unemployed, Alfie.  Boss is dead.  Her plan is over.
L293351 +++$+++ u5944 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ How.
L293324 +++$+++ u5951 +++$+++ m394 +++$+++ HAWK +++$+++ Last rites, sister?
