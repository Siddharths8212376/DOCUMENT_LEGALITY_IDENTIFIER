L130474 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Like she knows about Hollis' death. Like she knows more than you want her to tell.
L130473 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ What does it look like?
L130472 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ That's not what it looks like, Mrs. Mulwray.
L130471 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Yes.
L130470 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ You mean she just found out?
L130469 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Hollis' death. I tried to keep it from her, I didn't want her upset before I could make plans for her to leave.
L130468 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ What about?
L130467 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ She's too upset.
L130465 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Then let's go talk to her.
L130464 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ I am not!
L130463 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ You know what I mean. You're keeping her there against her will.
L130462 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ She's not tied up!
L130461 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ C'mon, Mrs. Mulwray. You've got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there!
L130460 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ The police?
L130459 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ It's either that or you drive to the police yourself.
L130458 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ You bastard.
L130457 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Okay, give me the keys.
L130456 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ It's possible. Please don't ask me any more questions now. Just wait, wait for me. I'll be back. I need you here.
L130455 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Including the death of your husband?
L130454 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ It's possible.
L130453 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ That's what your father said. You're telling me he's in back of this whole thing?
L130452 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ You may think you know what's going on, but you don't.
L130451 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Give me an example.
L130450 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ I want you to listen to me. My father is a very dangerous man. You don't know how dangerous. You don't know how crazy.
L130449 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Mulwray's girlfriend, for one thing. He wanted to know where she was.
L130448 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Do? To who?
L130447 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ That you were jealous, and he was worried about what you might do.
L130446 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ What did he say?  What did he say?
L130445 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ There hasn't been a lot of time.
L130444 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ You didn't tell me.
L130443 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ This morning.
L130442 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ You saw my fa... father? When?
L130441 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ I saw him.
L130440 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ He owns it. You know?
L130439 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ I know.
L130438 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ It has to do with my father.
L130437 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ The Albacore Club.
L130436 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Please!... Trust me this much...  I'll be back. Look, there is something I should tell you. The fishing club that old lady mentioned, the pieces off the flag.
L130435 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Where are you going?
L130434 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Please don't be angry... believe me, it's got nothing to do with you.
L130433 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ And I want to know where.
L130432 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Just... I have to.
L130431 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Where?
L130428 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ ...Yes, sort of a birthmark...
L130427 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ ...A flaw...
L130426 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...
L130425 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ There's something black in the green part of your eye.
L130424 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ What about it?
L130423 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Your eye.
L130422 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ What's wrong?
L130420 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Could you do anything about it?
L130419 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ I thought I was keeping someone from being hurt and actually I ended up making sure they were hurt.
L130418 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ ...No. Why was it.
L130417 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ You can't always tell what's going on there.
L130416 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Hold still. Why?
L130415 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Bothers everybody who works there, but to me... It was...
L130414 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ So why does it bother you to talk about it... Chinatown...
L130413 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Yeah.
L130412 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Boy oh boy, you're a mess.
L130407 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ They do in Chinatown.
L130406 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?
L130405 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ As little as possible.
L130404 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Doing what?
L130403 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Working for the District Attorney.
L130402 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ What were you doing there?
L130401 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ It was in Chinatown.
L130400 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Just. I don't know why. I'm asking.
L130399 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Why?
L130398 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ When was the last time?
L130397 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Actually this hasn't happened to me in some time.
L130396 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Well, I'm only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but if that's how you go about your work, I'd say you're lucky to get through a whole day.
L130395 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
L130394 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Tell me something. Does this usually happen to you, Mr. Gittes?
L130393 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ I guess not to you, Mrs. Mulwray. Frankly you really saved my a... my neck tonight.
L130392 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ No question from you is innocent, Mr. Gittes.
L130391 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Easy, it's an innocent question.
L130390 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ I gave everybody the night off.
L130389 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's here, that's all.
L130388 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Why?
L130387 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Maid's night off?
L130383 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Get in the car.
L130382 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ I'll stay.
L130356 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ They may not know it but they are.
L130355 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ They can't be.
L130354 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ You're looking at the owners of a 50,000 acre empire.
L130330 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Two weeks ago he bought those 25,000 acres. That's unusual.
L130329 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Is that unusual?
L130328 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ There was a memorial service at the Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper Lamar Crabb. He died three weeks ago.
L130327 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ What? What is it?
L130326 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ We got it. We got it, baby.
L130325 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ It's why he was killed. Jasper Lamar Crabb. Jasper Lamar Crabb.
L130324 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ And Hollis knew about it?
L130323 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Yeah. They've been blowing these farmers out of here and buying their land for peanuts. Have any idea what this land'll be worth with a steady water supply? About thirty million more than they paid.
L130322 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ No, I think I'd remember.
L130321 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Know him?
L130320 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Jasper Lamar Crabb?
L130319 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ In the last three months, Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres, Emma Dill 12,000 acres, Clarence Speer 5,000 acres, and Jasper Lamar Crabb 25,000 acres.
L130318 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ No.
L130317 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?
L130316 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ The Valley?
L130315 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. into building it, only the water won't go to L.A. It'll go here.
L130314 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ What dam?
L130313 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ That dam is a con job.
L130150 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Before this I turned on the faucet, it came out hot and cold, I didn't think there was a thing to it.
L130149 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ What are you thinking?
L130147 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ What about you? Do you and your father get along?
L130146 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Of course I'm sure.
L130145 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ You sure shout that?
L130144 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ For talking him into building it, he never forgave my father... They haven't spoken to this day.
L130143 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Never forgave him for what?
L130142 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Yes. He never forgave him for it.
L130141 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Oh, yeah?
L130140 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes and no.  Hollis felt the public should own the water but I don't think my father felt that way.  Actually, it was over the Van der Lip. The dam that broke.
L130139 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Then it was over the water department.
L130138 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Not over me. Why would they have a falling out over me?
L130137 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Over the water department, or over you?
L130136 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...
L130135 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Is there something upsetting about my asking about your father?
L130134 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Oh.
L130133 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ You've got one going, Mrs. Mulwray.
L130132 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ So you married your father's business partner?
L130131 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that.
L130130 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Your father is Julian Cross, isn't he?
L130128 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ I'll pay your salary plus five thousand dollars if you find out what happened to Hollis and who is involved.
L130127 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Money. How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that I don't know.
L130126 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Whoever's behind my husband's death, why have they gone to all this trouble?
L130076 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ What for? There's nothing more to say.  Get my car, please.
L130075 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Wait a minute, sonny.  I think you better come with me.
L130074 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Oh, no. I've got my own car. The creamcolored Packard.
L130068 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Another satisfied client's wife.
L130067 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Another satisfied client?
L130062 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ More like other people putting their business in my nose.
L130061 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
L130060 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Been meaning to talk to you about that.
L130059 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ How did it happen?
L130056 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ I don't believe you.
L130055 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ No, not for that one.
L130054 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ You seem to have had a reason for every other question.
L130053 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ No. I'm just a snoop.
L130052 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ You must've had a reason to ask me that.
L130051 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ No reason.
L130050 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Yes... why?
L130049 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ That your maiden name?
L130048 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ K... Cross.
L130046 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ I don't see anyone for very long, Mr. Gittes.  It's difficult for me. Now I think you know all you need to about me. I didn't want publicity. I didn't want to go into any of this, then or now. Is this all?
L130045 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ For very long?
L130044 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ You were seeing someone, too.
L130043 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ I mean I can't tell you.
L130042 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ You mean you don't know where you were?
L130041 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ I can't tell you.
L130040 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Where you were when your husband died.
L130039 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Is there anything else you want to know?
L130038 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Well I wouldn't run home and tell him whenever I went to bed with someone, if that's what you mean.
L130037 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Did he know?
L130036 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Mr. Gittes.
L130035 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Did you have affairs?
L130034 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ I don't like the word 'cheat.'
L130032 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ She's cheating on him.
L130031 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Unless what?
L130030 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Look, I do matrimonial work, It's my metiay.  When a wife tells me she's happy her husband is cheating on her it runs contrary to my experience.
L130029 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Why?
L130028 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ You'll have to explain that, Mrs. Mulwray.
L130027 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ I was grateful.
L130026 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ And you weren't the slightest bit upset about it?
L130025 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ He told you?
L130024 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ My husband.
L130023 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ How did you find out?
L130022 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Well, I suppose I am... actually I knew about the affair.
L130020 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ But he wasn't killed.
L130019 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ If your husband was killed it was.  This can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence.
L130018 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ It wasn't much of a lie.
L130017 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Sorry. Look, you sue me, your husband dies, you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato, and all of it quicker than wind from a duck's ass. Excuse me. Then you ask me to lie to the police.
L130016 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Mr. Gittes...  Don't tell me how I feel.
L130015 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.
L130014 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ I have?
L130013 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.
L130012 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Well, how much would you like?
L130011 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid that's not good enough.
L130010 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Yes. As I said, I was very grateful.
L130009 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ I got your check in the mall.
L129927 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ A check?
L129926 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Thank you for going along with me. I just didn't want to explain anything... I'll send you a check.
L129925 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Oh... thank you.
L129924 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ You left your keys in the ignition.
L129923 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ ...Just a minute...
L129922 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Mrs. Mulwray?... Mrs. Mulwray.
L129859 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Please call first.
L129858 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ I'll stop by.
L129857 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ No, Just riding bareback, that's all. Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them. Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.
L129856 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Looks like you went quite a distance.
L129855 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ No. I went riding rather early.
L129854 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Look at it this way. Now this phony broad, excuse the language, says she's you, she's hired me. Whoever put her up to it, didn't have anything against me. They were out to get your husband. Now if I see him, I can help him.  Did you talk this morning?
L129853 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
L129852 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
L129851 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
L129850 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course.  She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere.
L129849 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
L129848 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
L129847 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ What do you mean?
L129846 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ You see, somebody went to a lot of trouble here, and I want to find out, lawsuit or no lawsuit. I'm not the one who's supposed to be caught with my pants down... so I'd like to see your husband. Unless that's a problem.
