L441289 +++$+++ u7047 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ MIGUEL +++$+++ Do you think I'm ready for it?! I hate this shit. I'm not a fucking martyr! I hate every goddamn part of it!
L441288 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ I'm not ready to die.
L441287 +++$+++ u7047 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ MIGUEL +++$+++ Then, what <u>are</u> we, Drew?! The <u>winners</u>? "Ladies and gentlemen, the first prize of AIDS goes to Andrew Beckett and his lover Miguel..." Excuse me, I'm not your lover. I'm your Care Partner. FUCK!
L441286 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ You want me to give up? Let this thing turn us into <u>victims</u>?
L441285 +++$+++ u7047 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ MIGUEL +++$+++ That's right. We're on the Positive Plan. You don't have a Fatal Disease, you have Manageable Illness.
L441284 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ I'm not going to die.
L441283 +++$+++ u7047 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ MIGUEL +++$+++ Maybe you should think about it.
L441282 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ What's that mean?!
L441281 +++$+++ u7047 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ MIGUEL +++$+++ Maybe you should think about it.
L441280 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Maybe I should start making plans, is that what you think? Start planning my memorial service? "Begin to prepare for the inevitable."
L441279 +++$+++ u7047 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ MIGUEL +++$+++ No.
L441278 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ You're scared. You think we're near the end.
L441277 +++$+++ u7047 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ MIGUEL +++$+++ That's not what I said.
L441276 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ You don't think there's much time left, do you?
L441275 +++$+++ u7047 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ MIGUEL +++$+++ The least you can do is look at me, while I'm sticking this shit into your arm. Forget the fucking case, one hour a day, and give me a little of your time.
L441274 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ ALLRIGHT IT'S CLOSED!  Jesus!
L441273 +++$+++ u7047 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ MIGUEL +++$+++ CLOSE THE FUCKING LAW BOOK!
L441272 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ I'm not going to close the--
L441271 +++$+++ u7047 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ MIGUEL +++$+++ Close the law book.
L441270 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ What's wrong with you?
L441269 +++$+++ u7047 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ MIGUEL +++$+++ That shit's saving your life, you asshole!
L441268 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Fuck you. This shit's probably not doing me any good anyway.
L441267 +++$+++ u7047 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ MIGUEL +++$+++ Fuck you.
L441266 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ I said, skip it, Michael. It's my treatment.
L441265 +++$+++ u7047 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ MIGUEL +++$+++ We're not skipping this treatment.
L441264 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ I have too much work to do. Skip the treatment.
L441263 +++$+++ u7047 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ MIGUEL +++$+++ Hold still. Shit.  The goddamn vein's clotted. We have to go the goddamn hospital, so they can change the goddamn catheter.
L440993 +++$+++ u7047 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ MIGUEL +++$+++ Yes. I think it will be a simple solution. They'll put it in a syringe, inject it into your bloodstream. It'll neutralize the virus. It'll revitalize the immune system, and people with AIDS will become healthy again.
L440992 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ You got that right, Mikey...  You still believe that, don't you?
L440991 +++$+++ u7047 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ MIGUEL +++$+++ I said, "Everyone's going to die, Jimmy. But Drew's not going to die of AIDS. There's a cure around the corner, and he plans to be around to take advantage of it."
L440990 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Jerk... What did you say?
L440699 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ I promise!
L440698 +++$+++ u7047 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ MIGUEL +++$+++ Drew!
L440697 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ One hour!
L440696 +++$+++ u7047 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ MIGUEL +++$+++ You're leaving the hospital? You're going into the office looking like that? Are you insane?
L440695 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ You're not smiling.
L440694 +++$+++ u7047 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ MIGUEL +++$+++ You're going to the office?!
L440693 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Thanks for leaving school, and coming here, and...  I will be back. An hour, tops.
L440692 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ You're not going to like this. Please try to smile...
L440691 +++$+++ u7047 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ MIGUEL +++$+++ Why are you getting dressed?
L440675 +++$+++ u7047 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ MIGUEL +++$+++ I am relaxed.
L440674 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ That's the third time. I better call the office.  Would you relax, please?
L440671 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ He's not sorry, okay, fine.  Why don't we see what we find out from the blood work? I'll work on getting a specimen, I'm sure hospital food could help in that direction. Maybe, by then, we'll hear from my doctor, and we'll go from there. Okay? Everybody happy?
L440670 +++$+++ u7047 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ MIGUEL +++$+++ Don't apologize for me.
L440665 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ A reaction to AZT...
L440664 +++$+++ u7047 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ MIGUEL +++$+++ It could be parasites, an infection...
L440652 +++$+++ u7047 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ MIGUEL +++$+++ So what? It's nothing to be ashamed of. You have nothing to be ashamed of, okay?
L440651 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ I almost didn't make it to the bathroom, Miguel. I almost lost control right in front of everybody.
L440649 +++$+++ u7047 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ MIGUEL +++$+++ I said, don't worry about it.
L440648 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Aren't you giving an exam?
L440645 +++$+++ u7047 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ MIGUEL +++$+++ Yeah. Thanks, guys.
L440644 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Thanks, you guys.
L441396 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ I'm seeing him this afternoon.
L441395 +++$+++ u7052 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ WHEELER +++$+++ Longstreet's interested in the Harrisburg deal.
L441036 +++$+++ u7052 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ WHEELER +++$+++ Don't do this, Andy.
L441035 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ You can save it for the jury, Charles. I want to hear you say, under oath, in front of a judge and a jury, I'm a bad lawyer.  Gentlemen.  Counselor.
L440833 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ A carrot?!
L440832 +++$+++ u7052 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ WHEELER +++$+++ I hoped the challenge would improve your performance. You could say it was a carrot.
L440831 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ If you'd lost confidence in me, why did you give me the Kronos suit?
L440830 +++$+++ u7052 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ WHEELER +++$+++ Take it easy, Walter.
L440819 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Honesty is always best.
L440818 +++$+++ u7052 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ WHEELER +++$+++ We've been talking it over, Andy. Your future that is... We feel that, because we respect you so much, we have to be honest with you.
L440804 +++$+++ u7052 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ WHEELER +++$+++ More than your friend. Family.
L440803 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ I know that, Charles.
L440800 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Of course.
L440799 +++$+++ u7052 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ WHEELER +++$+++ Thanks for coming in.
L440619 +++$+++ u7052 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ WHEELER +++$+++ No sweat, buddy.
L440618 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Thanks, Charles.
L440601 +++$+++ u7052 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ WHEELER +++$+++ Bearing in mind that Bill Wright, the chairman of MacroSystems, is a close, personal friend of mine... which side of this mess would <u>you</u> desire to be on, Andy? And don't allow my very tight, personal relationship with Bill to influence your answer in any way.
L440600 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ It is, and it isn't, Charles. Macrosystem's new software copies all the best-known elements of Kronos' spreadsheet program. If they're allowed to sell it, Kronos will get undersold right out of business. For me, the legal principle, involved is copyright infringement.
L440669 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ He's upset, he's sorry.
L440668 +++$+++ u7041 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ INTERN +++$+++ I'm trying to help your "partner." You're not a member of his immediate family, I could have you removed from the ER.
L440663 +++$+++ u7041 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ INTERN +++$+++ Dr. Klenstein.  It's not a pleasant procedure, but if the KS is causing the diarrhea, we ought to know right away.
L440662 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ This is my partner. We keep records of hospital visits. Nothing personal.
L440658 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Sounds delightful.
L440657 +++$+++ u7041 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ INTERN +++$+++ ... meanwhile, I'd like to prepare you for a colonoscopy, so we can take a look inside.
L440656 +++$+++ u7041 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ INTERN +++$+++ We're waiting...
L440655 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ About my blood work?
L440654 +++$+++ u7041 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ INTERN +++$+++ Mr. Beckett, I'm sorry...
L441563 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You bet. We'll see you later.
L441562 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Thanks for coming by.
L441560 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Sure thing.
L441559 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I better get home. Lisa and I are having some friends over.
L441558 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ It was good working with you, Andrew. You're welcome.  Hey. Shouldn't you put that thing back on?
L441557 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Excellent work, Joe. I thank you.
L441556 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ A good start.
L441555 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What?
L441554 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ What do you call a thousand lawyers chained together at the bottom of the ocean?
L441486 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Thank you.
L441485 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Yes.
L441484 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Can you see the lesions on your chest in this mirror?
L441479 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ If it please the court, I'd like to ask Mr. Beckett to remove his shirt, so that the jury can have an <u>accurate</u> idea of what we're talking about.
L441478 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Yes. On my torso.
L441477 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Do you have any lesions on <u>any</u> part of your body, at this time, that resemble the lesions that were on your face at the time you were fired?
L441411 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Well... many things. But I think the thing I love the most, is that every once in a while, not that often, but occasionally... you get to be part of justice being done. It's really quite a thrill when that happens.
L441410 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What do you love about it?
L441409 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ I love the law. I know the law. I excel at practicing it. It's the only thing I've ever wanted to do.
L441408 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What makes you an excellent lawyer?
L441407 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ I'm an excellent lawyer.
L441406 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Are you a good lawyer?
L441394 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ You don't bring your personal life into a law firm. You're not supposed to <u>have</u> a personal life, really. Anyway, I did plan to tell Charles, eventually. But then, this thing happened at the tennis club...
L441393 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Can you explain <u>why</u> you didn't?
L441392 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ No. I didn't.
L441391 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ In the years you worked at Wyant Wheeler, did you ever tell Charles Wheeler you were gay?
L441390 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ I still am.
L441389 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Except... you were gay?
L441388 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ I suppose you could say that.
L441387 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ A regular all-American guy?
L441384 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You didn't look then, the way you look now?
L441383 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ It's possible I was infected with the HIV virus at that time, but I wasn't diagnosed until several years later.
L441382 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Obviously, at this time, you weren't sick.
L441381 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Possessed of an encyclopedic knowledge of the law. A razor sharp litigator, a genuine leader, gifted at bringing out the very best in others. An awesome ability to illuminate the most complex of legal concepts to colleagues, courtrooms, the person on the street.  The kind of person who plays three sets of tennis but doesn't sweat. But underneath the elegant surface, was an adventurous spirit.
L441380 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What kind of person is that?
L441379 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ He was... the kind of person I thought I wanted to be.
L441378 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What impressed you about him?
L441377 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Particularly, Charles.
L441365 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You're ready, don't worry.
L441364 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ I'll look over the Q and A.
L441357 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Opera?
L441356 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Want to hear my favorite aria?
L441355 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Opera?
L441354 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Thanks.  Do you like opera?
L441353 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I know a good probate lawyer.
L441352 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ I've made provisions in my will for some charities. Miguel will need a lawyer. I know it's not your area...
L441351 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ We proceed, representing your estate.
L441350 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ What happens?
L441349 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I've considered that.
L441348 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ There's a possibility I won't be around for the end of this trial.
L441347 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ For a healthy baby. For Lisa to make it through the delivery. For the Phillies to get into the playoffs.
L441346 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ What have you prayed for?
L441345 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Then we establish how Wheeler's boys recruited you after law school...
L441343 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Do you... pray?
L441342 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What?
L441341 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Charles. Okay. Miller?
L441340 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Beckett?
L441339 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Uh huh...
L441338 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ When you refer to Wheeler, call him Charles, to show how you'd been admitted to the inner circle, you were considered one of them.
L441337 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Let's review these notes for your testimony. We have a big day on Monday.
L441336 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Thank you for sharing that with me, Joe.
L441335 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Let me tell you something, okay? When you're brought up, like the rest of us, in a place like where I was brought up, there's not a whole lot of discussion about... homosexuals. As a kid, you're taught right away that queers are weird, queers are funny, they're a danger to kids, they're afraid to fight, and they all want to cop your joint. And that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there, if you want to know the truth.
L441334 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ You survived your first gay party intact.
L441321 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You're right.
L441320 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Correct.
L441319 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You think I'm uncomfortable...
L441317 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Thank you.
L441316 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ No, we have to do it. But later, allright?
L441315 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Sure. It's fine.
L441314 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Excuse me, I'm having a goddamn party, is that allright with you?
L441313 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Beer.  We need to go over your Q and A.
L441312 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ What do you want?
L441311 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Let's find you a drink.
L441310 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Get it?
L441309 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Not bad.
L441308 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'm a law suit.
L441307 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ I had a blood transfusion today. I feel great.
L441306 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Beckett. You seem... better. Energized, more alive...
L441297 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ It's me, you dork.
L441296 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ We're friends of Beckett's.
L441295 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ PARRTYY!
L441027 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Any settlement agreement <u>must</u> include, and this is critical, a letter of exoneration, making clear my termination had nothing to do with the quality of my work.
L441026 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ One more thing, Your Honor...
L440933 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Arline?
L440932 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Arline decision. Supreme Court.
L440931 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ There is no relevant precedent.
L440930 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Thank you.
L440929 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ So Kenton connected the... lesion, <u>and</u> whatever suspicions he had about your personal life... to this woman, Maria... and blew the whistle on you. Suddenly you're losing files, and it's time to let you go. But, up to this point, you've been their Golden Boy, their rising star... Their behavior is... inconsistent.
L440928 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ No. They didn't fire her.
L440927 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ They didn't fire her?
L440926 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ The partner who spotted the lesion, Walter Kenton, used to work for Benton, Myers, in D.C. There's a paralegal there, Maria Torres. She's had lesions on and off for three years. She says it was common knowledge around the office that her lesions were caused by AIDS.
L440922 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ One of the partners spotted a lesion on my forehead.
L440921 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ How did they find out?
L440920 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Rayisha. Very nice.
L440919 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Rayisha.
L440918 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ What's her name?
L440917 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Huh? Oh. Great. She's great.
L440916 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
L440915 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Find a lawyer?
L440914 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ What?
L440913 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Who'd you get?
L440912 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Fine.
L440911 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Oh, Beckett. How's it goin'?
L440852 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Don't send flowers, Joe. I'm not dead yet.
L440851 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Beckett? I'm sorry about... what's happened to you. It's a fucking kick in the head.
L440850 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Thanks for your time.
L440849 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Correct. I don't.
L440848 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Look. I know I have a case. If you don't want to take it for personal reasons...
L440847 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I knew you were going to say that. I don't buy it, and I don't see a case.
L440846 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ They sabotaged me.
L440845 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Okay... They want you out. It's against the law to fire you for having AIDS, so they make you look like a fuck up. Which leads us to the mysterious, lost file.
L440844 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Joe, from the day I arrived to the day they fired me, I performed consistently, thoroughly and with absolute excellence. And if they hadn't fired me, that's what I'd be doing today.
L440843 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Okay, okay... They discover you have this horrible, disgusting, terminal illness, and they panic, for any number of perfectly valid reasons. They're frightened for themselves, their families... Maybe it's the homo angle. Maybe they don't want to rub elbows with someone who's just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne. And how do they explain your status to the client for Chrissake?
L440842 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ The law says people with disabilities cannot be terminated, so long as they can perform the duties required by their position...
L440835 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ As in, the vegetable?
L440834 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I buy that.
L440806 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Charles, I must apologize again, for the Kronos mishap.  It was a scary few minutes around here. Wow. But thank God, the complaint was found. And no damage was done.
L440805 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Big trouble.
L440795 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ Makeup.
L440794 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Hell, they are staring. What's that shit on your face?
L440785 +++$+++ u7037 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ ANDREW +++$+++ I dove back into work, everything was fine. Until the lesions started...
L440784 +++$+++ u7042 +++$+++ m471 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Continue.
