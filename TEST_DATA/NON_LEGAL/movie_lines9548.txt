L45904 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ No, General.  I'm dancing with the war hero.
L45898 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Oh...oh well then, one more won't matter.
L45897 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ Yes.
L45896 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Ah, yes.  Well, charmed, I'm sure.  So, Princess, have you ever danced with a hero?
L45895 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ I'm Princess Bala.
L45894 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ And you are...?
L45893 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Well, if single-handedly vanquishing the enemy and slaughtering a whole nestful of termites makes someone a hero, yes I am.
L45892 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ You're the hero of the recent termite campaign, aren't you?
L45761 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ Let me think.  Hmmnn...  Never.  Bye!
L45760 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Wait!  When can I see you again?
L45759 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ Uh oh.  Goodbye!  Gotta run!
L45750 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ Aren't you gonna stand up for yourself?
L45749 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off this time.  Are you crazy?  This guy's built like a pebble!  You know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays --
L45748 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ You watch yours, soldier, or my worker friend will beat you up!
L45746 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ Why can't I just do whatever I want to do?  Why can't I just go wild?! Yahoo!
L45745 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ You -- you think I'm right?
L45744 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ You're right!
L45743 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Why should everyone dance the same way?  It's as exciting as watching fungus grow.
L45742 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ Really?
L45741 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up --
L45740 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ Are you sure this is a real dance?
L45737 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ <u>What</u>?
L45736 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ The palace, hunh?  I bet those royals really live it up.  Of course they're all a little, you know, from inbreeding --
L45735 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ I work in the palace, I don't get out much.
L45734 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ So uh -- how come I haven't seen you around here before?
L45732 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ Wanna dance?
L45731 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ What a bunch of losers.  Mindless zombies capitulating to an oppressive system --
L45721 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ Then if I go to the worker bar, it isn't improper.  Anyway, don't worry. No one will recognize us in our disguises.
L45720 +++$+++ u3721 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ HANDMAIDEN #2 +++$+++ Of course not --
L45719 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ And do Princesses do improper things?
L45718 +++$+++ u3721 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ HANDMAIDEN #2 +++$+++ Of course --
L45717 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ I'm the Princess, aren't I?
L45716 +++$+++ u3721 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ HANDMAIDEN #2 +++$+++ We shouldn't be doing this -- it isn't proper!
L45693 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ The worker bar!  Yes!  That's where I want to go!
L45692 +++$+++ u3721 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ HANDMAIDEN #2 +++$+++ There isn't anyplace else --  Except the worker bar.
L45691 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ The Club's so <u>stuffy</u>.  I want to try someplace different.
L46192 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ Mom!
L46191 +++$+++ u3723 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ QUEEN +++$+++ Bala!
L45794 +++$+++ u3723 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ QUEEN +++$+++ Darling, you must encourage the troops -- wave!
L45793 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ Who is that idiot?
L45684 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ Yes...he's wonderful...
L45683 +++$+++ u3723 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ QUEEN +++$+++ Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings.  The wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged.  Even marriage.  You're lucky -- General Formica is a paragon of anthood.
L45682 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ You did?
L45681 +++$+++ u3723 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ QUEEN +++$+++ I felt the same way before I got married.  Confused.  Scared.
L45667 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ It's just that -- well, I'm honored that you selected me, and everything, I just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if -- we had a conversation?
L45666 +++$+++ u3723 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ QUEEN +++$+++ Bala has always been a hopeless romantic, General.
L45847 +++$+++ u3718 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BARBATUS +++$+++ Don't make my mistake, kid... don't...be a grunt...your whole life...
L45846 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!
L45845 +++$+++ u3718 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BARBATUS +++$+++ I wonder...what...was it all...for...
L45844 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Hang in there, buddy!  You can make it!  Just -- take deep breaths, I'll try and find your body -- it's gotta be around here somewhere!
L45843 +++$+++ u3718 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BARBATUS +++$+++ No -- I can see it in your eyes.  I'm a goner.  It's alright, Z.  In this ant's army, a soldier's life ain't worth a sack of fungus.  I can't feel my legs...
L45842 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ No, no, you're...lookin' good. You've got good color in your cheeks.
L45841 +++$+++ u3718 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BARBATUS +++$+++ Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad?
L45840 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Barbatus!
L45839 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Barbatus?
L45838 +++$+++ u3718 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BARBATUS +++$+++ Z!  Over here!
L45826 +++$+++ u3718 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BARBATUS +++$+++ Don't get all sappy about it!
L45825 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ BARBATUS!  You -- you saved my life!
L45819 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Maybe they went out for the evening. Let's leave them a message and head home.
L45818 +++$+++ u3718 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BARBATUS +++$+++ Don't be scared, kid.  Barbatus's got yer back.
L45814 +++$+++ u3718 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BARBATUS +++$+++ Superior numbers, kid!
L45813 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ So we're going back for more armor, right?  I mean, these guys are from outer space, how are we supposed to beat them?!
L45811 +++$+++ u3718 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BARBATUS +++$+++ Our platoon has the best assignment of all.  We're the first into battle!
L45810 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Well, what exactly does our platoon do?  Serve beverages?  Process paperwork?
L45805 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Attack?  But -- I hate attacking! It's so hostile!
L45804 +++$+++ u3718 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BARBATUS +++$+++ No -- we're going to attack the termites!
L45803 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of playing hard to get.  As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable.  So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?
L45802 +++$+++ u3718 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BARBATUS +++$+++ You just stick by old Barbatus. He'll watch out for you.  Whatsamatter, kid?  Leave a girl behind?
L45799 +++$+++ u3718 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BARBATUS +++$+++ Trial membership?  Kid, when you join this ant's army, you're in for the full hitch.
L45798 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ I just joined up.  But I'm quitting! I got a trial membership!
L45797 +++$+++ u3718 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BARBATUS +++$+++ You new, kid?
L46250 +++$+++ u3719 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ CARPENTER +++$+++ Uh, actually, we <u>are</u> outnumbered sir...
L46249 +++$+++ u3720 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ FORMICA +++$+++ What are you doing?!  ATTACK!!  Come on, you yellow-bellies!  Don't just stand there, Carpenter! Make an example of yourself!
L46035 +++$+++ u3719 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ CARPENTER +++$+++ Ant Team Six...
L46034 +++$+++ u3720 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ FORMICA +++$+++ Desperate times call for desperate measures.  Get me Ant Team Six.
L46033 +++$+++ u3719 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ CARPENTER +++$+++ Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors. Nothing reliable.
L46032 +++$+++ u3720 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ FORMICA +++$+++ What do we have on this "Insectopia"?
L46014 +++$+++ u3720 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ FORMICA +++$+++ No one should have to.  Have him brought to me.
L46013 +++$+++ u3719 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ CARPENTER +++$+++ Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
L46012 +++$+++ u3720 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ FORMICA +++$+++ Notice the big one, holding hands with the female?
L46008 +++$+++ u3719 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ CARPENTER +++$+++ I've never seen anything like it, General, they're they're...well, look!
L46007 +++$+++ u3720 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ FORMICA +++$+++ Dammit, this tunnel is priority A-1! We can't afford <u>any delays</u> on this project!
L45679 +++$+++ u3720 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ FORMICA +++$+++ Duty calls!
L45678 +++$+++ u3719 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ CARPENTER +++$+++ Fourteen-fifty hours, sir.
L45674 +++$+++ u3720 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ FORMICA +++$+++ Outstanding.  Princess...?
L45673 +++$+++ u3719 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ CARPENTER +++$+++ Actually, sir, we're ahead of schedule.  We have thirty-six seconds available right now.
L45664 +++$+++ u3720 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ FORMICA +++$+++ Princess!  You look -- outstanding. Is there anything I can do for you?
L45663 +++$+++ u3719 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ CARPENTER +++$+++ Princess Bala, sir.  Your fiancee.
L46027 +++$+++ u3724 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ WEAVER +++$+++ No, sir!
L46026 +++$+++ u3720 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ FORMICA +++$+++ Not that one.  Or that one.
L46025 +++$+++ u3724 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ WEAVER +++$+++ That's correct, sir!
L46024 +++$+++ u3720 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ FORMICA +++$+++ We know what makes an ant colony strong, don't we?  We know that no ant can be an individual.  No <u>single</u> ant matters, right?
L46023 +++$+++ u3720 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ FORMICA +++$+++ Okay, son.
L46022 +++$+++ u3724 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ WEAVER +++$+++ I...I have no idea, sir.
L46021 +++$+++ u3720 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ FORMICA +++$+++ So tell me.  Where's Z?
L46020 +++$+++ u3724 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ WEAVER +++$+++ Thank you, sir.
L46019 +++$+++ u3720 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ FORMICA +++$+++ Good.  You're a good soldier.
L46018 +++$+++ u3724 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ WEAVER +++$+++ Oh, no, sir!
L46017 +++$+++ u3720 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ FORMICA +++$+++ Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
L46016 +++$+++ u3724 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ WEAVER +++$+++ Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.
L46015 +++$+++ u3720 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ FORMICA +++$+++ So this Z...he fancies himself an individual?
L45922 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Can't we all settle this like adults -- we're not larvae anymore --
L45921 +++$+++ u3720 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ FORMICA +++$+++ ARREST HIM!
L45920 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Well it wasn't a masquerade, really, it was more what I'd call a clever ruse --
L45919 +++$+++ u3720 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ FORMICA +++$+++ What's this?  A <u>worker</u> has been masquerading as a war hero?!
L45903 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Oh, of course --
L45902 +++$+++ u3720 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ FORMICA +++$+++ May I cut in?
L45889 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Oh, hey, that's great, I think I see an old war buddy over there, it's been fun chatting.  Good luck with the hallucinations.
L45888 +++$+++ u3720 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ FORMICA +++$+++ I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...
L45887 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Well I, I don't think "living it up" is the right term -- how about "working themselves to death"?
L45886 +++$+++ u3720 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ FORMICA +++$+++ Negatory.  <u>Too many ants</u>.  And while we soldiers go out there, and fight, and bleed, and die for the colony, the namby-pamby workers live it up back home.
L45885 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ ...Not enough food?
L45884 +++$+++ u3720 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ FORMICA +++$+++ Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
L45883 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Wow, what a spread -- you know, there's a food shortage in the rest of the colony.
L45882 +++$+++ u3720 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ FORMICA +++$+++ In love?  I'm just a plain old soldier at heart.  I'll tell you what I love -- the field -- blood -- death -- orders...and the company of other warriors.
L45881 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ So...you two are in love?
L45880 +++$+++ u3720 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ FORMICA +++$+++ Affirmative.
L45879 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Engaged?  As in you're getting married?
L45878 +++$+++ u3720 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ FORMICA +++$+++ Well she better -- she's engaged to one.  <u>Me</u>!
L45877 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Well, I generally just make belittling comments and snicker behind death's back.  So, tell me, fellow war-monger...do you think Princess Bala likes men in uniform?
L45876 +++$+++ u3720 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ FORMICA +++$+++ Son, you're an ant after my own heart.  A warrior.  An ant that looks death right in the face and <u>laughs</u>.
L45873 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ ONE TO NOTHING!
L45872 +++$+++ u3720 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ FORMICA +++$+++ Of course.  The entire royal family will be there to honor you.
L45871 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Royal victory party?  Will...will Princess Bala be there?
L45870 +++$+++ u3720 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ FORMICA +++$+++ Damn, I'm proud of you, boy.  I wish I had a hundred ants of your caliber. The world would tremble.  Now, time for some R and R.  You're invited to the royal victory party!
L45869 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ No -- you -- you don't understand!
L45788 +++$+++ u3720 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ FORMICA +++$+++ Dammit, I'm proud to be an ant.  And I know each and every one of you boys will do your duty.  Dismissed.
L45787 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.
L45786 +++$+++ u3720 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ FORMICA +++$+++ Now I've heard a lot of scuttlebutt about a <u>food shortage</u>.  Well you boys are gonna be taken care of.  But in the meantime we're gonna eat the enemy for <u>breakfast</u>, we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>lunch</u>, and we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>dinner</u>!
L45785 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Lays it on a little thick, doesn't he?  If you ask me, he's one giant bore.
L46188 +++$+++ u3720 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ FORMICA +++$+++ Alright, let's move out!
L46187 +++$+++ u3723 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ QUEEN +++$+++ Very well, General -- I know you -- all work and no play!
L46186 +++$+++ u3720 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ FORMICA +++$+++ 'Fraid not, your majesty.  Goodbye, your majesty.
L46185 +++$+++ u3723 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ QUEEN +++$+++ But General -- this tunnel is your baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?
L46184 +++$+++ u3720 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ FORMICA +++$+++ Your majesty, I'm afraid matters of state keep me from attending the ceremony.
L45901 +++$+++ u3720 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ FORMICA +++$+++ They should be...  But there's something funny about that soldier.
L45900 +++$+++ u3723 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ QUEEN +++$+++ All these parties are so marvellously <u>alike</u>.
L45670 +++$+++ u3720 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ FORMICA +++$+++ I'll take your suggestion under advisement, Princess.  In the meanwhile --
L45669 +++$+++ u3723 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ QUEEN +++$+++ Look, General!  A darling baby soldier!  Don't try to be a hero!  Just make sure you come back in one piece!  Next!
L45668 +++$+++ u3720 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ FORMICA +++$+++ Conversation...yes...well...  Wasn't she briefed?
L45661 +++$+++ u3723 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ QUEEN +++$+++ Yes, General Formica.  Carry on, my good man!  I don't know what we would do without you.
L45660 +++$+++ u3720 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ FORMICA +++$+++ I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all?
L45659 +++$+++ u3723 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ QUEEN +++$+++ No snacking between meals!  Off you go!  Now -- what were we saying?
L45658 +++$+++ u3720 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ FORMICA +++$+++ Please don't worry, your majesty. Leave the worrying to me.  As you know, I'm not an ant of half- measures.  I don't pussyfoot around. This crisis is my number one priority, and I promise you it's being dealt with swiftly, and decisively.
L45657 +++$+++ u3723 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ QUEEN +++$+++ Yes, what else?
L45656 +++$+++ u3720 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ FORMICA +++$+++ We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...
L45655 +++$+++ u3723 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ QUEEN +++$+++ General, the severe food shortage that faces the colony...<u>pains</u> me. The thought of any of my children going hungry...  Who's the cutest widdle worker?  You are!  Yes, you!  Don't forget to brush your teeth!  Ship 'er out.  What steps are you taking to remedy the situation?
L45635 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ But -- but I've always felt life was about finding meaning...and then sharing it with someone special, someone you love.
L45634 +++$+++ u3722 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR +++$+++ You see?  Being an ant is being able to say, "Hey -- <u>I'm</u> meaningless, <u>you're</u> meaningless."
L45633 +++$+++ u3722 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR +++$+++ Right!  Ants!  Millions of creatures, each with his assigned task, all pulling together!
L45632 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ ...Ants...
L45631 +++$+++ u3722 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR +++$+++ What do you see out there?
L45630 +++$+++ u3722 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR +++$+++ I'm glad you asked me that question!
L45629 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Why are we so successful?
L45628 +++$+++ u3722 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR +++$+++ Ask me why we're so successful.
L45626 +++$+++ u3722 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR +++$+++ YES!!!  You know, people ask me, "Doctor, why are you always happy?" And I tell them it's mind over matter.  I don't <u>mind</u> that I don't <u>matter</u>!  Do you get it?  Do you get it?
L45625 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ ...I should?
L45624 +++$+++ u3722 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR +++$+++ Terrific!  You <u>should</u> feel insignificant!
L45623 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ I feel...isolated.  Different.  I've got abandonment issues.  My father flew away when I was just a larva. My mother didn't have much time for me...when you have five million siblings, it's difficult to get attention.  I feel physically inadequate -- I've never been able to lift more than ten times my own weight.  Sometimes I think I'm just not cut out to be a worker.  But I don't have any other options.  I was assigned to trade school when I was just a <u>grub</u>.  The whole system just...makes me feel...<u>insignificant</u>.
L46222 +++$+++ u3724 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ WEAVER +++$+++ You heard the ant -- DIG!!!
L46221 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Yeah, but I hate drowning more!  Now <u>dig</u>!
L45777 +++$+++ u3724 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ WEAVER +++$+++ Don't tell anyone you're a worker. Follow that column over there.  And come right back after the inspection!
L45776 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ What do I do?
L45775 +++$+++ u3724 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ WEAVER +++$+++ Yeah, I know.
L45774 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ You're a real buddy.
L45773 +++$+++ u3724 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ WEAVER +++$+++ Wear this.
L45772 +++$+++ u3724 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ WEAVER +++$+++ Maybe I'll get lucky.  You know, Z, I wouldn't do this for anyone but you...
L45771 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ You bet!  They'll really go for a sensitive guy like you!
L45770 +++$+++ u3724 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ WEAVER +++$+++ Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
L45769 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...
L45768 +++$+++ u3724 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ WEAVER +++$+++ I can't think of any.
L45767 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ You have to help me.  Please, Weaver. Think of all the things I've done for you!
L45766 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ What's gonna go wrong?!  I take your place for the royal inspection.  Bala comes strolling down the line, she sees me -- <u>bingo</u>!  Love is rekindled, and she takes me up to the palace for a little...  tea and crumpets... and you take your place again, and go march around to your heart's content!
L45765 +++$+++ u3724 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ WEAVER +++$+++ It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?
L45764 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Are you kidding?  There were sparks between us!  This scarf is a sign!
L45763 +++$+++ u3724 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ WEAVER +++$+++ Get real, Z!  She just dropped the scarf by accident!
L45726 +++$+++ u3724 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ WEAVER +++$+++ Well, you just sit here and be a party-pooper.
L45725 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ I'm not in the mood.  Even when they're off work, they follow orders.
L45724 +++$+++ u3724 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ WEAVER +++$+++ Time to cut a rug, Z!
L45715 +++$+++ u3724 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ WEAVER +++$+++ Poor guy's had one too many scouting missions.
L45714 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Hey, did you hear what he said?!
L45709 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Weaver, I'm an insect, not a liquid.
L45708 +++$+++ u3724 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ WEAVER +++$+++ And all the time I've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves.  Go with the flow.
L45707 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Of course.  You were born two seconds after me.
L45706 +++$+++ u3724 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ WEAVER +++$+++ Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
L45705 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ I can't help it.  I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.  Call me crazy.
L45704 +++$+++ u3724 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ WEAVER +++$+++ Who said there was a girl for you? I was talking about a girl for me.  Don't you want your aphid beer?
L45703 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Weaver, they're career girls. They're obsessed with digging.  No, I'll probably never meet the girl for me.
L45702 +++$+++ u3724 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ WEAVER +++$+++ Yeah, but you get to spend all day with those fabulous worker babes.
L45701 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers.  You soldiers get all the glory.  Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them.
L45700 +++$+++ u3724 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ WEAVER +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about, Z.
L45699 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Did you see that?  How he gave <u>you</u> the beers, not me?  I'm telling you, he's got something against workers.
L45696 +++$+++ u3724 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ WEAVER +++$+++ I'll be back.
L45695 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ We declared war again?  Are you scared?
L46518 +++$+++ u3728 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DOBISCH +++$+++ That's right.  Maria Ouspenskaya. BLONDE  Hiya, Ouspenskaya.
L46517 +++$+++ u3726 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BLONDE +++$+++ So this is your mother's apartment?
L46515 +++$+++ u3726 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BLONDE +++$+++ Under the mat? 
L46514 +++$+++ u3728 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DOBISCH +++$+++ Not there.  Under the mat.
L46512 +++$+++ u3728 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ DOBISCH +++$+++ Don't worry about the old lady. One squawk from her, and she's out of a job.
L46511 +++$+++ u3726 +++$+++ m246 +++$+++ BLONDE +++$+++ I mean - barging in on your mother -- in the middle of the night?
