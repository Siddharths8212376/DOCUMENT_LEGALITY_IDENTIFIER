L274784 +++$+++ u1307 +++$+++ m87 +++$+++ KIRSTY +++$+++ I AM house-trained.
L274783 +++$+++ u1311 +++$+++ m87 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ Need any help?
L274782 +++$+++ u1307 +++$+++ m87 +++$+++ KIRSTY +++$+++ Just upstairs.
L274781 +++$+++ u1311 +++$+++ m87 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ You're not going?
L274752 +++$+++ u1311 +++$+++ m87 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ So lie down.
L274751 +++$+++ u1307 +++$+++ m87 +++$+++ KIRSTY +++$+++ I won't be able to stand.
L274749 +++$+++ u1307 +++$+++ m87 +++$+++ KIRSTY +++$+++ That's right. Cointreau.
L274748 +++$+++ u1311 +++$+++ m87 +++$+++ STEVE +++$+++ We're on the Cointreau.
L279684 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Technically, I'm number one.  I went out with her a week before Kevin did.  Her first boyfriend.  Me.
L279683 +++$+++ u1312 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ALISON'S MOM +++$+++ I beg your pardon?
L279682 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Really?  Married Kevin?  Her junior high sweetheart... What chance would I have had against that?  None, no chance.  That's just fate.
L279681 +++$+++ u1312 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ALISON'S MOM +++$+++ That's right.  Kevin.  She's Mrs. Kevin Bannister.  She lives in Australia.
L279680 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ You gotta be kidding me.
L279679 +++$+++ u1312 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ALISON'S MOM +++$+++ I hate to quibble with you Rob, but she married her first boyfriend. Kevin Bannister.
L279678 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Rob.  Rob Gordon.  Circa junior high...
L279677 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Long time ago.  I was just thinking about her.  I was her first boyfriend.
L279676 +++$+++ u1312 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ALISON'S MOM +++$+++ Really.
L279675 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Alison's.
L279673 +++$+++ u1312 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ALISON'S MOM +++$+++ I don't know.
L279672 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Do I know you?
L280038 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ That's what we want.  Reaction.  And if Laura's bourgeois lawyer friends can't take it, then fuck 'em.  Let 'em riot, we can handle it.  We'll be ready.
L280037 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night.
L280036 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ I owe it to myself to go right to the edge, Rob, and this group does exactly that.  Over the edge, in fact.
L280035 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Barry, you're over thirty years old. You owe it to yourself and your friends and to your parents not to sing in a group called Sonic Death Monkey.
L280034 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ What do you think?  Dick likes it.
L280033 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Sonic Death Monkey.
L280032 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by.  They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown thing.  We're called SDM.  Sonic Death Monkey.
L280031 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ You couldn't be.  Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums.  How are you going to cope with them?
L280030 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ We're not as bad as you think, Rob.
L280029 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ 110%.  That's my final offer.  I'm not kidding.  That's how much it means to me not to hear you play.
L280028 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ No.  We need the gig.
L280027 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ What is she doing?  Okay, 20%.
L280026 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ We're getting that anyway.
L280025 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I'll give you 10% of the door if you don't play.
L280024 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Laura said we could.  If we helped out with the posters and stuff.  And we did.  And we are.
L280023 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Like fuck you are.
L279983 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ HELLO.  DO YOU SEE ANYONE ELSE around here with a band, Mr. Branson?  Mr. Phil Spector?
L279982 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ So?  You even said they're good.
L279981 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ I heard you, man.  Don't give me that "what" shit.  You just told them that you're gonna put out a record with them.
L279980 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ What?
L279979 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ What the fuck is that?
L279964 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Yes way.  It's really...
L279963 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ No way.
L279962 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ The little skate-fuckers.
L279835 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Not really.
L279834 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Oh.  Right.  But I'd forgotten about that.  I wasn't biting the idea.
L279833 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Liar.  We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat.
L279832 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Haven't seen it.
L279831 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Because it's in The Big Chill.
L279830 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness. And "You Can't Always Get What You Want."
L279829 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Fuck off, Barry.
L279828 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Whatever.  Okay. "Tell Laura I Love Her." That'd bring the house down. Laura's mom could sing it.
L279827 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ It was Jan, and it was a long time after--
L279820 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Ooh.  Drag.
L279819 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Laura.  Her dad died.
L279818 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ What's up?
L279768 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Bitter?  Because I'm not in Barrytown? You should be shot like a lame horse, you jerk.  Just keep that out of my window.
L279767 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ So much for friends, then.  You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?
L279766 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Of course I'm not coming.  Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave?  Where is it?  The fucking Bucktown Pub?  Ha!
L279765 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ You're not even coming?
L279764 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ None.  Christ!
L279763 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ How many tickets can I put you down for?
L279762 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Great!  That's fucking great!  They only asked you to sing because of your name!  You can stick it above the browser racks over there.
L279761 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes. But --
L279760 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Isn't it?
L279759 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ That's why you got the gig, isn't it?
L279758 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ They were fucking called that before I was in it, okay?  It wasn't my idea.
L279757 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ You can't be called Barry and sing in a group called Barrytown.
L279756 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ I didn't make up the name.  It's the Steely Dan song.  And it was in The Commitments.
L279755 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Barrytown.  Barrytown?  Is there no end to your arrogance?
L279754 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Thanks for your support, Rob.  Really appreciate it.
L279753 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ You are not in a band, Barry.  You are not a musician.  And no posters.
L279752 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ The band that found me and asked me to join.
L279751 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ What band?
L279750 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ My band.
L279749 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ What the fuck is that?
L279748 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Hey.
L279617 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Terrific.
L279616 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Suck my ass.
L279615 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Don't be sad, Barry.  You'll find true love someday.
L279614 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you?  You two have to stick together now.  Boners United.  United in getting some.
L279613 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Shut the fuck up, Barry.
L279608 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Oh come on, Rob.  What am I, an idiot? I'm more bothered by Dick's thing. How did this happen, Dick?  What rational explanation can there possibly be?  What's her name?
L279607 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ How do you know about that?
L279606 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Un-fucking-believable.  Dick's out on a hot date, Rob's boning Marie LaSalle, and the best-looking and most intelligent of all of us isn't getting anything at all.
L279600 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Ha.
L279599 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Fine by me.  I still want pay to 7 o'clock.
L279598 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a customer in four hours.
L279597 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now?
L279596 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Because it's a brilliant film.  It's funny, violent, and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass.
L279595 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Why would they care?
L279594 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ How the fuck am I supposed to know that?  You might get sick of people telling you you've really gotta go see the movie.
L279593 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
L279592 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ ...But the word "yet..." Yeah, you know what, I'd get the impression that you wanted to see it.  Otherwise you'd say you didn't really want to.
L279591 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Well... you couldn't have been desperate to see it, otherwise you'd have already gone...
L279590 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
L279589 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ "-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
L279588 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Just listen to me.  If I said to you --
L279587 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ I'm sorry, Rob, but I'm struggling here.  I don't understand any part of this conversation.  You're asking me what I would think if you told me that you hadn't seen a film that you've seen.  What am I supposed to say?
L279586 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ No, but would you think, from that one sentence.  That I was going to see it?
L279585 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ I'd think you were a cinematic idiot. And I'd feel sorry for you.
L279584 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Yeah, yeah, I know.  But say I hadn't seen it and I said to you, "I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," what would you think?
L279583 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ To me, it would mean that you're a liar.  You saw it twice.  Once with Laura -- oops -- once with me and Dick.  We had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off-screen in the Fourteenth Century.
L279582 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Just... come on, what would it mean to you?  That sentence? "I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet?"
L279581 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ -- Barry, if I were to say to you I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet, what would that mean?
L279580 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ -- You're like a little squirrel of music, storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music, musical lint, old shit, shit, shit --
L279579 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ There's something different about the sound of her voice... And what did she mean last night, she hasn't slept with him yet.  Yet.  What does "yet" mean, anyway?  "I haven't seen... Evil Dead II yet." What does that mean?  It means you're going to go, doesn't it?
L279569 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Ooh!  A kind of recent record!  Rob's sly declaration of new classic-status slipped into a list of old classics! Nice! "Let's Get It On?" Couldn't you make it more obvious than that?
L279568 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Shut up. "Let's Get It On," Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On. "Airbag," Radiohead, from OK Computer.
L279567 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all.  Dick, did you hear that?
L279566 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ "Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind.
L279565 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Ehh.
L279564 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Okay.  Top five side one track ones. Number one... "Janie Jones," the Clash, from The Clash.
L279420 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ What am I missing?  What do you have to be happy about?
L279419 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I'm not snickering.  I'm smiling. Because I'm happy.
L279418 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ What are you snickering about?
L279417 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ What do you mean, "what?"
L279416 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ What?
L279317 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ It's not my car, now is it?  It's Laura's car, and thus Laura has it. So it's an ass-bumping double- transferring bus ride through bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab. Wow.  Fucking great.
L279316 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ We can take your car.
L279315 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ That's fucking great, Barry.  We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each.  Fantastic, Barry!
L279314 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ We're only on the fucking list for Marie's gig at the Pulaski Pub, that's all!  All three of us.
L279293 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ I didn't know it was classified information.  I mean, I know we don't have any customers, but I thought that was a bad thing, not, like, a business strategy.
L279292 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ What did you tell her about the shop for?
L279270 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ ...Maybe a picture of me in the liner notes...
L279269 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I wanna live with a musician.  She'd write songs at home, ask me what she thought of them, maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes.
L279268 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ I wanna date a musician...
L279261 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ But now I kind of like it.
L279260 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Yeah.
L279194 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Oh, now you're defending that motherfucker?  You're going soft in your old age, Rob.  There was a time when you would have chased him out of the store and up the street.  Now all of a sudden I'm offending your golf buddy.  You're right, Rob.  I am so sorry. How are we ever going to make enough money to get you and Laura into the country club?
L279193 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's.
L279192 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ He offended me with his terrible taste.
L279191 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ What did he ever do to you?
L279190 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Bullshit.  The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway.  Why not have a little fun?  Big fucking deal.
L279189 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Barry, I'm fucking broke!  I know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop.
L279188 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ "Our customers?" You think that Mr. L.L. Bean out there is going to be a regular?
L279187 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I don't want you talking to our customers like that again.
L279186 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Oh, so what's the point then?
L279185 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Not the point.
L279184 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ We didn't even really have it.  I happen to know for a fact that the only Stevie Wonder single we have is "Don't Drive Drunk." I was just goofing on the straight, and it never cost you a penny.
L279183 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ You just drove a fucking customer away, Barry.
L279182 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Rob.  Top five musical crimes perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the '80's and '90's.  Subquestion -- is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter- day sins?  "Is it better to burn out than to fade away?"
L279181 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Nice, Barry.
L279160 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Well what's the point in that?
L279159 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ We'll do it next Monday.
L279158 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Great.  That's the fun of working in a record store.  Playing crappy pap you don't want to listen to.  I thought this tape was going to be, you know, a conversation stimulator. I was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a Monday morning and all that, and you just had to ruin it.
L279157 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Since you brought that bullshit tape in.
L279156 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?
L279155 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ How can it be bullshit to state a preference?
L279146 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ "Little Latin Lupe Lu."
L279145 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Say it.
L279144 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Play it.
L279143 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ What's next?
L279142 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Don't you want to hear what's next?
L279141 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Yeah, well it's fucking Monday afternoon.  You should get out of bed earlier.
L279140 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ But it's my new tape.  My Monday morning tape.  I made it last night just for today.
L279139 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I don't want old sad bastard music either.  I just want something I can ignore.
L279138 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Public Enemy!  All I'm trying to do is cheer us up.  Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if I care.
L279137 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.
L279136 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ What are you doing?
L279135 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER.
L279134 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ TURN IT OFF, BARRY.
L279388 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ NO--!
L279387 +++$+++ u1316 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ CUSTOMER +++$+++ I have a television.
L279386 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ That is perverse.  Do not tell anyone you don't own fucking Blonde on Blonde.  What about Television?

L279377 +++$+++ u1316 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ CUSTOMER +++$+++ Well what about the new Echo --
L279376 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ They always seemed what?  They always seemed really great, is what they always seemed.  They picked up where your precious Echo left off, and you're sitting here complaining about no more Echo albums.  I can't believe that you don't own that record. That's insane.
L279375 +++$+++ u1316 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ CUSTOMER +++$+++ They always seemed...
L279374 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Oh really.  Well what about the first Jesus and Mary Chain?

L279372 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ It's almost impossible to find, especially on CD.  Yet another cruel trick on all of the dumbasses who got rid of their turntables.  But every other Echo and the Bunnymen album --

L279175 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Because it's sentimental tacky crap, that's why not.  Do we look like the kind of store that sells "I Just Called To Say I Loved You?" Go to the mall and stop wasting our time.
L279174 +++$+++ u1316 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ CUSTOMER +++$+++ Why not?
L279173 +++$+++ u1313 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ No, you can't.
