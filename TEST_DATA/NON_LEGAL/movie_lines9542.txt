L42471 +++$+++ u3691 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ MAN IN LINE +++$+++ It's like Samuel Beckett, you know- I admire the technique but he doesn't... he doesn't hit me on a gut level.
L42464 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ What are you depressed about?
L42463 +++$+++ u3691 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ MAN IN LINE +++$+++ without getting... well, let's put it this way...
L42462 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Key word here is "indulgent."
L42461 +++$+++ u3691 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ MAN IN LINE +++$+++ Like all that Juliet of the Spirits or Satyricon, I found it incredibly... indulgent. You know, he really is. He's one of the most indulgent film makers. He really is-
L42460 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ He's screaming his opinions in my ear.
L42459 +++$+++ u3691 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ MAN IN LINE +++$+++ You know, it must need to have had its leading from one thought to another. You know what I'm talking about?
L43535 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, I love it there.
L43534 +++$+++ u3699 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Uh, you guys are still-uh, you're still New Yorkers.
L43531 +++$+++ u3699 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Right before his un-American thing.

L43527 +++$+++ u3699 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ This is a great house, really. Everything. Saunas, Jacuzzis, three tennis courts. You know who the original owners were? Nelson Eddy, then Legs Diamond. Then you know who lived here?
L43345 +++$+++ u3699 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ This is, uh, Shawn, and, uh... Bob and Petronia.

L43606 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Mean?

L43601 +++$+++ u3690 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ GIRL DATE +++$+++ What are you making such a big deal about?  They're only lobsters. Look, you're a grown man, you know how to pick up a lobster.

L43658 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Max, are we driving through plutonium?
L43657 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Oh, I did Shakespeare in the Park, Max. I got mugged. I was playing Richard the Second and two guys with leather jackets stole my leotard.
L43656 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ You're an actor, Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park.
L43655 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Twins, Max. Sixteen-year-olds. Can you imagine the mathematical possibilities?
L43654 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah. I had the feeling that I got you at a bad moment. You know, I heard high-pitched squealing.
L43653 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Imagine my surprise when I got your call, Max.
L43516 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ We're gonna operate together.
L43515 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Uri Geller must be on the premises someplace.
L43514 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Yeah. Right.
L43513 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Hey, you guys are wearin' white. It must be in the stars.
L43510 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Hi. How do you do.
L43509 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ No, no, I came out here to get some shock therapy, but there was an energy crisis, so I... He's my-my food taster. Have you two met?
L43508 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Oh, he-he didn't say anything.
L43503 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I'll handle it. I'll handle it. Hi.
L43502 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ If she comes over here, Max, my brain is going to turn into guacamole.
L43501 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, intensive care ward.  My God-hey, Max, I think she's... I think she's giving me the eye.
L43500 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ And I think they just came back from Masters and Johnson.
L43499 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ How do you like this couple, Max?
L43498 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ And... uh-
L43497 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ M'hm.
L43496 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, you're used to the kind with the- with the shopping bags walking through Central Park with the surgical masks on muttering.
L43495 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ There are no twos, Max.
L43494 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, she's a ten, Max, and that's great for you because you're-you're used to twos, aren't you?
L43493 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Visible panty line. Max, she is gorgeous.
L43492 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ V.P.L.?
L43491 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ The one with the V.P.L.
L43490 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Where?
L43489 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max. He goes with that girl over there.
L43488 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I think he has a little thing for Annie.
L43487 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ What difference does that make?
L43486 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party.
L43485 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I even brought a road map to get us to the bathroom.
L43484 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ M'hm.
L43483 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ You like this house, Max?
L43459 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Oh, Max... no, I maybe I better lie down.
L43458 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ How about a ginger ale?
L43457 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ No, no-my, you know, my stomach felt queasy all morning. I just started getting...
L43456 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ You wanna lie down?
L43455 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I don't know, I mean, I-
L43454 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ You all right?
L43453 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Oh, Jesus.
L43452 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Well, sit down.
L43451 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I don't know, I just got-I got very dizzy...  I feel dizzy, Max.
L43450 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ What's the matter?
L43444 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Yeah, well, that's why this machine is dynamite.
L43443 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny.
L43442 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ We do the show live in front of an audience.
L43441 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Look, uh...
L43440 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Give me a tremendous laugh here, Charlie.
L43436 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, I know; but you're adding fake laughs.
L43435 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Max, I've got a hit series.
L43434 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Do you realize how immoral this all is?
L43431 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Look, now, Charlie, give me a big laugh here.
L43430 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Oh.
L43428 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ While you're out here, Max, I want you to see some of my TV show. And we're invited to a big Christmas party.
L43427 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ There's no economic crime, you know, but there's-there's ritual, religious- cult murders, you know, there's wheat- germ killers out here.
L43426 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging.
L43425 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Right-well, Santa Claus will have sunstroke.
L43278 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, and always over the most ridiculous things.
L43277 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ What kind of good memories, Max? Your mother and father fighting all the time.
L43276 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I have some very good memories there.
L43272 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, well, I used to lose my glasses a lot.
L43271 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Yes, I remember.  He was all schoolyard. They threw him a football once, he tried to dribble it.
L43270 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Right. I was a great athlete. Tell her, Max, I was the best, I was all schoolyard.
L43269 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ We can show her the schoolyard.
L43268 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, the neighborhood's gonna be great.
L43265 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ You'll total the whole car.
L43264 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Yeah, watch the road!
L42665 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Sun is bad for yuh. Everything our parents said was good is bad. Sun, milk, red meat, college...
L42664 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Max, if we lived in California, we could play outdoors every day, in the sun.
L42663 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Don't you see? The rest of the country looks upon New York like we're-we're left-wing Communist, Jewish, homosexual, pornographers. I think of us that way, sometimes, and I-I live here.
L42662 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ No, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient out. Every time some group disagrees with you it's because of anti-Semitism.
L42661 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ But the- I'm not discussing politics or economics. This is foreskin.
L42660 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Max, the city is terribly worried.
L42659 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Right, right, so g-get back to what we were discussing, the failure of the country to get behind New York City is-is anti-Semitism.
L42658 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Max, my serve is gonna send yuh to the showers-
L42401 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I'm gonna meet her in front of the Beekman. I think I have a few minutes left. Right?
L42400 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Right, Max, forget it. Aren't you gonna be late for meeting Annie?
L42399 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ No, I cannot. You keep bringing it up, but I don't wanna live in a city where the only cultural advantage is that you can make a right turn on a red light.
L42398 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ We move to sunny L.A. All of show business is out there, Max.
L42397 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Forget it, Max.
L42396 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.
L42395 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Ah.
L42394 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Right, Max. California, Max.
L42393 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ No, I don't! You know, I was in a record store. Listen to this- so I know there's this big tall blond crew-cutted guy and he's lookin' at me in a funny way and smiling and he's saying, "Yes, we have a sale this week on Wagner." Wagner, Max, Wagner- so I know what he's really tryin' to tell me very significantly Wagner.
L42392 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Why, Max? It's a good name for you. Max, you see conspiracies in everything.
L42391 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Stop calling me Max.
L42390 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Ah, Max, you, uh...
L42389 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Wh- How am I a paran-? Well, I pick up on those kind o' things. You know, I was having lunch with some guys from NBC, so I said... uh, "Did you eat yet or what?" and Tom Christie said, "No, didchoo?" Not, did you, didchoo eat? Jew? No, not did you eat, but Jew eat? Jew. You get it? Jew eat?
L42388 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Alvy, you're a total paranoid.
L42387 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ No, I'm not. We were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, "Jew."
L42386 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ You're crazy!
L42385 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I distinctly heard it. He muttered under his breath, "Jew."
L43289 +++$+++ u3682 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY'S FATHER +++$+++ She's a colored woman, from Harlem!
L43288 +++$+++ u3683 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY'S MOTHER +++$+++ How can we afford it? On your pay? What if she steals more?
L43287 +++$+++ u3682 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY'S FATHER +++$+++ All right-so we can afford it.
L43286 +++$+++ u3683 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY'S MOTHER +++$+++ Who's persecuting? She stole!
L43285 +++$+++ u3682 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY'S FATHER +++$+++ They're persecuted enough!
L43284 +++$+++ u3683 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY'S MOTHER +++$+++ She was going through my pocketbook!
L43283 +++$+++ u3682 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY'S FATHER +++$+++ So the colored have enough trouble.
L43282 +++$+++ u3683 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY'S MOTHER +++$+++ SO?
L43281 +++$+++ u3682 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY'S FATHER +++$+++ But she's colored.
L43280 +++$+++ u3683 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY'S MOTHER +++$+++ She was stealing.
L43279 +++$+++ u3682 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY'S FATHER +++$+++ You fired the cleaning woman?
L43031 +++$+++ u3682 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY'S FATHER +++$+++ Di-diabetes? Is that any excuse? Diabetes?
L43030 +++$+++ u3683 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY'S MOTHER +++$+++ His wife has diabetes!
L43029 +++$+++ u3682 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY'S FATHER +++$+++ Let 'im drop dead! Who needs his business?!
L42610 +++$+++ u3687 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE'S VOICE +++$+++ Hey, listen-I mean, he was a terrific actor, and look at him, he's neat- looking and he was emotional... Y- hey, I don't think you like emotion too much.
L42609 +++$+++ u3684 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY'S VOICE +++$+++ Heavy! Eaten by some squirrels.
L42599 +++$+++ u3684 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY'S VOICE +++$+++ Well, yeah, you always look pretty, but that guy with you...
L42598 +++$+++ u3687 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE'S VOICE +++$+++ I look pretty.
L42597 +++$+++ u3684 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY'S VOICE +++$+++ Look at you, you-you're such a clown.
L42596 +++$+++ u3687 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE'S VOICE +++$+++ Then there was Jerry, the actor.
L42595 +++$+++ u3684 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY'S VOICE +++$+++ Oh, I can imagine. P-p-probably the wife of an astronaut.
L42594 +++$+++ u3687 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE'S VOICE +++$+++ Oh, God, you should've seen what I looked like then.
L42593 +++$+++ u3684 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY'S VOICE +++$+++ Dennis-right, uh, uh... local kid probably, would meetcha in front of the movie house on Saturday night.
L43562 +++$+++ u3685 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY'S VOICE-OVER +++$+++ If only I didn't feel guilty asking Annie to move out. It'd probably wreck her. But I should be honest.
L43561 +++$+++ u3688 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE'S VOICE-OVER +++$+++ If only I had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him.
L43560 +++$+++ u3685 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY'S VOICE-OVER +++$+++ I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight. Whatta I need this?
L43559 +++$+++ u3688 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE'S VOICE-OVER +++$+++ I have to face facts. I-I adore Alvy, but our relationship doesn't seem to work anymore.
L43558 +++$+++ u3685 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY'S VOICE-OVER +++$+++ Lotta beautiful women. It was fun to flirt.
L43557 +++$+++ u3688 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE'S VOICE-OVER +++$+++ That was fun. I don't think California is bad at all. It's a drag coming home.
L43068 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I just have time to get the, uh-
L43067 +++$+++ u3692 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ MOM HALL +++$+++ M'mmm.
L43064 +++$+++ u3692 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ MOM HALL +++$+++ We're going to take them to the airport.
L43063 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You think so? Do you really?
L43062 +++$+++ u3692 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ MOM HALL +++$+++ Oh, he's adorable, Annie.
L43059 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ No.
L43058 +++$+++ u3692 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ MOM HALL +++$+++ Now, don't let it be so long, now.
L43045 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yes, I do.
L43044 +++$+++ u3692 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ MOM HALL +++$+++ Oh, you remember her, Annie.
L43043 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, yes, that's right. Did you see the new play?
L43027 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, yes, yes.
L43026 +++$+++ u3692 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ MOM HALL +++$+++ Oh, that Randolph Hunt. You remember Randy Hunt, Annie. He was in the choir with you.
L43020 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ We really had a good time.
L43019 +++$+++ u3692 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ MOM HALL +++$+++ We went over to the swap meet. Annie, Gram and I. Got some nice picture frames.
L43545 +++$+++ u3699 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ And here, you just-
L43544 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L43543 +++$+++ u3699 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ It could be freezing, it could be raining.
L43542 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L43541 +++$+++ u3699 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Oh, and there's another thing about New York. See... you-you wanna see a movie, you have to stand in a long line.
L43538 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah.
