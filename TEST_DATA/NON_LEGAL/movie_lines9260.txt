L378826 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ If you want to be a successful negotiator, you've got to learn to lie.
L378825 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off?
L378824 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You could say something like,  "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."
L378823 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ So what do I say to this guy?
L378822 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it.
L378820 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Then get out of my face you worthless piece of frogshit.
L378819 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ I can't do that.
L378818 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I need you to bring me the scumbag who ran off with my wife so I can cut off his nuts.
L378817 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Tell me what you need.
L378814 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ It'll come. Try again.
L378813 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ No.
L378812 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ First things is, don't say, "What's going on?" Everybody knows what's going on. I come into this situation, I say,  "I'm glad to see nobody's hurt. That's good. I'm here to help you."  Second: You hesitated. Don't hesitate. If you're thinking, talk while you're thinking, or else he's going to think you're plotting. Which you are. If he thinks you're plotting, you're going to make him nervous. You don't want him nervous. Got that?
L378807 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ I think so.
L378806 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You think you can learn, McCall?
L378803 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Yeah, you think so, but it comes up.
L378802 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ I think I can handle that one.
L378801 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Lesson two, "Dead Eye"... should have been lesson one. Never exchange yourself for a hostage.
L378800 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Yeah, well that's a sore subject, and therefore out of bounds to a young sprout of a hostage negotiator under my tutelage.
L378799 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Around. Barnett's tough competition.
L378798 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Where did you hear that?
L378797 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Thanks for clearing that up.  I hear your former girlfriend is going out with Greg Barnett.
L378796 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ No. Actually I think it's fucking crazy, I don't know if I could do it.
L378795 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Do you really?
L378794 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ That's a lot of commitment. I admire that.
L378793 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Every couple of months, huh?
L378792 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ We see each other every couple of months.
L378791 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Oh, "city girl". Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey?
L378790 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ No, no, no...  She's from Hoboken.
L378789 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ She grow up in Livingtston, too?
L378788 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ She's going to come here when she graduates and then we're gonna get married.
L378787 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Explain how that works.
L378786 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school.
L378785 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You living together?
L378784 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Yeah, I've got a girlfriend.
L378783 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ I don't gamble.
L378782 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You wouldn't want to put a small wager on this, would you?
L378780 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Why? You like my ass?
L378779 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You got a girlfriend?
L378778 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Well, if I have to, I have to.
L378777 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You have to. It's a tradition.
L378776 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ I don't really like to drink.
L378775 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Come on. Let's go for a drink.
L378772 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Not the ones I'm at.
L378771 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Eighty-five percent of domestic disturbances of this nature end in murder/suicide.
L378734 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ We could fill it with water.
L378733 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ How are we gonna get him out of there?
L378728 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I'm not sure.
L378727 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Is there something wrong with that?
L378726 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was.  So you're looking for "fast advancement".
L378725 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ You caught me on an "up" day.  How about you? How did you end up in San Francisco?
L378724 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You're a real excitable sort, aren't you?
L378723 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ It was okay.
L378722 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ How did you like Toronto?
L378721 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Been to Toronto. My mother was born there.
L378720 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You'd never been out of New York?
L378719 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Spent my whole life there. I just wanted to get out for a while.
L378718 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You don't like New York?
L378717 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Furthest point I could find from New York.
L378716 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here?
L378715 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ National Marksman Competition.
L378714 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Recruited you from where?
L378713 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement.
L378712 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ So, McCall, how come you ended up in San Francisco?
L378708 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I appreciate your concern. Let's leave it at that.
L378707 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ I'm sorry about your friend. I had a friend in SWAT killed. I know how it can be.
L378578 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow.
L378577 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ What's the point of this?
L378574 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Try to remember that.
L378573 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ I know.
L378572 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.
L378571 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ I've rarely shot anyone.
L378570 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ It rarely has to be done.
L378569 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Like it had to be done.
L378568 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ How do you feel after a shooting.
L378567 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Only at the very end.
L378566 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You ever been in a hostage situation?
L378562 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ If you say so.
L378561 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ We're already past it, aren't we, Kevin?
L378559 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Sorry... Habit.
L378558 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Don't go reading my lips, man. That's an intrusion. Save that shit for the sniper school. Comprende?
L378557 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ I'm ready to do it.  And I'm going to be here more than two weeks.
L378556 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator.
L378555 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Same here. I've watched you in action. Very impressive.
L378739 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Well, there's a good amount of agreement on that.
L378738 +++$+++ u2062 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ OFFICER #1 +++$+++ Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
L378737 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Is the hostage injured?
L378736 +++$+++ u2062 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ OFFICER #1 +++$+++ Only that floor.
L378735 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Have you evacuated anyone?
L378731 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Which apartment?
L378730 +++$+++ u2062 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ OFFICER #1 +++$+++ Husband came home. Found that guy and his wife "in flagrante". Now he's holding her at knife point.
L378729 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Roper. Metro Division. Hostage Negotiator. Give me the short version.
L378764 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ My name's Scott Roper.
L378763 +++$+++ u2063 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa?
L378762 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Not for you, Ray. For me. A close friend of mine was killed this week. The way I figure it, I stop you from doin' what you said, I'm one up on body count.
L378761 +++$+++ u2063 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ And why the fuck would you do that for me?
L378760 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work.
L378759 +++$+++ u2063 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Doing what? Cleaning toilets?
L378758 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Ray, if you walk out of here with me, I'll get you a job.
L378756 +++$+++ u2063 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ What am I giving up? I'm laid off last year. I'm down to my last unemployment check. I'm out on the streets looking for work and this bitch is banging some asshole in my bed.
L378755 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Ray, think about how she looked when you married her. Think about how happy you were. Don't lose that, man. Don't give up everything.
L378754 +++$+++ u2063 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ She's the one to blame. Not me.
L378753 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her.
L378752 +++$+++ u2063 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ I ain't interested in your life story.
L378751 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Same thing happened to me, man. She cheated on me, but I forgave her. You know why?
L378750 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Let me show you something, Ray.
L378749 +++$+++ u2063 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.
L378748 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the room with the hostage, I have to stay.
L378747 +++$+++ u2063 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ You don't know shit, and I suggest you leave.
L378746 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I know how you feel, Ray.
L379315 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ First you want me to put on one of those skinny ass bathing suits -- tongs or thongs or whatever you call them -- with my butt cheeks wrapped around a piece of dental floss... No way.
L379314 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Prude.
L379313 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ The hell I am!
L379312 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper.
L379311 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You crazy? With all those people around?
L379309 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ You thought I was talking about getting married?!
L379308 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You talkin' about gettin' 'nekked?'  Shit, I thought you were talkin' bout, you know... the "M" word.
L379307 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ I'm talking about me 'n' you stripping down on this beach and gettin' you know... 'naked in Tahiti'.
L379306 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I'm talking about... What are you talking about?
L379305 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ ...the hell are you talking about?
L379304 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I mean I said this trip should be a 'roadtest'.
L379303 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Scott...
L379302 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Whoa! Wait a minute, Ronnie. Hold on. I know it's beautiful here. The sun, the sand, the sea and all that nature shit can really get to you. But we've got to keep our perspective here. This place isn't real. This isn't reality.
L379301 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ That's right. We've got to bare it all. Here and now. 'Cause I think I'm finally ready to go for it...
L379300 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ A deeper level?
L379299 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ I was just thinking...  There's something special I want to talk to you about.  I think it's time we went to a whole other phase in our relationship.  A deeper level.
L379298 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ You've changed you know. I don't think there's anything you can't do once you put your mind to it.
L379297 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Yeah.
L379296 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Things have been going pretty well between us, haven't they?
L379295 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Hmm?
L379294 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ I've been thinking.
L379293 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Hmm?
L379292 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Scottie?
L379289 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Yeah, I could get used to this Paradise shit.
L379288 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti is magnificent, Scottie.
L379281 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Do it!
L379280 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Scottie...
L379279 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Stay here, don't move.
L379278 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ It's all over, babe, it's all over.
L379277 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Scottie, Scottie...
L379189 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ I think I'll stand out here in the sun.
L379188 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Why don't you come back up with me, Ronnie.
L379185 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Use your imagination.
L379184 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ I don't think you're old and fat enough for me.
L379181 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ And you think he'll...
L379180 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Korda escaped.
L379171 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ In Europe women find older men very sexy.
L379170 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ How come in those foreign movies the young girl is always with some fat, old guy.
L379135 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ ...Let me just show you.
L379134 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Yeah?
L379133 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ For the last week things have been going pretty well between us. I think we've been doing a good job getting intimate and all that stuff...
L379132 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ There is?
L379131 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I guess you realize that there's something special that I want to talk to you about.
L379130 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ It's very nice.
L379129 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You like this place?
L379027 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ He was going nuts at the park. He met this very attractive poodle. They made plans to meet again next weekend.
L379026 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ How's Paco doing?
L379012 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Just now.
L379011 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ When?
L379010 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ It's okay. We broke up.
L379009 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ What about Greg? What are you gonna tell him?
L379008 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Veronica, it's not easy for me... I don't know if I can change overnight. But what I'm telling you is that I want to share everything with you, because I don't ever want to be without you again.
L379007 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are.
L379006 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.
L379005 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Scottie, remember the day you lost that hostage in union square. You came over that night and we made mad, crazy love. But I didn't even know what happened... 'til I heard it on the news the next morning.
L379002 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Scottie...
L379001 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up.
L379000 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Yeah that's it.
L378999 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ What are you talking about? This is it. This is the stuff right here.  Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.
L378998 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Mmm, needs a little something.
L378997 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ What do you think?
L378995 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ And it's hard to get.
L378994 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I've been craving that stuff all week.
L378993 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ No. The kind from Kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese.
L378992 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ That kind with the garlic and the oil that I like so much?
L378988 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I was going to catch the last half on TV.
L378987 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ It's already started.
L378986 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ As a matter of fact, I do.
L378985 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ You got a bet on the game tonight?
L378984 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I wanted to get this out of the way.
L378674 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Ronnie...
L378673 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ If you did, you never showed it.
L378672 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You think I didn't need you?
L378671 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again.
L378670 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Something I guess I can't have anymore.
L378669 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ What do you want from me?
L378668 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.
L378667 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I've proved that, didn't I?
L378666 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Scott, You can't save everyone.
L378665 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ It was my fault. I was right downstairs. I should have gone up with him.
L378664 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.
L378663 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I won't stay long. I had to talk to someone.
L378659 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ About 4 months old. I'm working in a new style.
L378658 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ That a new picture?
L378657 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Can I come in?
L378656 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Yeah. I'm sorry.
L378655 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You heard.
L378654 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Maybe you should be.
L378653 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I'm not drunk. Yet.
L378652 +++$+++ u2064 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep.  Jack Daniels?
L378651 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.
