L479639 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Yes.  Conviction.  Conviction that I'm onto the truth.  You're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three.  You're going to run again.  And I'm not leaving until you do.
L479638 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Did something happen to make you care about reality?
L479636 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ You have one?
L479635 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ I'm not here to make you feel bad.  I'm here for vindication.  In my heart...
L479620 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Yes.
L479619 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Weird dreams?  You're going to tell me about them?
L479618 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Nervous?  Not at all!  No.  I've never been more certain in my life.  Except -- I am having all kinds of weird dreams.
L479617 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Getting nervous?
L479614 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ You'll answer my questions?
L479613 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash?  You know, get all that city grit out of it.
L479601 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Excellent.
L479600 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Originality is my speciality.
L479599 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I hope you have a different angle. It's pretty much all been covered.
L480238 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Quick.  Very quick.
L480237 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Thank you.  You still think that he was....
L480236 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Wedding.  Wedding.  You just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row.
L480235 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L480234 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Okay.
L480233 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ No, I'm just going to head home.
L480232 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?
L480231 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I'm just finishing up, too.
L480230 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ You okay?  I'm closing.
L480210 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ No sauntering down the aisle.  Just make time.  Let's just get there.
L480209 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Let's go.
L480161 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Not eight...
L480160 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ You and your lucky geese.  You always see geese.
L480159 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a "V".
L480158 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ He's not coming.  Watch.  He's not coming.
L480153 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ See, this is a mature relationship. She's really found it.
L480152 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Grandma!
L480106 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ It's for the bell.
L480105 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ ... I don't even want to talk about the luau.  What's this?
L480104 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ What happened at the luau?
L480103 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Yep.  I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.
L480102 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ He's going to be the pastor?
L480038 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Would it?
L480037 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours. It just gives me the creeps a little bit. I'd feel better if I knew where he was.
L480036 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ This party is for you and Bob.  Get your mind off the reporter.
L480035 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Lighten up, what?
L480034 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Lighten up, wahine.
L479844 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Thanks.  Will you fix my hair?
L479843 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ You're right.  It's not funny now. Maybe we both grew up.
L479842 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ It's only funny at Camp Birchwood at three in the morning at a tick hunt. It's not anymore.
L479841 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Something that brings warmth to my heart.  Duckbill platypus.
L479840 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I think you're right.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
L479839 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I'm not worried about you and Cory or Cory and me or even that you're irreversibly screwed up.  But, Maggie, you've been like this since we were kids.  And I think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people's feelings, maybe it's time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own, like Bob, if he's the one.
L479838 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Peggy, there's distinct possibility that I might be profoundly and irreversibly screwed up.  Despite that, I love you and I can promise that I will no longer flirt with Cory, and I beg your forgiveness.
L479837 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ No.  You're quirky.  Quirky and weird are two different things.
L479836 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ But I'm weird.
L479835 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.
L479834 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!
L479833 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ No, I don't think you're like, "I'm charming and mysterious in a way that even I don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you".  Very hard to compete with.  Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery.
L479832 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Because you think I'm all like... "Hey man, check me out".
L479831 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Why?
L479830 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I'm going to kill myself.
L479828 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ On anything male that moves?  As opposed to anything male that doesn't move?
L479827 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I know.  I think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves.
L479825 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Yes.
L479824 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
L479823 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Good morning to you, too.  You look good.
L479795 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ He looks better with that stuff out of his hair.  He's an attractive man.
L479794 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Over there.  Ten o'clock.  He's talking to our little Dennis.  Dennis will turn into one of those "sources say" things.
L479793 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Where?
L479792 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ There he is.  Snoop Doggy-Dogg.
L479791 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Not that he doesn't deserve to get fired... Look!  Cory's going for second!... Sneaky!
L479790 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Ya think?
L479789 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ It's probably because you got him fired.
L479788 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
L479787 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ For what reason?  Some personal satisfaction?
L479786 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Okay, he's on base.  Can we talk about my life now?  -- Ike's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- that I was never serious about Gill, blah blah.  He's totally out to get me.
L479603 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ She's the boss.
L479602 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Hold on -- Nobody interviews Maggie in here unless they're getting haircut.
L479598 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Yup!
L479597 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Reporter?
L479582 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Stop it.  When you talk like that, I get turned on and it frightens me.
L479581 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid.
L479580 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ You're a goddess!
L479523 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Yes, I've seen it.  And I have to say it's the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me!
L479522 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh?
L480255 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since I was a kid.  I don't like it.  Stop.  You may not like having a daughter with problems.  But guess what?  I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time.  I'll eat in my room.
L480254 +++$+++ u7371 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ A harmless joke.
L480253 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ No.  It's my life.
L480252 +++$+++ u7371 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Maggie, it's just a joke...
L480251 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.
L480250 +++$+++ u7371 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ What?
L480207 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Thank you, Dad.
L480206 +++$+++ u7371 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ I'm really rooting for this one.
L479958 +++$+++ u7371 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ I changed it.  See you later, Mr. Travis.  That guy has a problem... Maggie, you can run everyone's life but your own.
L479957 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.
L479956 +++$+++ u7371 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Good boy, Port Hole.
L479955 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I'm not exactly having fun, either... Steady.
L479670 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Not this one.  This one's on me.
L479669 +++$+++ u7371 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ So I've come to see it as a bonus, really, that we've been able to plan, and pay for, so many weddings.
L479516 +++$+++ u7368 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MRS. PRESSMAN +++$+++ Maybe she hasn't read the paper...
L479515 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Yeah.
L479514 +++$+++ u7368 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MRS. PRESSMAN +++$+++ You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.
L479513 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ No.
L479512 +++$+++ u7368 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MRS. PRESSMAN +++$+++ No, no.  You're her best friend.
L479511 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ No, you tell her.
L479510 +++$+++ u7368 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MRS. PRESSMAN +++$+++ You tell Maggie.
L479509 +++$+++ u7368 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MRS. PRESSMAN +++$+++ "And her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance.  So all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride isn't honeymooning with Las Vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race... before the rice hits the ground"  Holy moly.
L479508 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ "What is unusual about Miss Carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them.  She has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar."... I can't ready anymore.
L480305 +++$+++ u7385 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ So you're angry.  Big deal.
L480304 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You turn it on, you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time.
L480303 +++$+++ u7385 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ What am I going to do with a microwave?
L480302 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You take the microwave?
L480299 +++$+++ u7385 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ That's good.
L480298 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ How about ... you're too narcissistic to commit to another human being in a long- term way.
L480297 +++$+++ u7385 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Nope.
L480296 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You don't love me, is that it?
L480295 +++$+++ u7385 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Nope.
L480294 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Is there somebody else?
L480293 +++$+++ u7385 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ There's no why, Annie.  I'm just not up for it.  I never said I was.
L480853 +++$+++ u7390 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ WHEEDLE +++$+++ No, that's free.  He's an architect.  Used to do big high-profile projects.  He scaled it all back when his wife died.  Now he remodels people's homes.  He works in a small firm, makes a good living.
L480852 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I hope I don't have to pay for that piece of information.
L480851 +++$+++ u7390 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ WHEEDLE +++$+++ It's on the lake right in the middle of Seattle.  It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
L480850 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ But it's on the water.
L480849 +++$+++ u7390 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ WHEEDLE +++$+++ It's not a boat boat.  It's really a house.
L480848 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Boats.  All anyone talks about is the wind.  Is it up, is it down.  I can't live with a man who only talks about the wind.
L480847 +++$+++ u7390 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ WHEEDLE +++$+++ Houseboats don't go anywhere.
L480846 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Boats.  You go out in them. You come back in them.  I hate them.
L480845 +++$+++ u7390 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ WHEEDLE +++$+++ It sounds nice.
L480844 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I hate boats.
L480843 +++$+++ u7390 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ WHEEDLE +++$+++ He's got a houseboat.
L480842 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Tell me he's living in squalor. Tell me everything he has is being repossessed, including his filthy, dented mobile home.
L481180 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Look!
L481179 +++$+++ u7389 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ What?
L481178 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh!
L481177 +++$+++ u7389 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Yes.  Some people will do anything to get out of going to a symphony.
L481176 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You okay?
L481175 +++$+++ u7389 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ I think that's what I'm saying.
L481174 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, Walter.  I don't deserve you.
L481173 +++$+++ u7389 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Not really.  Look, Annie, I love you.  Let's leave that out of it.  I don't want to be someone you're settling for.  I don't want to be someone anyone settles for.  I have a life insurance policy, I'm fully invested in growth stocks, I have a paid subscription to Home Rox Office, I have no sexual diseases, I have been steadily employed in a part of the economy that isn't soft, I have expectation in the way of inherited wealth, I dress nicely, I am a member of the private sector, an independent voter, I don't watch Monday Night Football, the only thing wrong with me is that I am allergic to wheat, strawberries, penicillin, pollen, nuts and wool.  There are plenty of women who see me as the brass ring.  If you don't -- marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it, isn't it?
L481172 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here.
L481171 +++$+++ u7389 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ At the top of the Empire State Building --
L481170 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I told you.  Nothing --
L481169 +++$+++ u7389 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ So what happened?
L481168 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just...
L481167 +++$+++ u7389 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ -- it was a betrayal.
L481166 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I don't know what to say about it, Walter.  It was a form of temporary insanity.  But I had to tell you about it because --
L481148 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Walter, there's something I have to tell you --
L481147 +++$+++ u7389 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Beautiful view, isn't it?
L481088 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It's so beautiful.  It's just what I would have picked out if I'd had every ring in the world to choose from.  You see what I mean.  There are people who would like a relationship to be full of surprises, but I am not one of them.  Surprises are highly overrated.
L481087 +++$+++ u7389 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ It was my mother's.
L481086 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Walter.
L481082 +++$+++ u7389 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ It's just like my grandmother's china.
L481081 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I do.
L481080 +++$+++ u7389 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ You couldn't.
L481079 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Don't hate me but I love this pattern.
L481075 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, I did.  And you know what I think? I think that it was almost... too perfect.
L481074 +++$+++ u7389 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ No.
L481073 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ About forever.
L481072 +++$+++ u7389 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ What?
L481071 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I am.  I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous.  It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know?
L481070 +++$+++ u7389 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Ever since Christmas, you've been different.  Kind of distracted, distant.  But I feel like you're coming back from wherever you were.
L481069 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You go.
L480937 +++$+++ u7389 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Okay, okay.
L480936 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ And then I'll see you in New York --
L480935 +++$+++ u7389 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ When you get back, I'll be gone --
L480934 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.
L480933 +++$+++ u7389 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Couldn't you just do a phone interview?
L480913 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I know.  It makes no sense at all.  Thank God my life is in place.
L480912 +++$+++ u7389 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ That doesn't make any sense.
L480911 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Becky heard this woman on the radio complaining about this guy she was sure was Rick, which meant he was cheating on her.  She was completely hysterical.  Then it turned out the woman lived in Duluth.
L480903 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I gotta go.  I'll see you at work.  Walter, you scared me.  Don't ever do that again.
