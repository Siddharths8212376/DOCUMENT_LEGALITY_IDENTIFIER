L350365 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ You know what's nice about you? You just seem happy being yourself. You don't try to act cool.
L350364 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Wow. Maybe you should make drawstring socks for gals with fat ankles.
L350363 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ Basically, yeah.
L350362 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ So you're saying, make all pants with a drawstring, then heavier set gals don't have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store?
L350343 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Good. I was concerned.
L350342 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ Sometimes, sure.
L350341 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?
L350339 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ My perfume?
L350338 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
L350337 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.
L350336 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ School?
L350335 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ I'd love to have a dog. But I go to school full time. It wouldn't be fair to the dog.
L350332 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I'm not sure. I'd ask him, but he's uptown talking to his contacts.
L350331 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ You have a dog? What kind?
L350330 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.
L350329 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ This town is really going to hell lately.  So what part of the city do you live in?
L350327 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ It's not that cold. Here, let me wrap it.
L350326 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ It's freezing my hands.
L350325 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Uh, it's a deep south expression.
L350324 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ "Octopus people?"
L350323 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
L350322 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ If you want to.
L350321 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
L350320 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
L350319 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Here, have a Popeye's. This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.
L350318 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out.
L350317 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
L350316 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.
L350315 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart.
L350314 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ My dad's an optometrist.
L350313 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
L350312 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ Why are you laughing?
L350311 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yeah. Deep south.  She laughs along with him, not sure why.
L350310 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ Really?
L350309 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ The South.
L350308 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
L350307 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You think I'm a tourist?
L350306 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
L350305 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ That was amazing. Thanks so much. You didn't have to do that.
L350583 +++$+++ u1851 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ I've always wanted to kill someone. Can I do it?
L350582 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ That just hurt a lot.
L350482 +++$+++ u1851 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Why? Did she hurt you? Do you miss her? Need a shoulder to cry on?
L350481 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ A little strange. I can't stop thinking about this girl, Valerie.
L350419 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ If it's Cassius, yes.
L350418 +++$+++ u1851 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ A black guy?
L350417 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ It looks like the work of a brother...
L350231 +++$+++ u1851 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ And sorry, man, but no dogs allowed.
L350230 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I don't know.
L350229 +++$+++ u1851 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Why is that funny?
L350228 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yeah. The deep South.
L350227 +++$+++ u1851 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ It's like eighty degrees in this hallway. You from the South?
L350226 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ No.
L350225 +++$+++ u1851 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
L350224 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Off limits.
L350223 +++$+++ u1851 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.
L350222 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yes. What is rent?
L350221 +++$+++ u1851 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Uh, don't you want to know what the rent is?
L350220 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Hello, friend, my name is Nicky. I understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village Voice. Would it be possible for me to fill the slot?
L350295 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Sir, I would prefer if you didn't raise your voice. It's making my muscles tighten.
L350294 +++$+++ u1849 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ STREET VENDOR +++$+++ Okay, now you gone and done it. You done messed with my business bitch!
L350288 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I don't know?
L350287 +++$+++ u1849 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ STREET VENDOR +++$+++ And if that is your so-called "flask," how would I have it unless I was, in fact, a thief?
L350286 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
L350285 +++$+++ u1849 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ STREET VENDOR +++$+++ You callin' me a thief, my man?
L350284 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yes. I would like my flask back.
L350283 +++$+++ u1849 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ STREET VENDOR +++$+++ See something you like, my man?
L350282 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Hey...
L352677 +++$+++ u1853 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Shut up! Shut up your damn mouth!
L352676 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a cub with a green flower? You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here.  If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart!
L352675 +++$+++ u1853 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Nothing will happen! I make the rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say! Always have! Always will! I got Cathedral and I'll never let go!
L352674 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Fourteen? Fifteen? Your days are running out. How long can you last? A year. Six months?  What happens when you're sixteen and you go green?
L352673 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ No, for you! How old are you, Billy?
L352672 +++$+++ u1853 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ For me? Better feel sorry for yourself, Sandman!
L352671 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I feel sorry for you, boy!
L352670 +++$+++ u1853 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ I cut up a Sandman yesterday. They said I'd never get him... but I cut him up good, I did.
L352669 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I'm a Sandman!
L352890 +++$+++ u1854 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ BOX +++$+++ Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea.  It's all here -- ready -- fresh as harvest day. Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea... And then it stopped coming and they...  ...came instead. So I store them here. I'm ready. And you're ready. It's my Job -- protein, plankton, grass from the sea.
L352889 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ What other food?
L352888 +++$+++ u1854 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ BOX +++$+++ Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.

L352870 +++$+++ u1854 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ BOX +++$+++ Let me sculpt you and I will show you where the others have gone.
L352869 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ There must be somebody else up here. I can't believe that he's --
L352868 +++$+++ u1854 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ BOX +++$+++ Do you know how long all this will last? Not thirty years... or thirty thousand years... but thirty thousand years... and you'll be part of it. Ages will roll... Ages. And you'll be here... the two of you... eternally frozen... frozen... beautiful.
L352867 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Answer the question!

L352857 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ We were sent here and you know it. Others have been sent here. Where are they? Hiding?
L352856 +++$+++ u1854 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ BOX +++$+++ From? From? From?
L352855 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Where do you think we came from?

L352843 +++$+++ u1854 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ BOX +++$+++ Are you too startled? Am I too removed from your ken?  I'm neither machine nor man... but a perfect fusion of the two... and better than either.  No human sculptor could match this greatness... don't you agree?
L352751 +++$+++ u1855 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ DOC +++$+++ Hurry... hurry... hurry.
L352750 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I don't care... Just get it over with.

L352735 +++$+++ u1855 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ DOC +++$+++ Fine... Holly will get you ready. You're in good hands, believe me.
L352734 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Just the face.
L352733 +++$+++ u1855 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ DOC +++$+++ I designed it myself.  What'll it be... a face job or a full-body job?
L352732 +++$+++ u1855 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ DOC +++$+++ And I did it myself right on there.
L352731 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Your own work?
L352730 +++$+++ u1855 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ DOC +++$+++ I am.
L352729 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Thanks.  I thought you'd be older. I expected a Red.
L352728 +++$+++ u1855 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ DOC +++$+++ It's a real privilege, Sandman.
L353025 +++$+++ u1856 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ Why did you do that???!!!
L353024 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that...
L353023 +++$+++ u1856 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ Why did you do that??!!
L352767 +++$+++ u1856 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ What are you talking about?! I saw you let a Runner go?  I saw you, Logan?? Tell me!!
L352766 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ It has nothing to do with you.
L352765 +++$+++ u1856 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ What's going on, Logan?!
L352559 +++$+++ u1856 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ At Carousel tonight?
L352558 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I'm fine...  See you...
L352557 +++$+++ u1856 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ Look... why don't you get into the water... you need it... more than I do.
L352556 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Anybody we know?
L352555 +++$+++ u1856 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ Of course.
L352554 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Did you?
L352553 +++$+++ u1856 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ I think you've been skulling out too much. First Nursery and now stupid questions.
L352552 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Did you ever see anybody renew?
L352551 +++$+++ u1856 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ What the hell took you so long?
L352523 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ No -- it's that last Runner -- someone in 483 was trying to help him.
L352522 +++$+++ u1856 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ You? Why? You're already beautiful.
L352521 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ I just might look in on New You 483 myself.
L352460 +++$+++ u1856 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ Yes.  But you look a little rusty to me -- what were you doing, wondering?
L352459 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ That was a great shot you made.
L352457 +++$+++ u1856 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ I'm in my party mood.
L352456 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Who invited you?
L352449 +++$+++ u1856 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ Only a few? You're just not trying.
L352448 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Now there's a few who could have been his seed-mother.
L352444 +++$+++ u1856 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ Come on. I don't want to miss the filing-in. There'll be some I know tonight, I think...
L352443 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ You should have been with us in Nursery, Daniel. I'm positive I recognized him --
L352442 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ What an old, old man you're getting to be, Francis. Weren't you ever a Yellow? I bet you were even wilder than --  come on, Sandman.
L352441 +++$+++ u1856 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ The damned Yellows are getting out of hand. Those three ought to be in Cathedral. No business scrambling in Arcade...
L352439 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Well... you can't have them all.
L352438 +++$+++ u1856 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ You missed something special.
L352425 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Of course not! I'm curious, not sick. 
L352424 +++$+++ u1856 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ I don't know what makes you so curious. You have any idea who his seed-mother was?
L352423 +++$+++ u1856 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ I never even visited Nursery before tonight.  When you wonder, it slows you up -- you know?
L352422 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Did you ever see Francis-8?
L352416 +++$+++ u1856 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ Well the minute you get a better idea you can stop wondering.  You know, Logan -- you wonder a lot. Too much for a Sandman.
L352415 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that "one for one" song of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape.
L352414 +++$+++ u1856 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ Well, why not!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -- You have a better idea?
L352413 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ But you don't know, you just say what everyone says. "One for one. One for one."
L352412 +++$+++ u1856 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ Dunno... flameout maybe. Whatever happens, you can bet it's final. But who would want to find out?
L352411 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Just wondered... what happens?
L352410 +++$+++ u1856 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ Why?
L352409 +++$+++ u1856 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ Not in my time...
L352408 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
L352407 +++$+++ u1856 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ You need a lift. Let's go to Arcade and celebrate...  your alert successor... Logan-6.
L352404 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Even the alarm didn't wake him.
L352403 +++$+++ u1856 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ Had enough?
L352396 +++$+++ u1856 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ Maybe, maybe not. What's the difference? Come on, Logan, let's get out of here before everybody finds out.
L352395 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Open your eyes once, idiot.  It's not every day that a Sandman son is born. I'm telling you, Francis -- that's him!
L352394 +++$+++ u1856 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ You should've seen me take my last Runner... perfect.  I backed him up against a residence pool and when he terminated... his hand...  So now you've seen him... what's the difference awake or asleep?
L352393 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Turn this way.  No, no... not you... YOU!
L352392 +++$+++ u1856 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ You are here. I couldn't believe it when they told me. What are you doing?
L352802 +++$+++ u1857 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Yes. Oh yes.  He was after you. I remember. You're running!
L352801 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ ...and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him...
L352800 +++$+++ u1857 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ That's right. The other one came after. The older one. Smashing, killing, burning!
L352799 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Holly. Holly! Please... The other Sandman. Remember the one who came after --
L352798 +++$+++ u1857 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran.
L352797 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ No, Holly -- wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!
L352796 +++$+++ u1857 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ It's him! The first Sandman. He killed... Doc.
L352664 +++$+++ u1861 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I never go upstairs. You're a nice old lady.
L352663 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ When do you go up?
L352662 +++$+++ u1861 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'm very smart.
L352661 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Why aren't you in Nursery?
L352660 +++$+++ u1861 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Here.
L352659 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Where do you live, Mary?
L352658 +++$+++ u1861 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'm Mary 2.
L352657 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ What's your name?
L353082 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Of course.  I don't know where...  I just took them for granted.  It's our only chance.
L353081 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Is it inside the city?
L353080 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ It's part of the hydrogalvanic system. The ocean tides are changed into energy somehow.
L353079 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ What does that water do?
L353078 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Beloved wife...
L353077 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ Beloved husband...

L353074 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Yes. You and I, Jessica. 
L353073 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ "Beloved son"...  So people stayed together for that feeling of love... They would live and raise children together and be remembered.  I think I feel that way, Logan. Can we be that way?
L353051 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ I want to be alive and with you, that's all I want.
L353050 +++$+++ u1859 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ LOGAN +++$+++ Jessica... listen to me... listen to me...  The Lifeclocks made me kill Francis. They make people die or be killed every day. If I didn't try and destroy that... I couldn't live here or anywhere. Do you understand?
L353049 +++$+++ u1858 +++$+++ m122 +++$+++ JESSICA +++$+++ You want to go back to kill, is that it?! Now, you'll want to kill your own!!! Kill Sandmen!!! Killing's all you ever...!!!
