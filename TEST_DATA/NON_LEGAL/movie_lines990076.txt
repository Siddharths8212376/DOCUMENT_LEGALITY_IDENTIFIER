L347810 +++$+++ u6297 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ WILLIE +++$+++ I'm not touching you!
L347809 +++$+++ u6294 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ Answer them and quit kicking me!
L347808 +++$+++ u6297 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ WILLIE +++$+++ It saw us!
L347806 +++$+++ u6294 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ Jameson?  Who are you trying to con...?
L347805 +++$+++ u6297 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ WILLIE +++$+++ Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
L347804 +++$+++ u6294 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ Tip top, Willie...tip top.
L347803 +++$+++ u6297 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ WILLIE +++$+++ Are you okay, Jonesy?
L347801 +++$+++ u6297 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ WILLIE +++$+++ Well, why haven't they answered our flares?
L347800 +++$+++ u6294 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.
L347799 +++$+++ u6297 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ WILLIE +++$+++ Are you sure you saw something?
L347742 +++$+++ u6294 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ Don't fuckin' worry, I ain't.
L347741 +++$+++ u6297 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ WILLIE +++$+++ Don't spend all day down there.
L347738 +++$+++ u6294 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ She's wondering what's happening.  We're losing air faster than I thought.
L347737 +++$+++ u6297 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ WILLIE +++$+++ The shack...
L347724 +++$+++ u6294 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ The air's stopped.
L347723 +++$+++ u6297 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ WILLIE +++$+++ What is it?
L347698 +++$+++ u6294 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ The good doctor signed our death warrant.
L347697 +++$+++ u6297 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ WILLIE +++$+++ What is it?
L347691 +++$+++ u6294 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ Oh man, that's just great...
L347690 +++$+++ u6297 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ WILLIE +++$+++ Cobb's cut...It was in him! It got Doc...
L347650 +++$+++ u6294 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ Fucking great...You telling me we got a fucking dracula in here with us?
L347649 +++$+++ u6297 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ WILLIE +++$+++ It needs blood?
L347635 +++$+++ u6294 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ DeJesus...It's got him.
L347634 +++$+++ u6297 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ WILLIE +++$+++ What's wrong?
L347633 +++$+++ u6294 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ I ought to smack your face!
L347632 +++$+++ u6297 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ WILLIE +++$+++ What on earth's the matter with you?
L347526 +++$+++ u6294 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ Sleeping.  No sign of Doc, though.  I'll check the control room.  You look in the shower room...
L347525 +++$+++ u6297 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ WILLIE +++$+++ How is he?
L347524 +++$+++ u6294 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ Sixpack...
L347523 +++$+++ u6297 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ WILLIE +++$+++ Who were you talking to?
L347453 +++$+++ u6294 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ Honey, the company don't give a flying fuck about "whys," they just look at the numbers and the contract says if we miss our quota they only got to pay us half-pay for the entire month.
L347452 +++$+++ u6297 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ WILLIE +++$+++ No...he's really sick.  I heard him last night.  The company will take that into consideration...
L347370 +++$+++ u6294 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ "Debbie Does Dallas"...  Hell, it's in Russian.  I can't read it...
L347369 +++$+++ u6297 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ WILLIE +++$+++ What is it?
L347286 +++$+++ u6294 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ Jameson?  Who're you trying to con?
L347285 +++$+++ u6297 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ WILLIE +++$+++ Hey, Jonesy, who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
L347202 +++$+++ u6294 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ JONES +++$+++ Let's hope it holds.
L347201 +++$+++ u6297 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ WILLIE +++$+++ Clear for pickup.
L347326 +++$+++ u6296 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ SIXPACK +++$+++ Don't worry, darlin, I'm...
L347325 +++$+++ u6297 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ WILLIE +++$+++ Hardly.
L347324 +++$+++ u6296 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ SIXPACK +++$+++ What's wrong, did you miss me?
L347296 +++$+++ u6297 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ WILLIE +++$+++ Sorry, darling...Just thought a little humor would loosen us all up...you know?...
L347295 +++$+++ u6296 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ SIXPACK +++$+++ Bitch!  Look what you did!
L347237 +++$+++ u6297 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ WILLIE +++$+++ Right.
L347236 +++$+++ u6296 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ SIXPACK +++$+++ The latch is screwed up.  Or the hinge.
L347235 +++$+++ u6297 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ WILLIE +++$+++ Your pocket?
L347234 +++$+++ u6296 +++$+++ m421 +++$+++ SIXPACK +++$+++ My pocket.  Check my pocket, will ya, honey?
L352366 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Well not exactly, no; I got 'em sitting in the car, actually; I thought we might sell them back to the Greek, but I am having a bit of a problem getting hold of him.
L352365 +++$+++ u6299 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BACON +++$+++ Well, talk.
L352364 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I wanted to talk to you about that.
L352190 +++$+++ u6299 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BACON +++$+++ A traffic warden. Look, what's this?
L352189 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ A what?
L352075 +++$+++ u6299 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BACON +++$+++ I am not sure what's more worrying, the job or your past.
L352074 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Is there something we should know about you, Soap?
L352068 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Seven hundred for the pair.
L352067 +++$+++ u6299 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BACON +++$+++ How much did you part with?
L351967 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Well, it's still a good idea.
L351966 +++$+++ u6299 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BACON +++$+++ A month? So, my friend, what fucking good is that, if we need it in six . . . no, five days?
L351965 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Probably no longer than four weeks.
L351964 +++$+++ u6299 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BACON +++$+++ So how long do you have to wait 'till you see a return?
L351939 +++$+++ u6299 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BACON +++$+++ Stop fucking around, Tom, and think. What are we going to do?
L351938 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I'll kill him!
L351724 +++$+++ u6299 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BACON +++$+++ He's a stroppy sod but he's got more balls than a golfer, only he doesn't know it. ' * Cut from completed film.
L351723 +++$+++ u6318 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Soap is called Soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any unlawful behaviour. He is proud of his job, and even more proud that it's legal.
L352070 +++$+++ u6299 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BACON +++$+++ Jesus, Tom, do they work?
L352069 +++$+++ u6317 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ SOAP +++$+++ Drachmas, I hope. I would feel safer with a chicken drumstick. They could do more harm than good.
L351962 +++$+++ u6299 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BACON +++$+++ Yeah, but he has got to tell his Dad he is about to lose his bar.
L351961 +++$+++ u6317 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ SOAP +++$+++ It's hit us all hard!
L351960 +++$+++ u6299 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BACON +++$+++ At the bottom of a bottle and has been for two days; it's hit him hard.
L351959 +++$+++ u6317 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ SOAP +++$+++ I would rather put my money on a three-legged rocking horse. The odds are a hundred to one for a good reason, BACON . . . it won't win. So where is Ed with all the bright ideas?
L351958 +++$+++ u6299 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BACON +++$+++ The odds are one hundred to one so all we need is five grand.
L351735 +++$+++ u6299 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BACON +++$+++ Sex and sleaze and antique shotguns are all deep and dear in Harry's stone cold heart.
L351734 +++$+++ u6317 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ SOAP +++$+++ When the old bastard is not playing cards he's chasing a thousand debts that ill-fated individuals owe for an array of reasons.
L352362 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ And Tom took care of them.
L352361 +++$+++ u6299 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BACON +++$+++ Apart from those shotguns.
L352360 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ The traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized Dog and his lot so that put us sort of in the clear. They got no case against us because there is no evidence against us.
L352324 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ Well what?
L352323 +++$+++ u6299 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BACON +++$+++ Well?
L352317 +++$+++ u6299 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BACON +++$+++ Think about what you're going to say, Ed; we are on thin ice.
L352316 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ He'll care all right. That was going to be his money. Whether he cares about us is different. Pass your phone.
L352245 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ That inspires confidence, that does.
L352244 +++$+++ u6299 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BACON +++$+++ Scarface, I have watched Scarface. You want to know how to do a drug deal, you watch Scarface!
L352193 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ I dunno, but I don't think we need him. Dump him at the lights.
L352192 +++$+++ u6299 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BACON +++$+++ I think he's still alive. He's got claret coming out of him somewhere. What did they want with a traffic warden?
L352188 +++$+++ u6299 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BACON +++$+++ Let's have a butcher's. Jesus, there's lots of everything. We've got god knows how much of this stinking weed; we've got a shit load of cash; and we've got a . . . traffic warden.
L352187 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ Bacon, see what we got.
L352184 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ I'll meet you in the van when you have finished with handsome there.
L352183 +++$+++ u6299 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BACON +++$+++ Of course you will, sweetheart. This one, search this one. Ed finds the keys without any trouble.
L352064 +++$+++ u6299 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BACON +++$+++ It's happening tomorrow morning. Get back here now.
L352063 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ Yes?
L351999 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ They can't report they have had all their drugs and money nicked, can they?
L351998 +++$+++ u6299 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BACON +++$+++ I don't know how you've reached that conclusion.
L351942 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ I'll think of something, don't worry.
L351941 +++$+++ u6299 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BACON +++$+++ Let me tell you about Hatchet Harry. Once there was this geezer called Smithy Robinson who worked for Harry. It was rumoured that he was on the take. Harry invited Smithy round for an explanation. Smithy didn't do a very good job. Within a minute Harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand, which happened to be a fifteen-inch black rubber cock. He then proceeded to batter poor Smithy to death with this; that was seen as a pleasant way to go . . . Hence, Hatchet Harry is a man you pay if you owe.
L351763 +++$+++ u6299 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BACON +++$+++ And nobody wants to live next door to the people that we live next to; a bit anti-social, you know.
L351762 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ Because it's cheap like a budgie.
L351756 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ I still will, if you don't mind.
L351755 +++$+++ u6299 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BACON +++$+++ Twenty-five from me, Tom, Soap and yourself; a hundred grand to the pound. You don't need to count it.
L351738 +++$+++ u6299 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BACON +++$+++ The Baptist got his name from drowning people for Hatchet.
L351737 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ Hatchet has a colleague, a monster of a man: Barry the Baptist.
L351710 +++$+++ u6305 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ The reason he is called BACON is he spent so much of his youth in the police station that people thought he was one of them. But he is a big boy now and it is time to move on.
L351709 +++$+++ u6299 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BACON +++$+++ Ed can run fast, talk fast, eat fast, and play cards fast, but he's fucking slow when it comes to spotting the roz.
L351861 +++$+++ u6316 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ SAMOAN JO +++$+++ You ask him if you like, but I would leave him to it if I was you.
L351860 +++$+++ u6299 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BACON +++$+++ Well whatever it is, could you get your man to turn the TV down?
L351859 +++$+++ u6316 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ SAMOAN JO +++$+++ It's a Samoan pub.
L351858 +++$+++ u6299 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BACON +++$+++ I thought this was a pub.
L351857 +++$+++ u6316 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ SAMOAN JO +++$+++ You want a pint, go to the pub.
L351856 +++$+++ u6299 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BACON +++$+++ No, I asked you to give me a refreshing drink. I wasn't expecting a fucking rainforest; you could fall in love with an orang-utan in that.
L351855 +++$+++ u6316 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ SAMOAN JO +++$+++ A cocktail, you asked for a cocktail.
L351854 +++$+++ u6299 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BACON +++$+++ What's that?
L352265 +++$+++ u6300 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ You heard of Harry Lonsdale? Otherwise known as Back-you-up with-a- Hatchet Harry, infamous for his removal of digits?
L352264 +++$+++ u6302 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ Yeah, Bazza, what?
L352263 +++$+++ u6300 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Inside, out-fuckin'-side. I don't give a shit, you get those guns because if you don't . . .
L352262 +++$+++ u6302 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ We made a deal for everything inside the cabinet.
L352261 +++$+++ u6300 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ You fucking well have to get 'em!
L352032 +++$+++ u6300 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ I am not fucking interested.
L352031 +++$+++ u6302 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ They were . . .
L352030 +++$+++ u6300 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Well you just better un-sell 'em, sharpish.
L352029 +++$+++ u6302 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ Not in the cabinet there wasn't. There was a couple of old hammer-lock muskets the butler was carrying; they were ours, and we sold 'em!
L352028 +++$+++ u6300 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ There were two old guns there; where are they?
L352027 +++$+++ u6302 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ I don't know what you mean.
L352026 +++$+++ u6300 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?
L352025 +++$+++ u6302 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ There are no others.
L352024 +++$+++ u6300 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Where're the others?
L352023 +++$+++ u6302 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ Next time we do a job like this we gonna want more money, or we are going back to post offices and cars.
L351902 +++$+++ u6302 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ You should see what they did to poor Gary.
L351901 +++$+++ u6300 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ You get the guns?
L351900 +++$+++ u6302 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ I thought you said no staff, Bazza!
L351831 +++$+++ u6300 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ If it looks old, it's worth money, simple. So stop fucking moaning and rob the place.
L351830 +++$+++ u6302 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ Antiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?
L351829 +++$+++ u6300 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Like antiques.
L351828 +++$+++ u6302 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ DEAN +++$+++ Like what?
L351748 +++$+++ u6307 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ HATCHET +++$+++ Don't play innocent with me Bazza; spanking!
L351747 +++$+++ u6300 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Er, very nice Harry. What's it for?
L351746 +++$+++ u6307 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ HATCHET +++$+++ Good, you can get this under control now.
L351745 +++$+++ u6300 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ No mortgage, no debts; lock, stock, the sodding lot . . . don't worry, I got it under control.
L351744 +++$+++ u6307 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ HATCHET +++$+++ And JD is his dad, and owns the whole property?
L351743 +++$+++ u6307 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ HATCHET +++$+++ Where did he get a hundred grand?
L351742 +++$+++ u6300 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Better than good, he is a fucking liability.
L351741 +++$+++ u6307 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ HATCHET +++$+++ All right, all right, so we can say he is good.
L351837 +++$+++ u6300 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Fucking Northern monkeys.
L351836 +++$+++ u6306 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ I hate these Southern shites.
L351835 +++$+++ u6300 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Careful, remember who's giving you this job.
L351834 +++$+++ u6306 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ I see, one of those `on a need to know' basis things, like a James Bond film, is it?
L351833 +++$+++ u6300 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ You're doing it for me is all you need to know. You only know that because you need to know.
L351832 +++$+++ u6306 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ So who's the Guv? Who we doing this for?
L351827 +++$+++ u6300 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.
L351826 +++$+++ u6306 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
L351825 +++$+++ u6300 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . . Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There will be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours.
L351824 +++$+++ u6306 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot?
L352381 +++$+++ u6309 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ JD +++$+++ Well, I suggest you speak to him, then.
L352380 +++$+++ u6301 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BIG CHRIS +++$+++ I have got something for ya. Well, for your boy, actually.
L352379 +++$+++ u6309 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ JD +++$+++ Yes?
L352378 +++$+++ u6301 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BIG CHRIS +++$+++ I think I can help you, as it happens.
L352377 +++$+++ u6309 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ JD +++$+++ Can I help?
L352376 +++$+++ u6301 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BIG CHRIS +++$+++ Nope.
L352375 +++$+++ u6309 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ JD +++$+++ Chris.  You come to collect something, Chris? Should I have something for you?
L352374 +++$+++ u6301 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BIG CHRIS +++$+++ JD.
L352308 +++$+++ u6307 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ HATCHET +++$+++ Good job, Chris.
L352307 +++$+++ u6301 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BIG CHRIS +++$+++ It looks like ít, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.
L352306 +++$+++ u6307 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ HATCHET +++$+++ They were going to pay, then?
L352305 +++$+++ u6301 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BIG CHRIS +++$+++ Yeah, it's all there, to the pound.
L352304 +++$+++ u6307 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ HATCHET +++$+++ Have you counted the money?
L352301 +++$+++ u6307 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ HATCHET +++$+++ Er, yeah, sure, I'll have 'em.
L352300 +++$+++ u6301 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BIG CHRIS +++$+++ The boys had 'em. I know you like these things; wondered if you wanted them?
L352195 +++$+++ u6301 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BIG CHRIS +++$+++ No Harry, you can't.
L352194 +++$+++ u6307 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ HATCHET +++$+++ It's about time you give my young friends a visit, Chris. Tomorrow is the day and mum seems to be the word, and I can't have that now, can I, Chris?
L352297 +++$+++ u6301 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BIG CHRIS +++$+++ I am sure you have, no one was accusing you of being dishonest, John.
L352296 +++$+++ u6311 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ JOHN O'DRISCOLL +++$+++ I won't be seeing you again Chris; I have paid him every last penny.
L352295 +++$+++ u6301 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ BIG CHRIS +++$+++ Hello, John. Nice holiday?
L351792 +++$+++ u6311 +++$+++ m422 +++$+++ JOHN O'DRISCOLL +++$+++ No chance of you lifting this sunbed up is there?
