L438829 +++$+++ u7022 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MR. KELCHER +++$+++ We think this party might cheer her up. Just make sure you know what's expected of you.
L438821 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Yes, sir. Trust is a two—way street. In the past two years I've been pleased to note that you and Mrs. Kelcher have, uh, fulfilled your sacred trust of being good parents to the, uh, woman I plan to take off your hands.
L438820 +++$+++ u7022 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MR. KELCHER +++$+++ Charles, in spite of your adolescent infatuation with music, we've always regarded you a a fine young man. We've trusted you with our daughter.
L438819 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Yes, sir. But that's what I like about her. She's not like all the other girls at school.
L438817 +++$+++ u7022 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MR. KELCHER +++$+++ She seems confused, irresponsible, overemotional. My wife says that's the way girls act sometimes.
L438816 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L438813 +++$+++ u7022 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MR. KELCHER +++$+++ Fine, thanks. Come on in. I want to talk to you.
L438812 +++$+++ u7017 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
L438811 +++$+++ u7022 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MR. KELCHER +++$+++ Hello, Charlie.
L439273 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Have a nice day.
L439272 +++$+++ u7018 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Take a long walk on a short pier.
L439271 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I beg your pardon?
L439270 +++$+++ u7018 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Oh! You did that on purpose! I hate you. Go gargle with razor blades!
L439269 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Sorry. These fountain pens are so tricky.
L438886 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Touchy, touchy!
L438885 +++$+++ u7018 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Are you for real?
L438884 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.
L438883 +++$+++ u7018 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends.
L438882 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.
L438881 +++$+++ u7018 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Carol and I saw you with that creep, Richard, today.
L438689 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Test?
L438688 +++$+++ u7018 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Did you study for the test?
L438939 +++$+++ u7018 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ First a nerd and then a weirdo. What a bunch of nose pickers. I'll tell Charlie.
L438938 +++$+++ u7028 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ That commie beatnik? What's she doing with him? Wait'll I tell Charlie.
L438937 +++$+++ u7018 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ There's Peggy with Michael Fitzsimmons.
L438936 +++$+++ u7028 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ What, why?
L438935 +++$+++ u7018 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Terry! Slow down.
L438934 +++$+++ u7028 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Okay.
L438933 +++$+++ u7018 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Terry, slow down.
L438898 +++$+++ u7028 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ What if we're witnessing the end of touch dancing?
L438897 +++$+++ u7018 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Hey Terry, what is that?  Did Peggy make it up?  I've never seen that on Bandstand.
L439325 +++$+++ u7019 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ He won't tell me, but I've got my suspicions. And I don't want any of that. Don't keep her out late.
L439324 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ It was my idea, Grandma. I always wondered what went on at those lodge meetings.
L439316 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ My children make me happy. I miss them so much.  Beth. Scott and Beth.  I'm going to name my daughter after you.
L439315 +++$+++ u7019 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Right now you're just browsing through time. Choose the things you'll be proud of. The things that Last.
L439314 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ But I'm remembering the future.
L439313 +++$+++ u7019 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ If you believe it, darling, then I believe. Being young can be just as confusing as being old. The things that happened to me fifty years ago are more on my mind than what happened yesterday.
L439306 +++$+++ u7019 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ I'm not afraid. I know exactly when I'm going to die.
L439305 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I wish she hadn't.
L439304 +++$+++ u7019 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ You know, Peggy Sue, your mother said you had a dream that I died.
L439302 +++$+++ u7019 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ That's a day's work. But if that's what you want, maybe we can do it tomorrow for your birthday.
L439301 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Fine.  ) Grandma, would you teach me how to make strudel?
L439089 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I'm not going to marry him. I just went out with him once.  I know! Why don't we go to the movies tonight. Just us girls. It'll be fun.
L439088 +++$+++ u7020 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MADDY +++$+++ But I always thought that you would marry Charlie, Carol would marry Walter, and I would marry Arthur. We'd all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every Sunday. It'll spoil everything if you and Charlie break up. That Michael doesn't look like the barbecue type.
L439087 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Cool it kids. He's free to see other girls, if he wants.
L439082 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ He's very interesting. For all his pretending to be a tough guy, he's really got the soul of a poet.
L439081 +++$+++ u7020 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MADDY +++$+++ Yeah. He's so cool and mysterious.
L439073 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ She's unbelievable. Who needs satellites when we've got Dolores's mouth?
L439072 +++$+++ u7020 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MADDY +++$+++ How come we're your best friends and we had to find out about you and Michael Fitzsimmons from Dolores?
L438877 +++$+++ u7020 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MADDY +++$+++ Come on, where's your enthusiasm?
L438876 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Don't get your hopes up.
L438442 +++$+++ u7020 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MADDY +++$+++ It must run in the family.
L438441 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.
L438438 +++$+++ u7020 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MADDY +++$+++ I wish I had the nerve. And the figure.
L438437 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ It was Beth's idea.
L439222 +++$+++ u7021 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ My father. He's not just the ultimate square. He's a total crook.
L439221 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ What?
L439220 +++$+++ u7021 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah. That's cool. But I've got to warn you about something.
L439219 +++$+++ u7021 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Can we split now?
L439218 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I thought I knew everything about him.
L439217 +++$+++ u7021 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Peggy Sue's still stuck on treble without a cause.
L439216 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Ssh. He's great.
L439213 +++$+++ u7021 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ What a treat.
L439212 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ It's Charlie!
L439211 +++$+++ u7021 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I can dig that. Bittersweet perfection. Dogs of lust on leashes of memory... yeah.
L439210 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it.
L439209 +++$+++ u7021 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You think so?
L439208 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ That's a terrific line. You're going to be a wonderful writer.
L439207 +++$+++ u7021 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ But we had heat baby. Passion! Fire! We owe it to ourselves to fuse together.  At least one more time.
L439206 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Michael, you and I are light years apart. You should go, but not with me.
L439205 +++$+++ u7021 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ But what about the other night? We were like two stars in the same constellation.
L439203 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I hate chickens.
L439202 +++$+++ u7021 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
L439201 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I can't do that.
L439200 +++$+++ u7021 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us.
L439199 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
L439198 +++$+++ u7021 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...
L439197 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ For everyone.
L439196 +++$+++ u7021 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Five more weeks of school. And ten minutes past graduation I'm gone.  To freedom.
L439194 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I shouldn't have put you through that. It must have been agony. Let's do something.
L439193 +++$+++ u7021 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ That was quite an evening. Bourgeois, phony, decadent, stupid.
L438955 +++$+++ u7021 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Okay. Here's a new one. It's called Tenderness.  I couldn't sleep so I thought I'd scream Betrayed by a kiss, sucking pods of bitterness. In the madhouse of Dr. Dread Razor shreds of rat puke fall On my bare arms  I'm sorry. I guess I was trying to impress you. 
L438954 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I'd love to.
L438953 +++$+++ u7021 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ No, I just made that up. Do you want to hear one?
L438952 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Is that one of your poems?
L438951 +++$+++ u7021 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ A ray of oneness piercing the solitude. Falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh. You'll be a chapter in my memoirs of desire.
L438949 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I already did that. I want to be a dancer, I want to dance.
L438948 +++$+++ u7021 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Hey what's with you? I thought you were cool. You rode my bike. You blew some pot.  What's your scene Miss Majorette? You gonna marry Mr. Blue Impala and graze around with all the other sheep for the rest of your life?
L438947 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ They care about you. They're just a different generation.
L438946 +++$+++ u7021 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
L438945 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Don't you get along with your parents?
L438944 +++$+++ u7021 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more Jell—O for me, Mom.'
L438943 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ What are you shooting for?
L438942 +++$+++ u7021 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy.
L438941 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old...  Travels well though.  You know, the world looks a lot better from up here.
L438940 +++$+++ u7021 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ This is great reefer.
L438932 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Hey, man, I'm a hip chick.
L438931 +++$+++ u7021 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
L438930 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Coffee and a donut.
L438929 +++$+++ u7021 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ What're you doing here anyway?
L438928 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ The young man leaned back in his chair. No bulls would die today.
L438927 +++$+++ u7021 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ A writer's life is his work. Jack Kerouac doesn't have to kill a bull to have something to write about. He's out there feeling, burning... grooving on life!
L438926 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Maybe you're confusing his life with his work.
L438925 +++$+++ u7021 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author — fat, violent, drunk...
L438924 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ You don't?
L438923 +++$+++ u7021 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature.
L438922 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I was impressed with what you said in English class today.
L439232 +++$+++ u7022 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MR. KELCHER +++$+++ Look young lady, I grew up through the depression. I fought in the second World War. Six days a week I get up and deal with the public, the bank and the bill collectors. And on the seventh day, when God rests, I don't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool!
L439231 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Oh, you're both so naive.
L439226 +++$+++ u7022 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MR. KELCHER +++$+++ Didn't call, them pantyhose, though. What was it, Evelyn?
L439225 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Oh no!
L439224 +++$+++ u7022 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MR. KELCHER +++$+++ It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now.
L439223 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ How did it go with the pantyhose?
L439106 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Wrong, Dad. Your idea.
L439105 +++$+++ u7022 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MR. KELCHER +++$+++ You mean to tell me that you invited this Mr. Fitzsimmons over to talk about investing his money in your cockamamie idea?
L439102 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ You need a partner. There's a friend of mine at school whose father makes seat covers for cars, Mr. Fitzsimmons. I've invited him and his family over for dinner tomorrow night.
L439101 +++$+++ u7022 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MR. KELCHER +++$+++ That's all well and good, but we don't have the money to manufacture them.
L439096 +++$+++ u7022 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MR. KELCHER +++$+++ This is your great invention?  Would you wear those things?
L439095 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Ta da! Pantyhose! The death of the garter belt! Of course, once they're manufactured they'll look better than this. What do you think?
L439059 +++$+++ u7022 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MR. KELCHER +++$+++ Richard Nixon's going to be President. Nixon wears hats.
L439058 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ He'll win.
L439057 +++$+++ u7022 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MR. KELCHER +++$+++ Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win.
L439056 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats.
L439055 +++$+++ u7022 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MR. KELCHER +++$+++ That's very thoughtful, honey. It's just a slump. Things will pick up.
L439054 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Yes.
L439053 +++$+++ u7022 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MR. KELCHER +++$+++ I, that what all that nonsense was about this morning? You're worried about my business?
L439052 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ The hat business is in trouble.
L439051 +++$+++ u7022 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MR. KELCHER +++$+++ This morning was good.
L439050 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Quiet today?
L439049 +++$+++ u7022 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MR. KELCHER +++$+++ It's hard to believe you're going to be eighteen.  Want an eskimo pie? Or a creamsicle? I'd come home from the store and there's little you running up to me. I'd give you a dime and you'd promise never to grow up.
L439048 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I wanted to apologize for this morning.
L439047 +++$+++ u7022 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MR. KELCHER +++$+++ Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank.
L439046 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I closed my Christmas club.
L439044 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Open it.
L439043 +++$+++ u7022 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MR. KELCHER +++$+++ For me?
L439042 +++$+++ u7022 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MR. KELCHER +++$+++ Doing some shopping?
L439041 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Hi, Dad.
L438980 +++$+++ u7022 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MR. KELCHER +++$+++ Evelyn, take her to her room!
L438979 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
L438978 +++$+++ u7022 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MR. KELCHER +++$+++ I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room!
L438977 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands? You know, you treat Mom like a maid. It's not entirely your fault. Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school.
L438976 +++$+++ u7022 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MR. KELCHER +++$+++ That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into.
L438975 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I think they're going to deregulate it.
L438974 +++$+++ u7022 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MR. KELCHER +++$+++ Do you know how ridiculous you sound? First of all, it's illegal for U.S. citizens to buy gold. And in the second place, the price of gold is regulated by the government.
L438973 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I want to help with the family finances. I want you to buy some stocks. And gold. By 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce. Then you sell.
L438972 +++$+++ u7022 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MR. KELCHER +++$+++ All right. But this better be good.
L438971 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
L438970 +++$+++ u7022 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MR. KELCHER +++$+++ Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
L438969 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
L438968 +++$+++ u7022 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MR. KELCHER +++$+++ Thank God for that.
L438967 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ At my age? Don't be silly.
L438966 +++$+++ u7022 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MR. KELCHER +++$+++ Peggy, let me ask you something.  You're not... expecting are you?
L438965 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ It's not Charlie. It's me.
L438964 +++$+++ u7022 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MR. KELCHER +++$+++ Damn that Charlie I
L438647 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I think I'm way ahead of them.
L438646 +++$+++ u7022 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MR. KELCHER +++$+++ If all the kids jumped off a bridge, would you do that too?
L438643 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Mom, is there any coffee left?
L438642 +++$+++ u7022 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MR. KELCHER +++$+++ You're so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits.
L438641 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ That would be impossible.
L438640 +++$+++ u7022 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MR. KELCHER +++$+++ Thank you.. I accept your apology with the hope that what went on yesterday will never happen again.
L438626 +++$+++ u7022 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MR. KELCHER +++$+++ Evelyn, put her to bed.
L438625 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Dad, I never knew you had a sense of humor.
L438622 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Grounded? Ha! The story of my life. I don't wanna go to my room. I wanna import Japanese cars. I wanna go to Liverpool and discover the Beatles.
L438621 +++$+++ u7022 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MR. KELCHER +++$+++ I don't see the humor in this. Go to your room immediately. You're grounded.
L438620 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Just a little. I've had a tough day.
L438619 +++$+++ u7022 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MR. KELCHER +++$+++ Young lady, you're drunk!
L439230 +++$+++ u7023 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MRS. KELCHER +++$+++ Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.
L439229 +++$+++ u7022 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MR. KELCHER +++$+++ Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.
L439068 +++$+++ u7022 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MR. KELCHER +++$+++ We'll make it, we'll be fine.
L439067 +++$+++ u7023 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MRS. KELCHER +++$+++ Jack, I was just trying to help.
L439066 +++$+++ u7022 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MR. KELCHER +++$+++ I want everybody to hear because I don't have anything to be ashamed of.
L439065 +++$+++ u7023 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MRS. KELCHER +++$+++ Does everybody have to hear?
L439063 +++$+++ u7023 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MRS. KELCHER +++$+++ Please don't shout.
L439062 +++$+++ u7022 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MR. KELCHER +++$+++ I don't need your charity. I don't need your grandmother's jewelry or your parents money -—how could you do that?
L438631 +++$+++ u7023 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MRS. KELCHER +++$+++ You have four seasons, you have four slumps.
L438630 +++$+++ u7022 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MR. KELCHER +++$+++ Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.
L438629 +++$+++ u7023 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MRS. KELCHER +++$+++ A new car. We can't afford a new car.
L438624 +++$+++ u7022 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MR. KELCHER +++$+++ This is not giving blood. This is drunk.
L438623 +++$+++ u7023 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MRS. KELCHER +++$+++ Jack, take it easy. She gave blood at school today. Maybe she's just a little light—headed.
L439228 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ He's a liar! He has no such thing! It's my own fault. I should have had it patented first. He's a crook, damnit.
L439227 +++$+++ u7023 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MRS. KELCHER +++$+++ Sheerotards. Catchy name, isn't it? Like leotards.
L439180 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Yeah, I know Peggy Sue gets married. Case closed. Period. Mom, if you could live your life over again, would you do the same thing? Get married and settle down after high school?
L439179 +++$+++ u7023 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MRS. KELCHER +++$+++ What? When did it happen? Your dad and I always expected you two to get married.
L439178 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ You know Mom, it's okay to have male friends. Besides, it's over with me and Charlie.
L439177 +++$+++ u7023 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MRS. KELCHER +++$+++ What does Charlie think about that?
L439176 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ No, just a friend of mine. I don't think he Likes Jell—O.
L439173 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Mom, how about a machine that's like your blender, only it slices vegetables, kneads dough, chops meat and even make fresh pasta?
L439172 +++$+++ u7023 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MRS. KELCHER +++$+++ You know, dear, I think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea, but the next time you come up with something, please don't stay out all night. Just tell us. We'll believe you.
L439104 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ We've got to move fast. This is an idea whose time has come.
L439103 +++$+++ u7023 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MRS. KELCHER +++$+++ Isn't that awfully forward?
L439098 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Instead of a girdle. And light as a feather.
L439097 +++$+++ u7023 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MRS. KELCHER +++$+++ Would they go over my girdle or under?
L438982 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Way to go, Mom!
L438981 +++$+++ u7023 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MRS. KELCHER +++$+++ I'm not the maid!
L438963 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I went for a drive. Up in the hills.
L438962 +++$+++ u7023 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MRS. KELCHER +++$+++ Where have you been?
L438827 +++$+++ u7023 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MRS. KELCHER +++$+++ You accepted an invitation, Maddy's one of your best friends, and I baked the Rice Krispie squares.
L438826 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ I don't feel very festive.
L438825 +++$+++ u7023 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ MRS. KELCHER +++$+++ Maddy's party.
L438824 +++$+++ u7025 +++$+++ m469 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ For what?
