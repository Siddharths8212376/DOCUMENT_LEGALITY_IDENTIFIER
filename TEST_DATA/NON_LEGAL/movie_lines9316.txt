L426978 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Hey, Sid, thanks.
L426977 +++$+++ u2413 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PERRYMAN +++$+++ I see you didn't DOR, Mayo.
L426935 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Sorry, pard. Wouldn't want you to get an honor violation.
L426934 +++$+++ u2413 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PERRYMAN +++$+++ You'd make it. He's just getting to the girls. Come on, Zack. I gotta see my family, man. I couldn't take it if he keeps me here over the weekend.
L426933 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ I can't risk it.
L426932 +++$+++ u2413 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PERRYMAN +++$+++ I'll never get it polished in time. Give me a buckle, Zack.
L426745 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ I don't notice anyone else complaining.
L426744 +++$+++ u2413 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PERRYMAN +++$+++ Hey, man, is the piss-ass money you're making off this worth the risk of getting us all kicked out of here on an honor violation?
L426742 +++$+++ u2413 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PERRYMAN +++$+++ Who's got two bucks? It's costing me every penny they pay us just to keep my old Lady and my kids in that motel.
L426741 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Two bucks a buckle, Perryman. Look at that shine! Boonies'll cost you five.
L426677 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ He said it's up to us and I got here first, didn't I?
L426676 +++$+++ u2413 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PERRYMAN +++$+++ How do you figure that's your bunk?
L427227 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ Zack, it wasn't him! He didn't ask me to D.O.R. I came to him on my own.  I'm glad it's over, Zack. I really mean that. He was right. I wasn't doing this for me.
L427226 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ I don't get it! He's the best candidate in our class! Ask anyone! The best student! The best leader! The best friend to everybody! Couldn't you bend your goddamn standards just a little?
L427225 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ Please, Zack -- go back to the barracks!
L427218 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Just like that it's all over? With less than two weeks to go, you're out?
L427217 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ He's right, Zack. It doesn't matter.
L427211 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ I don't know... I felt like... like I was suffocating... Christ, Zack... I was so scared... so godddamn scared...
L427210 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Sid, what happened?
L427202 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Jesus Christ, Sid! Is everything your responsibility?
L427201 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ No matter how it happened, if she goes ahead and has it" Zack, there'll be a child in the world that's mine -- and I couldn't go through life knowing that and not knowing its name or where it lived.
L427200 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Okay, but what if it's like Foley said and she got knocked up, to trap you -- is it still your responsibility?
L427199 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ It's mine.
L427198 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Do you know that for sure?
L427197 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ But it would still be my kid. That's the point.
L427196 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Not if she won't even talk about an abortion.
L427195 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ I can't let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything. If it's my kid, too, then I've got a responsibility, don't I?
L427194 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ So what's the problem? Girls do that all the time.
L427193 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ She said it was up to me. If I don't, she'll go off and have the baby on her own somewhere.
L427192 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ But she expects you to marry her?
L427191 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ It's a big religious thing with her and she won't even discuss it.
L427181 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Doesn't mean shit. Get her to a doctor. You can't do anything until you hear what he says. Make the appointment yourself.
L427180 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ No, but she's gotta be at least a month late.
L427179 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Calm down, Sweet Pea. She seen a doctor?
L427177 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ But it can't wait.
L427176 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Talk to me in the morning. I feel like shit.
L427144 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ Lynette told me it really tore her up when you didn't call this week.
L427143 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ You should've done what I did. A clean break.
L427142 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ Listen, I'm not going to go to that little reunion party. I'm meeting Lynette at the motel.  Best head in fifty-two states. After three days of survival training, how could I resist?
L427141 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ I didn't ask you all that, Sweet Pea. I asked if you loved her.
L427140 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ She's the sweetest person I've ever known. Loves kids. Works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church. Everybody loves her.
L427139 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ I'm not your folks, man. You love this... Susan?
L427138 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ My girl back home. We're supposed to get married after I get my wings. She was Tommy's girl. They were engaged to be married before he died.  I should've told you about her. I don't know why I didn't, except I didn't want you to think I was a shit for making it with Lynette.
L427137 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ No problem, but who's Susan?
L427136 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ Thanks for covering for me.
L427108 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ That's what they want you to think, but I saw where she lived, what is she's trying to get away from.  Just take my word for it, pard. Break it off now. Do it this week.
L427107 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ I don't believe that. They're just having a good time, same as us.
L427106 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Remember what Foley said? His little warning? Those are the girls he was talking about. They're out to marry us any way they can.
L427105 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ What? You've gotta be kidding!
L427104 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ You'd better get smart, man. It's time to walk away.
L427103 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ I kid you not, Mayo, I am in love. We must've set a new indoor record today. You want to know how many times we did it?
L426988 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ A little.
L426987 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ That isn't true, is it?
L426984 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Naw.
L426983 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ What's the matter, Sweet Pea. Foley finally starting to get to you?
L426980 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ Yeah.
L426979 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Hey, you guys still awake?
L426928 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ Sure.
L426927 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ You okay?
L426872 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ Get off my case, Mayo. I didn't grow up rich.
L426871 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ She'll come, pard. A rich socialite Oakie like you oughta be a big catch around these parts.
L426870 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ Nice, hospitable folks they get around here.  I hope she comes.
L426852 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ Shhhh...
L426851 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Look at Foley! Can you believe it!
L426808 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ Jesus, that Lynette! I rode her hard and put her up wet.
L426807 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ 'Nellie's Nymphos!'
L426806 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ Could you believe those girls!
L426759 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ It's grown out more than an inch, sweetheart.
L426758 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ You told us it would grow out an inch.
L426753 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ Not if you make it worth my while. How about free boonies for the duration?
L426752 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Hey, you gonna tell anybody about this?
L426724 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ I hate to tell you guys, but only two out of every class make it into jets. Which one of you is going with me?
L426723 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Jets.
L426689 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Sure it is, Sweet Pea, but he should've warned you 'scuzzy' female types about the 'Puget Dudes.' They'll tell you they're wearing a rubber but they've bit a little hole in the end.
L426688 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ Think there's any truth to what he was saying about those girls? Is that still going on?
L426686 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ I've seen better.
L426685 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ That Foley looks like he's been through a war or two.
L435154 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ FUCK YOU, I'M GONE!
L435153 +++$+++ u2422 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ RAOUL +++$+++ YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS GONNA GO!
L435147 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ She's got your gun, that's what she's thinking!  The FUCK you had to bring a gun for?!
L435146 +++$+++ u2422 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ RAOUL +++$+++ We've got the Kid!  WE'VE GOT YOUR KID!!  What the fuck is she thinking?!
L435145 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ WHO THE FUCK BREAKS IN THROUGH THE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE?!
L435144 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ Hey man, it's the neighbor's house, who breaks in through the neighbor's house?!
L435143 +++$+++ u2422 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ RAOUL +++$+++ NOT THAT ONE?!
L435142 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ Not that one.
L435141 +++$+++ u2422 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ RAOUL +++$+++ The walls are steel, right?
L435133 +++$+++ u2422 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ RAOUL +++$+++ You know how this gotta end.
L435132 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ Bullshit.
L435131 +++$+++ u2422 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ RAOUL +++$+++ The kid in here.  The other two when we come out.
L435130 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ Get the fuck away from me.
L435129 +++$+++ u2422 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ RAOUL +++$+++ You're here with me, you're already on the hook for one.  Buy one, you get the rest for the same price. You know that.
L435128 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ -- posed to mean?
L435127 +++$+++ u2422 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ RAOUL +++$+++ You finish.  Then we finish.
L435126 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ Let me fucking finish this so we can get out of here.
L435125 +++$+++ u2422 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ RAOUL +++$+++ That's their problem.
L435124 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ That's your problem.
L435091 +++$+++ u2422 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ RAOUL +++$+++ She better.
L435090 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ She's gonna handle it.
L435089 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ It's not her fault, it's not her fault, the guy must have called them.  Look, look, look, she's telling us.
L435088 +++$+++ u2422 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ RAOUL +++$+++ She's fuckin' crazy, she killed the kid!  She just killed her own kid!
L435068 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ Are you gonna open the safe?
L435067 +++$+++ u2422 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ RAOUL +++$+++ You're wasting your fucking time, man, you're wasting my time.  You don't know how to do this, and the longer we stay in here, the more likely she's gonna lose it and call the cops!
L435062 +++$+++ u2422 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ RAOUL +++$+++ Yeah.  She can.  She's fine, she's just like, tired, she's gotta rest. You rest, Kid.  Half an hour.
L435061 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ Yeah, just like a half hour, maybe a little more, and your mom'll give it to you.  You can wait a half hour, can't you?
L435049 +++$+++ u2422 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ RAOUL +++$+++ I don't know, she keeps screamin' the same thing over and over.
L435048 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ The hell does she want?
L435047 +++$+++ u2422 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ RAOUL +++$+++ Hurry up, for Christ's sake!
L435046 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ Are you okay?
L435026 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ Yeah.  Yeah, I got an idea.  I gotta check something.
L435025 +++$+++ u2422 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ RAOUL +++$+++ You got an idea?
L435024 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ Okay, okay!  Okay.
L435023 +++$+++ u2422 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ RAOUL +++$+++ Th --
L435022 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ I can't just...
L435021 +++$+++ u2422 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ RAOUL +++$+++ Two.  Squeeze harder.
L435020 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ This is ridiculous...
L435019 +++$+++ u2422 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ RAOUL +++$+++ One.  Squeeze.
L435018 +++$+++ u2422 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ RAOUL +++$+++ You got till the count of three. Then you end up like him.
L435017 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ I can't...
L435016 +++$+++ u2422 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ RAOUL +++$+++ You can.  You're full of ideas.  You just need to squeeze one out.
L435015 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ I can't.
L435014 +++$+++ u2422 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ RAOUL +++$+++ What do you think?  Get us into that room.
L435013 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ What?  What do you want me to do?
L435012 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ Please...
L435011 +++$+++ u2422 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ RAOUL +++$+++ Remember that.
L435010 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ Yes.
L435009 +++$+++ u2422 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ RAOUL +++$+++ I have the gun.
L435008 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ Burning me.  It's burning my eye.
L435007 +++$+++ u2422 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ RAOUL +++$+++ That's right.
L435006 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ Me.  I am.
L435005 +++$+++ u2422 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ RAOUL +++$+++ Who's the clown now?  Huh?!  Who's the fucking clown now?!
L435004 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ Stop it!  Stop it!
L435002 +++$+++ u2422 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ RAOUL +++$+++ Fuckin' asshole, thinks he knows me. Drives his German car up to 125th Street a couple of times, buys a few rounds, thinks he's a tough guy, thinks he knows me.  You don't know one thing about me!
L435001 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ The fuck did you do that for?!
L435000 +++$+++ u2422 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ RAOUL +++$+++ You should see the look on your face.
L434865 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ Just sending a message.  She'll get the point.
L434864 +++$+++ u2422 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ RAOUL +++$+++ He said open it.
L434833 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ Make her come out.  And when she does, that's when we gotta be careful.  She can't get out of this house.  She can't even think she can get out of this house.  We just keep them here and keep them quiet for forty-five minutes.  And I don't want  Joe Pesci here standing over them with his fat sweaty finger on the trigger.  That's a sure way for us to end up with two dead bodies and little puffs of smoke burning out of our heads up in Greenhaven.  So we're gonna seal the place up.  They wanna hole up in here?  Fine, we'll help 'em.  Make it impossible for them to leave.  Once they come out of that room.
L434832 +++$+++ u2422 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ RAOUL +++$+++ So what the fuck are we supposed to do?!
L434829 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ Who else but God could think this shit up?  I spend ten years building those fucking rooms to keep people out, now I gotta figure out how to get in.  God, man, He just loves the irony.
L434828 +++$+++ u2422 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ RAOUL +++$+++ There is not one thing funny here.
L434827 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ God.
L434826 +++$+++ u2422 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ RAOUL +++$+++ What the fuck is funny about this?
L434823 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ She didn't.
L434822 +++$+++ u2422 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ RAOUL +++$+++ What if she called the cops?
L434754 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ Peace out.
L434753 +++$+++ u2422 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ RAOUL +++$+++ You're welcome.
L434742 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ I don't want Raoul to administrate that part.
L434741 +++$+++ u2422 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ RAOUL +++$+++ No problem.
L434737 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ Not with me.  Not with people.
L434736 +++$+++ u2422 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ RAOUL +++$+++ You're fuckin' A we can do this.
L434715 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ A woman and a little girl, both asleep upstairs.
L434714 +++$+++ u2422 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ RAOUL +++$+++ What?
L434997 +++$+++ u2419 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ Adios.
L434996 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ I mean it!
L434995 +++$+++ u2419 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ Yeah, whatever.
L434994 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ You walk out that door and you lose your share of the money.
L434985 +++$+++ u2419 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ Lookin' doubtful there, Big Guy, but ten out of ten for attitude.
L434984 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ We're not leaving.  I'm getting in that room, and I'm opening that safe.
L434978 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ What about us?
L434977 +++$+++ u2419 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ Close?  Are you insane?  We're nowhere near close!  Fuck this, I'll make an anonymous phone call on Monday, they'll find the floor safe, and I'll inherit the shit.  Little piece of it, anyway, it's better than nothing.
L434976 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ Hey man, after all we went through I am not walking out when we're this close.
L434964 +++$+++ u2419 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ Jesus, what was I thinking?
L434963 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ Do me a favor and don't talk.
L434962 +++$+++ u2419 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ And we're never getting in.
L434961 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ Hey.
L434960 +++$+++ u2419 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ She's never coming out.
L434916 +++$+++ u2419 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ Shit!
L434915 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ Cell phone.
L434875 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ Junior, you gigantic idiot, how are we supposed to get into the room if they pass out?
L434874 +++$+++ u2419 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ Nobody is gonna die, man, will you please have the balls to follow through with a good idea?  Think about it, what would you do if you were them, stay in there and choke to death, or come out?!  Huh?  We're just getting them to come out for forty-five minutes, forty-five fucking minutes!  The worst that's gonna happen is they pass out, we drag 'em out here into the fresh air, and they'll be fine.
L434873 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ They're gonna die in there!
L434872 +++$+++ u2419 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ They're coughing.
L434871 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ We're trying to scare them, not kill them!
L434870 +++$+++ u2419 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ Be quiet.
L434863 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ I did.
L434862 +++$+++ u2419 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ Open it.
L434831 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ Can't.  Whole point.  Can't get in the room.
L434830 +++$+++ u2419 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ Yes.  Yes, it's all terrible ironic and amusing.  You fuck.  Now how are you gonna get us into that room?
L434825 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ She lied.  Cops woulda been here by now if she called 'em.  Besides, Junior cut the phones.
L434824 +++$+++ u2419 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ She said she did.
L434821 +++$+++ u2419 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ Okay, fuckball, you think.  What are we gonna do?
L434820 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ I'm afraid to let you think, Junior. Things get worse when you think.  Oh, that's gonna help.
L434819 +++$+++ u2419 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ Shut up and let me think.
L434818 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ When you said you'd let 'em go I thought she'd come running right out for sure.
L434817 +++$+++ u2419 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ Shut up.
L434816 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ Got her right where you want her, Junior.
L434760 +++$+++ u2419 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ I am.  I'm an idiot's son.  An idiot's grandson.  I'm third- generation idiot.  But for once in my life I had a good idea, and I'm not giving up so easy.  You are? Are you actually telling me that for the first time in your life you're gonna throw your cards on the table and go home early?  I can't believe my eyes.  Fourteen million dollars upstairs, Burnham.  You'll be out of the hole. Baby, you'll be so far out of the hole you could draw bricks every night for the next twenty years and still shit green.  Come on, Buddy.  One more hand.
L434759 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ Pure idiot.
L434758 +++$+++ u2419 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ Not if we keep 'em here.  You can't kidnap somebody in their own house. It's just breaking and entering, unless we take 'em someplace.  Or something like that, I'm pretty sure.
L434757 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ Yeah.  Kidnapping.
L434756 +++$+++ u2419 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ It's still a good plan.  It's just... got a twist.
L434752 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ The fuck did you bring a gun for?
L434751 +++$+++ u2419 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ Different tables.
L434750 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ What tables?  I've never seen him before.
L434749 +++$+++ u2419 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ I met him at the tables, same as you.  And frankly, I'm grateful we have a little muscle right about now.
L434748 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ Where did you get this clown?
L434747 +++$+++ u2419 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ A guy shows you a gun, Burnham, and you insult him?  Hey, who's the idiot?  Huh?
L434746 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ Asshole.
L434745 +++$+++ u2419 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ Raoul, what in God's name do we do if she has a gun?
L434744 +++$+++ u2416 +++$+++ m155 +++$+++ BURNHAM +++$+++ What about us?  What if she has a gun?
