L497934 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Don't do that.
L497932 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Yeah, you're right. But I never claimed to know everything like you, and have all these little theories. I'm still learning, I know that. But I don't feel like I've wasted time. If I had to go through my marriage to get to where I am right now, fine.
L497931 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ All right, you want to talk about lies, let's talk about lies, Ann. Let's talk about lying to yourself. You haven't been able to sleep with your husband because you're no longer in love with him, and maybe you never were. You haven't been honest with yourself in longer than you can remember.
L497929 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Oh, you just moved here to think about it, right?
L497928 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ As I said, I haven't decided what to do, exactly. Perhaps I won't do anything.
L497927 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Whoa!! I'm so glad we got that on tape!! You won't answer a question about Elizabeth, but I have to answer all these intimate questions about my sex life!! Graham, what do you think she's going to make of all these videotapes? Are you going to tell her about them? I can't imagine her being too understanding about that. But since you don't lie anymore, you'll have to say something.
L497926 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I don't know. I really would rather not talk about it.
L497925 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?
L497924 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I don't know.
L497923 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Graham, I mean, what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her?
L497922 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Possibly.
L497921 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Like maybe a big part?
L497920 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Yes.
L497919 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ But that was part of it?
L497918 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Not entirely.
L497917 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's going on here? Did you come back here just to see her again?
L497916 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I don't know. Possibly.
L497915 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ But you're planning to be?
L497914 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ No.
L497913 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ You mean you're still in contact with her?
L497912 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Yes.
L497911 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Who? Elizabeth?
L497910 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I couldn't face her if I had slept with somebody else.
L497909 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ But how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig --
L497908 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Ann, it could happen to me all over again, don't you see? I could start to --
L497907 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ But I don't understand --
L497906 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I've told you.
L497905 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Why not?
L497904 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I can't.
L497903 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I'm asking for real. I want you to turn that camera off and make love with me. Will you?
L497902 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Ann. Are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now?
L497901 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ So why won't you make love with me? Why wouldn't you, I mean?
L497900 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ That's very flattering.
L497899 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ But I feel like maybe I could be really comfortable with you.
L497898 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I... I can't answer that precisely.
L497897 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ But if you were?
L497896 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I'm not in love with you.
L497895 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ If you were in love with me, would you?
L497894 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I'm not planning on it.
L497893 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ You're really never going to make love again?
L497892 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Yeah, I know, but somehow I expect that from her, I mean, she'll do it with almost anybody, I don't know, I shouldn't stick up for her I guess, but him. He lied so... deeply!! Ooo, I want to watch him die!!
L497891 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ You should be. He lied to you. So did Cynthia.
L497890 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ God, I m so mad at him!!
L497889 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ No, you're not.
L497888 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I'm babbling.
L497887 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Interesting analogy.
L497886 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Kind of. I mean, John's like this kind of... craftsman. Like he's a carpenter, and he makes really good tables. But that's all he can make, and I don't need anymore tables.
L497885 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ And you feel the same way with John?
L497884 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Subtlety, yes. No subtlety. Plus, I've never really felt able to open up with anyone. I mean, that other person I told you about, I enjoyed making love with him a lot, but I still wasn't able to really let go. I always feel like I'm being watched and I shouldn't embarrass myself.
L497883 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Subtlety?
L497882 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I don't know. It all gets back to that Cynthia thing. I don't like her... eagerness. There's nothing left to imagine, there's no...
L497881 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ If you do get out of your marriage, will you continue to be inhibited?
L497880 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Not yet. I'm not sure I will. I just want out.
L497879 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?
L497878 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I don't know anymore. I thought I was, but obviously I was wrong.
L497877 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ How could I, with all these nice people stopping by? The fact is that I've lived by myself for so long, I can't imagine living with another person. It's amazing what you can get used to if enough time goes by. And anyway, I'm asking the questions. Are you happy?
L497876 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Don't you get lonely?
L497875 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me.
L497874 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ And now you can?
L497873 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I loved her for how good she made me feel, and I hated her for how good she made me feel. And at that time, I tended to express my feelings non- verbally. I couldn't handle anyone having that much control over my emotions.
L497872 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ How come?
L497871 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly.
L497870 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ So you lied to her?
L497869 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ The problem was me. I was... I was a pathological liar. Or am, I should say. Lying is like alcoholism, one is always "recovering".
L497868 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ What was the problem?
L497867 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ No, it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem.
L497866 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?
L497865 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Her name was Elizabeth.
L497864 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Who was the last person you had sex with?
L497863 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Yes.
L497862 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ So you have had sex.
L497861 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ That's correct.
L497860 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ You said you weren't always impotent.
L497859 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Can't.
L497858 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Can't or won't?
L497857 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ If I can't do it all, I don't want to do anything. And I can't do it all.
L497856 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Why not?
L497855 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ No.
L497854 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ On tape?
L497853 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ No.
L497852 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ If I asked you to, would you? Not on tape, I mean?
L497851 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Yes.
L497850 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I remember. You could do that, couldn't you? Go down on me?
L497849 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I thought I made that clear before, when I said I would go down on you.
L497848 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Have you fantasized about me?
L497847 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Yes.
L497846 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ About me?
L497845 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I fantasized about you.
L497844 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ About who?
L497843 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Yes.
L497842 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ So you do fantasize?
L497841 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I know. Deep down, I know that. It just bothers me, when I have feelings or impulses that she has.
L497840 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ You're not like your sister. You couldn't be like her if you wanted to.
L497839 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Because that's how Cynthia thinks!! All she does is think about that stuff, and I hate that, I don't want to be like her, I don't want to be like her!!
L497838 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Why?
L497837 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Yes. Whenever... all right, look. Whenever I see a man that I think is attractive, I wonder what it would be like with him, I mean, I'm just curious, I don't act on it, but I hate that I think that!! I wish I could just forget about that stuff!!
L497836 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about?
L497835 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ No.
L497834 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Do you want me to stop?
L497833 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I guess not.
L497832 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Then as far as this taping goes, you have nothing to worry about.
L497831 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Yes, I have. I will.
L497830 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ At some level, I don't understand your nervousness. Have you decided to leave John?
L497829 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I don't see what difference it makes, I mean, I can think what I want.  I don't know if I want to do this anymore, I'm afraid... I don't mind answering the questions so much, but if somebody were to see this...
L497825 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Did the person you made love with satisfy you more than your husband?
L497824 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Yes.
L497823 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Did you have sex before you were married?
L497820 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Absolutely not.
L497819 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Is he going to see this?
L497818 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ It's a simple question. Have you ever thought of having -- making love with someone other than your husband?
L497817 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ You don't know what I'm thinking.
L497808 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Does he go down on you?
L497807 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Sometimes. Afterward.
L497806 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Yes.
L497805 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ When we're making love?
L497804 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Do you talk to him?
L497798 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ You are married, correct?
L497797 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Ann Bishop Millaney.
L497796 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Tell me your name.
L497756 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Ann Bishop Millaney.
L497755 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Tell me your name.
L497754 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Yes.
L497753 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ It won't. Are you ready?
L497752 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ What will you do when the money runs out?
L497751 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I have money.
L497750 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ How do you pay for all this? I mean, rent, and tapes and this equipment.
L497749 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Then do it.
L497748 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Load a new tape, turn the camera on.
L497747 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ What do you have to do to get ready?
L497746 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ That's a good question.
L497745 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ What would you know about a normal frame of mind?
L497744 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I want you to be aware of what you're doing and why, because I know that this is not the sort of thing you would do in a normal frame of mind.
L497743 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ What difference does it make why I do it?
L497742 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.
L497741 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Don't you want to make one?
L497740 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Do you think that's such a good idea?
L497736 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ It's not my place to tell you these things, Ann. You have to find out by yourself or from John directly. You have to trust me on this.
L497735 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Why not?
L497734 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ But even if we had been speaking, I wouldn't have told you.
L497733 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Ann, when would I have told you? We were not speaking, if you recall.
L497732 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Why didn't you tell me?
L497731 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ She said it on her tape.
L497730 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ How did you know?
L497729 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Yes.
L497728 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ You know?
L497727 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I know.
L497726 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ John and Cynthia have been... "fucking".
L497724 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I know.
L497723 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I'm not sure why I came here. I had kind of decided not to talk to you after... you know.
L497389 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Yes, I do.
L497388 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Maybe you want to go.
L497387 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ This is just... so...
L497386 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I'm sorry this came up.
L497385 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I don't... why... why do you do this?
L497384 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ No, not to me, for me, for the camera.
L497383 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ To you?
L497382 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Mostly. Sometimes they do things.
L497381 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ And they just answer them?
L497380 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Yes.
L497379 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ You just ask them questions?
L497378 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Like what they've done, what they do, what they don't do, what they want to do but are afraid to ask for, what they won't do even if asked. Anything I can think of.
L497377 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Like what?
L497376 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Everything about sex.
L497375 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ What about sex?
L497374 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Yes.
L497373 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ About sex?
L497372 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ The... interviews are about sex, Ann.
L497371 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ What... what are these interviews about?
L497370 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Because I promised each subject that no one would look at the tape except me.
L497369 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Why not?
L497368 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ No.
L497367 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Can we look at one?
L497366 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Yes.
L497365 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ All of these are interviews?
L497364 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Because I enjoy interviewing women more than men.
L497362 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Not really.
L497361 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ You went out with her?
L497360 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Donna was a girl I knew in Florida.
L497359 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Donna. On this tape it says "Donna".
L497358 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Donna?
L497357 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Who's Donna?
L497356 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Oh, just a personal project like anyone else's personal project. Mine's just a little more personal.
L497355 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ What kind of personal project?
L497354 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ It's a personal project I'm working on.
L497353 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I can see that. What are they?

L497351 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ What are these?
L497348 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Somehow I imagined books. I thought you would have like a whole lot of books and be reading all the time.
L497347 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Not much to see, I'm afraid. I'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe.
L497346 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I just wanted to see how the place looked furnished.

L497259 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ That's correct.  Bit of a dilemma, isn't it?
L497258 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ So since I've never had sex with you, by your own advice I shouldn't accept your advice.
L497257 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Basically, yes.
L497256 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Now, you said never take advice from someone that you don't know intimately, right?
L497255 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Well, I wasn't always impotent.
L497254 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Excuse me for asking, but how would you know?
