Remember that drover, the one I shot in the mouth so's the teeth come out the back of his head? I dream about him now an' again. I didn't have no reason to shoot him... not one I could remember when I sobered up.
L635129 +++$+++ u8715 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ NED +++$+++ Well, she...
L635128 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ I ain't blamin' her, Ned, I ain't holdin' it against her.  She knew me back then... an' she seen what a no good sonofabitch I was... an' she won't allow how I've changed. She just don't know how I ain't like that no more.
L635127 +++$+++ u8715 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ NED +++$+++ It's just... she's a Indian an' Indians ain't... overfriendly.

L635485 +++$+++ u8717 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ THE KID +++$+++ He wouldn't of took no beating like that if it hadn't of jammed. He wouldn't just give it over an' not shoot no one.

L636353 +++$+++ u8720 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ BAER +++$+++ We know, but our man says no way on the dope. This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the next' day. They had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it.
L636352 +++$+++ u8728 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KUJAN +++$+++ There was ninety-one million -

L636273 +++$+++ u8721 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ BODI +++$+++ No good. He needs guarantees. He says... his life is in danger... He has seen the Devil... looked him in the eye.
L636272 +++$+++ u8727 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KOVASH +++$+++ &lt;&lt;No, no, no. I need a guarantee from the ridiculous man. I am going to be killed. I have seen the Devil and looked him in the eye.&gt;&gt;
L636267 +++$+++ u8727 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KOVASH +++$+++ &lt;&lt;I'll tell you everything. I'11 even say it slow enough for you to understand it. Just tell this man I want protection. Real protection.&gt;&gt;
L636266 +++$+++ u8721 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ BODI +++$+++ Not dope. Something else. Some what?.. He doesn't knob what they were buying. But not dope... people.
L636263 +++$+++ u8721 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ BODI +++$+++ He says they were buying It doesn't make sense. I'm sorry, I'm a little rusty. They were there to buy something.

L636150 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ That's enough, Edie.
L636131 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ Alright.
L636130 +++$+++ u8722 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ Come home, Dean.
L636126 +++$+++ u8722 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ Dean, I love you. Do you hear me?
L636125 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ They ruined me tonight.
L636124 +++$+++ u8722 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ I love you.
L636123 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ They'll never stop.
L636122 +++$+++ u8722 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ Don't give up on me now, Dean.
L636121 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ No. It's never going to stop, period. It won't take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us. It's finished. I'm finished.
L636120 +++$+++ u8722 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ Give me some credit. I got you this far, let's go to the grand jury. This is never going to stop if we -
L636119 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ Time for what, Edie? Time to look into me a little more, that's what. No matter how well you cover my tracks now, they'll find out who I am.
L636118 +++$+++ u8722 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ They just said they wanted time.
L636117 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ Goddamnit.
L636116 +++$+++ u8722 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ They want more time to think about investing.
L636115 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ Edie, please. I don't want to hear this right now. What did Renault and Fortier say?
L636114 +++$+++ u8722 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ I'11 have this thing in front of a grand jury by Monday.
L636112 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ Just forget about it.
L636111 +++$+++ u8722 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ ...and the desk Sergeant is actually trying to tell me he can't release you? Can you believe that? You weren't even charged. New York police - Jesus. I want to take pictures of your face to bring to the D.A. first thing in the morning.
L635887 +++$+++ u8722 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ You've come far. You're a good man. I love you.

L635885 +++$+++ u8722 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ Now remember, this is another kind of business. They don't earn your respect. You owe it to them. Don't stare them down but don't look away either. Confidence. They are fools not to trust you. That's the attitude.
L636149 +++$+++ u8722 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ A hijacker like Dean, here? Or something more creative?
L636148 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ Umm ...
L636147 +++$+++ u8722 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ So what is it you do, Mr. Kint?
L636140 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ A glass of water would be nice.
L636139 +++$+++ u8722 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?
L636138 +++$+++ u8732 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ VERBAL +++$+++ I hope I didn't disturb you.
L636137 +++$+++ u8722 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ EDIE +++$+++ I know who he is.
L636401 +++$+++ u8723 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ FENSTER +++$+++ I don't know. This is bad.
L636400 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ Come on. The guy is a pipe dream. This Kobayashi is using him for window dressing .
L636399 +++$+++ u8723 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ FENSTER +++$+++ Yeah. He said he did jobs for him. Indirect stuff. Always five times more money than the job was worth.
L636398 +++$+++ u8723 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ FENSTER +++$+++ I don't know. Who was that guy that used to talk about Soze in New York?
L636397 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ This is not right.
L635984 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ I don't want to know.
L635983 +++$+++ u8723 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ FENSTER +++$+++ Fuck you. I'11 never shit right again. So who did it? Own up.
L635981 +++$+++ u8723 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ FENSTER +++$+++ I had a guy's fingers in my asshole tonight.
L635980 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ It was the Feds. A truck load of guns gets snagged, Customs comes down on N.Y.P.D. for some answers - they come up with us. They're grabbing at straws. It's politics - nothing you can do.
L635979 +++$+++ u8723 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ FENSTER +++$+++ So why the hell was I hauled in and cavity searched tonight?
L635978 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ How many times have you been in a line- up? It's always you and four dummies. The P.D. pays homeless guys ten bucks a head half the time. No way they'd line five felons in the same row. No way. And what the hell is a voice line-.up? A public defender could get you off of that.
L635977 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ This whole thing was a shakedown.
L635976 +++$+++ u8723 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ FENSTER +++$+++ Forget him. It's not important. I was trying to make a point.
L635975 +++$+++ u8725 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ KEATON +++$+++ Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet .
L635974 +++$+++ u8723 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ FENSTER +++$+++ I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus.
L636403 +++$+++ u8723 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ FENSTER +++$+++ The way I hear it, Soze is some kind of butcher. No pity.
L636402 +++$+++ u8724 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ HOCKNEY +++$+++ It's bullshit. This guy could be L.A.P.D. I think it's a setup.
L636396 +++$+++ u8724 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ HOCKNEY +++$+++ They fucking know everything.
L636395 +++$+++ u8723 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ FENSTER +++$+++ Everybody I ever worked with, did time with.
L636322 +++$+++ u8723 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ FENSTER +++$+++ RIGHT THERE. FREEZE.
L636321 +++$+++ u8724 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ HOCKNEY +++$+++ DON'T MOVE, YOU FUCKERS.
L636213 +++$+++ u8724 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ HOCKNEY +++$+++ We all go. How about it, Keaton?
L636212 +++$+++ u8723 +++$+++ m592 +++$+++ FENSTER +++$+++ Then who goes?
