L604326 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ A man can change his history.
L604325 +++$+++ u3238 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ OVERLORD +++$+++ She won't remember you.  None of them will.  You will be forgotten. That is how history works.
L604324 +++$+++ u3238 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ OVERLORD +++$+++ Yes.  Initiative and daring are not desirable traits in the Eloi.  But you should be happy for her.  She won't remember the creature she was.  She will... become.
L604323 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ You took her because she helped me.
L604322 +++$+++ u3238 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ OVERLORD +++$+++ When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool.  We're breeding them for submission.  Soon they will be fully domesticated.
L604321 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ So you take their best...
L604320 +++$+++ u3238 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ OVERLORD +++$+++ We have lost the capacity to reproduce.  But the species must continue.
L604319 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Why?
L604314 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ I could tell them.  Warm them of what's to come.
L604313 +++$+++ u3238 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ OVERLORD +++$+++ Alexander, yours is a world of brocade and velvet, not tooth and claw.  Why would you come back to this?  To save a few cattle?  No.
L604312 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Say I just come back again?
L604311 +++$+++ u3238 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ OVERLORD +++$+++ Because the past is immutable. Frozen.  Dead... And you are the past.
L604310 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Why would you let me go back?
L604309 +++$+++ u3238 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ OVERLORD +++$+++ Go back to where you came from.  Or die here.
L604308 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ What?
L604305 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ It can't all be like this...
L604304 +++$+++ u3238 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ OVERLORD +++$+++ And who are you, Alexander?  Who are you to question thousands of years of evolution?  This is the world now.  I am fact.
L604303 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ But this is barbaric!  Have you completely lost all sense of --
L604302 +++$+++ u3238 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ OVERLORD +++$+++ I'm afraid your indignation is lost here.  I have no more "human" response to the Eloi then you would have to a carrot.  It's just how we live now.
L604301 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ No... they didn't survive only to be your food.  You did that.
L604300 +++$+++ u3238 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ OVERLORD +++$+++ They survived above.  Became what they are.
L604299 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ And what of the Eloi?
L604298 +++$+++ u3238 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ OVERLORD +++$+++ As our bodies atrophied our minds... compensated.
L604297 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ How?
L604296 +++$+++ u3238 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ OVERLORD +++$+++ We make them see what we wish.
L604295 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ How do you control the Morlocks?
L604294 +++$+++ u3238 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ OVERLORD +++$+++ And centuries later when we tried to emerge into the sun again, we couldn't.  Our adaptation was too successful.  We survived... we endured... for this.
L604293 +++$+++ u3238 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ OVERLORD +++$+++ To work the machines and build the tunnels.  You can't imagine what it was like when it all started.  We survived for millennia, scraping the lichen and microscopic organisms from the rock with our teeth and digging for water with our nails.  Endlessly.  For generations.  And we... became.
L604292 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ As slaves.
L604291 +++$+++ u3238 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ OVERLORD +++$+++ You wouldn't understand.  We genetically engineered the Morlock class to serve our needs.
L604290 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Created?
L604289 +++$+++ u3238 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ OVERLORD +++$+++ No, we created the Morlocks.
L604288 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ You came underground when the world was ending above.  And you evolved. Some into the Morlocks and others --
L604287 +++$+++ u3238 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ OVERLORD +++$+++ Well, Alexander, as a fellow scientist I know you have a thousand questions --
L604286 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Alexander.
L604285 +++$+++ u3238 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ OVERLORD +++$+++ What's your name?
L603762 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ You have my word...  ... She's just a beauty.
L603761 +++$+++ u3236 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MOTORIST +++$+++ Next time then.  We perambulate here most every night.
L603760 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Ahhh... I'm afraid I've got a prior commitment.
L603759 +++$+++ u3236 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MOTORIST +++$+++ Well, much obliged -- I'm always forgetting the confounded brake -- say, if you wait until I get her up and running I'll give you a perambulation.  Tell you all about her.
L603758 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ I just love mechanical things.
L603757 +++$+++ u3236 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MOTORIST +++$+++ God -- could have killed me -- bad girl, Nell!  How did you know to do that?
L603756 +++$+++ u3236 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MOTORIST +++$+++ There's a cantilevered gasket on the --
L603755 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ How do you keep the water temperature stable?
L603754 +++$+++ u3236 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MOTORIST +++$+++ Now that's what I call plain crazy -- internal combustion is just too dangerous, all those little explosions, never catch on.
L603753 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ I've only read about them -- and the new internals.
L603752 +++$+++ u3236 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ MOTORIST +++$+++ Thanks.  Old Nell's my girl all right.  Al least when she decides to move, stubborn beast.
L603751 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ It's spectacular...
L603939 +++$+++ u3242 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ VOX KIOSK +++$+++ I was getting to that... The moon has reached the gravitational Roche Limit, 7,300 miles above the surface of the Earth.  This has created pressure on the lunar stratum beyond gravitational tolerances.  It might be helpful to know that the nearest public evacuation shelters can be found at Grand Central Station, Madison Square Garden --
L603938 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Why is it -- breaking up?
L603937 +++$+++ u3242 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ VOX KIOSK +++$+++ Well, considering it is, in fact, happening, I would assume it's possible.  The retrograde orbit began in 2005 when the demolitions for the lunar colonies --
L603936 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ No -- wait -- the moon's falling out of orbit -- that's not possible!
L603935 +++$+++ u3242 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ VOX KIOSK +++$+++ The 2005 terraforming demolitions for the lunar excavations sent the moon into a diminishing retrograde orbit resulting in global gravitational fluctuations, increased seismic activity and tidal anomalies.  Can I tell you more?
L603934 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ What's happening to the moon?!
L603933 +++$+++ u3242 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ VOX KIOSK +++$+++ I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk.  VOX registration NY-114.  May I help you?
L603932 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ I -- what are you?!
L603931 +++$+++ u3242 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ VOX KIOSK +++$+++ May I help you?
L603918 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ I have something for you...
L603917 +++$+++ u3232 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Let them.
L603916 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Let them.
L603915 +++$+++ u3232 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Alex... people are staring.
L603912 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ It's only a machine.
L603911 +++$+++ u3232 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Now I know you're ill -- passing up the chance to explore some new gadget.
L603910 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ I've seen it.
L603909 +++$+++ u3232 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Heavens, look at that now!
L603908 +++$+++ u3232 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ So it's astronomy now, is it?
L603907 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ The sailor's omen of good fortune. The hunter watching over him on his travels.
L603906 +++$+++ u3232 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ They are rare...  ... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth --
L603905 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Not like this.  Never like this. Emma, I swear to you -- if I've learned one thing, it's that moments like this are rare.  And I will thank God for them every moment of every day.
L603904 +++$+++ u3232 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ We took a walk three days ago.
L603903 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ No, I'm fine.  I'm...  ... wonderful.  Just walking down the street with you again.
L603902 +++$+++ u3232 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ You're so pale... I hope you're not coming down with something.
L603899 +++$+++ u3232 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Alex, it's just the zoo.
L603898 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ My God...
L603896 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ I want to get into the light, that's all.  Please...
L603895 +++$+++ u3232 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Why do we have to race for heaven's sake?!
L603894 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Shhh.  Let's just hurry on here. We don't have to talk, all right?
L603893 +++$+++ u3232 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Alex...?!
L603892 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Nothing -- let's just get out of the park.
L603891 +++$+++ u3232 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Alex, what is it?
L603890 +++$+++ u3232 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ All right...
L603889 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ No... let's walk through the city.
L603888 +++$+++ u3232 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Let's walk through the park...
L603887 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Not here... alone.  Please.
L603886 +++$+++ u3232 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ All right...
L603885 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ I need... to talk to you.
L603884 +++$+++ u3232 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Darling.
L603883 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Holding you... again.
L603882 +++$+++ u3232 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Alex, what is it?
L603881 +++$+++ u3232 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Trust me...
L603880 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ You know I can't.
L603879 +++$+++ u3232 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Dance with me...
L603878 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Got here as soon as I could.
L603877 +++$+++ u3232 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ You're late.
L603793 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Your birth stone.  I thought --
L603792 +++$+++ u3232 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ A moonstone.
L603791 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ I know it's not a diamond but --
L603790 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Hold on... I know I have it...
L603789 +++$+++ u3232 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ You know, the moment is rather dying here.
L603785 +++$+++ u3232 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ And what do you propose, Professor? Shall we hold a seminar to study the problem?
L603784 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Oh dammit, I love you!  I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't think, all I do is moon over you and -- hum, apparently.
L603783 +++$+++ u3232 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ You're getting warmer.
L603782 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ I mean... well... affection.
L603781 +++$+++ u3232 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Admiration?  My my.
L603780 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Emma, you know I have great... admiration for you.
L603779 +++$+++ u3232 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ All right, what is it now?
L603778 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ What?  Yes -- Orion -- good fortune -- sailors.
L603777 +++$+++ u3232 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ ... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth.  You see it over the rocks there?  Sailors consider that an omen of good fortune; the hunter watching over them on their travels... Are you listening to me, Alex?
L603775 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Not here... alone.  May we? Please?
L603774 +++$+++ u3232 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Talk away, Professor.
L603773 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ I need to... um... talk to you.
L603772 +++$+++ u3232 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Well there's something new.
L603771 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Sorry... I was distracted.
L603770 +++$+++ u3232 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ You promised me flowers tonight, don't you even remember?
L603769 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ What?
L603768 +++$+++ u3232 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ You promised me flowers.
L603767 +++$+++ u3232 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Trust me...
L603766 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ You know I can't.
L603765 +++$+++ u3232 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Dance with me...
L603764 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Got here as soon as I could.
L603763 +++$+++ u3232 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ You're late.
L604388 +++$+++ u3239 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ PHILBY +++$+++ His home.
L604387 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ This... was my home.
L604384 +++$+++ u3239 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ PHILBY +++$+++ I'm glad.
L604383 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ And this would be my study.  There was an elm tree outside the window then.
L603874 +++$+++ u3239 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ PHILBY +++$+++ Good night, Alex.
L603873 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Good night, David.
L603872 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ In a week... we will never have had this conversation.
L603871 +++$+++ u3239 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ PHILBY +++$+++ All right.  I'll come for dinner. And in the meantime... you'll think about what we discussed?
L603870 +++$+++ u3239 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ PHILBY +++$+++ I pray to God that in a week you're not here.
L603869 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ You won't say that in a week.
L603868 +++$+++ u3239 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ PHILBY +++$+++ You're dying here.  Don't you see that?!
L603867 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ That's absurd --
L603866 +++$+++ u3239 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ PHILBY +++$+++ There are trains leaving Grand Central every then minutes.  A dozen liners leaving the harbor. Get on one of them.  Go to Singapore, Scotland, Manchuria, anywhere, just away from here --
L603865 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ I can't leave when I'm so close.
L603864 +++$+++ u3239 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ PHILBY +++$+++ When's the last time you were outside this house --  -- or this room?
L603863 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ I can't do that --
L603862 +++$+++ u3239 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ PHILBY +++$+++ Why don't you come to our house instead?
L603861 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ I'll tell you what... come by for dinner in a week and I'll show you.
L603860 +++$+++ u3239 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ PHILBY +++$+++ I would.
L603859 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ You wouldn't believe me.
L603858 +++$+++ u3239 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ PHILBY +++$+++ What is it?
L603857 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ David... I appreciate your concern, I do.  But I ask you to have faith in me.  Just for a little while longer.  I'm working on something now.  Something... extraordinary.
L603856 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ That's where you're wrong.  I will change it.
L603855 +++$+++ u3239 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ PHILBY +++$+++ Alex, nothing will ever change what happened, but --
L603854 +++$+++ u3239 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ PHILBY +++$+++ Do you find her?
L603853 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Wasn't it?... I have a dream almost every night now.  The Lady and the Tiger, you remember that story?  In the dream I'm alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors. Behind every door, save one, is a tiger.  I have to make the decision.  Which door conceals Emma?  And I just stand there... looking at the doors...
L603852 +++$+++ u3239 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ PHILBY +++$+++ It wasn't your fault, Alex.
L603851 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ You don't know that.  You couldn't possibly.  If I'd only done this, or that, if I'd arrived ten minutes earlier, or later.  If we'd taken a different path or I hadn't fought the man for the ring.  You have no idea what it is to relive every moment of that night -- consider every action you made -- and every one of them wrong.
L603850 +++$+++ u3239 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ PHILBY +++$+++ I know that --
L603849 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ I live with it every minute of every day.
L603848 +++$+++ u3239 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ PHILBY +++$+++ What happened to Emma will never go away.  It's part of you now and it always will be.  But you have to learn to live with it...
L603846 +++$+++ u3239 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ PHILBY +++$+++ I care more about my life.  And yours.
L603845 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ That's because I'm working.  You remember that?  You used to care about your work.
L603844 +++$+++ u3239 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ PHILBY +++$+++ You know that's what it is.  Mrs. Watchit tells me you're here at all hours -- day and night --
L603843 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Hiding?
L603842 +++$+++ u3239 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ PHILBY +++$+++ But you won't listen.  You won't see me, you won't see anyone.  What would you like me to tell Jamie? That Uncle Alex is busy?  That Uncle Alex is hiding up there in his laboratory --
L603841 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ You care for me.  And you're concerned.  And I have to start living my life again.  I hear it from Mrs. Watchit every day.
L603840 +++$+++ u3239 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ PHILBY +++$+++ There are some things I need to say to you.  You may not like hearing them, but I don't know if I'll ever get another chance --
L603839 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ For God's Sake, David --
L603838 +++$+++ u3239 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ PHILBY +++$+++ It's my Jamie's birthday today. Your godson.  He's nine years old. At his party he asked me if Uncle Alex was coming.  I told him no. Then he asked me if you didn't like him anymore.
L603837 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Then why are you here?
L603836 +++$+++ u3239 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ PHILBY +++$+++ It hurt me, Alex.  Very much.
L603835 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ I'm sorry, David.
L603834 +++$+++ u3239 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ PHILBY +++$+++ I came by the house every day after the funeral.  And then every week. Then every other month.  Then I stopped coming.  Did you even notice?
L603833 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ I've been working.
L603739 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Perseverance.
L603738 +++$+++ u3239 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ PHILBY +++$+++ All these clocks -- how can you constantly be running late?!
L603735 +++$+++ u3239 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ PHILBY +++$+++ She's gotten into your equations.
L603734 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Oh?
L603733 +++$+++ u3239 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ PHILBY +++$+++ Alex, really... good luck tonight. She's a fine girl, and she's done wonderful things for you.
L603732 +++$+++ u3239 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ PHILBY +++$+++ No, I'm all bowler hat, remember?
L603731 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
L603730 +++$+++ u3239 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ PHILBY +++$+++ She made the best Shepherd's pie I ever tasted.
L603729 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ That's how I knew we were destined to be together.  When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk.  They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled.  At that moment -- I just knew.  How did you know with Molly?
L603728 +++$+++ u3239 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ PHILBY +++$+++ The most able inventor I know and you can't tie a simple four-in- hand.
L603727 +++$+++ u3239 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ PHILBY +++$+++ How romantic...
L603726 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Emma actually likes chalk dust -- says it smells like me.
L603715 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Nothing.
L603714 +++$+++ u3239 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ PHILBY +++$+++ What?
L603713 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ In the future, we'll be better.
L603711 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ But shouldn't it be better? Shouldn't we be teaching our students to imagine a world beyond all this?
L603710 +++$+++ u3239 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ PHILBY +++$+++ You may not like it, but this is the world we live in, Alex.  Little grey men with little grey hats.
L603709 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ I don't.  I want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see.
L603708 +++$+++ u3239 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ PHILBY +++$+++ I want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.
L603707 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Look at them, Philby, all alike, everyone in an identical bowler hat.  Do you want your students to turn out like them?
L603706 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ You sound like my father...
L603705 +++$+++ u3239 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ PHILBY +++$+++ Alex, this is your first year as an associate professor.  You might want to play things a little more conservatively.
L603704 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Where's the challenge in that?
L603703 +++$+++ u3239 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ PHILBY +++$+++ You know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers.
L603702 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ ... One day he'll be discovered by some future archeologists and they won't know what to make of him. The thick brow, so lacking in imagination.  The dim little eyes, devoid of curiosity.
L603662 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ God, and I'm running late --
L603661 +++$+++ u3239 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ PHILBY +++$+++ Tonight's the night?
L603660 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
L603659 +++$+++ u3239 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ PHILBY +++$+++ Somewhere around "D+2xy something something."
L603658 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ I was not.
L603657 +++$+++ u3239 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ PHILBY +++$+++ Do you know you were humming?
L603656 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ ... The point is I know it will work once the, um, numbers and such are in order.
L603805 +++$+++ u3230 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ ALEXANDER +++$+++ All right, all right -- here -- everything --
L603804 +++$+++ u3240 +++$+++ m214 +++$+++ THIN MAN +++$+++ Did you hear me, lad?
