L597379 +++$+++ u8312 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ THE ITALIAN +++$+++ Two stiffs and a missing kid followed your visit to one of the London hotels. He didn’t need your confession...
L597378 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ What sums?
L597377 +++$+++ u8312 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ THE ITALIAN +++$+++ Some guy called to let him know the Frenchman who’d called the night before he left London was in L.A. looking to kill him. He did his sums and decided to take the call seriously.
L597376 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Not even scum like Friedman would go to the trouble of killing a stranger on the strength of one anonymous call.
L597375 +++$+++ u8312 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ THE ITALIAN +++$+++ I can only tell you what he told us...
L597374 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Try again, and this time be polite.
L597373 +++$+++ u8312 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ THE ITALIAN +++$+++ That’s the beauty. An anonymous call. Makes you wonder how many people know what you’re up to, eh, French-fuck?
L597372 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ So you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room... How did Friedman say he got to know where to find me?
L597371 +++$+++ u8312 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ THE ITALIAN +++$+++ Huh. Maybe he figured the news our London bureau got a visit from a hitman on behalf of a pissed off client wouldn’t go down too well. He only shared his guilty secret last night. And then only ‘cause he was so fucking edgy after calling his hotel we persuaded him to talk.
L597370 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ I think you’d rather not know what I think.
L597369 +++$+++ u8312 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ THE ITALIAN +++$+++ What do you think, huh?
L597368 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ So why didn’t he?
L597367 +++$+++ u8312 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ THE ITALIAN +++$+++ If he had, you’d be dead.
L597366 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Are you telling me Friedman didn’t tell you I was here looking for him?
L597365 +++$+++ u8312 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ THE ITALIAN +++$+++ That’s just it. The sonofabitch didn’t ask for help from his colleagues...  Testa di cazzo! Hiring some amateur outsiders to fix you... He hasn’t gone to hell too soon... And neither will you, Mr Lamont!
L597364 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Nice way to help a colleague in trouble.
L597363 +++$+++ u8312 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ THE ITALIAN +++$+++ Huh! You turned him into a liability, didn’t you know?
L597362 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Why did you kill him?
L597361 +++$+++ u8312 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ THE ITALIAN +++$+++ Let me give you a tip, asshole - no one pulls stunts like what you pulled in London and here tonight and hopes to get away with it. It upsets people. It’s wrong. Fucking wrong.
L597360 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Why did you kill Friedman?
L597358 +++$+++ u8312 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ THE ITALIAN +++$+++ Huh! You’ve been around, eh?
L597357 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ The acid bath?
L597356 +++$+++ u8312 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ THE ITALIAN +++$+++ You’re the lantern man, huh?  If you wanna see what’s left of him...
L597355 +++$+++ u8312 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ THE ITALIAN +++$+++ Gluck’s dead, you sonofabitch!
L597354 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Three...
L597353 +++$+++ u8312 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ THE ITALIAN +++$+++ Fuck...
L597352 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Five seconds. Then you die.
L597351 +++$+++ u8312 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ THE ITALIAN +++$+++ Figlio di puttana. You’re the French asshole who bumped off the London guys...
L597350 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Gluck.
L597349 +++$+++ u8312 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ THE ITALIAN +++$+++ Who?  I don’t know who the fuck you’re talking about, sunshine.
L597348 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Okay, shitbag. I’m only going to ask you this once. Where is Friedman?
L596862 +++$+++ u8305 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ MOREAU +++$+++ It’s a good guess...
L596861 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Mossad?
L596860 +++$+++ u8305 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ MOREAU +++$+++ Their last suspected kill occurred two years back, though your Spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the group. Still, I’d watch my step. These people are well-connected, Laurent; former Israeli prime minister, etc. The lady’s also president of an international Zionist organisation... Anyway, you get the picture.
L596859 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Are they still operative?
L596858 +++$+++ u8305 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ MOREAU +++$+++ It appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady German group of Nazi hunters known as “Never Forget”. Over the years we’re talking about a dozen or so execution-type killings.
L596857 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ They lost their son. Why?
L596856 +++$+++ u8305 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ MOREAU +++$+++ Salut, Laurent. Ouais. It wasn’t easy but I got what you wanted through Interpol. Say, what’s your business with these Spitzes?
L596855 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Moreau? C’est moi. Alors...
L597331 +++$+++ u8302 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ MAN WITH ITALIAN ACCENT +++$+++ Sure. But speak English, will ya, ha ha...
L597330 +++$+++ u8301 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ MAN ON DAIS +++$+++ Very funny. Can I go on now?
L597329 +++$+++ u8302 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ MAN WITH ITALIAN ACCENT +++$+++ I don’t know. Could be the sound of jewellery hitting a parquet floor, huh?
L597328 +++$+++ u8301 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ MAN ON DAIS +++$+++ What do you think?
L597327 +++$+++ u8302 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ MAN WITH ITALIAN ACCENT +++$+++ What’s that? A word?
L597326 +++$+++ u8301 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ MAN ON DAIS +++$+++ Costliest!
L597325 +++$+++ u8302 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ MAN WITH ITALIAN ACCENT +++$+++ Cost what?
L597324 +++$+++ u8301 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ MAN ON DAIS +++$+++ Ha ha... Yes. With prices reaching an all time low, the name of the game has become ‘have-it- where-it’s-at’... As we all know, transportation has always been the costliest and trickiest part of this business...
L598449 +++$+++ u8322 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Tremoille... don't.  Please...
L598448 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ What do you fear most now... my sword?  ... or his hands?
L598444 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ No.  I see the hand of Tremoille, and Regnault, and Yolande, and you... and they are dirty hands.
L598443 +++$+++ u8322 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Jean... me dear, loyal Jean... why do you want to oppose the will of God?  Jeanne wanted to go to Compiegne -- we let her -- she got caught.  Then, on my personal orders, Regnault proposed 30,000 crowns for her ransom, and once again the answer was no.  And now you say she tried to escape, and the answer is still no.  Jean, open your eyes -- can't you see the hand of God in all this?
L598442 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ But not impossible... Gilles and La Hire are ready to risk everything to save her...
L598441 +++$+++ u8322 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Jean, it's... it's not so easy...
L598440 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ We have to do something before she tries it again!  I beg of you, my lord, don't let her down... let me organize an escape...
L598439 +++$+++ u8322 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ It's a miracle she's not dead!
L598438 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ Jeanne's been badly injured!  She jumped from the top of a tower into a frozen moat!
L598437 +++$+++ u8322 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ My dear Aulon...  That's fine...
L598381 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ 10,000 gold crowns.
L598380 +++$+++ u8322 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Very generous of you all.  How much?
L598379 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ Here... to help pay Jeanne's ransom. All the Captains gave what they could, as well as the citizens of Orleans and the other towns she saved...
L597838 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ Yes, my lord.
L597837 +++$+++ u8322 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Jeanne, this is -- in fact -- my loyal friend and finest archer, Jean d'Aulon.  Jean... I place her in your care.  Find her suitable lodgings -- here -- in the castle... and guard her with your life.
L597801 +++$+++ u8322 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ So... pretend it's not a game.
L597800 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ Sire, you know how bad I am at this sort of game.
L597798 +++$+++ u8322 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Good.  Until then, feel free to live like a king!
L597797 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ Of course I am, it's just that...
L597796 +++$+++ u8322 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Why, are you not ready to die for your king?
L597795 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ Majesty, I can't...
L597794 +++$+++ u8322 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ My dear Aulon, to you it shall befall the honor of impersonating the royal blood!
L597793 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ My lord, I'm not sure that...
L597792 +++$+++ u8322 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Why not you -- Jean d'Aulon?  The only man who's poorer than I am, and so the only man I can trust. Dignified, honorable, wise... what more could we ask of a king?
L597783 +++$+++ u8322 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ ... if she can find me? -- That's a brilliant idea!  If she's really been sent by God she'll discover the trap, and if she's an assassin she'll kill the wrong man!  Bring her up!
L597782 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ Let someone else pretend to be you, and see if...
L597781 +++$+++ u8322 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ What do you mean?
L597780 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ That's a good idea, sire.
L597779 +++$+++ u8322 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Oh dear, why is life so complicated? Sometimes I really wish I could be someone else.
L598827 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ Jeanne, you can't leave us like this!
L598826 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ I'm not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me...
L598825 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ No, you must come, Jeanne -- we need you -- so much has happened since you left... I have a new horse now, a white one, just like yours... and La Hire hardly swears at all anymore...  You can't stay -- they'll burn you!
L598824 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ I'm staying, Jean.
L598823 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ ... and maybe the king will give you some money, and a little land, and a title even...  ... wouldn't that be a fine thing? You, a lady of title!
L598822 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ You don't know what you're saying. You're going to leave this place, Jeanne -- you're going home -- or whatever you want -- you're going to be happy, and have children, and...
L598821 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ One day you will.
L598820 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ I -- I don't understand...
L598819 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ My gentle Captain... I'm staying.
L598818 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ Yes yes... any moment... you're always so impatient...
L598817 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ I'm already free...
L598816 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ Just give me a moment and then you'll be free...
L598815 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ I am ready now...
L598347 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ That's an order!
L598346 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ I want to stay with you...
L598345 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ Do as I say!
L598344 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ But... why... what's the point?
L598343 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ Get back inside the town and see if the English are attacking from the other side!
L598341 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ Not yet!
L598340 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ We must sound the retreat!
L598339 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ It would not be the same without you.
L598338 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ Will you at least let me stay with you?
L598337 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ If God wants me to win, he will find a way.  And if he wants me to die... if he wants me back... then that's fine too.  Then I'll be with him forever.
L598336 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ To be killed in battle?
L598335 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ But it is what I want.
L598334 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for Jeanne?
L598333 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ I would like to marry you.  But I have already promised myself... to God.
L598332 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ Jeanne... I believe in you -- but can you believe in me for once? Don't go... even if you don't want to marry me.
L598331 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ Jeanne... I have been hearing voices -- and believe me, those voices left me in no doubt that you must not go to Compiegne!
L598330 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ I will ask my voices... if they come back one day.  Meanwhile... I'm going to Compiegne.
L598329 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ To marry you.
L598328 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ Did you come back to marry me or to insult me?
L598327 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ Or maybe it's Jeanne who's in a trap -- her own trap -- a downward spiral that she can't stop?
L598326 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ No, but...
L598325 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ Did your voices tell you that?  You told me you hadn't heard them for months...
L598324 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ It's a trap!  They're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from England!
L598323 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ He said that... he's making a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy and...
L598322 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ What did the king say?
L598321 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ You listen to your voices, I listen to my heart.
L598320 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ That's not what I asked... Why do you want to marry me?
L598302 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ Tell the king to give me more men.
L598301 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ Tell me...
L598300 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ If you really want to help me, there's one thing you can do.
L598298 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ Jeanne... I believe in you... more than anyone...
L598297 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ So... even you don't believe in me anymore...
L598296 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ Me?!  It's not me, it's God who makes everything complicated!  If he's all-powerful, why not let the English stay on their island in the first place?  And why let this war go on for a hundred years?  And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family?  Why, why?!
L598295 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.
L598294 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ You make it sound so simple...
L598293 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ I don't know it.  I feel it.
L598292 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
L598291 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
L598290 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ But I hear so many voices... one voice saying one thing, another voice saying the opposite -- love your enemy, kill your enemy -- what is good, what is evil...?
L598289 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ Well of course they're me!  That's how God talks to me.  If you listen hard enough, even you can hear him. Everyone can hear him.
L598288 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ But how do you know that these -- these voices aren't really just -- well, you.
L598287 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ It's not time yet.  My mission is not over yet.  There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.
L598286 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe it's a sign to go home?
L598285 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ It's been weeks since they spoke to me.  Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...
L598284 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ What... what do you mean?
L598283 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ They've abandoned me... like everyone.
L598281 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ So... what am I supposed to do now?
L598280 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ Jeanne... the king has ordered us not to ride with you anymore.
L598242 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ Because there's an arrow in your leg.
L598241 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ Yes.  Yes, I'm fine...  We need more brushwood!  Why are you staring at me like that?
L598240 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ Jeanne...!  Are you alright?
L598193 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ Jeanne, no...
L598192 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ I'll go.
L598149 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ It's over, Jeanne.  We won, just as you said!
L598148 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ Yes...
L598147 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ Jeanne, calm down, do you hear me? Are you alright?
L598114 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ Come with me...
L598113 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ Well...
L598112 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ The king said you're his finest archer...?
L598071 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ I promise...
L598070 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ Alright... I promise to rest if you promise... to go back to the battle.
L598062 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ No, it's... it's nothing, it's...
L598061 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...
L598060 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ Not so... easily.  Why aren't you... fighting...?  go on... we're almost there...
L598016 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ They've started the battle without me!
L598015 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ What's going on?!
L598012 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ But... to be honest... I don't think they'll leave tomorrow.
L598011 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ Good.
L598010 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ Uh... they said... they will think about it.
L598009 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ What did they say?
L597997 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ Alright, whatever -- but since He's not going to come down and cut it himself, at least let someone cut it properly!
L597996 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ How dare you tell me what God tells me to do!
L597995 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ He didn't tell you to cut all your hair off...!
L597994 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ How dare you stop me doing God's will!
L597993 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ Jeanne, stop it!
L597961 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ There's nothing to hear -- I haven't done anything.  And why haven't I done anything?  Because none of you will listen to me!!
L597960 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ Jeanne, calm down.  You can't blame the people -- they've been hearing all about you for weeks.
L597959 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ Who do they think I am?!
L597869 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ The King of England.  I want to give them the chance to leave Orleans in peace before I get there.
L597868 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ Yes, I am.  I'm an archer who can read and write.  Who do you want to write to?
L597867 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ I thought you were an archer?
L597866 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ This I can do.  I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.
L597865 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ I also need someone who can read and write.
L597864 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ Well... uh -- this might take a little time -- but let me see what I can do.
L597863 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ Better today than tomorrow.
L597862 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ Now?
L597861 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ I shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner.
L597860 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ Right.  Raymond... a priest.
L597859 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ Yes.  I didn't confess today.
L597858 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ Now?
L597857 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ And I would like to see a priest.
L597856 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ Louis... water and fresh straw!
L597855 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ I would like some fresh straw.
L597853 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ Do you think I could have some water?
L597852 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ Listen, please accept my apologies for... you know, me pretending to be the... well it wasn't really my idea... well, yes it was my idea but...
L598082 +++$+++ u8325 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ DUNOIS +++$+++ I'm fed up with taking her orders. She swore she'd defeat the English before nightfall, instead of which she goes and plays the fool and gets herself nearly killed!  Look at the mess we're in!  That's her mess, not mine...!  We're worse off then if she'd never come at all!  ... now do as I say and Sound the Retreat!
L598081 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ But that was her order!
L598080 +++$+++ u8325 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ DUNOIS +++$+++ I made no such promise.  Sound the retreat for the night!
L598079 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!
L598078 +++$+++ u8325 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ DUNOIS +++$+++ Sound the retreat...
L598077 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ We have to press home the attack!
L598076 +++$+++ u8325 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ DUNOIS +++$+++ Good.
L598075 +++$+++ u8315 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ AULON +++$+++ Jeanne's alive!
L598666 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ No, I... I never killed anyone!
L598665 +++$+++ u8316 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ BEAUPERE +++$+++ ... so you were in the middle of the battlefield, with your sword in your hand, waving it above your head... charging against the enemy, screaming and yelling... fighting for your life... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone?
L598664 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ Yes, maybe... I don't remember...
L598663 +++$+++ u8316 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ BEAUPERE +++$+++ You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?
L598662 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ No, I... I held it up to...
L598661 +++$+++ u8316 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ BEAUPERE +++$+++ Did you use the sword that you held in your hand?
L598660 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ Yes, but...
L598659 +++$+++ u8316 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ BEAUPERE +++$+++ So sometimes you were carrying just your sword?
