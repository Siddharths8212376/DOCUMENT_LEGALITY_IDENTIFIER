L550909 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Rams... that's football, right?
L550908 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Guy named Wade Beemer.  Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 and '97.
L550907 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Who's the new side of beef in Tran's posse?
L550905 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Sure, Lenny.  The only thing worse than a junkie is someone in love.
L550904 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Begging?  Groveling?  Any pathetic behavior at all?  Will that help? Faith's there tonight, and I've got to talk to her.
L550903 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Jesus, Lenny.
L550902 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish? It's on your way.
L550901 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Yeah.  I don't see a way out of it.
L550900 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ You still like me, don't you?  We're still buddies?
L550899 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Look, I gotta get some sleep.
L550898 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace.  Really.
L550897 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life.  You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next.  And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it.  Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer.
L550896 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Macey... I've never seen you like this.
L550895 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ No, you're just trying to get off.
L550894 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ So am I.  Just trying to get by.
L550893 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ No, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another.  You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act.  Well I'm out.  I got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex- husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support... I'm just trying to hold on here.
L550892 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I thought we were friends.
L550891 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Okay, you got my attention, but this is cutting off the circulation to my head, here.  D'you mind?
L550890 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
L550889 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ That would be no.
L550887 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Get it.
L550886 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I need my case.  It's still in the back.
L550884 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ In LA?  Are you crazy?
L550883 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ I've had enough of this shit.  You're on foot, Lenny.
L550882 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Hey, careful on the jacket.  This is Armani.  You angry?
L550876 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Let's talk in the car.
L550875 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Are we having a bad night?
L550864 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ You will not live to see the morning.
L550863 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Coming with you.
L550862 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ What the fuck are you doing?
L550860 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Mr. Fumitsu, good evening sir, Leonard Nero, Security Express. Lornette Mason here is just completing our routine driver evaluation.  We do it to make sure that out VIP clients, such as yourself, are always treated as honored guests.  I just need to ride up front and take some notes, if you don't mind.
L550859 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Fumitsu.
L550858 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ What's his name?
L550856 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Define love.
L550855 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Yeah, but that was for love.
L550854 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Me bailing your sorry pale ass out of jail twice in the last six months.
L550853 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Define illegal.
L550852 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Lenny, this shit's illegal.
L550851 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime, it's what we are.  But now the risks are outa line.  The streets are a war zone.  And sex can kill you.  So you slip on the trodes, you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks.
L550850 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Price he pays for being a scumsucking pig.
L550849 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Okay, take some executive... bored with his life, bored with his wife... he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar.  Then he goes around for months, torn up worrying that he's got AIDS, that he'll infect his wife.  And maybe he really does catch something--
L550848 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Uh huh, I wanna hear this part.
L550847 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Way I look at it, I actually perform a humanitarian service.  I save lives.
L550846 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.
L550845 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
L550844 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ So, what's up with you?  Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?
L550843 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Driving Mr. Lenny.
L550842 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Mace!  You're a life-saver.
L550841 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Jeez, you're pathetic.  Okay, I got a pickup at the St. James.  I'll take you there, you can get a cab.
L550840 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Lenny, this may be a hard concept for you, but friends don't have to pay their friends.
L550839 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Mace, you're my friend.  I need you. Plus I'll give you 25% of what I make tonight.
L550838 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Excuse me.  What part of NO don't you understand?
L550837 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Just a couple of hours.  It'll be fun--
L550836 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Sleaze to peddle.
L550835 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Come on, Mace.  This is gonna be a big night.  Can't you feel it?  The energy in the air?  There's money to be made, dreams to sell.
L550834 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've already pulled twelve hours today.
L550833 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Thanks for giving me a ride.  I just have a few stops, mostly on the west side--
L550820 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ They jerked my wheels, d'you believe it?  I mean it's outrageous, the computer errors the banks are making lately.  Have you noticed?
L550819 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Greetings, gents.  So let's hear this week's sad story.
L551195 +++$+++ u3063 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ ZANDER +++$+++ Aw, Mom!
L551194 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey. We're going to watch fireworks from there.  Let's go.  Chop chop.
L551110 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Well give me some then... I'm starving.
L551109 +++$+++ u3063 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ ZANDER +++$+++ Cheerios and wieners.  I made it myself.  It's good.
L551108 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ What is that?
L551107 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Are you going to make me beg?
L551106 +++$+++ u3063 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ ZANDER +++$+++ Right.  That explains it.
L551105 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Just Lenny.
L551104 +++$+++ u3063 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ ZANDER +++$+++ Where were you Mom?  Did you meet a guy?
L551276 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You really want that on your head?
L551275 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!
L551274 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Fine.  Do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains?  The gangbangers'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground.  And when the fires start the street cops'll be capping off at anything that moves.  It'll be all- out war and you know it.
L551273 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ So you're saying we just pretend is didn't happen?  It happened!  The LAPD executed one of the most important black men in America!  Who the fuck are you to bury this?!
L551257 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ There's more to this whole thing than you think.
L551256 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ This seems a little sophisticated for them.  These are not subtle guys.
L551255 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Those two psycho cops are on a slash-and-burn to find the tape and cover their tracks.
L551037 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Take the tape to the cops.
L551036 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.
L551033 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Maybe he just figures Lenny will appreciate what he's created.  It's the dark end of the street, Lenny. How do you like it now?
L551032 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ He's skull-fucking you, bud.  Trying to get a reaction.  Maybe pushing you to do something.
L550830 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Sssssh!  Not in front of Lenny.  You may trigger a maudlin display which will force us to tranquilize him.
L550829 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ But I mean isn't he Faith's new-- 
L550828 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Yup.  He was Jeriko's manager.  Bummer, Tran!  Lost your golden goose.  Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
L550827 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ Hey, isn't that Tran Vo?
L550822 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Sucks.  Hey, Bobby, turn that up.
L550821 +++$+++ u3058 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MACE +++$+++ No.  I haven't noticed because I make my payments.  So, Max Pelcher, how's the P.I. business?
L562603 +++$+++ u3064 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ The bearded guy, the creep. Oh, one other thing. Testa, if that's his name, he kept mentioning my feet. Said I had very pretty feet.
L562602 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Testa?
L562601 +++$+++ u3064 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ To be honest, when I'm working, I don't look at faces much. He knew the guy's name.
L562600 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Besides that.
L562599 +++$+++ u3064 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ Um... he was older.
L562598 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Was this him?
L562506 +++$+++ u3065 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ DAITZ +++$+++ Of course. He knows everything about Dick Low.
L562505 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Does Koessler know about the Suspect Zero theory?
L562502 +++$+++ u3065 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ DAITZ +++$+++ You got that right. Low became obsessed with the Green River murders, the case had been inactive for ten years at that point. He argued the Green River Killer had actually become Suspect Zero, this master murderer who killed without pattern, killed literally hundreds of victims -- male, female, old, young, straight, gay -- and who was still killing, even though there were no bodies. It went against everything we knew. Low became increasingly paranoid. Every suspect was potentially Suspect Zero. Anybody tried to talk sense into him, he'd accuse them of being out to get him. Deputy Director Koessler was "out to get him." The decision was made to relieve him.
L562501 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Pacific Northwest is a hotbed for serials.
L562500 +++$+++ u3065 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ DAITZ +++$+++ ...well, there was some friction: I wanted to write up my work, educate the public, but Koessler wouldn't allow it. Low felt Koessler was more interested in career advancement than catching killers. Koessler had Low reassigned to the Pacific Northwest, Seattle. You know when they say, stick it where the sun don't shine? That's where they stuck Dick Low.
L562499 +++$+++ u3065 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ DAITZ +++$+++ Before your time. It was Richard Low's brainchild, or, lack-of-brain child. The Behavioral Sciences Unit at Quantico is essentially the product of three men: David Koessler, Dick Low and myself. Low was a field agent, Koessler administrative, I was teaching criminology. Low came up with the concept of a serial killer's signature. He invented profiling. Everything we know about profiling started with Richard Low...
L562498 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ No.
L562497 +++$+++ u3065 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ DAITZ +++$+++ Zorro. Yes, ran it through my files, even asked around: came up completely blank. Thought there might be a Mexico connection, El Paso and all, but nothing. Fooled around with the letter "Z," turned it on it's side, got "N" -- there Ng, he's Vietnamese. The only thing that came to mind was zero, not Zorro. Remember Suspect Zero?
L562496 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Have you had a chance to think about --
L562262 +++$+++ u3077 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ SALINAS +++$+++ The diner?
L562261 +++$+++ u3066 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ DUNCAN +++$+++ No, sir.
L562260 +++$+++ u3077 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ SALINAS +++$+++ Anybody talk to the press?
L562259 +++$+++ u3066 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ DUNCAN +++$+++ Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
L562258 +++$+++ u3077 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ SALINAS +++$+++ Agents Duncan, Mackelway.  Anything new?
L562221 +++$+++ u3066 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ DUNCAN +++$+++ I'm babysitting the DEA guys this afternoon, Casio and I. You said that was top priority.
L562220 +++$+++ u3077 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ SALINAS +++$+++ Agent Duncan, there's an interstate issue up on 54, run out there.
L562200 +++$+++ u3066 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ DUNCAN +++$+++ Yeah.
L562199 +++$+++ u3077 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ SALINAS +++$+++ Takes four days to chill, then its time to come back.  Is that...?
L562198 +++$+++ u3066 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ DUNCAN +++$+++ Welcome back, sir. How was the vacation?
L562812 +++$+++ u3067 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ DYLAN +++$+++ Winona.
L562811 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota?
L562810 +++$+++ u3067 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ DYLAN +++$+++ She's buried.
L562809 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ You have the body?
L562808 +++$+++ u3067 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ DYLAN +++$+++ Her body turned up. In a Minnesota cemetery. They brought her back.
L562807 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ What?
L562806 +++$+++ u3067 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ DYLAN +++$+++ You heard?
L562805 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter case.
L562804 +++$+++ u3067 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ DYLAN +++$+++ Hi there.
L562803 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
L562802 +++$+++ u3067 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ DYLAN +++$+++ Dylan here.
L562389 +++$+++ u3067 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ DYLAN +++$+++ Got a sister like this, what they call it, anal? That's her.
L562388 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Tape it off, we'll want to fine-tooth- comb it. My guess is that the UNSUB is having us on. He checks in, pays, picks up the key, but never walks inside. Tell me if I'm wrong.
L562387 +++$+++ u3067 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ DYLAN +++$+++ Show's over, boys. Nobody home.
L562385 +++$+++ u3067 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ DYLAN +++$+++ And it's getting dark. I'm not going to run this into the night.  Eddie, we're walking in. Everything covered?
L562384 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ The room key's in the car. On the seat.
L562382 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Let's take a look.
L562381 +++$+++ u3067 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ DYLAN +++$+++ I sent a female in. The room in question was rented by an Anglo, cash; since then, nothing -- no activity, no phone response.
L562380 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ What does the Manager say?
L562379 +++$+++ u3067 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ DYLAN +++$+++ Down the road a piece is the Golden Sunset, the no-tell motel, Socorro's contribution to international relations. The car's just sitting there, no activity. I've had a couple Hispanic officers casing it all day. Want to take a look?
L562378 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Hey, Sheriff.
L562377 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ I'm on my way.
L562376 +++$+++ u3067 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ DYLAN +++$+++ No bad news. You know the Be On the LookOut you asked me to send on the diner car -- we got a hit on it. A little town on the border, Socorro. We got it staked out -- you interested?
L562375 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ You tell me.
L562374 +++$+++ u3067 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ DYLAN +++$+++ What's the bad news?
L562373 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Oh Jesus, Sheriff, I am sorry. I meant to call you -- I got distracted -- the Sumpter girl was not one of Speck's victims. That's the good news.
L562372 +++$+++ u3067 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ DYLAN +++$+++ Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan.
L562371 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Agent Mackelway.
L562296 +++$+++ u3067 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ DYLAN +++$+++ I just assumed she ran away. Happens a lot around here. Look around. This place is an invitation to run away.
L562295 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ This isn't in our database?
L562294 +++$+++ u3067 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ DYLAN +++$+++ Who knows.
L562293 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ You're thinking...?
L562292 +++$+++ u3067 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ DYLAN +++$+++ Her name is Karen Sumpter, from near Dell City. Just disappeared a couple weeks back. Vanished.
L562291 +++$+++ u3067 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ DYLAN +++$+++ I know how the Feds like to sit on information. I got something in the car to show you.
L562290 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ I'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself.
L562289 +++$+++ u3067 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ DYLAN +++$+++ Nine bodies in Roswell, now this -- it's getting a little hairy, huh?
L562280 +++$+++ u3067 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ DYLAN +++$+++ That's right, Jan.
L562279 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ I hope that wasn't a joke because I can assure you, from personal experience, the FBI does not have a sense of humor.
L562243 +++$+++ u3067 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ DYLAN +++$+++ Ten miles back on the Texas side.
L562242 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Where's the Nuevo American Diner?
L562230 +++$+++ u3067 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ DYLAN +++$+++ Well, the victim was killed at the turn-around over there, then his car was pushed over here...  ...right across the state line. That makes it Federal. This is Officer Wallace, he's out of Alamogordo.
L562229 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Excuse me, a salesman gets done in his car and you call the FBI?
L562228 +++$+++ u3067 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ DYLAN +++$+++ Fella's name is Harold Speck, travelin' man out of Roswell.
L562227 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ You run the plates?
L562844 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ We need to run this through VICAP, search for similar burns.
L562843 +++$+++ u3068 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ EAGLEFOOT +++$+++ A grill pattern.
L562842 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Turn the body over. There was something in the autopsy report, yes, here.  These burn marks.
L562841 +++$+++ u3068 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ EAGLEFOOT +++$+++ The body was embalmed. I don't understand --
L562840 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ I'm sorry. This won't take long.
L562839 +++$+++ u3068 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ EAGLEFOOT +++$+++ The family has gone through a lot. Their daughter missing, the search, her body found, the funeral -- then this order to exhume the corpse.
L562313 +++$+++ u3077 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ SALINAS +++$+++ That's the thing. Don't know if it connects, but Harold here had a thing about eyes. Two of the victims had their eyes gouged out, another punctured. Took polaroids after.
L562312 +++$+++ u3068 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ EAGLEFOOT +++$+++ Ripped off. By hand, my guess. Perimortal: victim was alive at the time, there's blood on his throat.
L562306 +++$+++ u3077 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ SALINAS +++$+++ This is Agent Mackelway.
L562305 +++$+++ u3068 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ EAGLEFOOT +++$+++ Be my guest, Agent Kulok, scrub suits are in the back.
L562300 +++$+++ u3077 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ SALINAS +++$+++ I appreciate it, doctor. You know how it is, press screaming for answers, Washington's all over me.  Ever handle a serial case?
L562299 +++$+++ u3068 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ EAGLEFOOT +++$+++ We had to bring staff in from the whole county to handle this.
L562298 +++$+++ u3077 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ SALINAS +++$+++ I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.
L562297 +++$+++ u3068 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ EAGLEFOOT +++$+++ Ligature strangulation, just like his victims. A cord, nylon, you can tell by the indentation signature -- again, like his victims.  Look at that little thing and look at all the trouble it got him in. Should have cut it off.
L562880 +++$+++ u3078 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ ZERO +++$+++ Not as much as you'd think.
L562879 +++$+++ u3069 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ FOREMAN +++$+++ Oh yes, I see. You must get asked this a lot.
L562878 +++$+++ u3078 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ ZERO +++$+++ It's been customized for sleeping capacity.
L562877 +++$+++ u3069 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ FOREMAN +++$+++ You can't imagine how many men have told me that.
L562876 +++$+++ u3078 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ ZERO +++$+++ Mam, it's my truck. I know my own capacity.
L562875 +++$+++ u3069 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ FOREMAN +++$+++ I have 6 tons.
L562874 +++$+++ u3078 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ ZERO +++$+++ Not a discrepancy, an error. My capacity is 5.5 tons, not 6.
L562873 +++$+++ u3069 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ FOREMAN +++$+++ There seems to be a discrepancy.
L562196 +++$+++ u3070 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Why me? What do you want from me!?
L562195 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ I've been looking for you.
L562192 +++$+++ u3070 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What do you want from me?
L562191 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
L562190 +++$+++ u3070 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Oh God, mister, please leave me alone.
L562189 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ Calm down, Harold.  Okay, here's what we're going to do, Harold: there's a pull off up ahead, we're going to stop there.
L562186 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ What's wrong with me?
L562185 +++$+++ u3070 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You're a... you're sick.
L562184 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ Not bad, huh?
L562183 +++$+++ u3070 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ My God.
L562181 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ Take a look, Harold. Tell me if you see anything you want. You do like to look, don't you?
L562180 +++$+++ u3070 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Look, mister...
L562179 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ Fucking. I'm talking about fucking, Harold. You ever think of fucking other women?
L562178 +++$+++ u3070 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What are you...?
L562177 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ You know, you ever think about other women?
L562176 +++$+++ u3070 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Excuse me?
L562175 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ You must get lonely. You ever think about, you know... 
L562174 +++$+++ u3070 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Look...
L562173 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ About your being away all the time. Must get lonely.
L562172 +++$+++ u3070 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What?
L562171 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ Just gettin' a jolt of java before headin' on home?  How does your wife feel about it?
L562170 +++$+++ u3070 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I don't mean to be rude, but...
L562169 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ Whole country or just hereabouts?
L562168 +++$+++ u3070 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Yeah.
