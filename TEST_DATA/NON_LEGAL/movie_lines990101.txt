L368122 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ We're all gonna fan out!  C'mon, let's do a sweep of the alleys -
L368121 +++$+++ u6471 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ MARVOSA +++$+++ I'm going to look for him on my own. Fuck this.
L368120 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Great. Well that changes a lot...
L368119 +++$+++ u6471 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ MARVOSA +++$+++ He must have got the keys... off Stanton.
L368118 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ What the hell is this Marvosa!!
L368099 +++$+++ u6471 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ MARVOSA +++$+++ Oh for Chrissakes it could have happened to anyone of--
L368098 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ I don't know how you're used to doing things, Marvosa, but it sounds like some damn sloppy work to me!
L368097 +++$+++ u6471 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ MARVOSA +++$+++ It happened too fast.  He was in the back, quiet and calm and boom! He was out - and gone.  We...we fanned out...Stanton must have let his guard down!
L368096 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!
L368095 +++$+++ u6471 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ MARVOSA +++$+++ He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
L368094 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ What the hell happened?
L368060 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ we've got kidnapping, grand theft auto, burglary, and two counts of murder on you, and I'm gonna see to it personally that it sticks!
L368059 +++$+++ u6471 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ MARVOSA +++$+++ You can cut the shit, asshole--
L368053 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Did you report it stolen?
L368052 +++$+++ u6471 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ MARVOSA +++$+++ Bullshit...
L368572 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ It wasn't in the cards.
L368571 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ I tell you one thing Trudell - you'd make a hell of a cop...
L368570 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I'll live...
L368569 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Are you alright?
L368056 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Yeah, it was opened -  with a goddamn screwdriver!!!
L368055 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I didn't break in - the back door was open!
L368054 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ So...  to get the car back, you break into her house.
L368051 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ She stole my car!!
L368050 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Anyhow...	you wake up and she's gone. But--  --this is my favorite part--  she leaves you the keys to a brand new Beemer.
L368041 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I'm done talking until I get a lawyer.
L368040 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Who am I?  I'm gonna be your worst fucking nightmare until you start breaking it down for me.  You understand? Where did you get the car!
L368039 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ And who are you?
L368038 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Alright, where is she?
L368223 +++$+++ u6470 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ LURCH +++$+++ Nothing!  He didn't do nothing!
L368222 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ And what did he do to the girl?
L368221 +++$+++ u6470 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ LURCH +++$+++ I was just having a little fun -
L368219 +++$+++ u6470 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ LURCH +++$+++ Alright, alright!  We were just fucking with him..you know?
L368218 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Now you listen to me hay-seed! If you don't want to spend a year in jail for making a false report you'll start giving me straight answers, you got that!!
L368217 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Mm-hmm...that's not what the bartender told us.
L368216 +++$+++ u6470 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ LURCH +++$+++ Hell, he probably raped her in the lot, dumped the body somewhere. That's what he was like - a real wacko.
L368215 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Did he harm the girl?
L368214 +++$+++ u6470 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ LURCH +++$+++ Yeah...the guy was psycho - I was just tying to protect the girl...
L368213 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ And he took a swing at you?
L368212 +++$+++ u6470 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ LURCH +++$+++ The guy was looking for trouble, shoving people around, being an asshole...
L368388 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Well let's get his ass to the garage!  Some lead...
L368387 +++$+++ u6476 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ ZYDOWSKI +++$+++ He said he was following up some lead.
L368386 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ And where the hell is Marvosa?
L368380 +++$+++ u6476 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ ZYDOWSKI +++$+++ Could explain why Fleming was there.
L368379 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Vice...you think they had something to do with this dead hooker?
L368378 +++$+++ u6476 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ ZYDOWSKI +++$+++ Well it's just kind of a coincidence, isn't it?  Stanton and Fleming, both started in '83, both in area six...both in Vice?
L368377 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Something I don't already know?
L368376 +++$+++ u6476 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ ZYDOWSKI +++$+++ Well read this -
L368375 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ No Zydowski I didn't read today's paper - it's just going to irritate the hell out of me.
L368374 +++$+++ u6476 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ ZYDOWSKI +++$+++ Did you read today's paper?
L368115 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ That's great Zydowski, you tech guys are really on the ball.  Harding - call the print lab at the FBI, run the prints through their library, see if it's less screwed-up than ours...
L368114 +++$+++ u6476 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ ZYDOWSKI +++$+++ That's not all.  According to the computer - she died of a drug overdose last year.
L368113 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ What?  Wait a minute -
L368112 +++$+++ u6476 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ ZYDOWSKI +++$+++ Her prints belong to Stephanie Field, convicted for soliciting two years ago.
L368111 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Yeah?
L368110 +++$+++ u6476 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ ZYDOWSKI +++$+++ You won't like this.  I ran the prints from the house.  No police record on your suspect--at least not in our files. But there is a match on the girl.
L368109 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Zydowski.  It's about time.
L368432 +++$+++ u6472 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ LAPD data center reports a breach on the system.  An outside hacker has accessed files on Detectives Fleming and Stanton...and yours too, Marvosa.
L368431 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Yeah?
L368430 +++$+++ u6472 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ Captain?
L368384 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Good! We'll get it to the nearest outlying station and hold it for prints - we're on our way -  You coming?
L368383 +++$+++ u6472 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ They found the getaway Mercedes a parking garage north of Venice. It checks out.
L368382 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Speak of the devil.
L368314 +++$+++ u6472 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ I lost him - I heard shots - that way!!
L368313 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Where is he?!!
L368247 +++$+++ u6472 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ I don't know - but he's from the FBI.
L368246 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Who is it?
L368245 +++$+++ u6472 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ Captain there's someone here to see you - he's waiting in your office.
L368579 +++$+++ u6473 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ Neither did I.  I'll make it up to you, I promise...
L368578 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No -
L368577 +++$+++ u6473 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ Have you ever heard of the Live Oak River?
L368576 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Where the hell is my car?
L368575 +++$+++ u6473 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L368574 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ There's something I've been meaning to ask you, Stephanie.
L368526 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ So you know about Marvosa, and Stanton, and all of them.
L368525 +++$+++ u6473 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ I took it with me.  It's in a safe place.
L368524 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ What happened with the tape?
L368523 +++$+++ u6473 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ I didn't know what to do - but I knew I had something somebody would want.  That's where I met him - told him what I had.  The FBI set me up with a new place...but the cops found me somehow.  So I ran...and met you.
L368522 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ What did you do then?
L368521 +++$+++ u6473 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ I had it all on tape...
L368518 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Found what?
L368517 +++$+++ u6473 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ I got out of there.	I just grabbed up my stuff, and then I found it.
L368516 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ And what did you do?
L368504 +++$+++ u6473 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ Yeah...they did.  One girl...
L368503 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Didn't these - professionals - figure he had a girl in the room?
L368502 +++$+++ u6473 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ I was there, and it was no suicide. He was killed by professionals.  I was in the bathroom when it happened.
L368501 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No, but I'm listening.
L368500 +++$+++ u6473 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ Six months ago, a police lieutenant named Charles Fletcher was found dead in a hotel room - he blew his brains out - left no note, you may have heard of it...
L368499 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ What exactly did you see?
L368498 +++$+++ u6473 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ No.  A witness.
L368497 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Look what are you anyway? Some kind of spy?
L368496 +++$+++ u6473 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ I had to get away!  My life was in danger!
L368495 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Well you figured wrong!  And now I'm public enemy number one.  You have an answer for that?
L368494 +++$+++ u6473 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ I didn't.  I figured you leave it well enough alone.
L368493 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Why did you set me up?
L368456 +++$+++ u6473 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ You'll find out - soon enough.
L368455 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ What's going on here?
L367994 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Only on dates?
L367993 +++$+++ u6473 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ No.
L367992 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You always carry a gun with you?
L367991 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Figure you would have tried it already.
L367990 +++$+++ u6473 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ You know, you don't seem afraid of much either.  How do you know I'm not going to try to rape you?
L367989 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No...
L367988 +++$+++ u6473 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ Mind if I turn out the light?
L367985 +++$+++ u6473 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ You're the mysterious type, right?
L367984 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No...
L367983 +++$+++ u6473 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ You got any family?
L367982 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Seattle.
L367981 +++$+++ u6473 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ Where up north?
L367980 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Up north.
L367979 +++$+++ u6473 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ STEPHANIE +++$+++ So where are you from?
L368467 +++$+++ u6474 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Don't worry about me...  ...and don't forget your helmet. You don't want to get a ticket.
L368466 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Are you going to be alright?
L368464 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I'm going to need a way to get there.
L368463 +++$+++ u6474 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ I can't help you anymore, Jimmy. I'm sorry.
L368462 +++$+++ u6474 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ I told you I'm not going anywhere! I got my whole life in this place!  I'll just destroy the evidence and play dumb.
L368461 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Tubbs, these people mean business.
L368460 +++$+++ u6474 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ I'm not going anywhere!
L368459 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ That was her - the girl... We have to go.
L368448 +++$+++ u6474 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Shit, we just started.  But I better log out of this.
L368447 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ It's not very much to go on...is there anything else we can check?
L368446 +++$+++ u6474 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Ahh, shit.  We're pretty much tapped out.  I'm getting denied access all over the place...
L368444 +++$+++ u6474 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ And look at the balances...these aren't police salaries...
L368443 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Both at the same bank...
L368442 +++$+++ u6474 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Who knows?  Maybe he's ordering army knives. I can't access that, but look what we have here...these are the account records for Fleming and Marvosa.
L368441 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ A bank?
L368440 +++$+++ u6474 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ OK...Marvosa makes calls to this fax number overseas.  And that's Switzerland's country code.
L368372 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ What else is new?
L368371 +++$+++ u6474 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ You know this time, there's nobody that's gonna cover your ass. You're over your head this time.
L368370 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I gave all that up.  I got tired of the lies. They wanted to stuff me in Levenworth to cover their asses on a botched assignment.  It got so I didn't know who to trust anymore...  ...some things never change, I guess.
L368369 +++$+++ u6474 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ So...what happened to you, Jimmy?  I figure you'd be in some far off place somewhere, living on the edge like the good old days.
L368368 +++$+++ u6474 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ I'll access the LAPD mainframe, but we gotta be careful - that one's kind of tricky -
L368367 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ How about Marvosa and the others?
L368366 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ OK...county tax records...they're saying 1490 Breckinridge is owned by... an Atlantic Trust Corporation...they have a P.O. box in D.C.
L368365 +++$+++ u6474 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ I got a lot of free time, you know what I mean?
L368364 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I knew I could count on you.
L368363 +++$+++ u6474 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe.  If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico.
L368362 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No thanks.  How do you know they can't catch you on this thing?
L368361 +++$+++ u6474 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Donut?
L368360 +++$+++ u6474 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Let's see what we got...
L368359 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ 1490...Breckinridge...
L368358 +++$+++ u6474 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ OK, I'm logged on to the municipal network.  I'm showing sixteen people with the name Sarah Williams in L.A. county.  None of them live in Hollywood.  Do you remember the address?
L368356 +++$+++ u6474 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ OK...where do you want to start?
L368355 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I've got a better idea...
L368354 +++$+++ u6474 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Shit, what I have now made our setup in Angola look like Tinker Toys.  I've been skipping through Internal Revenue records all day. I even have video strip poker. You want to check it out?
L368353 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I hope you haven't lost your touch with this stuff.
L368352 +++$+++ u6474 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Alright...alright...you've saved my ass enough times.  What do you want to do?
L368351 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I don't know.  But I'm in trouble. I'm all over the papers. I have to figure out what's going on.
L368350 +++$+++ u6474 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Oh man...what happened?
L368349 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I have nowhere else to go, Tubbs, I need your help!
L368348 +++$+++ u6474 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Shit, you know what happens to me if I'm harboring a fugitive?  I already think they're on to me! I thought you were the phone police for Chrissake!
L368347 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ They're inside the department, they're everywhere - it's not safe.
L368346 +++$+++ u6474 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ You gotta turn yourself in. Before it's too late -
L368345 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ It was self-defense, Tubbs! They're dirty!  I walked in on something, I don't know what -
L368344 +++$+++ u6474 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Jimmy, do you realize what you did? Man that's like death penalty shit -
L368343 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Yeah I'm sure!  I did it with my own hands!
L368342 +++$+++ u6474 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Oh, shit, shit, shit - I don't know about all this! You sure?!
L368341 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I killed them.
L368340 +++$+++ u6474 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ And?...
L368338 +++$+++ u6474 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Look, Jimmy, you know, I haven't seen you in eight years, you show up to my door like you're on drugs - now the least you could do is tell me what the fuck is going on!
L368337 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No...
L368332 +++$+++ u6474 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Yeah, c'mon in...you scared the hell out of me!
L368331 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Hello Tubbs.  Can I come in?
L368330 +++$+++ u6474 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Holy shit -
L368273 +++$+++ u6474 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ This is Tubbs. Sorry I can't answer the phone, I'm out square dancing. Leave a message--
L368272 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Operator, I'd like to make a collect call - 213-467-0972...
L368180 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Please...
L368179 +++$+++ u6474 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Jesus, man...
L368178 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ It's...it's a long story.  Can we meet somewhere?
L368177 +++$+++ u6474 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Just what did you get yourself into, Jimmy?
L368176 +++$+++ u6469 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Tubbs listen!  I don't know anywhere else to go!  I need your help!
L368175 +++$+++ u6474 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ You are drunk.  You know, it's been a long time and I'd love to catch up, but I really got to -
