L244767 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Okay: I...look: I'm going to make it worth your while.  I am.  I turned this thing around.  I closed the old stuff, I can do it again. I'm the one's going to close 'em. I am!  I am! 'Cause I turned this thing a...I can do that, I can do anyth...last night.  I'm going to tell you, I was ready to Do the Dutch.  Moss gets me, "Do this, we'll get well..." Why not.  Big fuckin' deal.  I'm halfway hoping to get caught.  To put me out of my...  But it taught me something.  What it taught me, that you've got to get out there.  Big deal.  So I wasn't cut out to be a thief.  I was cut out to be a salesman.  And now I'm back, and I got my balls back...and, you know, John, you have the advantage on me now: Whatever it takes to make it right, we'll make it right.  We're going to make it right.
L244766 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Mmm.
L244765 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ He told me my share was twenty-five.
L244764 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Uh-huh?
L244763 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ I...I'm sure he got more than the five, actually.
L244762 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Was it?
L244761 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ It was his idea.
L244760 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ That was easy, wasn't it?
L244759 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Do I have to tell you?  Moss.
L244758 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Who kept the other half?
L244757 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Five thousand.  I kept half.
L244756 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ How much did you get for them?  How much did you get for them?
L244755 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ I sold them to Jerry Graff.
L244753 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ I...
L244752 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ If you tell me where the leads are, I won't turn you in.  If you don't, I am going to tell the cop you stole them, Mitch and Murray will see that you go to jail.  Believe me they will.  Now, what did you do with the leads?  I'm walking in that door--you have five seconds to tell me: or you are going to jail.
L244751 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ I don't know what you are saying.
L244750 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ What'd you do with the leads?  You want to go in there?  I tell him what I know, he's going to dig up something...You got an alibi last night?  You better have one. What did you do with the leads?  If you tell me what you did with the leads, we can talk.
L244749 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Sure!  I robbed the office.  Sure.
L244748 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ You robbed the office.
L244747 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ You're so full of shit.
L244746 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ Well, I'm saying this, Shel: usually I take the contracts to the bank.  Last night I didn't.  How did you know that?  One night in a year I left a contract on my desk. Nobody knew that but you.  Now how did you know that?  You want to talk to me, you want to talk to someone else...because this is my job.  This is my job on the line, and you are going to talk to me.  Now how did you know that contract was on my desk?
L244745 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Don't fuck with me, John, don't fuck with me...what are you saying?
L244744 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ No.  It hadn't.
L244743 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Well, hadn't it?
L244742 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ I told the customer that his contracts had gone to the bank.
L244741 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L244740 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ You said, "You don't make something up unless it's sure to help."  How did you know that I made it up?
L244739 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L244738 +++$+++ u5528 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ WILLIAMSON +++$+++ How do you know I made it up?
L244737 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ What?
