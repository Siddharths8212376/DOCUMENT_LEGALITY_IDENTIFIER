L651866 +++$+++ u8892 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Teddy? Would you please please please take me to the prom?
L651865 +++$+++ u8892 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ If you don't have...I mean...
L651864 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Yeah?
L651863 +++$+++ u8892 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ And I was wondering.
L651862 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Yeah?
L651861 +++$+++ u8892 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Well. The prom's coming up.
L651860 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Ladies first.  I insist.
L651859 +++$+++ u8892 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ You go first.
L651858 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ From your lips, to God's ears.
L651857 +++$+++ u8892 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing?
L652445 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ We want you to go to college, find a career you love, marry a nice girl from a nice family, and live happily ever after.
L652444 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ We think you should give up the magazine. Sell it. Let someone else run it. Whatever it takes.
L652442 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ We miss our family.
L652441 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ We miss you. We miss our son.
L652440 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ We're not ashamed of you, Teddy. We don't approve of the magazine or the models or the so-called "flesh parties" you attend. But we can get past all that.
L652437 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Don't you see how your self involvement and lack of humility are affecting the whole family?
L652436 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ But that doesn't make you the boss of everything, son.
L652435 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ You have to understand. This was a big shock, for all of us. One minute you're our little boy, of whom we could not be more proud. The next minute you're the owner of this whole pornographic empire.
L652331 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ We love our lives just the way they are.
L652330 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.
L652329 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Ted, we put a lot of love in our business.
L652250 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Oh, honey. We can't accept this extravagance.
L652249 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ I always wanted Craftsman tools. He even got me the limited edition Buckeye colors.
L652248 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Sweetheart, what is it?
L652243 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Of course, dumpling. Its very nice of Ted but...
L652242 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ We can't accept it.  It's much too expensive. Right, dear?
L651956 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ We own a small family grocery store.
L651955 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning.
L652725 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ I will not have my boys arguing.
L652724 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Shut your pie hole, Jimmy.
L652448 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Why don't you just admit what this is really all about? I'm not your real kid and you can't control me anymore.
L652447 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Watch your tone, mister.
L652446 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ THAT is your dream, not mine. My dream is so far beyond anything YOU PEOPLE could even imagine.
L652439 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ You ordered a Winnebago?
L652438 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I paid off the mortgage! I ordered that Winnebago you always wanted! Now you're ashamed of me?
L652431 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Your mom said you've been ignoring your chores.
L652430 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ It's okay. You need me?
L652429 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Sorry I--
L652326 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Consider me your fairy godfather, except without the fairy part. No more mealy apples and bruised bananas, ever, for the rest of your lives.
L652325 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ But those are our dreams, son. We have to make them come true.
L652313 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ We're grateful, Ted. It's not that. Those Craftsman tools...they're a dream come true.
L652312 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Finally, some gratitude.
L652104 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Well, good. Every little bit helps.
L652103 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Dad, let's just say I can buy anything I want in the whole bookstore. Including the bookstore.
L652102 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ I know they were simple people, but did this trip help your college fund at all?
L652101 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Just say it, Dad.
L652100 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Ted, it's your dad.  I have a question for you.  I don't know how to put it tactfully. You know I'm lousy with words.
L651992 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ ...not the pit.
L651991 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ There ya go. Always remember, focus on the peach...
L651990 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
L651989 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Whatever helps you cope.
L651988 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Like one of those "National Geographic" specials with the topless chicks?
L651987 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.
L651986 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I guess we could go to Disneyland or something.
L651985 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be?
L651984 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Yeah.
L651983 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ They did do one great thing. They gave us our boy.
L651982 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I guess.
L651981 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ They had a rough life. Your father was a bouncer. Your mother was, well, a two-bit stripper. There was no place for a baby.
L651980 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Well, why should I?
L651979 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Son.
L651978 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ They didn't want me when I was born. Why should I care...
L651977 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Of course we are.
L651976 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You guys are my parents.
L651975 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ I'm getting so good at this.
L651974 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do. It's all part of growing up. And it usually works out peachy in the end.
L651973 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ The lesson being?
L651972 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ It was the year of the rhizopus rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm. You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival. And in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow.
L651971 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ You're way ahead of me again?
L651970 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you?
L651969 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Grandpa was so strong back then. Working from the crack of dawn. So proud of his peaches.
L651968 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Dad, please.
L651967 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ I remember spring break of my senior year.  Seems like a lifetime ago.
L651937 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ It's my private business! Mine!
L651936 +++$+++ u8893 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ We understand your disappointment, Teddy. Christy is a pretty, sexy, provocative, voluptuous...  We...uh...we understand your disappointment.
L652481 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I guess...I don't know...I guess we should leave if we're not wanted.
L652480 +++$+++ u8894 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Well?
L652479 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Hang in there, I'll think of something.
L652478 +++$+++ u8894 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!
L652477 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ What do you want me to do?
L652476 +++$+++ u8894 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Ted! Do something!
L652460 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Of course we were.
L652459 +++$+++ u8894 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Teddy, I thought we were having a moment here.
L652453 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Whatever you want.
L652452 +++$+++ u8894 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
L652451 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Hmmm?
L652450 +++$+++ u8894 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Teddy? I was thinking.
L652167 +++$+++ u8894 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Then remember, you are the heir to a billion dollar empire. You have a staff of literally thousands. Multiply everything you ever imagined by a million and you still can't even wrap your head around everything that is yours. ALL YOURS.
L652166 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I always knew there was more. I felt it.
L652165 +++$+++ u8894 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Or do you have a taste for the good life, Ted? It's in your blood.
L652163 +++$+++ u8894 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ And who IS Ted Nelson?
L652162 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.
L652161 +++$+++ u8894 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Who exactly ARE you?
L652158 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Hi ho, Silver.
L652157 +++$+++ u8894 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Don't worry.  He found the chocolate room.
L652156 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.
L652155 +++$+++ u8894 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping?
L652153 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I almost didn't recognize you without...you know...that stallion between...your...uh...legs.
L652152 +++$+++ u8894 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ That's me.
L652151 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ The one with the horses.
L652150 +++$+++ u8894 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ I know.  I'm Ginger. Miss April.
L652149 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I'm Ted, by the way. I think I forgot to say that.
L652148 +++$+++ u8894 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Your father liked shifting. He said it brought him closer to the engine. "Like a woman, purring with ecstasy."
L652147 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Some of them have to be automatics.
L652146 +++$+++ u8894 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ It's your car. These are all your cars.
L652145 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I don't even know if I should be doing this. It's a very expensive car.
L652144 +++$+++ u8894 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ The first time can be awkward. You just have to get on and try again.
L652142 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Got it.
L652141 +++$+++ u8894 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Now release the brake. And slide the stick into first gear.
L652139 +++$+++ u8894 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Want a lesson?
L652138 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.
L652137 +++$+++ u8894 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ You do know how to drive?
L652136 +++$+++ u8894 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ They're in the ignition, silly.
L652135 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I-I don't have the keys.
L652048 +++$+++ u8903 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Everything.
L652047 +++$+++ u8895 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ So here we are. Dead. But we never want you to want for anything. That is, we want you to have everything.
L652046 +++$+++ u8903 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Before we knew it, we created the most popular men's magazine in the entire nation. The rest is history.
L652045 +++$+++ u8895 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Can you believe that was me?
L652044 +++$+++ u8903 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ We had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this.
L652043 +++$+++ u8895 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ But we did want you. It's just that you don't always get to keep what you want. We knew you needed a real mom and dad.
L652042 +++$+++ u8903 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ If you're anything like yours truly, then you probably figure we didn't want you when you were born, so who cares if we're dead? Am I right?
L652041 +++$+++ u8895 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ But don't worry...we'll be in heaven. The REAL heaven, I mean. Not that heaven is an actual place, but more like a state of being. Or not being. Who knows. Maybe we know now.
L652040 +++$+++ u8903 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ But if you're watching this, then it means we bit the dust.
L652039 +++$+++ u8895 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Oh, sweetheart! We wish we could be right there to hug the living daylights out of you!
L652717 +++$+++ u8896 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ But how can you respect yourself if you don't?
L652716 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ And the girl I love, she hates "Heaven." If I keep it, she'll never respect me.
L652715 +++$+++ u8896 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I understand.
L652714 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ They're not my parents, Helen. My parents are back in Xenia and I hurt them very much.
L652713 +++$+++ u8896 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Your parents would be crushed to think you weren't happy with it.
L652712 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ My legacy.
L652711 +++$+++ u8896 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did. When they founded "Heaven," they wished they could take you back but it was too late. All they could do was build the empire, knowing that someday it would all be yours.
L652710 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I wondered about them, for so many years. I wondered if I looked like them, acted like them. I wondered why they gave me up.
L652709 +++$+++ u8896 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ They kept this scrapbook of your life. It meant the world to them.
L652708 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You mean they knew who I was?
L652707 +++$+++ u8896 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, Ted. They knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much. They knew they did the right thing. But that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar.
L652699 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Look, the girls of Xenia are gorgeous, you'll see. Next month we'll be back to normal.
L652698 +++$+++ u8896 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ It's a little more serious than that, Bill. The stockholders have requested a meeting. They want our guarantee that this will never happen again.  Some of them are even calling for Ted's resignation.
L652433 +++$+++ u8896 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ We'll send you the release forms, Ted. Our staffers will help in any way they can.
L652432 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ No problem, consider it done.  I had this idea of shooting on location. Outdoors, you know? Maybe at some famous Xenia landmarks. You think that would be a problem?
L652030 +++$+++ u8896 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I'm Helen McDole.  Your father's executive secretary.
L652029 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You're on the next plane home.
L652380 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Matter of fact, Jay, I'm planning a pictorial focusing on the women of my hometown, "The Girls of Xenia." Just to show my appreciation.
L652379 +++$+++ u8897 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ I see, so you'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers?
L652378 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Matter of fact, Jay, my uncle and I are planning to rethink the magazine. To expand the traditional western notions of "beauty."
L652377 +++$+++ u8897 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ What about the future? You planning to rock the boat at all? Stir things up in "Heaven?"
L652376 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I'm no stranger to the notion of philanthropy. Andrew Carnegie has long been one of my idols.
L652375 +++$+++ u8897 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Are they hitting you up for donations? Asking you to sponsor the local quilting bee?
L652374 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Well, Jay. They've been exceptionally supportive.
L652373 +++$+++ u8897 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ How are the hometown folks treating you, back in Xenia?
L652757 +++$+++ u8898 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ From my wise, albeit youthful, vantage point, the world is your oyster. You scored big.
L652756 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Great.
L652595 +++$+++ u8898 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ You ever look down on them again and call them "grocers" like it's a dirty word, and you'll be sucking your filet mignon through a straw for six to eight weeks. Got it?
L652594 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I didn't forget.
L652593 +++$+++ u8898 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ But just for the record, my Mom is a kick-ass schoolteacher and my Dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the Himalayas. You seem to have forgotten they opened Nelson's FAMILY Market so they could build something permanent, a legacy, for us. Their kids.
L652592 +++$+++ u8898 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Look Ted. I'm cool with everything. You've long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town. You've always had an itch for the good life. I'm happy for you. This couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
L652591 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ That's a crappy thing to say.
L652590 +++$+++ u8898 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I meant biologically.
L652589 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ He was my Grandfather, too.
L652588 +++$+++ u8898 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Funny you should say that. My Grandfather was a peach farmer.
L652587 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You're a peach.
L652586 +++$+++ u8898 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ You can't come back. That is, you can, but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine.
L652585 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I miss them, too.
L652584 +++$+++ u8898 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Aside from the fact that Mom's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn't broken, things couldn't be better.
L652583 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Are they okay?
L652582 +++$+++ u8898 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Are you kidding? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time.
L652581 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ That's it? I mean, you don't want to order room service or anything? We could play games and watch movies and stuff.
L652580 +++$+++ u8898 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Just a formality.
L652579 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You want it in writing?
L652578 +++$+++ u8898 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ If you could just sign right there.
L652577 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You can have it, then. I'm not going back there.
L652576 +++$+++ u8898 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home.
L652575 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ It's not up to me.
L652574 +++$+++ u8898 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Better view, more spacious, new carpet. It's a no-brainer.
L652573 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ My room?

L652561 +++$+++ u8898 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious.
L652560 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ James, what are you doing here?
L651931 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Why can't we have pot roast or stroganoff or even a little London broil? I mean, for god's sake, we own a grocery store!
