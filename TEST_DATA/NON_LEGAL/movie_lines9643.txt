L113522 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I didn't think you'd make it.
L113502 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Okay.
L113501 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I'll wait for you till seven.
L113500 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Yeah?
L113499 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Jane?
L113495 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I'm going over to Aaron's.  Maybe I'll hoop up with all of you later.  How long do you think you'll be there?
L113494 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ You have to celebrate with me, don't you?  Everybody's going to that bar on the corner, 'Caps.'
L113493 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Indescribable -- you knew just when to feed me the next thing, just a split second before I needed it.  There was a rhythm we got into, like great sex.
L113492 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Yeah.  It was an unusual place to be.
L113491 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ You're an amazing woman.  What a feeling having you inside my head.
L113454 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ George Weln is at the Pentagon where the attack launched by the lone Libyan pilot has resulted in a massive movement of military might.
L113453 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ We're going to George.  Say 'the Joint Chiefs are meeting -- we have George Weln at the Pentagon'.
L113415 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Excited.
L113414 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Nervous?
L113379 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Yes.  Just don't say anything mean for a while.  Thanks.
L113378 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ You okay?
L113377 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ You're great at taking the edge off a good time.
L113376 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.
L113375 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ At work there's always this sort of film over you.
L113374 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ What do you mean clean?
L113373 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ It's the firs time I've seen you dressed like this.  You look so clean and pretty.
L113333 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Okay, billion...right, of course. They told me I could have any producer I wanted -- and I want you.
L113332 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Billion.
L113331 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ The House Armed Service Committee has a secret report which says that the General Stillwell tank the Army has dumped a fortune into plain won't work.  I have it cold, confirmed.  They have five million dollars in this thing already.
L113330 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?
L113329 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I've got another story.
L113301 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Ah, I don't want any credit.  Bobbie and I serve anonymously.
L113300 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Give it to him -- so we can concentrate.
L113297 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Yes.
L113296 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ So he was indicted?
L113222 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Okay.
L113221 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
L113220 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
L113219 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ How's it going?
L113218 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Hi.
L113183 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ And it has nothing to do with the fact I left your room instead of staying there?
L113182 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I can't help you, sorry.  I'm not here to teach remedial reporting.
L113181 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ You  make me nervous.  Anyway if I can pick your brain --
L113180 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ 'Really a lot appreciate it...'
L113179 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I thought you were incredible in there. I know how much I have to learn.  I'd really -- a lot -- appreciate it...if...
L113178 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ No.  Aaron and I go to Central America on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.
L113177 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I can't believe I'm really here.  No kidding.  If you're through work now --
L113176 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ You weren't.  Thanks.  How does it feel being here?
L113175 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I'm sorry if I was in the way.  It was totally impressive.  Great piece.
L113115 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ We're working here!!  You can stand over in the uh, uh, uh...
L113114 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ They said it would be okay if...
L113103 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Those audition tapes I sent out... I've been hired by your network for the Washington bureau.  So I'll probably see you at work.  Sorry.
L113102 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Hey?
L113101 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I never told you the reason I was telling you everything for.
L113085 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Just what do you want from me, anyway? Permission to be a fake?  Stop whining and do something about it.
L113084 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Whoa, this was a mistake.
L113083 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I agree with you -- you're not qualified.  So get qualified.  You can insist on being better prepared.  You don't have to just leave it as...  'I don't write.  I'm not schooled. I don't understand the news I'm reading. But at least I'm upset about it, folks.'
L113082 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L113081 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ It's hard for me to advise you since you personify something that I truly think is dangerous.
L113079 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ So, you're not well educated and you have almost no experience and you can't write.
L113078 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ One year...almost one year.
L113077 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Well, come on -- it is your life. Nobody is tying you to the fast track.  Did you go to college?
L113076 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ But that didn't stop me from sending out audition tapes to bigger stations and the networks.
L113075 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I don't write.
L113074 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ What about the obvious remedy? Reversing things.  Maybe getting a job on a newspaper.
L113073 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I didn't even have the chance to get really good at sports.  I wasn't bad. I thought I was starting to do interesting features but hockey is big at the station and...
L113072 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I trust you.
L113071 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Listen to me.  You keep on thinking I'm somebody ho lacks...confidence. That's not it.  I know I can talk well enough and I'm not bad at making contact with people, but I don't like the feeling that I'm pretending to be a reporter.  And half the time I don't really get the news I'm talking about.  It isn't that I'm down on myself.  Trust me, I stink.
L113069 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ How are you at back rubs?
L113068 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Except I'm no good at what I'm being a success at.
L113067 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ So great -- right?
L113066 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I was doing sports at the station. The newspaper ran this untrue story that I was leaving and they got all these tons of protest mail.  So they made me anchor.
L113065 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ No, I really got this job on a fluke and wait till you hear where it ends up.
L113064 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Come on...Even I'm not that hard on myself.
L113063 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Yes, sure.
L113062 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Yes.  My room is down here -- I'm not tired.  Do you want to keep talking?
L113061 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ That actually goes on...
L113060 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Another thing I can't stand is ...when White House reporters bullshit with each other after a briefing and then one of them has a theory and the other quotes it in his story as "White House" sources say...
L113056 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Nooo.  If I could just have a roll, I'd be okay.
L113055 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Totally understood.  Totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day you've had.  Totally sorry.
L113054 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ If we could just eat first.
L113052 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I haven't been in news that long. I've just been looking for the right person to talk to.  I have about two thousand questions for you.
L113051 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I like "godsend."
L113050 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I kept thinking what a great break it was for me to get to see you tonight.  More than a great break, maybe just what I needed...just when I needed it...Angel of mercy -- godsend...lifesaver...what?
L113049 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I was a lot earlier.
L113048 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Hi.  I was worried I was early.
L113046 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Well, they say if you can reach even one person, it means something... And you did that.
L113045 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Thank you.  They hated me.  I don't hate them.
L113044 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I just wanted to tell you  how great you were.  My name's Tom Grunick.
L113043 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Hi.
L113529 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Right back to you.
L113528 +++$+++ u4279 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I sure know that feeling.  Terrific work today.
L113368 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I can't be.
L113367 +++$+++ u4279 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ You're saying stay away from him.
L113366 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ God Almighty -- Whew.  Do I mind? Why do I mind?  I do mind.  What a shock -- I don't have a right to... I don't think I like him.  I know I don't respect him...So what am I talking about -- what am I saying to you?
L113365 +++$+++ u4279 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but I see Tom around you a lot and this is such a small office and I'd like to see him outside of work, unless there's some reason for you to mind... in which case I just won't do anything.
L113364 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Go ahead -- what?
L113363 +++$+++ u4279 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ This is very awkward.
L113541 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I'm not knocking it.  It's a great solution.  Not only the storage but you can see everything you have.
L113540 +++$+++ u4279 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I converted a bedroom -- this stuff builds up.  Wait till you've been doing this sixteen years.
L113539 +++$+++ u4279 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Through the closet.
L113538 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Where's the bathroom?
L113535 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ It would never occur to me to worry at all about you.
L113534 +++$+++ u4279 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ The last time I was with someone we went through this awful mutual disease questionnaire but I guess it beats getting paranoid the next day.  Okay, I'll go first.  I haven't...
L113314 +++$+++ u4279 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I didn't have the guts to ask when I first came up.  I'll get you a great tour.
L113313 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ This is my first time at the White House. Is there any chance to look at where he works and the rest of it?
L113312 +++$+++ u4279 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Boy, that's nice...I wish we could all deal with each other like this. I'll check it.  Anything I can do for you?
L113311 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Look, I'm junior man -- and it's your beat.
L113310 +++$+++ u4279 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ How come you're not chasing it down yourself?
L113309 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ So he bought this Peugeot sedan at a greatly reduced price while he was there in charge of the White House Advance Team.
L114005 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ ...that way we have someplace to go when we cut.  And I just sit here, I nod my head and look nerdy.
L114004 +++$+++ u4283 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ YOUNG WOMAN +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L114003 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I just need you for another minute now, so we can shoot from behind towards me, and, um...
L114002 +++$+++ u4283 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ YOUNG WOMAN +++$+++ The way you were looking at me, I just went.
L114001 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Don't be silly.  What are you sorry about?
L114000 +++$+++ u4283 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ YOUNG WOMAN +++$+++ Yes, I'm sorry.
L113999 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Are you okay?
L113998 +++$+++ u4283 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ YOUNG WOMAN +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L113997 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ That's enough.  That's enough.
L114657 +++$+++ u4284 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I'll pose any way you want.
L114656 +++$+++ u4295 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Look -  This pose is all wrong!
L114655 +++$+++ u4284 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Well I just wanted to make sure you know, fully and completely, that you're never gonna get any from me, at least in this lifetime.
L114654 +++$+++ u4295 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Whaddya mean?
L114653 +++$+++ u4284 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ It's just an innocent question.  Besides I just wanted to clarify your intentions.
L114651 +++$+++ u4284 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Are you a virgin?
L114650 +++$+++ u4295 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ What!
L114649 +++$+++ u4284 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Walter can I ask you something?
L114648 +++$+++ u4295 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ You're breaking my concentration!
L114647 +++$+++ u4284 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ A girl with a body like mine?
L114646 +++$+++ u4284 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Without a stitch of clothing on, sitting and facing you...
L114645 +++$+++ u4295 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Um...
L114644 +++$+++ u4284 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ When's the last time you had a totally nude girl in your room...
L114643 +++$+++ u4295 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ I already told you I'm not.
L114642 +++$+++ u4284 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Not even a little bit?
L114641 +++$+++ u4295 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ N-no...
L114640 +++$+++ u4284 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Are you nervous, Walter?
L114639 +++$+++ u4295 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Oh it's enough...
L114638 +++$+++ u4284 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ That doesn't look like very much clay.
L114635 +++$+++ u4295 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Sit in this chair, and I'll pose you.
L114634 +++$+++ u4284 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I'm almost ready -
L114631 +++$+++ u4295 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Shh!
L114630 +++$+++ u4284 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ It's kind of dark -
L114627 +++$+++ u4295 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L114626 +++$+++ u4284 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ What, right now?
L114625 +++$+++ u4295 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Tonight.
L114623 +++$+++ u4284 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Yeah.
L114622 +++$+++ u4295 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?
L114621 +++$+++ u4284 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Well I'm touched.  You're serious, aren't you?
L114620 +++$+++ u4295 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ I decided to make a female figure after all!  I want you to pose for it.
L114619 +++$+++ u4284 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram!
L114618 +++$+++ u4295 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ I didn't finish talking to you!
L114617 +++$+++ u4284 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Listen schmuck, why don't you get out of here and let me go to bed!
L114615 +++$+++ u4295 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ I wanted to apologize for being nasty to you this evening.
L114614 +++$+++ u4284 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L114612 +++$+++ u4295 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ I'm going home!
L114611 +++$+++ u4284 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ If you were an artist you could have created something!
L114608 +++$+++ u4284 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Oh yeah?
L114607 +++$+++ u4295 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ That's not true I am a sculptor!
L114591 +++$+++ u4284 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I'd be glad to help.  For $50 an hour.
L114590 +++$+++ u4295 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ I just might.
L114589 +++$+++ u4284 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Would you like to do me?
L114579 +++$+++ u4295 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Not anymore!
L114578 +++$+++ u4284 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Don't you work here?
L114288 +++$+++ u4285 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ ART +++$+++ Righto.
L114287 +++$+++ u4290 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ See you later -
L114285 +++$+++ u4285 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ ART +++$+++ He made a cat.
L114284 +++$+++ u4290 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ What did he do?
L114283 +++$+++ u4285 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ ART +++$+++ Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
L114282 +++$+++ u4290 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ What the hell's going on?
L114123 +++$+++ u4285 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ ART +++$+++ You know it.  I'm out of here.
L114122 +++$+++ u4290 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Alright I got you, man.  It's my turn for freak patrol.
L114121 +++$+++ u4285 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ ART +++$+++ Yeah, he's keeping an eye out, said he'd call us if he sees anything. That's about it for tonight.
L114120 +++$+++ u4290 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Is the manager cooperating?
L114119 +++$+++ u4285 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ ART +++$+++ Not really.  One girl who fit the descrip came in, kinda skinny, brunette, didn't see much changing hands.
L114118 +++$+++ u4290 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Anything new?
L114117 +++$+++ u4285 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ ART +++$+++ Alright we're clear.
L114874 +++$+++ u4295 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Don't you see Carla?  I made them immortal.
L114873 +++$+++ u4286 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ CARLA +++$+++ Walter...stay away from me!
L114869 +++$+++ u4286 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ CARLA +++$+++ There's...a body inside that statue!
L114868 +++$+++ u4295 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ What?
L114867 +++$+++ u4286 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ CARLA +++$+++ Walter...there's...
L114857 +++$+++ u4295 +++$+++ m286 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Ok...tonight.  I'll make a statue of you tonight, OK?
