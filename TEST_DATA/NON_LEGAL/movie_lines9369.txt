L497602 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Hi.
L497601 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Hello.
L497512 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ He doesn't have to tell me.
L497511 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Is that what he tells you?
L497510 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ John doesn't have sex with Ann anymore.
L497509 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Different.
L497508 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Prettier than Ann?
L497507 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Yes.
L497506 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Do you think I'm pretty?
L497505 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Yes.
L497504 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Do you like the way I look?
L497503 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ If you wish.  You're not wearing any underwear.
L497502 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Would you like me to take my pants off?
L497494 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Then I started moving my hand, and then he stopped talking.
L497493 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Then what happened?
L497492 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ He said that my hand felt good.
L497491 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ What did he say?
L497490 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ It was warmer than I thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked. It's weird. Thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me. I mean, after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it, I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.
L497489 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ What about when you touched it? What did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like?
L497488 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ No. If anything, after I looked at it awhile, it got more interesting. It had character, you know?
L497487 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Were you disappointed?
L497486 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Not really. I didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything, I thought it would be smooth, like a test tube.
L497485 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ What did you think? Did it look like you expected?
L497484 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Very much live.
L497483 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Live, or in a photograph or film of some sort?
L497482 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ When I was fourteen.
L497481 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ How unfortunate. So when did you finally get to see a penis?
L497480 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ No. He kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. To Cleveland, actually.
L497479 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward?
L497478 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ I was... eight years old. Michael Green, who was also eight, asked if he could watch me take a pee. I said he could if I could watch him take one, too. He said okay, and then we went into the woods behind our house. I got this feeling he was chickening out because he kept saying, "Ladies first!" So I pulled down my underpants and urinated, and he ran away before I even finished.
L497477 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Your first sexual experience.
L497476 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ My first sexual experience or the first time I had intercourse?
L497475 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Describe for me your first sexual experience.
L497474 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
L497473 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I am now recording. Tell me your name.
L497472 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Just a moment.
L497471 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ I'd rather sit. Are you ready?
L497470 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Whichever you prefer.
L497469 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Do I sit or stand?
L497468 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ No.
L497467 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Can I see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what --
L497466 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ That depends on you. One woman only used three minutes. Another filled up three two hour tapes.
L497465 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ How long will it take?
L497464 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Yes.
L497463 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ And you ask questions, right?
L497462 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I turn on the camera. You start talking.
L497461 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ How do we start?
L497460 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Absolutely not. They are for my private use only.
L497459 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Would anybody else see the tape?
L497458 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Yes.
L497457 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Is this how you get off or something? Taping women talking about their sexual experiences?
L497456 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ That's all.
L497455 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ And that's all?
L497454 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I just want to ask you questions.
L497453 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ You just want to ask me questions?
L497452 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Nothing.
L497451 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ What makes you think I'd discuss that with you?
L497450 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Sex. Your sexual history, your sexual preferences.
L497449 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ About what?
L497448 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Talking.
L497447 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Doing what?
L497446 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Why don't you let me tape you?
L497445 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Well, either you are or you aren't. Which is it?
L497444 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Not exactly.
L497443 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Well, they must be something sexual, because Ann gets freaked out by that shit. Are these tapes of you having sex with these girls or something?
L497442 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ What do you get?
L497441 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Oh, okay. I think I get it.
L497439 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Spooked.
L497438 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ I think you're right. So come on, I came all the way over here to find out what got Ann so spooked, tell me what happened.
L497437 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Nope. I think the man is a liar.
L497436 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Well, I don't really listen to her when it comes to men. I mean, look at John, for crissake. Oh, you went to school with him didn't you? You're probably friends or something.
L497435 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I don't understand. Why did you want to come here? I mean, I can't imagine Ann painted a very flattering portrait of me.
L497434 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ I, uh, know a guy at the power company.
L497433 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ How did you find me?
L497432 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Nope.
L497431 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ She didn't give you my address?
L497430 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Nope.
L497429 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ She didn't tell you why she was upset?
L497428 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Nope.
L497427 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ And are you here to berate me for making her that way?
L497426 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ She still is.
L497425 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ No, I really can't. I find it healthy never to characterize people I don't know or conversations I haven't heard. I don't know what you and your sister discussed about me or anything else. Last time I saw Ann she left here very... confused, I would say. And upset.
L497424 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Well, like I said, Ann is my sister. Sisters talk. You can imagine the rest.
L497423 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I just want to know why you're here.
L497422 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ You want me to leave?
L497421 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ She called you that, too. May I ask why you're here?
L497420 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ She must have been in a good mood when she said that. She usually calls me loud.
L497419 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ The extrovert.
L497418 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ I'm Ann Millaney's sister.
L497417 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Do I know you?
L497416 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ I'm Cynthia Bishop.
L497415 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Who are you?
L497720 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ No, John, things are getting real simple.
L497719 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated.
L497718 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ John, we have nothing to talk about.
L497717 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk.
L497716 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ I know. Will you please leave now?
L497715 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ God, you... you're mean.
L497714 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ If he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure.
L497713 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I can't believe I let him stay in my house. Right under my nose. That deviant fucker was right under my nose and I didn't see him.
L497712 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ No, he didn't put me up to this. Jesus, I don't need people to tell me what I should do. I've just been thinking about things, that's all.
L497711 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Graham.
L497710 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Who?
L497709 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Did he put you up to this?
L497708 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Come on, John. You should be happy, we've gone this far without Ann finding out, I'm making it real easy on you. Just walk out of here and I'll see you at your house for a family dinner sometime.
L497707 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ How about straightening up the living room?
L497706 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...
L497705 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
L497704 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Look, are we going to do it or not?
L497703 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ That's right. But I never took a vow in front of God and everybody to be "faithful" to my sister.
L497702 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ By definition you're lying to Ann, too.
L497701 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Oh, please. Come on, John. You're fucking your wife's sister and you hardly been married a year. You're a liar. But at least I know you're a liar. It's the people that don't know, like Ann, that have to watch out.
L497700 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ It hurts that you would say that to me.
L497699 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Exactly what I said. I'd trust him before I'd trust you. How much clearer can I be?
L497698 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What do you mean?
L497697 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Yeah, I do. A helluva lot more than I trust you.
L497696 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You trust him.
L497695 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ It won't. I trust him.
L497694 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You realize you have no recourse legally? This stuff could show up anywhere.
L497693 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ No.
L497692 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ It just wasn't a smart thing to do. Did you sign any sort of paper, or did he have any contract with you saying he wouldn't broadcast these tapes?
L497691 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Hung up.
L497690 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I just... Ann is very...
L497689 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ She's a grown-up, she can handle it.
L497688 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about.
L497687 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Why not?
L497686 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I wish you hadn't done that.
L497685 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything.
L497684 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You told Ann about this?
L497683 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ I felt like it, so what? Goddam, you and Ann make such a big deal out of it.
L497682 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Interact, fine, but did you have to masturbate in front of him, for God's sake? I mean...
L497681 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Doesn't work. He has to know the people, he has to be able to interact with them.
L497680 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Jesus. I could almost understand it if he was screwing these people, almost. Why doesn't he just buy some magazines or porno movies or something?
L497679 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Right.
L497678 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Jesus Christ. And he doesn't have sex with any of them? They just talk?
L497677 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ "The wrong hands"? We're not talking about military secrets, John. They're just tapes that he makes so he can sit around and get off.
L497676 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What if this tape gets into the wrong hands?
L497675 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ I like the way he dresses.
L497674 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Shit, after what you've told me, I don't know. I should've known, when he showed up dressed like some arty brat.
L497673 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Well, you know him, he's a friend of yours, do you think he can be trusted?
L497672 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ That you... you don't even know the guy.
L497671 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ What's so stupid about it?
L497670 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ It's just so blatantly stupid, I have a hard time believing you did it.
L497595 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Look, I'll call you, okay?
L497594 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Do you want me to stop calling?
L497593 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ I don't think my sister would agree.
L497592 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Nothing wrong with trying.
L497591 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ I don't know. I'm not sure I can duplicate the level of intensity I had the other day.
L497588 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ She's there? What's she doing there?
L497587 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Well, this is timely. Your wife is here, would you like to speak to her?
L497586 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Cynthia. John.
L497585 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Hello.
L497500 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Then get those balls in the air and get your butt over here.
L497499 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Jesus, I don't know if I can get away. I've got a client waiting. I'd have to do some heavy duty juggling.
L497498 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Right now.
L497497 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ When?
L497496 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ I want to see you.
L497495 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ John Millaney.
L497413 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Yeah, I know what you mean.
L497412 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You know what I mean.
L497411 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ How about inviting me over to dinner?
L497410 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Oh.  Well, when, then?
L497409 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Not today. I've got other plans.
L497408 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Cynthia. John.
L497407 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Hello.
L497205 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ In here!!
L497204 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ John?
L497194 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ You are scum. I'll be there.
L497193 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Cynthia. John. Meet me at my house in exactly one hour.
L497192 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Hello.
L497094 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Sure. Maybe he's the man I'm looking for. Then I won't have to fuck worried husbands all the time.
L497093 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You're intrigued?
L497092 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ I'm intrigued.
L497091 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Cynthia, I don't think you want to, I mean, you should see the way he dresses. I really think he's in a bad way.
L497090 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ You should be. Can I meet this friend of yours?
L497089 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Maybe.
L497088 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Afraid of getting caught?
L497087 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ No, I mean doing it at my house.
L497086 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Well, maybe I could just start a rumor, then.
L497085 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Could be risky.
L497084 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ I wish I could tell everybody that Ann's a lousy lay. Beautiful, popular, Ann Bishop Millaney.
L497082 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ I did.
L497081 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Who said I was jealous?
L497080 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ I can handle it. Besides, the money is good and some of the guys are cute. And you are in no position to be jealous.
L497079 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time.
L497078 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Why?
L497077 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I wish you'd quit that bartending job.
L497076 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Right.
L497075 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Meaning we'll have to cool it for awhile, right?
L497074 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I have a friend coming in from out of town, I'll probably be spending some time with him the next couple of days.
L497072 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Don't give me this passive/aggressive bullshit. If you want to leave, leave. My life doesn't stop when you walk out the door, you know what I'm saying?
L497071 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I can't let my lunch hour go on too long. I've already skipped one meeting.
L497070 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ I only get one today? Gee, how exciting.
L497069 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I've got to get back to the office.
L497202 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ How about for five hundred?
L497201 +++$+++ u2693 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ Not for three-fifty.
L497200 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Will you lease month-to-month?
L497199 +++$+++ u2693 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ Plus first and last month deposit.
L497198 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ No.  You said three-fifty?
L497197 +++$+++ u2693 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ Student?
