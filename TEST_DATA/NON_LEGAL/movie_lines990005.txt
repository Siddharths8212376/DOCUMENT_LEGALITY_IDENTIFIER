L278816 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ I don't know -- put 'em in the drawer with all the Chinese take- away menus.
L278815 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Where should I hide the car keys?
L278814 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ The cab's waiting!
L278813 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Honey, I'm sorry, I think the vacation will be a good break for both of us.  You'll see.
L278812 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I thought we'd be happy here.
L278811 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Fuck you, Philip.
L278810 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Who told you that -- someone on the radio?
L278809 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ There <u>are</u> people who do things because they <u>want</u> to get caught.
L278808 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Honey, I can't track of all the meals Charlie and I have been having.  This is a delicate time. If it leaks out that I'm jumping ship before I'm set up someplace else I could be out on my ear before I'm ready with nothing. With <u>nothing</u>.
L278807 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Do you usually pay for Charlie? At "Trattoria <u>Valentino</u>"?
L278806 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Barbara <u>Zelman</u>?  I don't believe this!
L278805 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I don't care, Philip.  You want to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go ahead.  Just watch out for those buck teeth.
L278804 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Sweetheart, this is a very risky time for me right now.  Maybe you don't appreciate that.
L278803 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Well, what about <u>these</u>?  Do you usually put your <u>carbons</u> in your pocket, too?!
L278802 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Honey, you know what I've been like lately... I've been a total zombie.  I have no idea what that was doing in my pocket.
L278801 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I <u>remember</u> what day you wore that jacket.  It was <u>Monday</u>.  The day you were all day in <u>meetings</u> again?  And had to send out for <u>sandwiches</u>?
L278800 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ What next?!  -- A strange bra under my pillow!
L278799 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ No, I'm not kidding you, <u>Philip</u>.
L278751 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Someone nice will find him if he gets lost.
L278750 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Yeah, I guess it would be good for us to get away for a while.  Maybe Rudolf got the same idea.  Dogs need a change of scene, too, from time to time.
L278732 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I know someone else who's sensitive.
L278731 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ I mean, he's a smart kid, he'll get by -- he takes after me. You're too sensitive.
L278730 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ He's made some friends, hasn't he?
L278729 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Neil's still having a bad time at school.  I feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time.
L278728 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
L278727 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ How long does it have to be a new house?
L278726 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ All new houses have noises.
L278725 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I hear things in this house,
L278724 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ There's no card or anything.
L278723 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ No.
L278722 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Do you remember who gave us this?
L278684 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ <u>No</u>.  If I hear anything you'll be the first to know, all right?
L278683 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?
L278682 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Oh -- great.
L278681 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ How was your lunch with Charlie?
L278680 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Huh?
L278679 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ How was lunch?
L278650 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ It's just a dumb game they play. You want to be at a bigger firm, get used to the politics.
L278649 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ I know.  It's just having to pass muster with these juniors before the senior partner even agrees to see me.
L278648 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Honey, the meeting today is going to be fine.  Don't get in an uproar.
L278647 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ -- And keep my kids away from his property -- who the hell does he think he is?  Some nice neighborhood.
L278646 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Honey, are you okay?
L278645 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ He made, you know, a remark.
L278644 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ What?
L278643 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Did you hear what he said?
L278642 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ What?
L278641 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Did you hear that?
L278634 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Damn.
L278633 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ <u>Now</u>, Neil.  Stop teasing your sister.
L278597 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Good -- that's what I was trying to project.
L278596 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Paul Newman in "The Hustler."
L278595 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ How were we -- were we cool?
L278579 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ It's very nice, but it's still a little pricey for us.
L278578 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ We're going to think about it.
L278573 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Honey, nobody buys a house overnight -- if someone else comes back at them, well, we might have to make a counter offer.  But we can't look too eager or we'll get screwed.
L278572 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ What if someone else buys it in the meantime?
L278569 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ It'll be even shorter if I get that new job.  Come on.
L278568 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ And it's a shorter commute.
L278567 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ It's a nice pool, isn't it?
L278566 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ You could have a pool to cool off in.
L278565 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ You want me to bargain at the high end of our range?  -- I'll have a stroke.  I've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks.
L278564 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ They don't expect to get what they're asking.  Let's make an offer.
L278563 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ You wanted furniture too, didn't you?
L278562 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ But it's what we want.
L278561 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ High end?  Honey, it's a whole new budget.
L278560 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I know it's at the high end of our range --
L278559 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Stop knowing me so well.
L278558 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.
L278557 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ What's that?
L278556 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ You're thinking exactly what I thought when I first saw this house,
L278555 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ What?
L278554 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I hear what you're saying, but I know what you're thinking.
L278548 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ We'd have to get one of those sliding covers for the pool.
L278547 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Neil, don't leave the back doors open -- I don't want Holly near the pool.
L278546 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Neil, calm down.
L278528 +++$+++ u5844 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ REAL-ESTATE LADY +++$+++ We must <u>always</u> count the husband. By my count there've been... four. But I still live in hope.
L278527 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Two -- three if you count the husband.
L278526 +++$+++ u5844 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ REAL-ESTATE LADY +++$+++ How large is your brood?
L278525 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Oh, space!  -- You said the right thing.
L278524 +++$+++ u5844 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ REAL-ESTATE LADY +++$+++ You'll see that there's really much more space than the average three bedroom.
L278523 +++$+++ u5844 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ REAL-ESTATE LADY +++$+++ Isn't it?
L278522 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ This is a terrific entrance hall, What a welcoming feeling.
L278521 +++$+++ u5844 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ REAL-ESTATE LADY +++$+++ Sometimes they prefer a quicker return on their investment.
L278520 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Just reduced.
L278519 +++$+++ u5844 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ REAL-ESTATE LADY +++$+++ Oh, yes, well, you know, when developers remodel a house they often overestimate their costs at first.  It's not like it's been marked down or anything.
L278518 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Because it caught my eye when it was in a higher price bracket in the listings.
L278517 +++$+++ u5844 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ REAL-ESTATE LADY +++$+++ Not very long.  There have been a couple of bids already.
L278516 +++$+++ u5840 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ It's been on the market a while, hasn't it?
L278876 +++$+++ u5842 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ NEIL'S FRIEND #1 +++$+++ Put it out, man!
L278875 +++$+++ u5841 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Shit!
L278703 +++$+++ u5842 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ NEIL'S FRIEND #1 +++$+++ Grow up, Dreyer.
L278702 +++$+++ u5841 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ It's fun.
L278701 +++$+++ u5842 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ NEIL'S FRIEND #1 +++$+++ What for, dickweed?
L278700 +++$+++ u5841 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Let's follow 'em.
L278689 +++$+++ u5842 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ NEIL'S FRIEND #1 +++$+++ Shut up.
L278688 +++$+++ u5841 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ God, your sister's really hot.
L278901 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Get on the other side of that.
L278900 +++$+++ u5841 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ I thought I was supposed to stay in my room.
L278897 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ No man!  <u>Go to your room</u>.
L278896 +++$+++ u5841 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ No.
L278895 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Do you see a man?
L278892 +++$+++ u5841 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ -- A man.
L278891 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ You knew a second ago.  <u>Who</u> started it?
L278888 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Neil, goddamn it, you're not five years old!
L278887 +++$+++ u5841 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ A <u>man</u> started the fire.
L278856 +++$+++ u5841 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Can we keep him?
L278855 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Hiya, sport.  Where'd you come from, huh?
L278769 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ What d'you want me to do, Neil? I've told you we'll get another dog.  What does EVERYONE want me to do?  You want to move back? Huh?  Would you like that?  Should we all just pack up again and MOVE BACK?!
L278768 +++$+++ u5841 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ And I can't help having a cold.
L278767 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Y'know what?  I'm ready to cancel our trip.  I really am. I've had it.
L278764 +++$+++ u5841 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ The thermometer's broken.
L278763 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ What did the thermometer say?
L278762 +++$+++ u5841 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ I have a cold.
L278761 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ If you want that baseball jacket for your birthday, Neil, learn to cough a little more realistically.
L278760 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Oh really?  <u>You've</u> been going through a lot of personal crap. You, Princess Di and Madonna?
L278759 +++$+++ u5841 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ I've been going through a lot of personal crap, all right?
L278758 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Why?  I just read your report card.  What's the point?  Stay home, watch some television, we'll get "Mad" magazine delivered.  What kind of report card do you call this?!
L278757 +++$+++ u5841 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ All right then, if I have to go to school then I'd better go.
L278746 +++$+++ u5841 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Rudolf?  C'mere, Rudolf!
L278745 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Neil, do you mind?
L278632 +++$+++ u5841 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ I didn't.
L278631 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ All right, who ate the last piece of cheesecake?
L278618 +++$+++ u5841 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ No.
L278617 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ We'll get cable when the cable company is good and ready -- you think you can survive till then?
L278616 +++$+++ u5841 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ What about cable?
L278615 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Okay!  We have TV!  We can all get stupid again!
L278589 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Would you mind if Rudolf had a look too?
L278588 +++$+++ u5841 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Dad, we can't decide unless Rudolf gets to look too!
L278577 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Do you have enough money?
L278576 +++$+++ u5841 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Are we gonna buy this house?
L278795 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Really.
L278794 +++$+++ u5847 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ Really?
L278793 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Uh huh.
L278792 +++$+++ u5847 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ Would you?
L278791 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ I'd like that.
L278790 +++$+++ u5847 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ Promise.
L278789 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Promise?
L278613 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Thank you -- how efficient of you.
L278612 +++$+++ u5847 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ That's right -- you got the bill this morning.  I put it on your desk.
L278611 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Even cosier.
L278610 +++$+++ u5847 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ Even better.
L278609 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ It's a double.
L278608 +++$+++ u5847 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ Is it a king or a queen?
L278607 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Right over here.
L278606 +++$+++ u5847 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ Oh yeah?  Where's the bed?
L278605 +++$+++ u5843 +++$+++ m387 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ And this -- is the master bedroom.
L281491 +++$+++ u5865 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ ROBBERY DETECTIVE +++$+++ You can believe what you want.  You saw the tape.
L281490 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ Am I supposed to believe that this guy got shot in the chest six times at point blank range and just got up and walked out?
L281489 +++$+++ u5865 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ ROBBERY DETECTIVE +++$+++ Hey, I don't have answers for this. I just brought you down here because of the sword.
L281488 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ If he was knocked out in the can how could be walking across the lobby?
L281487 +++$+++ u5865 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ ROBBERY DETECTIVE +++$+++ Parker.  We found him knocked out in the can.
L281486 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ Where's the guy we saw in the beginning -- what's his name...?
L281485 +++$+++ u5865 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ ROBBERY DETECTIVE +++$+++ No joke, Lieutenant.
L281484 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ What the hell.  What is this?  A joke?
L281493 +++$+++ u5856 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Yes.
L281492 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ You didn't see this.  Understand?
L281474 +++$+++ u5856 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Well, technically it's not mid evil - - it's Renaissance.
L281473 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ Why are people walking around New York with swords, dressed in mid evil clothing?
L281472 +++$+++ u5856 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ They appear to be authentic.
L281471 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ What do you think?
L281464 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ Talk to me about what?
L281463 +++$+++ u5856 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I'm an archaeologist.  I read in the paper about the murder yesterday and I thought I should come talk to you.
L281462 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ What?  Who are you?  What do you want?
L281461 +++$+++ u5856 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Lieutenant?
L281454 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ Not now.  I'm busy.
L281453 +++$+++ u5856 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Lieutenant Bedsoe?
L281680 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ So?
L281679 +++$+++ u5852 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ DETECTIVE GRELEY +++$+++ I asked the State Department to check with our Embassies and Interpol to see if there were any similar occurrences like the bank.  Two weeks ago in London Charles Redder from the Bronx was mugged in Hyde Park.
L281678 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ Why?
L281677 +++$+++ u5852 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ DETECTIVE GRELEY +++$+++ I think it was England.
L281676 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ He had to come from somewhere.
L281675 +++$+++ u5852 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ DETECTIVE GRELEY +++$+++ We sent the prints we lifted from the counter at the bank to the State computers, the FBI and interpol. Nothing.
L281674 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ Anything from the bank?
L281521 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ I don't need proof.  I know it.  Send it out.
L281520 +++$+++ u5852 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ DETECTIVE GRELEY +++$+++ We don't have any proof of that.
L281519 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ This ties in with Nash.
L281518 +++$+++ u5852 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ DETECTIVE GRELEY +++$+++ It's not a homicide, Lieutenant.
L281517 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ Tough.
L281516 +++$+++ u5852 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ DETECTIVE GRELEY +++$+++ Y'know, the guys in robbery are gonna get kind of upset.  We're stepping on their toes of this one.
L281515 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ Good -- also, give it to the papers and TV.
L281482 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ I'd like you to see this.
L281481 +++$+++ u5852 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ DETECTIVE GRELEY +++$+++ That's not all, Lieutenant.  Wait until you see the tape.  It's unbelievable.
L281480 +++$+++ u5852 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ DETECTIVE GRELEY +++$+++ The guy had a sword and was dressed like this guy.
L281479 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ Really?  I want to make sure that I understand what you're telling me, Greley.  A crime was committed in New York City?  That is news.
L281478 +++$+++ u5852 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ DETECTIVE GRELEY +++$+++ A tape from the surveillance camera at the First National Bank.  It was robbed this morning.
L281477 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ What is it?
L281476 +++$+++ u5852 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ DETECTIVE GRELEY +++$+++ Hey Lieutenant, the boys in robbery have something I think you should look at.
L281384 +++$+++ u5852 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ DETECTIVE GRELEY +++$+++ Yeah -- how'd you know that?
L281383 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ Did you find a sword?  An old sword?
L281451 +++$+++ u5850 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ I see your point, Bedsoe, but I have to look at this from the law's point of view.  There's something missing here.  It's something I'm sure you've come across many times in your career.  It's called evidence.  Get me a murder weapon with his fingerprints on it.  Find me an eye witness.  Dig up a motive.  Until then we don't have a case against him.
L281450 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ For Chrissake!  Gimme a break.  The guy disappears for seven years and as soon as he comes back it starts again.
L281449 +++$+++ u5850 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ It's circumstantial.
L281448 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ You don't understand.  About seven years ago we found the body of a guy named Vasilnic in Jersey.  A week later in the parking lot of Madison Square Garden we found Iman Fasil. Three days after that Luman Castageer was found in an alley.  The fourth body we've never been able to identify.  All four men died from decapitation.  Nash was our primary suspect -- but he disappeared.
L281447 +++$+++ u5850 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ Cut him loose.  The D.A. says you ain't got shit on this guy.
L281446 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ What?
L281445 +++$+++ u5850 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.
L281444 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ I'm in the middle of an interrogation, Captain.
L281814 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ Hey -- somebody want to gimme a hand here?
L281813 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ Yes -- I think it is.
L281791 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ Most people are afraid of death.
