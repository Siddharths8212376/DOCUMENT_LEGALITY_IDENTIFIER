L638225 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ What did she do?
L638224 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Uh...the admitting nurse...

L638221 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Who?  They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
L638220 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ ...one of the other nurses?
L638219 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ `You guys are a bunch of whores...uh...loyalty...you don't care who gets hurt...you don't have any loyalty...'

L638206 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I think we tried that.  The case is over.
L638205 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ That's right.
L638204 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ You use their witness.
L638203 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Okay.  What do you do when you don't have a witness?
L638076 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Yeah.
L638075 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ And all we've got is a witch doctor!
L638074 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I'm swell.
L638073 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ How are you holding up?

L637906 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ What happened, Joey...?
L637835 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Mickey:  I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.
L637834 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
L637833 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I've got to go see Gruber.    What's the best cigars you have?
L637832 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Today is Tuesday.  What?
L637831 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Oh shit, what's today?
L637830 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ John:  gimme a cuesta-ray.
L637829 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ So what do you want me to do? Concannon's going to try the case his way, I'm going to try it mine. You want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack, got stories in the newspaper. I'm going to win this case.
L637828 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ What I'm saying, they're getting some help.
L637827 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ They still have to take it to a jury.
L637826 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ So what...?  The best is yet to come.  Check the TV Guide.  They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
L637825 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ So what?
L637824 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Mary Rooney.  She won't talk to me.  I tried her at the hospital. I'm going to try her back at home. Read this.
L637823 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I'm getting it back.  Don't worry about me, Mick.  I'm fine.  D'you find the obstetric nurse?
L637822 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Been a long time, huh...?
L637758 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I'm going to get laid.
L637757 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Yeah?  And what are you going to do tonight?
L637756 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Jimmy?  Bushmills.   Lookit, do me a favor.  I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
L637755 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I had a good teacher.  McLean versus Urban Transport...
L637754 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ You got a good memory, Franky.
L637753 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
L637752 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Right.
L637751 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Okay now.  Cases:  Smith versus State of Michigan.
L637750 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Right.
L637749 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ 'Mary Rooney, forty-nine.  Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.'  Can you get out tomorrow?  How come she isn't speaking up.
L637748 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ No.
L637747 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ They had an obstetrical nurse in there.  We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
L637746 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ ...Gruber's not bad.GALVIN Not bad...?  This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick...  And you calm down, all right?  Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse...'All these guys are God.  I saw them walk on water...'
L637745 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
L637744 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Forget it.  You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
L637743 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Admittance form is wrong.
L637742 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
L637741 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ We've got her sister.  Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
L637731 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I have to try this case.  I have to do it, Mick.  I've got to stand up for that girl.  I need your help.    Mick, will you help me...?    Will you help me...?
L637730 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Frank, but not now.  Frank.  You're trying to wipe out some old business.  But not now.  I understand.  But you go call 'em back.  You call the Bishop back.
L637729 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...I have to stand up for her...
L637728 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ ...he's a good man...?  He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness...he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis...don't fuck with this case.
L637727 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...he's a good man...
L637726 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I know what I said but not now. You won it.  Franky.  You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won.  We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?  You know who the attorney is for the Archdiocese, Eddie Concannon.
L637725 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ You -- Listen:  you said to me, `if not now, when...'
L637724 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ What?
L637723 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Mick.  Mick.  Mick...
L637722 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ That's the point, you stupid fuck. Let them buy it.  We let them buy the case.  That's what I took it for.  You let this drop -- we'll go up to New Hampshire, kill some fuckin' deer...
L637721 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ They killed her.  And they're trying to buy it...
L637720 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ To do what...?  To do what, for chrissake...?   To help her to do what?  She's dead...
L637719 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I'm going to help her.
L637718 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ You need my help...?  You need a goddamn keeper...are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred- ten grand?    Huh...?  Are you nuts?  Eh?  Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
L637717 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...I'm going to need your help...
L637716 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Are you out of your mind...?
L637715 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Don't touch anything.
L637714 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Come on.  Let's get a drink.
L637713 +++$+++ u8752 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ What do you want?

L637594 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ I'm going to see you get that chance.
L637593 +++$+++ u8754 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ We just can't do it anymore.   This is our chance to get away.
L637587 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ... and I have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field ... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent ...

Nobody cares.  The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care ... in Arlington ...?  They'd take her in.  Perpetual care.  They'd take her.  Fifty thousand dollars they want.  An endowment.

L637568 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ It's not a good case.  It's a very good case.  A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anaesthetic ...
L637566 +++$+++ u8744 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ It's locked?
L637565 +++$+++ u8754 +++$+++ m593 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ It's locked.
