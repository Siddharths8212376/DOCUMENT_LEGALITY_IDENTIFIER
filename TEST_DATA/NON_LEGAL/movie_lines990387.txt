L574758 +++$+++ u8126 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ADHARA +++$+++ I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
L574757 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ Not for you, clearly.
L574756 +++$+++ u8126 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ADHARA +++$+++ Is that a problem?
L574755 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ Is it possible that you're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?
L574754 +++$+++ u8126 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ADHARA +++$+++ Then what good is he?
L574753 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ Gordon?  He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.
L574752 +++$+++ u8126 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ADHARA +++$+++ I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.
L574751 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ Is there anything in the world that you want or need?
L574750 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ Could be worse, he could've named you Reticulum.
L574749 +++$+++ u8126 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ADHARA +++$+++ I used to hate it.  Now I like it.
L574748 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ Adhara.  I told your father, if you're looking for a name, you can't go wrong with a constellation.
L575049 +++$+++ u8127 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ AVERY +++$+++ That's why I'm letting you take care of this.  I'm the one with appearances to maintain.  But who gives a shit about you?  Not even God.
L575048 +++$+++ u8137 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Fuck you, Mr. whatever-your-name is. This is a lifestyle I embrace.
L575047 +++$+++ u8127 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ AVERY +++$+++ See, a successful man like me has limitations -- I lose touch at a street level.  So I have to depend on a smart boy like you who's closer to the nitty and the gritty than I am.
L575046 +++$+++ u8137 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ This is un-fucking professional.
L575045 +++$+++ u8127 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ AVERY +++$+++ I'll point you in the right direction, but you'll have to take it to the end- zone.  He's a hit-and-run gunman -- I figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge.
L575044 +++$+++ u8137 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ What shit is this.  I just do it.  I don't prepare it.
L575043 +++$+++ u8127 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ AVERY +++$+++ When you find the guy, you'll know.
L575042 +++$+++ u8137 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Where do we go?
L575041 +++$+++ u8127 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ AVERY +++$+++ Same as last time -- the rest after.
L575040 +++$+++ u8137 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Okay.
L575039 +++$+++ u8127 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ AVERY +++$+++ How'd you like to kill someone for me?
L575038 +++$+++ u8137 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Not bad.
L575037 +++$+++ u8127 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ AVERY +++$+++ How they goin', kid?
L575036 +++$+++ u8127 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ AVERY +++$+++ Come over here.
L575035 +++$+++ u8137 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Hey.
L575032 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ Well, can we make it one more.  Nowhere the fuck near me.
L575031 +++$+++ u8127 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ AVERY +++$+++ There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.
L575030 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ You think I'm staying?
L575029 +++$+++ u8127 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ AVERY +++$+++ You could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here.
L575028 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ No.  I mean.  Not even your people should be involved.  Right?  It's too close now.
L575027 +++$+++ u8127 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ AVERY +++$+++ We'll find him.
L575026 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ Where do <u>you</u> think he is, Mike.
L575025 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ I don't know everyone here.  He was so traumatized he split.  Maybe he was Gordon's <u>pusher</u>.
L575024 +++$+++ u8127 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ AVERY +++$+++ And where is this guest?  Don't they want to interview him.
L575023 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ As it happens.  I didn't make that part up.
L575022 +++$+++ u8127 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ AVERY +++$+++ Heavier than that now.  But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story.
L575021 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ I mean, Gordon must weigh a good four hundred pounds.
L575019 +++$+++ u8127 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ AVERY +++$+++ What did you tell them.
L575018 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ Why, because you're my security consultant?  This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
L575017 +++$+++ u8127 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ AVERY +++$+++ You should have let me do the talking.
L574789 +++$+++ u8127 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ AVERY +++$+++ Well, either they have a very liberal work-release program, or he's out, because he's here in L.A., looking for you.
L574788 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ I thought he was in prison, in England.
L574787 +++$+++ u8127 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ AVERY +++$+++ No, Terry.  They don't work like that. Jenny Wilson's father paid a little visit, left a message.
L574786 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ Our black friends?
L574785 +++$+++ u8127 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ AVERY +++$+++ What the papers used to call a "gangland slaying."
L574784 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ What kind?
L574783 +++$+++ u8127 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ AVERY +++$+++ There's been some trouble downtown.
L574782 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ What.
L575208 +++$+++ u8137 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ I saw your mother on the Strip last night.  She went up to three guys, said she'd like 'em to stick one in each, know what I mean?
L575207 +++$+++ u8128 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ CREEP +++$+++ Huh?
L575206 +++$+++ u8137 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ I wouldn't talk.
L575205 +++$+++ u8128 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ CREEP +++$+++ Fuck you.
L575204 +++$+++ u8137 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Let him break - he likes to break.
L575203 +++$+++ u8128 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ CREEP +++$+++ You broke last time.
L574705 +++$+++ u8129 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ DEALER +++$+++ No problem.  If <u>you</u> don't have a problem with me reporting this gun stolen.
L574704 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Yeah?
L574703 +++$+++ u8129 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ DEALER +++$+++ I can take care of the paperwork.
L574700 +++$+++ u8129 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ DEALER +++$+++ Packs a punch, but it's compact, has accessible features -- makes a nice concealed-carry piece.
L574699 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Been to the Boat Show.
L574698 +++$+++ u8129 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ DEALER +++$+++ You're in gun country now, my friend.
L574697 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Just luck, this, really.  Never been to one of these before.
L574696 +++$+++ u8129 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ DEALER +++$+++ You came to the right place, sir.  My wife's second cousin is English.  Well, Scotch-Irish.  Can I interest you in a holster?
L574695 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ England.  Only, we saw there was a show on, thought I might pick something up for a price, type of thing.
L574694 +++$+++ u8129 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ DEALER +++$+++ Oh really?  Where you from?
L574692 +++$+++ u8129 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ DEALER +++$+++ Close Quarters Combat.  Keep one in my own home.
L574691 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ CQ what?
L574690 +++$+++ u8129 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ DEALER +++$+++ Yes, sir.  Won't find a better CQC on the market.
L574689 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What'd you call that -- the Protector?
L574688 +++$+++ u8129 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ DEALER +++$+++ That's a high-end item.  Total reliability.
L574687 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Lookin' good.
L574686 +++$+++ u8129 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ DEALER +++$+++ Man knows what he likes.
L575273 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ The lot.  The whole British bloody Post Office.  I had a brilliant plan -- all worked out -- work of genius, it was. Could I get anybody interested?  No -- they're too busy pinching orange squash from the milkman.  Lazy sods.  Jumble sale on in Watford, they'll be up at the crack of dawn.
L575272 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What post office?
L575271 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Useless gits.  I was gonna do the Post Office once.
L575267 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Yeah, I suppose.  Call 'em that, yeah. Down the boozer Saturday night.  Meet some of the lads.
L575266 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Do you have any friends, man?
L575265 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Again?
L575264 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I've been wondering something.
L575015 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You think a fuckin' guy like that ever will?  What more do you want, man?
L575014 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ He's gotta know why.
L575013 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Too easy?
L575012 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ That would be too easy.
L575011 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Why didn't you just kill him, you had the chance.
L575009 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You steady on, man.  What the fuck else did you do back there.
L575008 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Steady on.
L575007 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ One thing I need.
L575006 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You goin' back inside?
L575005 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Bring the motor around.  Bang out in front, right?
L574982 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Faith.
L574981 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ What are we standing on?
L574945 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ First in, first out, that's me.
L574944 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No one else is even here yet.
L574943 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Well, that's what we're doin', n' it.
L574942 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I thought you just wanted to check out the house, man.
L574941 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Valets, eh?  Aren't we all la-de-da.
L574937 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ <u>Valets</u>.  They park cars.  He's having a party.
L574936 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Valets.  What d'ya mean valets.  What is he, then, the Earl of fucking Doncaster?
L574935 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Those aren't guards.  They're valets.
L574934 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ What's so fucking funny?
L574932 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ See what I mean?  Wearing bloomin' uniforms n' all.
L574931 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ That was one of them?
L574930 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ They look a right load of wallies. Patrolling back and forth outside the gate, all ponced up like the fuckin' Household Cavalry.  Watch it.
L574929 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Has he?
L574928 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.
L574927 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What?
L574926 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ He's brought in the heavy mob.
L574925 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Huh?
L574924 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Butcher's hook.  Look.  I don't much reckon those minders of his.
L574923 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Who'd you butcher at the house?
L574922 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Gate's open.  I had a butcher's at the house.
L574921 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Told you you wouldn't be able to see through that gate.
L574725 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Oh, Jenny was in my acting class.
L574724 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ How'd the two of you hook up, then?
L574723 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No, no -- Jenny used to work as a waitress.  Before she met him.  But that's not where she met me.  Not in my restaurant.
L574722 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ And that's where you met Jenny.
L574721 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work.  That's not where they met.
L574720 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Hang about.  I thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny.
L574719 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Jenny told me she met him at the beach. Got blinded by his smile.  You believe that shit?  Son of a bitch never smiled at me.  Buried her at a "private" service.  Private for who. Him?
L574718 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Well, there you are.  Jen must've liked him.
L574717 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Five years, I think.  Long time.
L574716 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ It's only insurance.  Can't be too careful.  This Terry Valentine, he's probably a wonderful fella.  They were together how long?
L574715 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Now what.  You gonna take your new arsenal, go visit Terry Valentine, just like that?  Boom bam boom.
L574714 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Fucking out of order, that.  Shouldn't be allowed.
L574713 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You hadda show up on a weekend.  This weekend.  Wouldn't've even been a gun show ... for another month.
L574708 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ I mean, it's already a steal, n'it -- what you said -- four hundred for this one?
L574707 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Not me, man.
L574706 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ No.  Not at all.  Do we?
L574702 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Don't have time for a lot of paperwork, y'know.  Just popped over on a quick visit.
L574701 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ He don't have a concealed weapons permit.
L574681 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Travelling on a dodgy passport, n' all.
L574680 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Probation?  Man, you crazy.  They shouldn't've let you outta your country, much less prison.
L574679 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Sod that.  Gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where I've skived off to.
L574678 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Are you a resident of California? You gonna fill out forms, man?  Do the background check?  Go through a three-day waiting period?
L574677 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Thought perhaps there'd be dispensing machines, you know.  Bung in your coins, come out with a .44 Magnum, fully-loaded.
L574676 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ These are not guys you can just go run a number on, man.
L574675 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages?
L574674 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You're kiddin' me, right?
L574670 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ But that's not me anymore.  That's when I was into the gang lifestyle.  That's not who I am now.  Five years in the joint -- that's it for me, man.
L574669 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Nick's a nick, n' it?  No matter what state you're in.  State of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught.
L574668 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I already told you, man.  Corcoran.  Know what that is?  State prison.
L574667 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service.
L574666 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what you think.
L574665 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass or whatever?
L574664 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ She didn't know what to say.  I thought someone should say something. To someone.  With me it was, I don't know -- Jenny liked me for some reason.  I felt like I owed her.
L574663 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ She didn't write to me, did she.
L574662 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You should talk to Elaine.  That was her best friend.
L574661 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Those streets up in the hills, man. Gotta be real careful, keep your eye on the ball.  Two o'clock in the morning, it's dark, your mind is all agitated, you're drivin' a little too fast ...  Those curves don't kid around.
L574660 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.
L574659 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What you gonna do, man?  You gonna go to the cops?
L574656 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Valentine wasn't even there.  If he was into something, if she was involved -- who can say.  But I'll tell you something.  She stood in front of these dudes, man.  Eyeballing <u>them</u>.  Checking <u>them</u> out.  I felt like she was covering <u>my</u> ass that day.
L574655 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Did Jenny know?
L574654 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Bad place, man.  Bad people.  Some guys loading some trucks.  Some kinda deal goin' down.  I don't know and I don't care.  Maybe they're shipping fava beans to Eskimos.
L574653 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Where abouts?
L574652 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ That's what I thought, man.  But it was not a hotel or nothin' that we went to. It was someplace else.
L574651 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ What, tryin' to catch him with another bird?
L574649 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ I only asked.
L574648 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I go to work, try to keep my life together, put all that shit behind me, man.  What d'you want from me.
L574647 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You kiddin', man?  I don't need a wife and screamin' kids.  I still got my youth.
L574646 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ This ain't your lot?
L574645 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I knew when I was droppin' that letter into the mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face.  I did my time, okay?  My sister, her ol' man's up in Chino right now doin' eight years.
L574644 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Y'what?
L574643 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Boomerang.
L574641 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I dunno ... Maybe they do.
L574640 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ No, not my girl.  Self-control, she had. Point of pride.  And people don't change, do they.
L574639 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Coulda happened to anyone, man.  I never knew her to be reckless.  I mean, sure, she would smoke a little grass, or something, have a few drinks.  But that's it, nothing more than that.
L574638 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I'm just sayin' -- it was a steep hillside.  There was no moon that night ...
L574637 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ What more is there.
L574633 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I dunno.  What's he gonna say?  They had a fight that night, she drove away, she was upset?  I don't even know the guy. Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were friends, but we didn't travel in the same social circles.  She had her life, I had mine.
L574632 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Valentine.  What's he got to say for himself?

L574630 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ This bloke she was bunked up with.  This Terry what'sit.
L574628 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ No, but between the lines, eh? Mysterious circumstances, and that.
L574627 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I never said nothin' about nothin' like that.  No, no, no.  That's not what I wrote to you.
L574625 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Snuffed her.

L574623 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Who done it, then?
L574622 +++$+++ u8142 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ It was better than a telegram.
L574621 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I didn't even know who I was writing to -- just someone with the same last name. She never talked about any family.

L575310 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I'd rather be with him than without him. I don't want to be found dead in L.A.
L575309 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I thought maybe you just came for the ride.
L575308 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Hard to miss.
L575307 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ ... Reminds me of Jennifer.
L575305 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ No, but I know what he means.
L575304 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Hey, Elaine.  You even know what he's saying half the time?
L575245 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Hell, no.  I started writing.

L575240 +++$+++ u8131 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Really.
L575239 +++$+++ u8130 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I was gonna be in that Michael Mann movie, you know -- with Pacino and DeNiro.  Got three callbacks.
