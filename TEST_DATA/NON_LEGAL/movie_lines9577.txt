L65389 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Frequently played, seldom remarked.
L65388 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right there.
L65387 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Sure you could!  And yet many writers do everything in their power to insulate themselves from the common man – from where they live, from where they trade, from where they fight and love and converse and – and – and... so naturally their work suffers, and regresses into empty formalism and – well, I'm spouting off again, but to put it in your language, the theater becomes as phony as a three dollar bill.
L65386 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ And I could tell you some stories –
L65385 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Exactly, Charlie! You understand what I'm saying – a lot more than some of these literary types. Because you're a real man!
L65384 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I can feel my butt getting sore already.
L65383 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Well, I don't mean to get up on my high horse, but why shouldn't we look at ourselves up there?  Who cares about the Fifth Earl of Bastrop and Lady Higginbottom and – and – and who killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons?
L65382 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I can see you feel pretty strongly about it.
L65381 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ And that's the point, that we all have stories. The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life – why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater?  Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater.
L65380 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Hell, I could tell you some stories–
L65379 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ ...I don't guess this means much to you.
L65378 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way, that's exactly the point. There's a few people in New York – hopefully our numbers are growing – who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience, create a theater for the masses that's based on a few simple truths – not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that doesn't hold true today, if they ever did...
L65377 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Well ain't that a kick in the head!
L65376 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Well, that's a good question. Strange as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I write about people like you. The average working stiff. The common man.
L65375 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Caught me trying to be fancy! Yeah, that's it, Bart.
L65374 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ What do I write about?
L65373 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality. What kind of venue, that is to say, thematically, uh...
L65372 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ That's okay, Charlie. I'm a playwright. My shows've only played New York. Last one got a hell of a write-up in the Herald. I guess that's why they wanted me here.
L65371 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Oh, it's an exciting time then. I'm not the best-read mug on the planet, so I guess it's no surprise I didn't recognize your name. Jesus, I feel like a heel.
L65370 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ That's okay; actually I am just starting out in the movies – though I was pretty well established in New York, some renown there,
L65369 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ ...Is the egg showing or what?!
L65367 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Pictures! Jesus!
L65366 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now –
L65365 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What kind of scribbler are you – newspaperman did you say?
L65364 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
L65363 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people – that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need – a fella could do worse.
L65362 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Doesn't surprise me at all.
L65361 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ ...In spite of what you might think from tonight, I'm pretty good at it.
L65360 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Hell no! Call me Charlie. Well Barton, you might say I sell peace of mind. Insurance is my game – door-to-door, human contact, still the only way to move merchandise.
L65359 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ And what's your line, Mr. Meadows?
L65358 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Damned difficult, I'd imagine.
L65357 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Can be. Not easy, but –
L65356 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You don't say. That's a tough racket. My hat's off to anyone who can make a go of it. Damned interesting work, I'd imagine.
L65355 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Well, I'm a writer, actually.
L65354 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you don't mind my asking?
L65353 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ That's okay, I assure you. It's just that I was trying to work –
L65352 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Yeah, just a nip. I feel like hell, all the carryings-on next door.
L65351 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Okay... a quick one, sure...
L65350 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ ... You got a glass? It's the least I can do.
L65349 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ All right, hell, you trying to work and me carrying on in there. Look, the liquor's good, wuddya say?
L65348 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ That's all right, really, thank you.
L65347 +++$+++ u3866 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Neighbor, I'd feel better about the damned inconvenience if you'd let me buy you a drink.
L65993 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ I tried to show you something beautiful.  Something about all of US –
L65992 +++$+++ u3871 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ LIPNIK +++$+++ You didn't let ME down. Or even Lou. We don't live or die by what you scribble, Fink. You let Ben Geisler down. He liked you. Trusted you. And that's why he's gone. Fired.  That guy had a heart as big as the outdoors, and you fucked him. He tried to convince me to fire you too, but that would be too easy. No, you're under contract and you're gonna stay that way.  Anything you write will be the property of Capitol Pictures. And Capitol Pictures will not produce anything you write. Not until you grow up a little. You ain't no writer, Fink – you're a goddamn write-off.
L65991 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ I'm sorry if I let you down.
L65986 +++$+++ u3871 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ LIPNIK +++$+++ I had to call Beery this morning, let him know we were pushing the picture back.  After all I'd told him about quality, about that Barton Fink feeling. How disappointed we were. Wally was heartbroken. The man was devastated. He was – well, I didn't actually call him, Lou did. But that's a fair description, isn't it Lou?
L65985 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Yes sir.
L65984 +++$+++ u3871 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ LIPNIK +++$+++ Don't gas me, Fink. If you're opinion mattered, then I guess I'd resign and let YOU run the the studio. It doesn't and you won't, and the lunatics are not going to run THIS particular asylum. So let's put a stop to THAT rumor right now.
L65983 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ With all due respect, sir, I think it's the best work I've done.
L65982 +++$+++ u3871 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ LIPNIK +++$+++ ...I gotta tell you, Fink. It won't wash.
L65981 +++$+++ u3871 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ LIPNIK +++$+++ Anyway, I had Lou read your script for me.
L65980 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Yes sir, they –
L65979 +++$+++ u3871 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ LIPNIK +++$+++ Actually it hasn't officially gone through yet. Had wardrobe whip this up. You gotta pull teeth to get anything done in this town. I can understand a little red tape in peacetime, but now it's all-out warfare against the Japs. Little yellow bastards.  They'd love to see me sit this one out.
L65978 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Congratulations.
L65977 +++$+++ u3871 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ LIPNIK +++$+++ ...I was commissioned yesterday in the Army Reserve. Henry Morgenthau arranged it. He's a dear friend.
L65975 +++$+++ u3871 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ LIPNIK +++$+++ Colonel Lipnik, if you don't mind.
L65974 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Mr. Lipnik.
L65973 +++$+++ u3871 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ LIPNIK +++$+++ Fink.
L65783 +++$+++ u3871 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ LIPNIK +++$+++ Ah, forget it, kid. I want you to pull this out of your head. If that sonofabitch wouldn't apologize to you, goddammit, I will. I respect your artistry and your methods, and if you can't fill us in yet, well hell, we should be kissing your feet for your fine efforts.
L65782 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much better if you could reconsider –
L65781 +++$+++ u3871 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ LIPNIK +++$+++ You don't have to cover for him. It's noble of you, but these things happen in business.
L65780 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been a great help –
L65779 +++$+++ u3871 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ LIPNIK +++$+++ I apologize, Barton.
L65778 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Mr. Lipnik, I –
L65776 +++$+++ u3871 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ LIPNIK +++$+++ KISS THIS MAN'S FEET!!
L65775 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ I – Mr. Lipnik –
L65765 +++$+++ u3871 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ LIPNIK +++$+++ CAN you?  You damn well better be. Jesus, if I hadn't been honest in my business dealings – well, of course, you can't always be honest, not with the sharks swimming around this town – but if you're a writer, you don't think about those things – if I'd been totally honest, I wouldn't be within a mile of this pool – unless I was cleaning it. But that's no reason for you not to be. Honest, I mean.  Not cleaning the pool.
L65764 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ ...Can I be honest, Mr. Lipnik?
L65763 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ And then... well...
L65762 +++$+++ u3871 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ LIPNIK +++$+++ Great! He's poor, this wrestler! He's had to struggle!
L65761 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ ...It's a tenement building. On the Lower East Side...
L65757 +++$+++ u3871 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ LIPNIK +++$+++ Boy! You writers! Work hard, play hard!  That's what I hear, anyway...
L65756 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Yeah... rye whiskey?
L65336 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ ...Both maybe?
L65335 +++$+++ u3871 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ LIPNIK +++$+++ ...Well Bart, which is it? Orphan? Dame?
L65327 +++$+++ u3871 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ LIPNIK +++$+++ Lou.
L65326 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ ...Yes, thank you.
L65325 +++$+++ u3871 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ LIPNIK +++$+++ That's okay, that's okay, that's okay – that's just fine. You probably just walked in here thinking that was going to be a handicap, thinking we wanted people who knew something about the medium, maybe even thinking there was all kind of technical mumbo- jumbo to learn. You were dead wrong. We're only interested in one thing: Can you tell a story, Bart?  Can you make us laugh, can you make us cry, can you make us wanna break out in joyous song? Is that more than one thing? Okay.  The point is, I run this dump and I don't know the technical mumbo-jumbo. Why do I run it? I've got horse-sense, goddamnit. Showmanship. And also, and I hope Lou told you this, I bigger and meaner than any other kike in this town. Did you tell him that, Lou? And I don't mean my dick's bigger than yours, it's not a sexual thing – although, you're the writer, you would know more about that. Coffee?
L65324 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ To be honest, I don't go to the pictures much, Mr. Lipnik –
L65321 +++$+++ u3871 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ LIPNIK +++$+++ Less Hollywood?  Sure, say it, it's not a dirty word. Sat whatever the hell you want. The writer is king here at Capitol Pictures. You don't believe me, take a look at your paycheck at the end of every week – that's what we think of the writer.  ...so what kind of pictures does he like?
L65320 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Thanks, but I wanted a place that was less...
L65319 +++$+++ u3871 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ LIPNIK +++$+++ Never heard of it. Let's move him to the Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell, he can stay at my place.
L65318 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ I'm at the Earle.
L65317 +++$+++ u3871 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ LIPNIK +++$+++ ...Where did we put him?
L65301 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ The others are being sent.
L65300 +++$+++ u3867 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ ...Those your only bags?
L65297 +++$+++ u3867 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ Don't you wanna go to your room?!
L65296 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ What –
L65295 +++$+++ u3867 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ Okey-dokey, go ahead.
L65294 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Huh?
L65293 +++$+++ u3867 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ ...Okay
L65291 +++$+++ u3867 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ Kitchen closes at eight but I'm the night clerk. I can always ring out for sandwiches.
L65290 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Well, I'm going to be working here, mostly at night; I'm a writer. Do you have room service?
L65289 +++$+++ u3867 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ Rez. That'll be twenty-five fifty a week payable in advance. Checkout time is twelve sharp, only you can forget that on account you're a rez. If you need anything, anything at all, you dial zero on your personal in-room telephone and talk to me. My name is Chet.
L65288 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ I don't know... I mean, I'll be here, uh, indefinitely.
L65287 +++$+++ u3867 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ Transient or resident?
L65286 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Excuse me?
L65285 +++$+++ u3867 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ ...Are you a tranz or a rez?
L65284 +++$+++ u3867 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ Okay then, everything seems to be in order. Everything seems to be in order.
L65283 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Must be.
L65282 +++$+++ u3867 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ F-I-N-K. Fink, Barton. That must be you, huh?
L65281 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ I'm checking in. Barton Fink.
L65280 +++$+++ u3867 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ Welcome to the Hotel Earle. May I help you, sir?
L65934 +++$+++ u3873 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MASTRIONOTTI +++$+++ You're a sick fuck, Fink.
L65933 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Sex?! He's a MAN! We WRESTLED!
L65926 +++$+++ u3873 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MASTRIONOTTI +++$+++ No kidding, bright boy – we smelt Mundt all over this. Was he the idea man?
L65925 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Charlie... Charlie's back...
L65850 +++$+++ u3873 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MASTRIONOTTI +++$+++ Funny. As in, he likes to ventilate people with a shotgun and then cut their heads off.
L65849 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ What did... What did he –
L65842 +++$+++ u3873 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MASTRIONOTTI +++$+++ That's right, Fink, he lives next door to you.
L65841 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ ...Yeah, he... he lives next door to me.
L65839 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Nine days – Tuesday –
L65838 +++$+++ u3873 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MASTRIONOTTI +++$+++ Is this multiple choice?
L65835 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Yeah.
L65834 +++$+++ u3873 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MASTRIONOTTI +++$+++ Jesus! Ain't that a load off! You live in 605?
L65822 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L65821 +++$+++ u3873 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MASTRIONOTTI +++$+++ L.A.P.D.
L65940 +++$+++ u3873 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MASTRIONOTTI +++$+++ ...Fred...
L65939 +++$+++ u3868 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ DEUTSCH +++$+++ Why's it so goddamn hot out here?
L65932 +++$+++ u3868 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ DEUTSCH +++$+++ You two have some sick sex thing?
L65931 +++$+++ u3873 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MASTRIONOTTI +++$+++ He teach you to do it?
L65928 +++$+++ u3873 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MASTRIONOTTI +++$+++ Only fry you once.
L65927 +++$+++ u3868 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ DEUTSCH +++$+++ Tell us where the heads are, maybe they'll go easy on you.
L65923 +++$+++ u3868 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ DEUTSCH +++$+++ Give you nose bleeds?
L65922 +++$+++ u3873 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MASTRIONOTTI +++$+++ Sixth floor too high for you, Fink?
L65921 +++$+++ u3868 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ DEUTSCH +++$+++ You didn't tell us you knew the dame.
L65920 +++$+++ u3873 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MASTRIONOTTI +++$+++ Second one of your friends to end up dead.
L65917 +++$+++ u3868 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ DEUTSCH +++$+++ I dunno, Duke. I kinda liked it.
L65916 +++$+++ u3873 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MASTRIONOTTI +++$+++ ...I thought you said you were a writer.
L65874 +++$+++ u3873 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MASTRIONOTTI +++$+++ Fink. That's a Jewish name, isn't it?
L65873 +++$+++ u3868 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ DEUTSCH +++$+++ Ya see how he's not writing it down?
L65872 +++$+++ u3873 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MASTRIONOTTI +++$+++ Ya know, Fink, ordinarily we say anything you might remember could be helpful. But I'll be frank with you: That is not helpful.
L65868 +++$+++ u3873 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MASTRIONOTTI +++$+++ No reputable company would hire a guy like that.
L65867 +++$+++ u3868 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ DEUTSCH +++$+++ Yeah, and he's Buck Rogers.
L65863 +++$+++ u3873 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MASTRIONOTTI +++$+++ But, you know, with the head still on.
L65862 +++$+++ u3868 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ DEUTSCH +++$+++ Female caucasian, thirty years old. Nice tits. No head. You ever see Mundt with anyone meets that description?
L65861 +++$+++ u3873 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MASTRIONOTTI +++$+++ Hollywood precinct finds another stiff yesterday. Not too far from here. This one's better looking than the doc.
L65860 +++$+++ u3868 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ DEUTSCH +++$+++ Anyway.
L65859 +++$+++ u3873 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MASTRIONOTTI +++$+++ Good luck with no fuckin' head.
L65858 +++$+++ u3868 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ DEUTSCH +++$+++ Physician, heal thyself.
L65857 +++$+++ u3873 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MASTRIONOTTI +++$+++ Well, some of his throat was there.
L65856 +++$+++ u3868 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ DEUTSCH +++$+++ All of which he's now missin'.
L65855 +++$+++ u3873 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MASTRIONOTTI +++$+++ Doctor. Ear, nose and throat man,.
L65854 +++$+++ u3868 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ DEUTSCH +++$+++ Couple of days ago we see the same M.O. out in Los Feliz.
L65853 +++$+++ u3873 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MASTRIONOTTI +++$+++ Started in Kansas City. Couple of housewives.
L65848 +++$+++ u3868 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ DEUTSCH +++$+++ He's a little funny in the head.
L65847 +++$+++ u3873 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MASTRIONOTTI +++$+++ Also known as Madman Mundt.
L65846 +++$+++ u3868 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ DEUTSCH +++$+++ His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.
L65845 +++$+++ u3873 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MASTRIONOTTI +++$+++ Yeah, and I'm Buck Rogers.
L65830 +++$+++ u3873 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MASTRIONOTTI +++$+++ Would that be good enough for ya?
L65829 +++$+++ u3868 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ DEUTSCH +++$+++ You want my partner to kiss your ass?
L65828 +++$+++ u3873 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MASTRIONOTTI +++$+++ Big fuckin' deal.
L65824 +++$+++ u3873 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MASTRIONOTTI +++$+++ What do you do, Fink?
L65823 +++$+++ u3868 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ DEUTSCH +++$+++ Got a couple questions to ask ya.
L65990 +++$+++ u3871 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ LIPNIK +++$+++ Look at "Blood, Sweat, and Canvas". These are big movies, Fink. About big men, in tights – both physically and mentally. But especially physically. We don't put Wallace Beery in some fruity movie about suffering – I thought we were together on that.
L65989 +++$+++ u3872 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ "Blood, Sweat, and Canvas".
L65988 +++$+++ u3871 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ LIPNIK +++$+++ Hell, I could take you through it step by step, explain why your story stinks, but I won't insult your intelligence. Well all right, first of all: This is a wrestling picture; the audience wants to see action, drama, wrestling, and plenty of it. They don't wanna see a guy wrestling with his soul – well, all right, a little bit, for the critics – but you make it the carrot that wags the dog. Too much of it and they head for exits and I don't blame 'em. There's plenty of poetry right inside that ring, Fink. Look at "Hell Ten Feet Square".
L65987 +++$+++ u3872 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Yes, Colonel.
L65774 +++$+++ u3872 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Mr. Lipnik, please –
L65773 +++$+++ u3871 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ LIPNIK +++$+++ Get down on your knees, you sonofabitch!  Get down on your knees and kiss this man's feet!
L65771 +++$+++ u3871 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ LIPNIK +++$+++ This man creates for a living! He puts food on your table and on mine! THANK him for it!  Thank him, you ungrateful sonofabitch! Thank him or YOU'RE fired!
L65770 +++$+++ u3872 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Mr. Lipnik, I –
L65338 +++$+++ u3871 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ LIPNIK +++$+++ Ah, hell, let Bart take a crack at it.  He'll get into the swing of things or I don't know writers. Let's make it a dame, Bart, keep it simple. We don't gotta tackle the world our first time out. The important thing is we all have that Barton Fink feeling, but since you're Barton Fink I'm assuming you have it in spades.  Seriously Bart, I like you. We're off to a good start. Dammit, if all our writers were like you I wouldn't have to get so goddamn involved. I'd like to see something by the end of the week.
L65337 +++$+++ u3872 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ ...Maybe we should do a treatment.
L65334 +++$+++ u3871 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ LIPNIK +++$+++ Okay, the hell with the story. Wallace Beery is a wrestler. I wanna know his hopes, his dreams. Naturally, he'll have to get mixed up with a bad element. And a romantic interest. You know the drill.  Romantic interest, or else a young kid. An orphan. What do you think, Lou? Wally a little too old for a romantic interest?  Look at me, a writer in the room and I'm askin' Lou what the goddamn story should be!
L65333 +++$+++ u3872 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ No, not yet Jack. We just bought the story. Saturday Evening Post.
L65332 +++$+++ u3871 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ LIPNIK +++$+++ We got a treatment on it yet?
L65331 +++$+++ u3872 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Excellent picture.
L65330 +++$+++ u3871 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ LIPNIK +++$+++ ...Thanks Lou. Join us. Join us. Talking about the Wallace Beery picture.
L65323 +++$+++ u3871 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ LIPNIK +++$+++ How's about it, Bart?
L65322 +++$+++ u3872 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Mr. Fink hasn't given a preference, Mr.  Lipnik.
L67681 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Who are you guys gonna sell my file to this time?
L67680 +++$+++ u3876 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ AN I.A. MAN +++$+++ I want you in Dr. Gardner's office at nine o'clock.  You're out of control, Curran.
L67511 +++$+++ u3876 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ AN I.A. MAN +++$+++ Going after him before gets you off the hook for killing him that's your alibi.
L67510 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Come on -- I'm going to storm into his office in front of everybody in the afternoon and then that night I'm going to kill him?  I'd have to be really dumb to do that.
L67507 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What are you gonna do -- charge me with smoking?

L67489 +++$+++ u3876 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ AN I.A. MAN +++$+++ Do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone?
L67488 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Okay.  I went after him.  I lost my temper.

L67775 +++$+++ u3877 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ I can get my butt kicked for this. You're not supposed to be in here.
L67535 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Thanks.
L67534 +++$+++ u3877 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ The boat blew.  There was a leak in the gas line.  There were two previous repairs.  There was a five-mil policy on both of 'em.  A real heavy investigation.  Zilch. Goose-egg.  It was an accident.
L67533 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ You know I'm whacko, Sam, what'd you find?
L67532 +++$+++ u3877 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ You're on leave, man.  You're on psycho leave.  I'm talking to a possible whacko here.
L67531 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Did you find out about her parents?
L67530 +++$+++ u3877 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Take care, you hear?
L67395 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ She was there, wasn't she?
L67394 +++$+++ u3877 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ We got a call from Berkeley P.D. There was a killing.  A professor. Icepick.  In his bed.  Multiple stab wounds.  1977.
