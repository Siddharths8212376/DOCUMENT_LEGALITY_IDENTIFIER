L616675 +++$+++ u8498 +++$+++ m576 +++$+++ WYATT +++$+++ What about all these saloons?
L617630 +++$+++ u8509 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ M +++$+++ GET BOND OUT OF THERE.
L617629 +++$+++ u8499 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ ADMIRAL ROEBUCK +++$+++ It's too late -
L617614 +++$+++ u8509 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Bring up the tracking satellite. And get 007 out of there.
L617613 +++$+++ u8499 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ ADMIRAL ROEBUCK +++$+++ I appreciate your assistance, M. But this is now a military operation.
L617607 +++$+++ u8499 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ ADMIRAL ROEBUCK +++$+++ - Thank you, M. But this is more than your man can handle.  Are we in agreement?
L617606 +++$+++ u8509 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ M +++$+++ But -
L617594 +++$+++ u8509 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ M +++$+++ What do they say in Russia, General Bukharin? 
L617593 +++$+++ u8499 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ ADMIRAL ROEBUCK +++$+++ - I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a naval operation.
L617592 +++$+++ u8509 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ M +++$+++ ... What were you saying, Admiral? Something about this 'not being a job for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing playboy spy?'
L618021 +++$+++ u8510 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ MINISTER JOHNSTONE +++$+++ I expect to have that gold recovered in 36 hours. Until then, I'm imposing my own electronic silence: For the sake of the economy, not a word to NATO, the press, the CIA.  ...And so long as Commander Bond here seems to be such an expert on these matters, I want him to go along as an observer. Are we agreed?
L618020 +++$+++ u8499 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ ADMIRAL ROEBUCK +++$+++ 36 hours. They've already sailed from the Persian gulf.
L618019 +++$+++ u8510 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ MINISTER JOHNSTONE +++$+++ At least we know where the gold is. When are the recovery ships due?
L618017 +++$+++ u8510 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ MINISTER JOHNSTONE +++$+++ And I have the entire British economy to worry about.
L618016 +++$+++ u8499 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ ADMIRAL ROEBUCK +++$+++ I resent your tone, sir. I have men who are missing -
L618015 +++$+++ u8510 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ MINISTER JOHNSTONE +++$+++ Why wasn't the ship protected?!?! Why was it sailing without radar?
L617999 +++$+++ u8510 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ MINISTER JOHNSTONE +++$+++ Admiral, are you suggesting -
L617998 +++$+++ u8499 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ ADMIRAL ROEBUCK +++$+++ Excuse me, but -  I must formally protest this meeting. Given the nature of what's occurred - and the need for secrecy - I see no reason to involve the air force, the army, or MI-6.  This is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her Majesty's Royal Navy.
L617997 +++$+++ u8510 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ MINISTER JOHNSTONE +++$+++ Good evening. I've just spoken with the Prime Minister at the economic summit in Tokyo; he's expecting a full update within the hour.  For those of you still unaware, some forty minutes ago -
L618520 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ Take the girl. Leave the handcuffs. We'll drown her at sea.
L618519 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I'd rather die alone.
L618508 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ What about the gold?
L618507 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ ...As the advertising says: Tomorrow never lies.
L618494 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ Chernobyl will look like a campfire.
L618493 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ - Instant melt-down.
L618492 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ Precisely, Mr. Bond. In a matter of minutes, the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor...  And when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium -
L618491 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ ...So that's what the weapons grade uranium was for.
L618448 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ My guards are from South Africa, Mr. Bond. This is their chance to get even with the formerly 'Great' Britain.  Now both of you. Put your hands on your heads, and step forward.
L618447 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Are your guards really going to kill a helpless girl?
L618347 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ Good-bye, Mister Bond.
L618346 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I'm sure they will.
L618335 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Sidney, perhaps we should leave this to -
L618334 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ ...And what's that, my dear?
L618327 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ Don't pout, Sidney. I invited him here hoping he might shed some light on your story. He's from 'Lloyd's of London.'  ...Aren't you, Mr. Bond?
L618326 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Briefly.
L618321 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ Your choice.  Look at the time! Come. There's someone I want you meet - about a story I'm thinking of publishing.
L618320 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ ...Words to live by?
L618319 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ You see, Mr. Bond, you and I are both men of action. But your era is passing. Words are the new weapons; satellites the new artillery. And make no mistake about it: In the right hands, they can be as deadly as your Walther PPK.
L618314 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ Fantastic idea Mr. Bond! Perhaps I should buy it for a book! It's totally preposterous, but -  You amuse me. ...And now perhaps I can amuse you.
L618313 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Or disinformation... If you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course? Maybe one degree a minute?
L618312 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ They're merely tools to disseminate information.
L618311 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ ...Although it must be fun to have all those satellites.
L618310 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ And still not a thing to watch.
L618309 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ Welcome to the new world order, Mr. Bond.  Churchill had his armies; Caesar had his legions; I have my divisions:  News, sports, business, entertainment. And these are my foot soldiers:  2000 people working on 14 floors to feed 300 newspapers, 4 cable news networks, 87 magazines, and 29 different cable TV channels - in 35 languages.
L618308 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ Because it's a dying city. Since the Chinese take-over, who knows what can happen tomorrow?  In any case, this is my father, Charles: A royal bastard who started the first radio and television stations. Said I'd never amount to anything, but...  I turned it into this
L618307 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ So why did you leave?
L618306 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ My third great Uncle - the Earl of Aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of Hong Kong from the Chinese.  His son-in-law - George Harmsway - made the first family fortune, running opium into Shanghai...  His son, Thomas, who lost it, smoking the opium... And my grandfather Henry, who opened the first telegraph station, and published the colony's first English newspaper.  It was a city of unlimited possibility.
L618305 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Yes. I can see: You've hung the rest of your relatives.
L618304 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ I call this the Rogue's gallery.
L618303 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Sightseeing.
L618302 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ By the way - what is it that brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mister Bond?
L618301 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I can feel your pain.
L618300 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ Still, I do miss her. I only wish she could have lived to see all this.
L618299 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ The only difference between a psychopath and a genius, Mr. Bond, is the degree of success.
L618298 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I wonder if it runs in the family.
L618297 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ I tried to save her. But she remained a manic depressive: Fits, inappropriate behavior... Delusions of grandeur.
L618296 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I see.
L618295 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ Before I became involved with Paris, she was always involved with the most inappropriate' men...  Playboys. Thrill seekers. Middle aged Peter Pans who only brought out the worst in her.
L618289 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ Come. Let's get out of the noise.  - I'll give you a tour of the building, then we'll talk.
L618288 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Sir Elliot.
L618287 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ Mr. Bond! Nice to see you.
L618279 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I'm on my way.
L618278 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information.  Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes?
L618277 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ How did you get this number?
L617874 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ We'll see about that.
L617873 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ A piece of advice, Mr. Bond: Don't screw with a man who buys ink by the ton.  It's deadlier than uranium.
L617872 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours?
L617871 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ I hope you've enjoyed this little charade.
L617854 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ I can tell you're a man with an eye for exquisite possessions, Mr. Bond.  Darling! Come here.  I want you to meet my wife.
L617853 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ It's a beautiful boat, Sir Elliot. Practically glows in the dark.
L617851 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ You might say I've always been one of Mr. Valentin's biggest followers.
L617850 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ Always nice to meet one of her Majesty's fellow subjects...  Especially one with such distinguished friends.
L618135 +++$+++ u8501 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ CAPTAIN CHEONG +++$+++ Him? He, is a she -  at the bar.
L618134 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Where can I find him?
L618133 +++$+++ u8501 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ CAPTAIN CHEONG +++$+++ Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch. Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody knows more about the Strait.
L618132 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I appreciate your time -
L618131 +++$+++ u8501 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ CAPTAIN CHEONG +++$+++ Next morning. Both boats. Nothing wrong.  My 90 year old grandfather thinks 'Ghost in the computer - Silicon Dragon.'
L618130 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Did you test the auto-pilots? The satellite positioning receiver?
L618129 +++$+++ u8501 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ CAPTAIN CHEONG +++$+++ The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night. Captain blamed the auto-pilot; I suspected he was drunk - until the Sumatra ferry captain had same problem.
L618128 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L618127 +++$+++ u8501 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ CAPTAIN CHEONG +++$+++ Sometimes kill the crew; other times -  Torture them.
L618126 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I know. Pirates from Sumatra want the cargo; smugglers from Thailand and Burma want the ships.
L618125 +++$+++ u8501 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ CAPTAIN CHEONG +++$+++ In the Strait of Malacca, when a boat is even five minutes late, one begins to worry, Mr. Bond.
L617706 +++$+++ u8511 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ MONEYPENNY +++$+++ No, 007. It's just that I've learned from personal experience - that when we get what we want -  Somehow the reality is never as... Satisfying as the fantasy.
L617705 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ What - no lust for adventure?
L617704 +++$+++ u8511 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ MONEYPENNY +++$+++ Not all of us, 007.
L617703 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ - We all want what we can't have?
L617702 +++$+++ u8511 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ MONEYPENNY +++$+++ Actually, I've never known you to do either... But -
L617701 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Moneypenny! How indiscreet! Have you ever known me to kiss and tell?
L617700 +++$+++ u8511 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ MONEYPENNY +++$+++ By the way, James: Ordinarily I would never ask, but... Weren't you and that Colonel once stranded on a raft for two weeks in the Sargasso Sea?
L617699 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ In the darkest moments, it's what I live for. Especially since I've heard how much you like to watch... On the hidden camera.
L617698 +++$+++ u8511 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ MONEYPENNY +++$+++ Hello, James. Enjoy your meeting?
L617697 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Moneypenny! We've got to stop meeting like this. They may be on to us.
L617663 +++$+++ u8511 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ MONEYPENNY +++$+++ Ah, James. You always were a cunning linguist... Au revoir, mon cher.
L617662 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Tsi tien, Chien-penny.
L617661 +++$+++ u8511 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ MONEYPENNY +++$+++ Four o'clock. Don't be late.
L617660 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ 4:30. It may take me a little longer to wrap things up here.
L617659 +++$+++ u8511 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ MONEYPENNY +++$+++ Four o'clock. M will meet you in the conference room.
L617658 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Moneypenny... Here I was, finally getting a feel for a new tongue -
L617657 +++$+++ u8511 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ MONEYPENNY +++$+++ I'm sure she is, James. But I'm afraid you'll have to 'kiss off' the rest of your lessons this afternoon.
L618181 +++$+++ u8514 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ Q +++$+++ Don't even think about it. 007. They're my granddaughters.
L618180 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I must say, Q, you seem to be doing rather well in your retirement.
L618179 +++$+++ u8514 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ Q +++$+++ Standard equipment. The world's automobile manufacturers seem to be in some kind of mad war to see who can provide the most beverage cup holders.
L618178 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ ... 17 Beverage cup holders?
L618177 +++$+++ u8514 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ Q +++$+++ Yes. And do try to keep all four of them on the road.  All the usual refinements: Smoke, missiles, machine guns -  Fully operational remote control. Drives forward, reverse -  Stop that!  Plus infrared thermal imaging radar, heads up instrumentation, and 17 beverage cup holders.
L618176 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ - Four wheel drive?
L618175 +++$+++ u8514 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ Q +++$+++ Your new car. 
L618174 +++$+++ u8514 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ Q +++$+++ I don't care who you dial, so long as it's not me. Next -
L618173 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Do I have to dial '9' to get out?
L618172 +++$+++ u8514 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ Q +++$+++ Not a clue. I didn't lose the ship.  Next, your new personal communicator.  Picture-phone, fax, beeper.
L618171 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Do you have any idea of what any of that means? In English?
L618170 +++$+++ u8514 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ Q +++$+++ That hardly makes up for the imposition.  Now, for what I hope will be the very last time - pay attention, 007.  First, computer generated retrograde analysis map. Body here, meteorolog- ical influences here, likely vector- ing of the ship's coordinates here.
L618169 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I'm sorry. It was a national emergency -
L618168 +++$+++ u8514 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ Q +++$+++ Retired. I'm not getting paid to help you save the world anymore.
L618167 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Q! How are you?
L618268 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I know what I saw -
L618267 +++$+++ u8502 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ CAPTAIN MORTON +++$+++ That's absurd! It took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold.
L618266 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Yes, the ship is down there. But the gold is gone.
L618265 +++$+++ u8502 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ CAPTAIN MORTON +++$+++ What are you talking about? We went through all this and the ship isn't even down there?
L618264 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ ...That's all well and good, Captain, save for one thing:  There's no gold down there.
L618263 +++$+++ u8502 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ CAPTAIN MORTON +++$+++ Yes. The famous James Bond. I've heard all about you, sir. You were under direct orders to act as an observer - and yet you had to go off, on your own, like some half-assed CIA cowboy -  Endangering the gold, attracting that lunatic woman, and then putting in a distress call for us to save your bloody hide.
L618262 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Don't you think you're overreacting?
L618245 +++$+++ u8502 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ CAPTAIN MORTON +++$+++ Get them out of here. If he says one word, shoot him.
L618244 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Wait a minute -
L618243 +++$+++ u8502 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ CAPTAIN MORTON +++$+++ Guard! Arrest these men! Escort them to the cutter!
L618242 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Yes -
L617865 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ One thing at a time. I'll see you in twenty minutes. Go.
L617864 +++$+++ u8513 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ PARIS +++$+++ Just - say it. Say it just once.
L617862 +++$+++ u8513 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ PARIS +++$+++ He didn't want anyone to know. He kept it out of the papers. He said a third wife was bad for his image.  You've got to protect me!
L617861 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
L617860 +++$+++ u8513 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ PARIS +++$+++ Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
L617859 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Paris -
L617802 +++$+++ u8513 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ PARIS +++$+++ Just hold me.
L617801 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Shhhhh...
L617800 +++$+++ u8513 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ PARIS +++$+++ I'm so sorry, James. I promise, I'll never leave you again.
L617799 +++$+++ u8513 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ PARIS +++$+++ It's on the boat. He's holding a press conference tomorrow.
L617798 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ What about the uranium?
L617797 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Do you?
L617796 +++$+++ u8513 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ PARIS +++$+++ Do you feel better now?
L617795 +++$+++ u8513 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ PARIS +++$+++ No! He's crazy - he's insane. He hates everybody. He's got these plans -  You've got to help me, James. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I know I was wrong - but you've got to protect me. I know you still love -
L617794 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ What about Elliot Harmsway? Or is this just another one of your stunts?
L617793 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Nothing.
L617792 +++$+++ u8513 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ PARIS +++$+++ Don't you even miss me? Didn't I mean anything to you?
L617791 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I've got half the British government breathing down my neck. I don't have time for your nonsense.
L617790 +++$+++ u8513 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ PARIS +++$+++ Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice?
L617789 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Is this another one of your games?
L617788 +++$+++ u8513 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ PARIS +++$+++ Oh, James. I've missed you -
L617787 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ I thought your specialty was good-bye.
L617786 +++$+++ u8513 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ PARIS +++$+++ Is that any way to say hello?
L617785 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Paris?!? What are you doing here?
L617740 +++$+++ u8510 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ MINISTER JOHNSTONE +++$+++ To the best of my recollection, Mr. Bond, I suggested no such thing.  In fact, I was never here.
L617739 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Political considerations?
L617738 +++$+++ u8510 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ MINISTER JOHNSTONE +++$+++ There is one last thing, 007: Elliot Harmsway is vital to the economic interests of this nation. He's also a major contributor to the party. I expect him to be given every consideration.
L617726 +++$+++ u8510 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ MINISTER JOHNSTONE +++$+++ Need I remind the two of you that Elliot Harmsway - Sir Elliot Harmsway - is directly descended from the Earl of Aberdeen? That his Scottish ancestors practically invented Hong Kong - and out of sheer gratitude, Queen Victoria herself named the port "Aberdeen Harbor" in their honor?
L617725 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Perhaps. But it does explain how an ex-KGB agent turned illegal-arms dealer is suddenly portrayed as a long-time friend of the people.  If you believe what you read in the papers.
L617724 +++$+++ u8510 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ MINISTER JOHNSTONE +++$+++ More scurrilous, unsubstantiated gossip.

L617775 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ A wedding band??? What am I supposed to be able to do with this?
L617774 +++$+++ u8515 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Oh. I almost forgot. There is one last thing: Before Q retired, he asked that I give you one other protective device.
L617773 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ If you can't do the time, don't do the crime?

L617750 +++$+++ u8515 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ SAUNDERS +++$+++ Q's retirement party. I'd just put the knife into the cake, and -
L617749 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Okay, Saunders. What is it this time? Rocket in the leg? Machine pistol in the arm?

L618185 +++$+++ u8519 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ They'd never sail this close to the shore.
L618184 +++$+++ u8500 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ BOND +++$+++ Who knows? Fog, night...
L618183 +++$+++ u8519 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ I dunno, Jimbo. It can't be out here. How could they get this far off course?
