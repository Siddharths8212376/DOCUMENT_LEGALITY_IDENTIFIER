L555295 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Where are my cigarettes?
L555294 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I ran into some people I knew.
L555293 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ What on earth, darling? It took you hours.
L555252 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ You're a darling.
L555251 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Pull up at the drugstore, will you, Max.  I'll get you some.
L555250 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ They're awful.  They make me cough.
L555249 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Have one of mine.
L555246 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ So he said it quite a few years ago.  So what?  I never looked better in my life.  Do you know why?  Because I've never been as happy in my life.
L555245 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ When did he say it, Norma?
L555244 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me.  DeMille always said I was his greatest star.
L555243 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I hope you realize, Norma, that scripts don't sell on astrologers' charts.
L555242 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ DeMille is Leo.  I'm Scorpio. Mars has been transmitting Jupiter for weeks.  Today is the day of greatest conjuction. Now turn around.  Let me dry you.
L555241 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Did she read the script?
L555240 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ This is the right day.
L555239 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ You're really going to send it to De Mille?
L555225 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I'll do it again, I'll do it again, I'll do it again!
L555224 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.
L555223 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --
L555222 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Look, I was making that up because I thought the whole thing was a mistake.  I didn't want to hurt you. You've been good to me.  You're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me.
L555221 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Go away.  Go to that girl of yours.
L555220 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Great stars have great pride.
L555219 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ It sure would have made attractive headlines: Great Star Kills Her- self for Unknown Writer.
L555218 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ To fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing.
L555217 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ What kind of a silly thing was that to do?
L555216 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Go away.
L555130 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ What you're trying to say is that you don't want me to love you.  Is that it?
L555129 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Why not? What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you. You want a Valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --
L555128 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra?
L555127 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Has it ever occurred that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl I'm crazy about?
L555126 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ What right? Do you want me to tell you?
L555125 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ What right do you have to take me for granted?
L555124 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ What's the matter with you?
L555123 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Cut out that us business.
L555122 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.
L555121 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Keep it.
L555120 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Shut up.  I'm rich.  I'm richer than all this new Hollywood trash. I've got a million dollars.
L555119 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Norma, I can't take it.  You've bought me enough.
L555118 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ "Mad about the boy."
L555117 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ What are the notes?
L555111 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I'm in love with you.  Don't you know that? I've been in love with you all along.
L555110 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ What's that?
L555109 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Is it funny that I'm in love with you?
L555108 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ A little.
L555107 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ You think this is all very funny.
L555106 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head?
L555105 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Hold me tighter.
L555104 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I understand some rich guy bought up all the tickets for a perfor- mance at the Metropolitan and sat there listening to La Traviata, all by himself.  He was afraid of catching cold.
L555103 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ There are no other guests.  We don't want to share this night with other people.  This is for you and me.
L555102 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ The other guests?
L555101 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Who?
L555100 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ It's a quarter past ten.  What time are they supposed to get here?
L555099 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ It's those feathers.  They tickle.
L555098 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Don't bend back like that.
L555097 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Just follow me.
L555096 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Not on the same floor with Valentino!
L555093 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Careful, it's slippery.  I had it waxed.
L555092 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Shouldn't we wait for the others?
L555091 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Cute.  Let's have some drinks.
L555090 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Now, I'm not going to wear ear- rings, I can tell you that.
L555089 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I don't like those studs they've sent.  I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.
L555088 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ You know, to me dressing up was always just putting on my dark blue suit.
L555087 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Come here!
L555086 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ All padding.  Don't let it fool you.
L555084 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Come on!
L555083 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ 
L555082 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Joe,  you look absolutely divine.  Turn around!
L555059 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ You'll need them for parties. You'll need them for New Year's Eve.  Where are your evening clothes?
L555058 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Tails.  That's ridiculous.
L555057 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Of course you do.  A tuxedo and tails.
L555056 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I don't need a tuxedo.
L555055 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ How about some evening clothes?
L555053 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Why begrudge me a little fun? I just want you to look nice, my stray little boy.
L555052 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I don't need any clothes, and I certainly don't want you buy- ing them for --
L555051 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Nothing, if you work in a fill- ing station.  And I'm getting rather bored with that sport jacket, and those same baggy pants.  Max, what's a good men's shop in town?  The very best... Well, go there !
L555050 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ What's wrong with It?
L555049 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ That's a dreadful shirt you're wearing.
L555047 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Now you're being silly.  We don't need two cars.  We have a car.  And not one of thuse cheap new things made of chromium and spit.  An Isotta-Fraschini.  Have you ever heard of Isotta-Fraschinis?  All hand-made.  Cost me twenty-eight thousand dollars.
L555046 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ It is to me.  That's why I came to this house.  That's why I took this job -- ghost writing!
L555045 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Oh...and I thought it was a matter of life and death.
L555044 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I've lost my car.
L555043 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Now what is it?  Where's the fire?
L555040 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Can't you wait till I'm dummy?
L555039 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I need some money right now.
L555038 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Please.  Now I've forgotten how many spades are out.
L555037 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ They've come for my car.
L555036 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Not now, my dear.  I'm playing three no trump.
L555035 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I want to talk to you for a minute.
L555023 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Okay.
L555022 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ They don't?  Then why do they still write me fan letters every day. Why do they beg me for my photo- graphs?  Because they want to see me, me, me!  Norma Desmond.
L555021 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Honestly, it's a little old hat. They don't want that any more.
L555020 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Cut away from me?
L555019 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ The one where you go to the slave market.  You can cut right to the scene where John the Baptist -
L555018 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ What scene?
L555017 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Just a scene I cut out.
L555016 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ What's that?
L555014 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Suppose you make up your mind. Do you want this job or don't you?
L555013 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Unpack nothing.  I didn't say I was staying.
L555012 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Now, now, don't let's be small about such matters.  We won't keep books.  Go on, unpack Mr. Gillis' things.
L555011 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Okay.  We'll deduct it from my salary.
L555010 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.
L555009 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I'm used to paying my own bills.
L555008 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ It's all taken care of.  It's all paid for.
L555007 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I'll take care of that.
L555006 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ You can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent.
L555005 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Thanks for the invitation, but I have my own apartment.
L555004 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ You'll like it here.
L555003 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Look, I'm supposed to fix up your script.  There's nothing in the deal about my staying here.
L555002 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I don't know why you should be so upset.  Stop that playing, Max.  It seemed like a good idea -- if we are to work together.
L554978 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I'll come early tomorrow.
L554977 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ You can stay here.
L554976 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ There sure is.
L554975 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ There's something wrong with your car, you said.
L554974 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Hollywood.  The Alto Nido Apart- ments.
L554973 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Where do you live?
L554972 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ The name is Gillis.  I'm single.
L554971 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Are you married, Mr.  -- ?
L554970 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ It's getting kind of late --
L554969 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Oh no.  I couldn't let it out of my house.  You'll have to finish it here.
L554968 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Maybe I'd better take the rest of the script home and read it -
L554967 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I wouldn't worry about money. I'll make it worth your while.
L554966 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ You know, I'm pretty expensive. I get five hundred a week.
L554965 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I don't care.
L554964 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Me?  I'm busy.  Just finished one script.  I'm due on another assignment.
L554963 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I want you to do this work.
L554962 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Thank you.
L554961 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Sagittarius.  I like Sagittarians. You can trust them.
L554960 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ December twenty-first.
L554959 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ What month?
L554958 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I don't know.
L554957 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Who?  I'd have to have somebody I can trust.  When were you born -- I mean, what sign of the zodiac?
L554956 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Of course not.  But it ought to be organized.  Just an editing job.  You can find somebody.
L554955 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I will not have it butchered.
L554954 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
L554953 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ What for?  I can say anything I want with my eyes.
L554952 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Sure you did.  That's what makes it great.  What it needs is a little more dialogue.
L554951 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I wrote that with my heart.
L554950 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Maybe it's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions... but you're not a professional writer.
L554949 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Of course it is.
L554948 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ This is fascinating.
L554947 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Well?
L554941 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I am not afraid.  Read it!
L554940 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Right now?  Never let another writer read your stuff.  He may steal it.
L554939 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ They will love it every place.  Read it.  Read the scene just before she has him killed!
L554938 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ They'll love it in Pomona.
L554937 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Salome -- what a woman! What a part! The Princess in love with a Holy man.  She dances the Dance of the Seven Veils.  He rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray, kissing his cold, dead lips.
L554936 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Fair enough.
L554935 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I hate that word.  It is a return. A return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.
L554934 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Only asking.  I did't know you were planning a comeback.
L554933 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Who else ?
L554932 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ And you'll play Salome?
L554931 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ We've made a lot of pictures together.
L554930 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L554929 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ It's the story or Salome.  I think I'll have DeMille direct it.
L554928 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Looks like enough for six impor- tant pictures.
L554927 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ This is to be a very important picture.  I have written it myself.  Took me years.
L554926 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.
L554925 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ How long is a movie script these days?  I mean, how many pages?
L554924 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Or teach it a better tune.
L554923 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ The wind gets in that blasted pipe organ.  I ought to have it taken out.
L554921 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Sure have.  The last one I wrote was about cattle rustlers. Before they were through with it, the whole thing played on a torpedo boat.
L554920 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ And you have written pictures, haven't you?
L554919 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I think that's what it says on my driver's license.
L554918 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Are you or aren't you?
L554917 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Why?
L554916 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ You're a writer, you said.
L554915 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Yeah?
L554914 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Just a minute, you!
L554912 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Get out!
L554911 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Ssh! You'll wake up that monkey.
L554910 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ You are! Writing words, words! You've made a rope of words and strangled this businessl But there is a microphone right there to catch the last gurgles, and Technicolor to photograph the red, swollen tongue!
L554909 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Don't get sore at me.  I'm not an executive.  I'm just a writer.
L554908 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Look at them in the front offices -- the master minds! They took the idols and smashed them.  The Fairbankses and the Chaplins and the Gilberts and the Valentinos. And who have they got now?  Some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshl
L554907 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ That's where the popcorn business comes in.  You buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears.
L554906 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ They're dead.  They're finished. There was a time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world.  But that wasn't good enough.  Oh, nol They wanted the ears of the world, too.  So they opened their big mouths, and out came talk, talk, talk...
L554905 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I knew there was something wrong with them.
L554904 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I am big.  It's the pictures that got small.
L554903 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I know your face.  You're Norma Desmond.  You used to be in pictures.  You used to be big.
L554902 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Or shall I call my servant?
L554901 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Sure.  Wait a minute -- haven't I seen you -- ?
L554900 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Get out.
L554899 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I'm sorry, and I'm sorry you lost your friend, and I don't think red is the right color.
L554898 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ It is not.  Get out.
L554897 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I had some trouble with my car. Flat tire.  I pulled into your garage till I could get a spare. I thought this was an empty house.
L554896 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Lady.  you've got the wrong man.
L554895 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ How much will it be?  I warn you - don't give me a fancy price just because I'm rich.
L554893 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I don't care anyway.  I want the coffin to be white.  And I want it specially lined with satin. White, or deep pink.
L554892 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I wouldn't know.
L555525 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ It was I who asked to come back, humiliating as it may seem.  I could have gone on witn my career, only I found everything unendur- able arter she divorced me.  You see, I was her rirst husband.
L555524 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ And she's turned you into a servant.
L555523 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I directed all her early pictures. There were three young directors who showed promise in those days: D.W. Grirrith, C.B. deMille, and Max von Mayerling.
L555522 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ You made her a star?
L555521 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ She never will.  That is my job. It has been for a long time.  You must understand I discovered her when she was eighteen.  I made her a star.  I cannot let her be destroyed.
L555520 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Sure you are.  And we're not help- ing her any, feeding her lies and more lies.  Getting herself ready for a pioture ...  What happens when she finds out?
L555519 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ It's just that I'm very worried about Madame.
L555518 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Why don't you? I'm writing a script and I'm dying to finish it, no matter what.
L555517 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I'm not inquiring where Mr. Gillis goes every night...
L555516 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it?
L555515 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You must be very careful as you cross the patio.  Madame may be watching.
L555514 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ What is it, Max? Want to wash the car, or are you doing a little spying in your off hours?
L555440 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ What?
