L527954 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ From you, Norman.  From your mind. You're doing it.
L527953 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Then where's it coming from?
L527952 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Stop what?  Don't blame me.  It's not me.
L527951 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Beth, stop it!
L527950 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Don't you know?
L527949 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Where is it coming from, Beth?
L527948 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ You're frightened, aren't you, Norman?
L527947 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Beth!
L527945 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ I'm not fucking with you, Norman. You've fucked yourself.
L527944 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Don't fuck with me, Beth.
L527943 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Of course you're going to deny it. You want to blame someone else.  You want to blame Beth.  Because you hate Beth.
L527938 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Get away from the door, Beth.
L527937 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ This is what I'm talking about, Norman.  Don't you see?  It's in you. This vindictiveness.  This rage.
L527932 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ You think I care?  You think I care if I die?  Would I put explosives around the habitat -- set on vibration sensors -- that can trigger automatically, if I cared about myself?  Would I? I've tried twice before, Norman, why wouldn't I try a third time?  I'm not thinking about myself -- No, Norman, I'm thinking about you.  Your safety. Protecting you from your own self.
L527931 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ It's not safe for you to be either.
L527930 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ It's your choice.  Because it's not safe for you to be awake.  To be walking around.  To be thinking about things.
L527928 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ It's either this... or I kill you.
L527927 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Don't, Beth.  Please.
L527926 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ You think I'd belive you?  Believe anything you might say now?  After you lied to me about telling Barnes about my past.  About my problems.  My problems.  Not yours.  Not his.  Mine.
L527925 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Beth --
L527924 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Promise what, Norman?  Tell me!
L527923 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I promise --
L527922 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ But I have to, Norman.
L527921 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Don't, Beth.
L527920 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ "It's not me, Beth.  It's not me.  It can't be.  I'm not doing anything." Just like Harry said before I stabbed him with the needle.
L527919 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ It's not me, Beth.  I swear.  It can't be.
L527918 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ I'm not scaring you, am I Norman?  I hope I'm not frightening you.  The last thing I want to do is frighten you.  You feel okay, don't you?
L527917 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ When you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking?  Do you know?  "I can't get Beth on the radio.  I'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean.  All alone.  Surrounded by all this water." Was it really the squid that was attacking you, Norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears?  You never really saw what it was, did you?
L527916 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Shut up, Beth --
L527915 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ No, it isn't.  Your name is Norman. But your younger brother -- what was his name?  The one who was stung when you were younger.  The one that died. The one you couldn't save.  What was his name?  "Mommy, we're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming." "But I don't want to go swimming, Norman.  I'm scared." "C'mon, <u>Harry</u>, it'll be fine, it'll be fun."  You heartless fuck.  That's why you're so scared of the water, isn't it?
L527914 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Beth, the message said Harry.  "My name is Harry".  My name isn't Harry.
L527913 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Is it?
L527912 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ That's bullshit.
L527911 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ You remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that -- when the sphere opened?  That's right.  But you can't remember going inside, can you?  No, of course not.  Harry couldn't either, could he?  "Like everything's on the tip of my tongue", he said.
L527910 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Yes.
L527909 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ You don't remember you did.  But I'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get Harry, don't you?  You remember that.
L527908 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I never went in that sphere.
L527907 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Am I?  Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?
L527906 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You're insane.
L527905 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Did I?  Or was that you?  When you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, didn't you?  Terrified.  Like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor.  You did that, Norman.
L527904 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You manifested that, Beth.
L527903 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
L527902 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ That's when you went in the sphere.
L527901 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ And the snakes?  You want to know about the snakes?  You saw one outside earlier, didn't you?  When you thought I had deserted you -- you were terrified.
L527900 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ But --
L527899 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you absolutely sure I'm lying?  Then explain to me about the jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear jellyfish.  You do.  They're your fear, aren't they?
L527898 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You're lying --
L527897 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ C'mon -- what?
L527896 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Beth you're losing it.  C'mon.
L527895 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Yes, someone did.  But it wasn't me, Norman.  It was you.  You manifested the snakes.
L527894 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Someone did.
L527893 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ You think I manifested the snakes?
L527892 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Then why, Beth?  Why go in?  Why put out explosives?  Why manifest the snakes?
L527891 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ No, he can't.
L527890 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ He can't manifest.
L527889 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ No, he isn't.
L527888 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Against what?  Harry's unconscious. He's not a threat.
L527887 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Same reason I put explosives around the habitat.  For defense.  For the power.  To protect myself.
L527886 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
L527885 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ What's the phrase -- "keeping up with the Joneses"?
L527884 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Did you?
L527883 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ If I was, then I would've had to have gone in the sphere, wouldn't I?
L527882 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Are you manifesting them?
L527881 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Don't you?
L527880 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Do you fear them?
L527879 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ You tell me.
L527878 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What are they doing down here?  In the bathroom?  Suddenly appearing.
L527877 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Am I afraid of them?  Not during the day.  Sea snakes are diurnal.  When the sun's out, they don't bite. Fortunately for you, I had on my watch.  This is quite good.
L527876 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You know what I mean.
L527875 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?
L527874 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ How do you feel about snakes?
L527873 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ I did do that, didn't I?
L527872 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.
L527871 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ You don't think I put something in it, do you?
L527870 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You think I'd really drink that?
L527869 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ It's getting cold.
L527868 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Are you?
L527867 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I'm feeling better.
L527866 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ What's wrong, Norman?
L527862 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Oh yes, my watch.  I almost forgot.
L527861 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Your watch.
L527860 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
L527840 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ How's Harry?
L527839 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ The grooves around the door -- they've shifted.  And the pattern -- the fluids -- they look darker now.
L527838 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ What do you mean, different?
L527837 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ The sphere looks different.
L527836 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ In the sub.  Resetting the timer. Why?
L527835 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Where are you?
L527834 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ What is it, Norman?
L527829 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ You're not sorry.  You're scared.  You're a psychologist, Norman.  You pride yourself on knowing when someone's lying to you, not telling you the truth.  And now you're scared ... because you're not sure you can tell anymore.
L527828 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Not believing you.
L527827 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ For what?
L527826 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L527815 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Only lab rats.  Here.
L527814 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Thirty years ago.  In residency.  I passed out.  You?
L527813 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ You ever given an injection before.
L527812 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Look, it's either him or us, Norman. Another attack, and we go down with this place.
L527811 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You want to kill him?
L527810 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ To be on the safe side.  I mean --
L527809 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Beth --
L527808 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ It's an idea.
L527806 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ What if it takes 20 minutes, Norman? What if it takes an hour?  And he can fight it off?  We can't afford that.
L527805 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Doesn't say.
L527804 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ How fast does it take effect?
L527803 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What?  Wait -- isn't that dangerous?
L527802 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ I'll just boost the doses.
L527801 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Three to six hours.
L527800 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ How long does it last?
L527799 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ "20 cc's of parasolutrine in combination with 6 cc's of paracin given IV produces deep sleep suitable for emergency surgical procedures... no cardiac side effects ... REM activity is surpressed... "
L527797 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ "... used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride... "
L527796 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ It's like a sleeping pill?
L527795 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Causes sleep.
L527794 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What's that?
L527793 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ It's a soporific.
L527792 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ P-a-r-a-s-o...
L527791 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ How do you spell it?
L527790 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Parasolutrine?
L527789 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Antibiotic.
L527788 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Damn it!  Chloramphenicol?
L527787 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Antihistamine.  For bites.
L527786 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Riordan?
L527785 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ "... and may also cause bizarre halucinations".
L527784 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Bingo.
L527783 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
L527782 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Tarazine?
L527781 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Nothing about drowsiness.
L527780 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Does it cause drowsiness?  That's all we need.  To get him unconscious -- put him under.
L527779 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ A synthetic opium analogue.
L527778 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Sintag.
L527777 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Ulcers.
L527776 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Valdomet.
L527775 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ It's for motion sickness.
L527774 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Ephedrine hydrochloride.
L527773 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Something for burns.
L527772 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Diphenyl parlene.
L527744 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Why would Harry go back to using a code?
L527743 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Looks like some sort of code.
L527742 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Must be.  And if it is -- it's a part of him not even he can control.
L527741 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ And that's the part of Harry that's being manifested.
L527740 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ No.  I mean, we've always believed we can think anything we want without consequences.  You ever read the Bible?  It talks about our sinful nature, you know?  I mean, we can think, and believe, and desire whatever we want, but there's a part of us -- a shadow side, as Jung called it -- that can't be controlled.  It's evil. It's inside us.  It's what we are.
L527739 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ His dream?  You can't control your dreams.  And you can't control your fears, can you?
L527738 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ He must not realize he is.  Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then.  He must've manifested his dream.
L527737 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ But why is he doing it?
L527736 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real.
L527735 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Which I told Barnes was attacking --
L527734 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I don't know, Beth.  I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can.  When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87.  How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to.  Then you found the book, remember in your lab.  Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid...
L527733 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ How can the sphere do that?
L527732 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I don't know.
L527731 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ But how?
L527730 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things.
L527729 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ You think, in the sphere --
L527728 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ When did the messages start?  The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere.
L527727 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ What do you mean, a part of Harry?
L527726 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Remember when we first spoke to Jerry, Barnes kept asking for Jerry's real name?  But Harry never would?  He didn't because he was afraid the screen would say "Harry", instead of Jerry.  We weren't talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to Jerry, we were talking to Harry... or a part of Harry.
L527724 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ What?
L527723 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ He translated it wrong.
L527722 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Created.  Brought to life.  I don't know.  But at the end, Jerry said, "Stop calling me Jerry".  And --
L527721 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Manifested?
L527720 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ After the attack, a Navy guy woke me up -- I don't know -- I thought he was an illusion.  But I checked the tape, and Jerry said he manifested him.
L527717 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ "... according to calculations of some naturalists, one of these animals, only six feet long, would have tentacles 27 feet long.  That would make a formidable monster."
L527716 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Squids?
L527715 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ "Our fisherman frequently see some that are more than four feet long. Some skeletons of squids...
L527714 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Page 87.  "I could never read that far."
L527713 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ What?
L527712 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Page 87.
L527709 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ Damn it, Norman!  He's lying.  Don't you get it?  There is something seriously fucked up going on here -- and he's causing it.  Why can't you believe me?
L527708 +++$+++ u7811 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there.
L527707 +++$+++ u7806 +++$+++ m528 +++$+++ BETH +++$+++ You think it's me?  You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?
