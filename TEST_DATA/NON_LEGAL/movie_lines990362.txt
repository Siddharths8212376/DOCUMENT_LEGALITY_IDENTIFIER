L555439 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I just found out why all those tele- phone calls.  It is not Miss Desmond they want.  It is the car they want to rent.
L555438 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ What's the matter, Max?
L555398 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ He had a great big bungalow on wheels.  I had the upstairs.  See where it says 'Readers' Department'? I remember my walls were covered with black patent leather...
L555397 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ That didn't leave much for Wallace Reid.
L555396 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You see those offices there, Mr. Gillis? They used to be her dressing room, The whole row.
L555285 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Right with you.
L555284 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Mr. Gillis, if you please.
L555214 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ She is upstairs.
L555213 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ How is she?
L555080 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I don't know, sir.  Madame made the arrangements.
L555079 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ No, I haven't.  I suppose all the waxworks are coming?
L555078 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I'd better press your evening clothes, sir.  You have not for- gotten Madame's New Year's party.
L555077 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ You send them.  Is that it, Max?
L555076 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks.
L555075 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Why?  Her career?  She got enough out of it.  She's not forgotten. She still gets those fan letters.
L555074 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ We have to be very careful.  No sleeping pills, no razor blades. We shut off the gas in her bed- room.
L555073 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Uh-huh?
L555072 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Madame's doctor.  She has moments of melancholy.  There have been some suicide attempts.
L555071 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ What doctor?
L555070 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ The doctor suggested it.
L555069 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ How come?
L555068 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ There are no locks anywhere in this house.
L555067 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Hey, what's this with the door? There isn't any lock.
L555065 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ It was the room of the husband. Or of the husbands, I should say. Madame has been married three times.
L555064 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Whose room was this?
L555033 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ They found your car in the garage.  They are going to tow it away.
L555032 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Good.
L555031 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ That's what I told them.
L555030 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I'm not here.
L555029 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Some men are here.  They asked for you.
L555000 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Who said you could?  Who asked you to?
L554999 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Why are you so upset?  Is there anything missing?
L554998 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Is that so!
L554997 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Naturally.  I brought them myself.
L554996 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I'm talking to you.  My clothes and things are up in the room.
L554990 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You did, sir. GILLIS' VOICE He goes out.  Gillis     I pegged him as slightly looks after him, hangs   cuckoo, too.  A stroke maybe. his coat over a chair,   Come to think of it, the walks over to the win-   whole place seemed to have dow, pulls down the      been stricken with a kind of rickety Venetian blind.  creeping paralysis, out of As he does so, he looks  beat with the rest of the down at:                 world, crumbling apart in slow motion ...
L554989 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I sure turned into an interesting driveway.
L554988 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ She was the greatest.  You wouldn't know.  You are too young.  In one week she got seventeen thousand fan letters.  Men would bribe her mani- curist to get clippings from her fingernails.  There was a Maharajah who came all the way from Hyderabad to get one of her stockings.  Later, he strangled himself with it.
L554987 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Thanks.  Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.
L554986 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ There is the bathroom.  I put in soap and a toothbrush.
L554985 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ It will never make house Beautiful. I guess it's O.K. for one night.
L554984 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ This room has not been used for a long time.
L554983 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Thanks.  How did you know I was going to stay, this afternoon?
L554982 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I made your bed this afternoon.
L554887 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ For me?  Okay.
L554886 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Madame is waiting.
L554885 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Suppose you listen just for a minute -
L554882 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Dressed for what?
L554881 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You are not dressed properly.
L554880 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Wipe your feet!
L554879 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Look, maybe I'd better take my car --
L554878 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Go on in.
L554877 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I just put my car in the garage. I had a blow-out.  I thought --
L554808 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ You say the cutest things.
L554807 +++$+++ u7964 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NO. 1 +++$+++ Sure we believe you, only now we want you to believe us.  That car better be back here by noon tomorrow, or there's going to be fireworks.
L554806 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ You don't believe me?  Look in the garage.
L554805 +++$+++ u7964 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NO. 1 +++$+++ Had to get away for his health, I suppose.
L554804 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ I lent it to a friend of mine. He took it up to Palm Springs.
L554803 +++$+++ u7964 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NO. 1 +++$+++ Is that So?
L554802 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Relax, fans.  The car isn't here.
L554796 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ What car?
L554795 +++$+++ u7964 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NO. 1 +++$+++ We've come for the car.
L554794 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ That's right.
L554793 +++$+++ u7964 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NO. 1 +++$+++ Joseph C. Gillis?
L554853 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
L554852 +++$+++ u7966 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Could I?  Gillis, last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley.  So I borrowed money from the bank so I could pay for the ranch.  This year I had to mortgage the ranch so I could keep up my life insurance so I could borrow on the insurance so I could pay my income tax.  Now if Dewey had been elected -
L554851 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan?
L554850 +++$+++ u7966 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ There's nothing, Gillis.  Not even if you were a relative.
L554849 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Any kind of assignment.  Additional Dialogue.
L554848 +++$+++ u7966 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Haven't got a thing.
L554847 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Along is no good.  I need it now.
L554846 +++$+++ u7966 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Sure, Gillis.  If something should come along -
L554845 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ You trying to be funny?  -- because I'm all out of laughs.  I'm over a barrel and I need a job.
L554844 +++$+++ u7966 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Now wait a minute.  If we made it a girls' softball team, put in a few numbers.  Might make a cute musical: It Happened in the Bull Pen -- the story of a Woman.
L554843 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Frankly, no.
L554842 +++$+++ u7966 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton.  Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
L554841 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Mr. Sheldrake, I don't want you to think I thought this was going to win any Academy Award.
L554840 +++$+++ u7966 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Well, seems like Zanuck's got himself a baseball picture.
L554833 +++$+++ u7966 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ No, that was me.  I said, Who wants to see a Civil War picture?
L554832 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Oh, you're one of the message kids.  Just a story won't do. You'd have turned down Gone With the Wind.
L554817 +++$+++ u7966 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Get the Readers' Department and see what they have on Bases Loaded.
L554816 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Bases Loaded.  There's a 4O-page outline.
L554815 +++$+++ u7966 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ Got a title?
L554814 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ More or less.  Only for the end I've got a gimmick that's real good.
L554813 +++$+++ u7966 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh?
L554812 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ It's about a ball player, a rookie shortstop that's batting 347.  The poor kid was once mixed up in a hold- up.  But he's trying to go straight -- except there's a bunch of gamblers who won't let him.
L554811 +++$+++ u7966 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ SHELDRAKE +++$+++ All right, Gillis.  You've got five minutes.  What's your story about?
L554868 +++$+++ u7963 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MORINO +++$+++ Maybe what you need is another agent.
L554867 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ What do you think I've been doing? I need three hundred dollars.
L554866 +++$+++ u7963 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MORINO +++$+++ Greatest thing that could happen to you.  Now you'll have to sit behind that typewriter.  Now you'll have to write.
L554865 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ Forget Romanoff's.  It's the car I'm talking about.  If I lose my car it's like having my legs out off.
L554864 +++$+++ u7963 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MORINO +++$+++ Don't you know the finest things in the world have been written on an empty stomach?  Once a talent like yours gets into that Mocambo- Romanoff rut, you're through.
L554863 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ How's that about your being my friend?
L554862 +++$+++ u7963 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MORINO +++$+++ Gillis, get this through your head.  I'm not just your agent. It's not the ten per cent.  I'm your friend.
L554861 +++$+++ u7959 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ GILLIS +++$+++ No?
L554860 +++$+++ u7963 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MORINO +++$+++ So you need three hundred dollars? Of course, I could give you three hundred dollars.  Only I'm not going to.
L555656 +++$+++ u7960 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ HEAD OF HOMICIDE +++$+++ Okay.  And let's have the car right outside.
L555655 +++$+++ u7961 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ HOLMBY HILLS CAPTAIN +++$+++ Well, it's one way to get her down stairs.
L555647 +++$+++ u7960 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ HEAD OF HOMICIDE +++$+++ Was theft involved?  Did you catch him trying to steal something, or find he had stolen something?
L555646 +++$+++ u7961 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ HOLMBY HILLS CAPTAIN +++$+++ Did you hate him?  Had you ever thought of doing something like this before?
L555645 +++$+++ u7960 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ HEAD OF HOMICIDE +++$+++ Did the deceased ever threaten you? Were you in fear of bodily injury?
L555644 +++$+++ u7961 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ HOLMBY HILLS CAPTAIN +++$+++ Had he been trying to blackmail you?
L555643 +++$+++ u7960 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ HEAD OF HOMICIDE +++$+++ Did he have a wife?  Did he had a girl friend?  Did you know them?
L555642 +++$+++ u7961 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ HOLMBY HILLS CAPTAIN +++$+++ This guy -- where did you meet him for the first time?  Where did he come from? Who is he?
L555641 +++$+++ u7960 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ HEAD OF HOMICIDE +++$+++ If it was a quarrel, how come you had the gun right there?
L555640 +++$+++ u7961 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ HOLMBY HILLS CAPTAIN +++$+++ Was it a sudden quarrel?  Had there been any trouble between you before?
L555639 +++$+++ u7960 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ HEAD OF HOMICIDE +++$+++ Did you intend to kill him? Just answer me that.
L555638 +++$+++ u7961 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ HOLMBY HILLS CAPTAIN +++$+++ You do not deny having killed this man, Miss Desmond?
L555667 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ All right.  Camera!  Action!
L555666 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Oh, yes, yes.  They're below, waiting for the Princess ... I'm ready.
L555665 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ This is the staircase of the palace.
L555664 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ What is the scene? Where am I?
L555652 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ They have?  Thank you, Max.  Tell Mr. DeMille I will be on the set at once.
L555651 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ The cameras have arrived, Madame.
L555650 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Cameras? ...What is it, Max?
L555320 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Thank you, Max.
L555319 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ If you will pardon me, Madame. The shadow over the left eye is not quite balanced.
L555314 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Very good, Madam.
L555313 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Say that I'm busy, and hang up.
L555312 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I myself was surprised at Mr. de Mille's manners.
L555311 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Certainly it's important.  It's important enough for Mr. deMille to call me personally.  The idea of having an assistant call me!
L555310 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ It is not Mr. deMille in person. It is someone by the name or Gordon Cole.  He says it's very important.
L555309 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.
L555308 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Paramount studios.
L555307 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Who?
L555306 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Paramount is calling.
L555305 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ You know better than to interrupt me.
L555304 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Madame is wanted on the telephone.
L555238 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Yes, Madame.
L555237 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Wait a minute.  I want you to get out the car.  You're going to take the script over to Paramount and deliver it to Mr. De Mille in person.
L554944 +++$+++ u7962 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Yes.  Madame.
L554943 +++$+++ u7965 +++$+++ m539 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Bring something to drink.
L555709 +++$+++ u7980 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ZALTAR +++$+++ The Guardians will be angry. They may even send me to the Phantom Zone. You see, I didn't really have permission to borrow it. I must go explain to them...
L555708 +++$+++ u7967 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ALURA +++$+++ But what will happen?
L555707 +++$+++ u7980 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ZALTAR +++$+++ It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
L555706 +++$+++ u7967 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ALURA +++$+++ But the Power Source, Zaltar.
L555702 +++$+++ u7967 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ALURA +++$+++ How can you create beauty...with a selfish heart? The spiky insect-creature flies closer and closer around the little girl's head, buzzing angrily. Her look of delight turns to fear. She tries to shoo the creature away. It flies off toward the thin membrane that encloses the city.
L555701 +++$+++ u7980 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ZALTAR +++$+++ I'm an artist, Alura. My work comes first. Other people come second.
L555699 +++$+++ u7980 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ZALTAR +++$+++ It's big. And empty. I'm tired of limiting myself to  Argo City. I want to do something new. I'm starting to repeat myself here with this airy, glittery stuff....
L555698 +++$+++ u7967 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ALURA +++$+++ But the phantom Zone is for criminals.
L555697 +++$+++ u7980 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ZALTAR +++$+++ I've discovered a new way into the Phantom Zone.
L555694 +++$+++ u7967 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ALURA +++$+++ But where?
L555693 +++$+++ u7980 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ZALTAR +++$+++ You and your husband have been kind to me, Alura. I have something to tell you: I'm going away. Soon.
L556197 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ What do you mean we?
L556196 +++$+++ u7968 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!
L556195 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ At last. Ultimate Power.
L556141 +++$+++ u7968 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ There's no need. I learned the Craft from my 						grandmother.
L556140 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ That little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools.
L556139 +++$+++ u7968 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ She didn't take it from you, did she?
L556138 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ I don't feel like it right now.
L556136 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ Shut up, and get me a hacksaw.
L556135 +++$+++ u7968 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you.
L556086 +++$+++ u7968 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Is it her that's bothering you--or your gardener?
L556085 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
L556084 +++$+++ u7968 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Home?
L555971 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ Yes. Whatever I say.  From now on.
L555970 +++$+++ u7968 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Whatever you say.
L555969 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ I think I'd better keep it.
L555968 +++$+++ u7968 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Yes, of course, it was foolish of me.
L555967 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ Next time, remind me to do this out in the yard.
L555965 +++$+++ u7968 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ The Naming of Names is not necessary. Just concentrate on her face. Your Shadow will do the rest.
L555964 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ What do I do?  I don't know her name.
L555962 +++$+++ u7968 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ That moment is now! What good is a sword unless it be unsheathed? Use it, and no one will dare oppose you again. No one.
L555961 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ I've been saving it. For the right moment.
L555960 +++$+++ u7968 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Yes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing can withstand its power.
L555959 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ Am I? Still?
L555958 +++$+++ u7968 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ You can do it. You're the most powerful woman on Earth.
L555957 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ That's easy for you to say, Bianca.
L555956 +++$+++ u7968 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Eliminate her.
L555955 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ Why did she have to show up now?
L555938 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ No, a super girl.
L555937 +++$+++ u7968 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ A Storm Dragon?
L555936 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ It's what we were warned about.
L555935 +++$+++ u7968 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ I came as quickly as I could. What is the danger?
L555863 +++$+++ u7968 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Have fun.
L555862 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ He will be. In about five minutes.
L555861 +++$+++ u7968 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Is he your entertainment for tonight?
L555839 +++$+++ u7968 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Sorry, mistress.
L555838 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at the wheel. OK?
L555837 +++$+++ u7968 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ And then, like great cats---we pounce! And destroy!
L555836 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ We'll bide our time and keep watch. Young girls just can't keep a secret. If one of them's up to something--we'll find out.
L555835 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ Drive on. We have already attracted enough attention.
L555834 +++$+++ u7968 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ But which one?
L555833 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ It must be the girls. One of the girls.
L555832 +++$+++ u7968 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ Softball.
L555831 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ Oh, fiddlesticks. What could be dangerous about a baseball game?
L555830 +++$+++ u7968 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .
L555829 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ What does it mean?
L555828 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ The Coffer of Shadow. Look at it.
L555827 +++$+++ u7968 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ BIANCA +++$+++ What is it?
L555826 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ I said stop, I didn't say run into a brick wall.
L555778 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ There's no such thing as an accident. Everything has meaning, if you can read the signs.
L555777 +++$+++ u7969 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ELDERLY MAN +++$+++ Maybe it was just an accident.
L555776 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ It's a warning, that's for sure.
L555775 +++$+++ u7969 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ELDERLY MAN +++$+++ Is this Nigel's doing?
L555753 +++$+++ u7969 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ELDERLY MAN +++$+++ No problem. She can have it. I hate mountains.
L555752 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.
L555751 +++$+++ u7969 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ELDERLY MAN +++$+++ Western Europe.
L555750 +++$+++ u7978 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SELENA +++$+++ What do you want?
L555749 +++$+++ u7969 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ELDERLY MAN +++$+++ I don't want much, Selena. I have simple tastes.
