L67576 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ There's Pepsi in the fridge.
L67575 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately.  You don't have any coke, do you?  I love coke and Jack Daniel's.
L67574 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?
L67573 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Cheers.  My friends call me Catherine.
L67572 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I know, Nicky, but I like it.
L67571 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ My wife used to call me that.
L67570 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ What if I call you Nicky?
L67569 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What if I asked you not to call me Shooter?
L67568 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Isn't he the policeman that you shot, Shooter?
L67567 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What did you pay Nilsen?
L67562 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Please.
L67561 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Ice?
L67560 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Fine.
L67559 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Jack Daniel's okay?  It's gonna have to be.
L67557 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Not me.
L67556 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ You can make a mistake.
L67555 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Why not?
L67554 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Don't get too cocky.
L67553 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ You're not easy to figure.  I'm just very good at figuring.
L67550 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Yeah.  Would you like to come up and have a drink?
L67549 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Do you?
L67548 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I like you.
L67547 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me.
L67546 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I don't know about that I don't have any money I don't have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend.
L67545 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I have attorneys.  They have friends.  I have friends.  Money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends.
L67544 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ How exactly did you hear?
L67439 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Yes, you did.  They never tested you, did they?  But Internal Affairs knew.
L67438 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I didn't.
L67435 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ No.
L67434 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ What happened, Nick?  Did you get sucked into it? Did you like it too much?
L67433 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Only in theory.  You know all about homicidal impulse, don't you, shooter?  Not in theory -- in practice.
L67432 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Didn't you study it in school?
L67431 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Yes.  She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
L67430 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ She wiped out her whole family.
L67429 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Noah was my counselor in my freshman year.  That's probably where I got the idea for the icepick.  For my book. Funny how the subconscious works.  Hazel is my friend.
L67428 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ You want a name from the present? How about Hazel Dobkins?
L67427 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ There's a name from the past.
L67426 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Tell me about Professor Goldstein.
L67425 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ They were drug buys.  I was a vice cop.
L67424 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Four shootings in five years.  All accidents.
L67423 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ It was an accident.  They got in the line of fire.
L67422 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I don't know.  But you do.
L67421 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ You tell me.
L67417 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I'd like to ask you some, too.
L67416 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
L67414 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ No, thanks.
L67413 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Would you like a drink?  I was just going to have one.
L67411 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ No.  Come in.
L67410 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Am I... disturbing you?
L67325 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick?
L67324 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I don't know anything that isn't police business.
L67323 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ You know all about me.
L67322 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ How do you know all this stuff about me?
L67321 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ You see?  We're both innocent, Nick.
L67320 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I passed.
L67317 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Because I'm a professional liar. I spend most of my waking hours dwelling on my lies.  For my writing.
L67316 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Why not?
L67315 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ If I were guilty, and if I wanted to beat that machine, it wouldn't be tiring.  It wouldn't be tiring at all.
L67314 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ It's got to be tiring to beat that machine.
L67313 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I'm tired.
L67312 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Thanks.
L67311 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Sure.
L67290 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ You still get the pleasure.  Didn't you ever fuck anybody else while you were married, Nick?
L67289 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Even though you were fucking him.
L67288 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ That's right.
L67287 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Because you didn't love him --
L67286 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ No.
L67285 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ But you didn't hurt --
L67284 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game.
L67283 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ How did you feel when I told you Johnny Boz had died -- that day at the beach.
L67282 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I loved him.  I hurt.
L67281 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ How did you feel when he died?
L67277 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I've got a degree in psych.  It goes with the turf.  Games are fun.
L67276 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ You like playing games, don't you?
L67267 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Yes it does, doesn't it?
L67266 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Writing a book about it gives you an alibi for not killing him.
L67261 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ No.  I said I liked Johnny to use his hands.  I don't give any rules, Nick.  I go with the flow.
L67260 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ But you said you liked men to use their hands.
L67246 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I have nothing to hide.
L67245 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I told them you wouldn't want to hide.
L67242 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I told them you wouldn't want an attorney present.
L67241 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Did I miss something?
L67234 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ A detective.  He falls for the wrong woman.
L67233 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What's your new book about?
L67225 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ It won't last.
L67224 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I told you -- I quit.
L67223 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I found some in my purse; would you like one?
L67222 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I thought you were out of cigarettes.
L67221 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I quit.
L67220 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Yes, you do.
L67219 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I don't smoke.
L67218 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Do you have a cigarette?
L67214 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Only when they make interesting reading.
L67213 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Do you always keep old newspapers around?
L67208 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ If that's the way you want to play it.
L67207 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Are you arresting me?
L67206 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Ms. Tramell, we'd like you to come downtown and answer some questions for us.
L67132 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ No.  I wasn't in the mood to have sex with anyone last night.
L67131 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Was there anyone with you last night?
L67130 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ No.  We had a drink at the club. We left together.  I came here. He went home.
L67129 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Did you go home with him?
L67128 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Yes.
L67127 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Did you leave the club with him?
L67126 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Yes.
L67125 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Were you with him last night?
L67124 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ About a year and a half.
L67123 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ How long were you having sex with him?
L67120 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I wasn't dating him.  I was fucking him.
L67119 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ How long were you dating him?
L67114 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I know who you are.
L67113 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I'm De...
L67263 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way I described in my book. I'd be announcing myself as the killer.  I'm not stupid.
L67262 +++$+++ u3880 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CORRIGAN +++$+++ Did you kill Mr. Boz, Ms. Tramell?
L67255 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ No.
L67254 +++$+++ u3880 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CORRIGAN +++$+++ Did you ever tie him up?
L67253 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan.
L67252 +++$+++ u3880 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CORRIGAN +++$+++ Did you ever engage in sado- masochistic activity with him?
L67250 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I had sex with him for about a year and a half.  I liked having sex with him.
L67249 +++$+++ u3880 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CORRIGAN +++$+++ Would you tell us the nature of your relationship with Mr. Boz?
L67248 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ What are you going to do?  Charge me with smoking?
L67247 +++$+++ u3880 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CORRIGAN +++$+++ There is no smoking in this building, Ms. Tramell.
L67238 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ No thank you.
L67237 +++$+++ u3880 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CORRIGAN +++$+++ I'm John Corrigan.  I'm an assistant district attorney, Ms.  Tramell. Can we get you anything?  Would you like some coffee?
L67302 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I'm a writer,  I use people for what I write.  You write what you know.  Let the world beware.
L67301 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?
L67300 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ In the beginning.  Then I got to like what he did for me.
L67274 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Cocaine.
L67273 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ What kind of drugs?
L67270 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Sometimes.
L67269 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?
L67268 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ The answer is no.  I didn't kill him.
L67232 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ I like that.  "Suspension of Disbelief."
L67231 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ You make it up, but it has to be believable.  They call it suspension of disbelief.
L67230 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ How's that?
L67229 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ It teaches you to lie.
L67228 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ It must really be somehtin' --makin' stuff up all the time.
L67227 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Yes I am.
L67226 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ You workin' on another book?
L67217 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Why would I need an attorney?
L67216 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ You have the right to an attorney.
L67137 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Read me my rights and arrest me and I'll go downtown.
L67136 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Listen, lady, we can do this downtown if you --
L67135 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I don't really feel like talking anymore.
L67117 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Really.  Maybe that's why you're from Homicide.  How?
L67116 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ He was murdered.
L67115 +++$+++ u3879 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ How did he die?
L67880 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ You did.
L67879 +++$+++ u3881 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ DETECTIVE +++$+++ I hope I helped you out.
L67878 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Thanks.
L67877 +++$+++ u3881 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ DETECTIVE +++$+++ Nope. She did.  Like I say.  It never panned.
L67876 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ He had a girlfriend?
L67875 +++$+++ u3881 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ DETECTIVE +++$+++ The usual -- a girlfriend.
L67874 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What kind of talk?
L67873 +++$+++ u3881 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ DETECTIVE +++$+++ Nope.  There was some talk; it never panned.
L67872 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Was she ever a suspect?
L67871 +++$+++ u3881 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ DETECTIVE +++$+++ That's him.
L67870 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Nilsen?
L67869 +++$+++ u3881 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ DETECTIVE +++$+++ Nope, can't say that I do.
L67868 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Do you remember his name?
L67867 +++$+++ u3881 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ DETECTIVE +++$+++ Yeah, he said it was routine too. Now it's two guys saying it's routine.
L67866 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Routine.
L67865 +++$+++ u3881 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ DETECTIVE +++$+++ I had another one of you guys down here from Frisco -- about a year ago -- he asked me the same question.  What's this about anyway?
L67864 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Was his wife ever a suspect?
L67863 +++$+++ u3881 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ DETECTIVE +++$+++ No suspects, no motive.  Unsolved.
L67862 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Were there ever any suspects?
L67861 +++$+++ u3881 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ DETECTIVE +++$+++ .38 revolver.  Never recovered.
L67860 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What was the weapon?
L67859 +++$+++ u3881 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ DETECTIVE +++$+++ He was walking home from work. They only lived a coupla blocks from the clinic.  Somebody drove by and shot him.
L67898 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ She said alone -- suite 405.  It ain't gonna take long.
L67897 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I'm going with you.
L67896 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Where the hell you goin'?
L67828 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ You got goddamn tweety-birds flutterin' around your head, that's what you got.  You think you're gonna fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after?  Oh, man.
L67827 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I know what happened.  Catherine told me what happened.
L67826 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Goddamn writers -- all they do is use up trees and ruin people's eyes.  There's gotta be somebody at Berkeley who knows what the hell happened.
L67825 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ She's a writer -- it's part of what she does.
L67824 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ She'd have to be nuttier than a twenty-pound Christmas fruitcake. She's not the one who hangs out with multiple murderers -- your girlfriend is.
L67823 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ He was I.A.  He probably asked her about it.
L67822 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?
L67821 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Don't you get it, Gus?  If Beth killed Johnny Boz to frame Catherine -- she wouldn't want anyone to know what happened at Berkeley.  It gives her the motive to kill Nilsen.
L67820 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ If she's telling  you the truth.
L67819 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Catherine told me what was in it.
L67818 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ So Nilsen had a report on her -- so what.  You don't know what the hell was in it?
L67751 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Which one you talkin' about now, son?  We know ole Hazel did it; we know young Roxy did it -- and the other one Well, hell, she's got that magna come lawdy pussy on her that done fried up your brain.
L67750 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I'm not sure anymore she did it.
L67747 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Ain't that hard, son.  This young farmgirl, she got tired of all that attention goin' to her little brothers -- she fixed 'em.  Just like 'ole Hazel Dobkins fixed her whole family -- except young Roxy here, she didn't use a wedding present.  She used Daddy's razor.
L67746 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I don't understand what the hell's going on here, pop.
L67739 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ You're my friend, Gus.
L67738 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Why not?
L67737 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I don't believe it.
L67736 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ You know that stuff they say about how you can judge people by their friends?
