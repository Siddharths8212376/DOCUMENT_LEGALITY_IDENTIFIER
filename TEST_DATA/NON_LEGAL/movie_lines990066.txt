L337352 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I'd like to know what the hell kind of courage it takes to walk out on your husband and your child?
L337351 +++$+++ u6231 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Ted, divorce is a terrible thing. I know, I went through it. You've got to believe I did everything I could to get Joanna to stay.  But I'll tell you something. You may not want to hear it, but it took a lot of courage for Joanna to do what she just did.
L337350 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Y'know something Thelma--you are the typhoid Mary of divorce. I mean it.  Joanna and I never had any trouble until you and Charley split up.
L337349 +++$+++ u6231 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ No.
L337348 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Boy, you guys are really something, y'know?  I'd like to know one thing, okay--just one little thing.  Did you tell Joanna she should leave me?
L337347 +++$+++ u6231 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Maybe she didn't feel like she should have to.  Maybe she felt like if you'd been paying any real attention to her to start with, maybe you would've noticed.
L337346 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Then how come she never said anything like that to me?
L337345 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Joanna said that?
L337344 +++$+++ u6231 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Oh for shit's sake, Ted, you are the most selfish human being I have ever met.  No wonder she said you came first, then Billy, then, if there was anything left over, she got the scraps.
L337343 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Two.  She is getting to be a real hermit or recluse or whatever it is you call it.  Thelma, do you know where I could be in this business if I had a wife that entertained or went out socially--
L337342 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Did it ever occur to you guys that Joanna Kramer's not the easiest person in the world to live with?!  Did it?!  For one thing she's always thirty minutes late.  You can set your watch by it--
L337341 +++$+++ u6231 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ What d'you know about how Joanna felt?  You went off to an office every morning and you'd come dragging home at seven or eight every night and as long as dinner was on the table you thought everything was swell.
L337340 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Listen, Joanna Kramer's got a goddamn good life.  She's got a husband that loves her.  She's got a terrific kid.  She's got a wonderful home--
L337339 +++$+++ u6231 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ I mean...things.  Ted, Joanna's very unhappy and--
L337338 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Things? What kind of things?
L337337 +++$+++ u6231 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Ted, Joanna and I used to talk a lot and...well, she told me a lot of...ah, things about the two of you.
L337336 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Hostile?  Me?  Thelma, I'm not hostile.  I am anything but hostile.  But if you want to know what I am.  I'll tell you what I am. What I am is, I am hurt.  I am very hurt.  And I just want to know one thing, okay?  Just one thing ...Why?  That's all I want to know...Why?
L337335 +++$+++ u6231 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Ted, don't be so hostile.
L337334 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Yeah, she said it wasn't any use talking anymore.
L337333 +++$+++ u6231 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ OhmyGod.  Didn't she say anything? She must've said something.
L337332 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I walk in the house and before I can say "How are you?", "Did you have a nice day?" before I can say anything.   Pow she's out the door.
L337331 +++$+++ u6231 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Ted, all I wanted to know was where--
L337330 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I came home tonight.  We just got the Fire and Ice account at the agency.  Do you know what that means?!  Do you understand what that means?  It means that it was maybe one of the five best days in my whole life.
L337329 +++$+++ u6231 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ THELMA +++$+++ Look, Ted, all I--
L337328 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ All right, Thelma, you want to know what's going on?  I'll tell you what's going on.  I'll tell you exactly what's going on.
L337326 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Ha!  You tell me.
L337325 +++$+++ u6232 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ WOMAN'S VOICE +++$+++ Ted, I don't understand a word you're saying.  Where's Joanna?
L337324 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Don't play innocent with me, Thelma.  You know perfectly well what's going on.
L337323 +++$+++ u6232 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ WOMAN'S VOICE +++$+++ Ted, what are you talking about?!
L337322 +++$+++ u6230 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ All right, Thelma...That's it. I've had it.  You can call your good friend Joanna Kramer and tell her enough is enough, okay?  I mean, I don't know what I did, but you can tell her she's made her point.
L337321 +++$+++ u6232 +++$+++ m416 +++$+++ WOMAN'S VOICE +++$+++ Huh.. .Hello?
L339238 +++$+++ u6233 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ BODYGUARD +++$+++ Do not worry, Holiness. They fight for you. They are under your protection.
L339237 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ I worry about them.
L339236 +++$+++ u6233 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ BODYGUARD +++$+++ Khambas are wild men.
L339235 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Your people are very brave. They are fighting the Chinese. No one can stop them. Not even me.
L339234 +++$+++ u6233 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ BODYGUARD +++$+++ Kham, Holiness.
L339233 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Where are you from?
L339232 +++$+++ u6233 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ BODYGUARD +++$+++ Yes, Holiness.
L339231 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ All quiet?
L339226 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Yes. I am ready.
L339225 +++$+++ u6233 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ BODYGUARD +++$+++ Please, come, Holiness.
L339224 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ A moment.
L339223 +++$+++ u6233 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ BODYGUARD +++$+++ We must go, Holiness.
L338850 +++$+++ u6234 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ I know.
L338849 +++$+++ u6253 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ And that day, your father got better. He named you Lhamo. "The Protector."
L338847 +++$+++ u6234 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ No cried?
L338846 +++$+++ u6253 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ You were a beautiful baby. So calm.
L338841 +++$+++ u6234 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Cow.
L338840 +++$+++ u6253 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Your father had been very ill, we thought he would die, and some animals had died.
L338839 +++$+++ u6234 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Tell me.
L338838 +++$+++ u6253 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Again?
L338837 +++$+++ u6234 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Mama, my story.
L339333 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ No!
L339332 +++$+++ u6235 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Goodbye, Kundun.
L339011 +++$+++ u6235 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Hmmm.
L339010 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Can I free the prisoners?
L339009 +++$+++ u6235 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ I will buy them for you.
L339008 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Here. We'll collect them.
L339007 +++$+++ u6235 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Where will you keep them?
L339006 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Will you buy the sheep for me?
L339005 +++$+++ u6235 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ I do, beautiful horses. Thank you, Holiness.
L339004 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ And you have horses? You love horses.
L339003 +++$+++ u6235 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ I do, now.
L338997 +++$+++ u6235 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Are you? Of whom?
L338996 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ But, I am in charge.
L338995 +++$+++ u6235 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ No.
L338994 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Can I do anything I want?
L338993 +++$+++ u6235 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Not the way to talk to people.
L338990 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ It is alright, Father.
L338989 +++$+++ u6235 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ I am sorry, Lhamo.
L339359 +++$+++ u6243 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LUKHANGWA +++$+++ And we will begin with tearing it down.
L339358 +++$+++ u6236 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ GENERAL CHIANG +++$+++ Then, we will begin with replacing the Tibetan flag with the flag of the Motherland.
L339357 +++$+++ u6243 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LUKHANGWA +++$+++ I will not approve it.
L339356 +++$+++ u6236 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ GENERAL CHIANG +++$+++ Plans for absorbing the Tibetan army into the People's Army will soon be finalized.
L339355 +++$+++ u6243 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LUKHANGWA +++$+++ Chairman Mao can keep China. Just give us back Tibet.
L339354 +++$+++ u6236 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ GENERAL CHIANG +++$+++ To protect. To serve you. Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now.
L339353 +++$+++ u6243 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LUKHANGWA +++$+++ Why is it necessary for the Chinese to keep so many soldiers in Lhasa?
L339352 +++$+++ u6243 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LUKHANGWA +++$+++ It depends on the quality. And, that it be Indian.
L339351 +++$+++ u6236 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ GENERAL CHIANG +++$+++ How much tea do you drink, Prime Minister?
L339350 +++$+++ u6243 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LUKHANGWA +++$+++ So far, they do. But, the quantity, it does not exist. You will have to re-evaluate your needs.
L339349 +++$+++ u6236 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ GENERAL CHIANG +++$+++ The People's Liberation Army pays for all food and lodging.
L339348 +++$+++ u6243 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LUKHANGWA +++$+++ Impossible! You will bring famine down on the people of Tibet with these insatiable demands! More food, the best land for your soldiers to camp.
L339347 +++$+++ u6236 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ GENERAL CHIANG +++$+++ We want 2,000 more tons of barley distributed.
L339346 +++$+++ u6243 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LUKHANGWA +++$+++ Are you, General?
L339345 +++$+++ u6236 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ GENERAL CHIANG +++$+++ We are simply respecting the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement.
L339344 +++$+++ u6243 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LUKHANGWA +++$+++ You have cracked a man's skull and that crack has not healed. It is too soon to expect him to be your friend.
L339343 +++$+++ u6236 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ GENERAL CHIANG +++$+++ You must also do something about the public meetings. I see this, memorandum circulating, with Tibetan grievances.
L339311 +++$+++ u6237 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU +++$+++ Good. Our first request is that you allow us to build a road. You have no roads in Tibet. We can discuss the plans in Lhasa. When you return.
L339310 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Soon.
L339309 +++$+++ u6237 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU +++$+++ Do you have plans to return soon, Dalai Lama?
L339306 +++$+++ u6237 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU +++$+++ I have a copy for you.
L339305 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ I have.
L339304 +++$+++ u6237 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU +++$+++ Have you heard the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement?
L339303 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Thank you. Please sit.
L339302 +++$+++ u6237 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU +++$+++ We bring greetings from Chairman Mao.
L339301 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ General Chiang.
L339300 +++$+++ u6237 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ GENERAL CHIANG CHIN-WU +++$+++ Dalai Lama.
L339317 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ If I were to go into exile, could we expect any serious assistance, from India, suppose?
L339316 +++$+++ u6238 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ KASHAG MEMBER +++$+++ Your Prime Ministers, support the proposal that you return to Lhasa. On the opposite hand, some officials urge you not to return. They believe you should leave now, for India.
L339299 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Then, we shall meet.
L339298 +++$+++ u6238 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ KASHAG MEMBER +++$+++ General Chiang Chin-wu, the Chinese representative, is en route to Dromo. He is coming to meet you.
L339297 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Yes.
L339296 +++$+++ u6238 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ KASHAG MEMBER +++$+++ Holiness?
L339295 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Yes, but they say he did.
L339294 +++$+++ u6238 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ KASHAG MEMBER +++$+++ Ngabo did not have the state seal. He could not sign.
L339285 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Time to study.
L339284 +++$+++ u6238 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ KASHAG MEMBER +++$+++ Yes.
L339281 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ He is a capable man.
L339280 +++$+++ u6238 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ KASHAG MEMBER +++$+++ Not yet, but the Governor of Chamdo, Ngabo Jigme, suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to Peking.
L339279 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China?
L339278 +++$+++ u6238 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ KASHAG MEMBER +++$+++ I am afraid.
L339277 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ With much bloodshed.
L339276 +++$+++ u6238 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ KASHAG MEMBER +++$+++ Yes. Most of the Chamdo region is now in Chinese hands. There is a report from Chamdo which makes quite clear that, unless some settlement can soon be reached, Communist troops will soon be marching on Lhasa.
L339275 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ So, we must face China and all her might alone.
L339271 +++$+++ u6238 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ KASHAG MEMBER +++$+++ The United Nations voted not to hear our appeal.
L339270 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ And the United Nations? Surely?
L339268 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ All?
L339267 +++$+++ u6238 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ KASHAG MEMBER +++$+++ Of the Tibetan delegations sent abroad, all have been turned away.
L339124 +++$+++ u6238 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ KASHAG MEMBER +++$+++ We did not.
L339123 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Did you receive the letter?
L339122 +++$+++ u6238 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ KASHAG MEMBER +++$+++ The Tibetans were introduced as delegates from the "Chinese region of Tibet". We protested this reference and demanded a letter rebutting it.
L339121 +++$+++ u6238 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ KASHAG MEMBER +++$+++ Very complicated, Holiness. Let me tell you current news. The Chinese have launched a deceptive campaign aimed at convincing the world that Tibet belongs to China. We sent a mission to the Chinese National Conference. Our attendance was a grave mistake.
L339116 +++$+++ u6238 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ KASHAG MEMBER +++$+++ It is calm.
L339115 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ The Sera monks have surrendered?
L339114 +++$+++ u6238 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ KASHAG MEMBER +++$+++ He has been imprisoned, here in the Potala, Holiness.
L338930 +++$+++ u6246 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ We do not know.
L338929 +++$+++ u6239 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LHAMO +++$+++ Who am I?
L338915 +++$+++ u6246 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Yes, yes. Your brothers are here.
L338914 +++$+++ u6239 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LHAMO +++$+++ This many?
L338913 +++$+++ u6246 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Two.
L338912 +++$+++ u6239 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LHAMO +++$+++ How many?
L338911 +++$+++ u6246 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I will be back in a few days.
L338899 +++$+++ u6246 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I miss him too.
L338898 +++$+++ u6239 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LHAMO +++$+++ I miss my brother.
L338897 +++$+++ u6246 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ You did. We washed you and wrapped you in sheepskin and took you to your father. That day the father got better. And that day, a pair of crows came to nest in our roof. I just remembered.
L338896 +++$+++ u6239 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LHAMO +++$+++ I pooped.
L338895 +++$+++ u6246 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ At dawn, you were born. One eye was closed, and your sister opened it with her thumb. We gave you the sweet drink.
L338894 +++$+++ u6239 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LHAMO +++$+++ Me. First break of day.
L338893 +++$+++ u6246 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Yes. A cow had died. One night, you stopped all your moving, and I said to your sister, "His time has come."
L338892 +++$+++ u6239 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LHAMO +++$+++ Cow.
L338891 +++$+++ u6246 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ He had been sick from the time you began growing in me. We thought he would die.
L338890 +++$+++ u6246 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Your father had been very sick.
L338863 +++$+++ u6239 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LHAMO +++$+++ Far, far away.
L338862 +++$+++ u6246 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Oh, no. Where will he go?
L339049 +++$+++ u6240 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LING RINPOCHE +++$+++ Answer. 
L339048 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ I need to squeeze this brain.
L339045 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ The causes of suffering arise from true sources. Attachment, desire, envy, hatred, greed, unkindness, wrong view and so forth -- these are some causes of suffering.
L339044 +++$+++ u6240 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LING RINPOCHE +++$+++ I accept it. What are the causes of suffering?
L339043 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ True suffering arises from contaminated actions and afflictions. Birth, illness, grief, old age, poverty, pain, death -- these are surferings.
L339042 +++$+++ u6240 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LING RINPOCHE +++$+++ I accept it. What is suffering?
L339041 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ The Four Noble Truths, as taught by the Lord Sakyamuni Buddha are: The Truth of Suffering The Truth of the Cause of Suffering, The Truth of the Cessation of Suffering, the Truth of the Way which leads to the cessation of Suffering.
L339014 +++$+++ u6241 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LOBSANG +++$+++ Not until you are eighteen.
L339013 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ I am him.
L339012 +++$+++ u6241 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LOBSANG +++$+++ You can't do anything real until you are Dalai Lama.
L339002 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Do you have money?
L339001 +++$+++ u6241 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LOBSANG +++$+++ What do you think?
L339000 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Do I have money?
L338999 +++$+++ u6241 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LOBSANG +++$+++ You could buy them.
L338998 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Can I save the sheep from going to the market? So they don't die.
L339431 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Arrange for me to speak to the people's leaders.
L339430 +++$+++ u6242 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LORD CHAMBERLAIN +++$+++ We are now accused of aiding the rebels. The Chinese said we can expect drastic measures to be taken to crush this revolt.
L339424 +++$+++ u6242 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LORD CHAMBERLAIN +++$+++ I will alert the Chinese delegation. You know, I would never have let you go alone, Kundun.
L339423 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ I will not go.
L339422 +++$+++ u6242 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LORD CHAMBERLAIN +++$+++ The crowd will not disperse until you give your assurance that you will not attend the Chinese festivities. Many who have been invited to dine with the Chinese do not return home.
L339411 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ The people will not allow it.
L339410 +++$+++ u6242 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LORD CHAMBERLAIN +++$+++ They will take Lhasa next.
L339400 +++$+++ u6242 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LORD CHAMBERLAIN +++$+++ Non-violence means co-operation when it is possible. Resistance, when it is not.
L339399 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ The pursuit of non-violence. Very difficult.
L339398 +++$+++ u6242 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LORD CHAMBERLAIN +++$+++ The Communists put their guns in the hands of the Khamba children and force the child to kill the parent. They have dropped bombs on the monastery of Lithang in Kham. It has been destroyed. Women and children, trying to escape from the fighting, have been shot with machine guns, fired from airplanes.
L339397 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ I have always asked for plain information. Just the truth.
L339396 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ A beggar can be called a landlord if he disapproves of the Chinese.
L339395 +++$+++ u6242 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LORD CHAMBERLAIN +++$+++ Land reform is underway in Amdo. The large estates are being confiscated and redistributed. Landlords are being punished.
L339394 +++$+++ u6242 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LORD CHAMBERLAIN +++$+++ The Khamba's gun is his most prized possession. I admire them so. They face a modern, well equipped army, and still, they fight.
L339393 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ I ask them to stop, to lay down their guns.
L339390 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ I had relinquished doubt.
L339389 +++$+++ u6242 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LORD CHAMBERLAIN +++$+++ Did you ever doubt it?
L339325 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ My first and foremost duty is to protect my people. I feel sure of this. And, things change. Maybe not right away, maybe not soon. But I believe this -- things will change.
L339324 +++$+++ u6242 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LORD CHAMBERLAIN +++$+++ Shall we consult the protective deities, Holiness?
L339323 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ I am scared.
L339321 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Tibet, at war? No. China is close, America is far away. After countless people die, China would still, always, be close. We will work with what we have.
L339320 +++$+++ u6242 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LORD CHAMBERLAIN +++$+++ The Chinese would see such a pact as an open declaration of war.
L339319 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ At this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war.
L339318 +++$+++ u6242 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LORD CHAMBERLAIN +++$+++ It is unlikely. America, perhaps. There is great anti-communist feeling in America.
L339283 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ And then they would concede that the times are desperate and we must go to Peking. Agreed. Send Ngabo. Is that all?
L339282 +++$+++ u6242 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LORD CHAMBERLAIN +++$+++ Your prime minsters would argue that such negotiations should take place in Lhasa.
L339274 +++$+++ u6242 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LORD CHAMBERLAIN +++$+++ In the Americas.
L339273 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Where is that?
L339272 +++$+++ u6242 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LORD CHAMBERLAIN +++$+++ One country did sponsor the resolution. A land called "El Salvador".
L339169 +++$+++ u6242 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LORD CHAMBERLAIN +++$+++ The radio contact said one officer had died. Then he said, "The Chinese soldiers -- they are coming." And then, the radio went dead.
L339168 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Has anyone died?
L339167 +++$+++ u6242 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LORD CHAMBERLAIN +++$+++ Eight thousand, five hundred, soldiers and officers. We have recently requested mortars, anti-aircraft guns and ammunition from India. We have several hundred in the area.
L339166 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ What is the size of our army, now?
L339136 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ I shall send a letter to America, to the President, informing him of our problem.
L339135 +++$+++ u6242 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LORD CHAMBERLAIN +++$+++ Quite simple. Yes. Good.
L339134 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Ask the Chinese mission to leave our country. Immediately.
L339133 +++$+++ u6242 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LORD CHAMBERLAIN +++$+++ America, we shall see.
L339132 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ And, America?
L339131 +++$+++ u6242 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LORD CHAMBERLAIN +++$+++ Britain chooses not to.
L339130 +++$+++ u6251 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ TENZIN GYATSO +++$+++ Britain?
L339129 +++$+++ u6242 +++$+++ m417 +++$+++ LORD CHAMBERLAIN +++$+++ India is a newly independent nation. They are struggling. India is in no position to help us.
