L439800 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?
L439799 +++$+++ u2460 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I don't get it.
L439798 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Oh, faith's a little more than just believing.
L439797 +++$+++ u2460 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ You believe in it.
L439796 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I think we go on. I'm not sure what happens after we die, but yeah-- I have faith in that.
L439795 +++$+++ u2460 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Do you believe that?
L439794 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard.
L439793 +++$+++ u2460 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Sure, carnation. Like in that movie you rented, Audrey Rose.
L439792 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I don't know, honey. Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. Some believe in heaven or hell. Some think we're born again as little children--
L439791 +++$+++ u2460 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think?
L439790 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ But don't you dare say that.
L439789 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Well, I think Michael McDowell is so full of shit he probably squeaks when he walks, my dear.
L439788 +++$+++ u2460 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell.
L439787 +++$+++ u2460 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge went to heaven?
L439786 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ What's up, sugar?
L439784 +++$+++ u2460 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Missy made the best chocolate chip cookies in the world--even Mom said so. Now there won't be any more because she's gonna be dead forever!
L439783 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Huh?
L439782 +++$+++ u2460 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ No more chocolate chip cookies.
L439781 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Ellie? What's wrong?
L439772 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ That's enough, Ellen.
L439771 +++$+++ u2460 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ She's in bed. She was throwing up. Ever since Mrs. Rogers called and said Missy--
L439763 +++$+++ u2460 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I hate that smell.
L439762 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I've noticed it, too. I'll cough up the money, Ellen.
L439759 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I know.
L439758 +++$+++ u2460 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Because you promised.
L439757 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Yes.
L439756 +++$+++ u2460 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Is he really all right?
L439755 +++$+++ u2460 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Cause I had a bad dream about him. I dreamed he got hit by a car and you and Mr. Crandall buried him in the Pet Sematary.
L439754 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Yes...I guess so. He was sleeping on the front porch when I left.
L439708 +++$+++ u2460 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Fine...except when Mom was airing Gage's diaper rash, he walked away and got into Grampa's study and pooped in Grampa's favorite chair.
L439707 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Yeah, I know...how are things out there in Chicagoland?
L439572 +++$+++ u2460 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation!
L439571 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Good God! Where'd you hear that?
L439559 +++$+++ u2460 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ It doesn't seem long to me. It seems short. I think the whole thing about pets dying s-s-sucks!
L439558 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Lovey...Church might be still alive when you're in a high school...and that's a very long time.
L439557 +++$+++ u2460 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ In the end he's gonna croak, isn't he?
L439556 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Well, it's always better to take precautions--but I'm sure Church will be all right, honey...
L439555 +++$+++ u2460 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ That's what I think. I heard Missy Dandridge tell Mom when Church was fixed he wouldn't cross the road so much.
L439550 +++$+++ u2460 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ To remember.
L439549 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ And that someone cared enough about that animal to mark the spot.
L439534 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ For a little while.
L439533 +++$+++ u2460 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I want to look around, daddy-- may I?
L439529 +++$+++ u2460 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Well, I thought it was safe--
L439528 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Have you got a death-wish, Ellen?
L439468 +++$+++ u2460 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Yayyy!
L439467 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ No-I guess not.
L439449 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Anyone who can scream that loud isn't ready for intensive care just yet-- looks like she just skinned her knee.
L439448 +++$+++ u2460 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Hurrts! It hurrrrts!
L439436 +++$+++ u2460 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Yaay!
L439435 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Yes.
L439933 +++$+++ u2464 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Don't bother. I'm coming home.
L439932 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to--
L439931 +++$+++ u2464 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Was it Pascow?
L439930 +++$+++ u2464 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Jud, do you remember the name of the student that died on Louis's first day at work? The one that was hit by a car?
L439929 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ No--but if he drops by, I'll tell him to call you.
L439522 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ Well, but Missus Creed! It ain't quite that way, deah!
L439521 +++$+++ u2464 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ How can you call it a good thing? A graveyard for pets killed in the road! Built and maintained by broken- hearted children!
L439466 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ Same here. Come over and visit when you get the chance.
L439465 +++$+++ u2464 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Excuse me, Mr. Crandall--I've got to change this kid. It's nice to meet you.
L439461 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ No harm, no foul. But you want to watch out for that road. Those damn trucks go back and forth all day and most of the night.
L439460 +++$+++ u2464 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here.
L439459 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ Jud Crandall. I live just across the road.
L439869 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ Why...that sometimes dead is better. That's all. Sometimes dead is better.
L439868 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I'll bite--what's the bottom of the truth, Jud?
L439866 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ And because the dead walked.
L439865 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Because something called a wendigo soured the ground.
L439864 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ I know the Micmacs thought it was a holy place...and then they thought it was a cursed place. That's why they moved on.
L439863 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ Ayuh--it's a mess, all right.
L439862 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Shit! Look at this mess!
L439861 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ --but I think the thought has crossed your mind.
L439859 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I'm thinking about going to bed.
L439858 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ You're thinking of things best not thought of, Louis.
L439857 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Jud, I buried my son today and I'm very tired. I wonder if we could just--
L439845 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ Louis--
L439844 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ No...squatting out there at the Holiday Inn like a couple of vultures. He really thinks Rachel's going to go back with them. Her and Ellie.
L439843 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ Your father-in-law packs a wallop, for an old guy. He and his wife gone back to Chicago?
L439780 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ Nope. He's your cat now.
L439779 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ It's Ellie's cat.
L439778 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?
L439777 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ My father used to have a saying, Jud-- "God sees the truth, but waits."
L439776 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ Poor Missy. God, I was sorry to hear. I remember when she was no older'n Ellen there, walking down to the store with her Raggedy Anne doll draggin' behind her in the dust. I don't know why God takes someone like her, who should have a bunch of years still in front of them, and lets an old shit like me just go on and on.
L439774 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ This babe has said enough.
L439773 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.
L439770 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Well...a touch of the flu...
L439769 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ Rachel not feeling well?
L439744 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ Ellie's a little scared of death. And the main reason Ellie's that way is because your wife is a lot scared of death. Now you just go ahead and tell me I'm wrong.
L439743 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ What?
L439742 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ A man doesn't always know why he does things, Louis. I think I did it because your daughter ain't ready for her favorite pet to die.
L439741 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ She got used to the idea. Spot lived another four years. He died peacefully in the night that second time, and I buried him in the Pet Sematary...where his bones still lie.
L439740 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ A little upset is all she was? Because I'll tell you, Jud, my brains feel a little like a nuclear reactor on the edge of a meltdown.
L439739 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ Why, then, things should be fine.
L439738 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Yes.
L439737 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ Well, she was a little upset at first, and that's why I thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night...you did, didn't you, Louis?
L439735 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ Stanny B. did for me what I did for you last night, Louis. Only I wasn't alone when Spot came back.
L439734 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You and this old Indian rag-man--
L439732 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ Spirit of the north country. Not a good spirit. Wendigos are great liars and tricksters, according to the stories. And if one touches you...
L439731 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Wendigo?
L439730 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ They buried their dead and for a long time their dead stayed buried. Then something happened. Half the tribe died in a season. The rest moved on. They said a Wendigo had soured the ground.
L439728 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ I guess it wouldn't hurt.
L439727 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Can I have another one?
L439726 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ Ayuh. It was the rag-man told me about the place--Stanley Bouchard. Us kids just called him Stanny B. He was half Micmac himself.
L439725 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ No. I'm a doctor. I know death when I see it, and Church was dead. He smells horrible and he uses his claws, but he's alive...and I feel like I'm going crazy. It was that place, wasn't it?
L439724 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ Wouldn't wash?
L439723 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I tried to tell myself I buried him alive. You know--Edgar Allan Poe meets Felix the Cat. But...
L439722 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ Why, saved a little girl from being unhappy...that's all. Drink up, Louis!
L439721 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ What did we do, Jud?
L439720 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ I most generally don't start before noon, but this looks like an exception.
L439704 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ No buts! Accept what's done, Louis. What we done was right. Another time it might not be, but tonight it was... at least I hope to Christ it was. Now you make your call...but not a word about tonight.
L439703 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ But--
L439697 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ Because it's right.
L439696 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Jud, why am I doing all this?
L439695 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ Don't worry about that.
L439694 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Doesn't look like they last long.
L439693 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ Your cairn.
L439692 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ What are those for?
L439689 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ Soil's thin, all right. But you'll manage.
L439688 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.
L439687 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ You want to rest a bit before you start?
L439686 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I guess so...but...
L439685 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later. All right?
L439684 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Why? For God's sake, why?
L439683 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat.
L439682 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Whose burying ground?
L439681 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ This was their burying ground, Louis.
L439680 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ This time I mean it.
L439679 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You keep saying that.
L439678 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ Almost there, Louis.
L439677 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ Just don't stop, Louis. You don't ever want to stop down here in Little God.  And you don't ever want to look behind you, whatever you hear.
L439676 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ It's funny, all right.
L439675 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You're telling me.
L439674 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ There's a lot of funny things down this way, Louis.
L439672 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ Ayuh.
L439671 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Is there quicksand?
L439670 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp.
L439668 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ You'll see before long. Let's go.
L439667 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?
L439666 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ No, you shouldn't have stopped. But you got away with it. Important thing is are you sure you're all right?
L439660 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ Give me the cat. I'll take care of it myself.
L439659 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I'm not climbing that.
L439658 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ No. We won't. I have climbed it a time or two before, and I know all the places to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. If you stop, you'll crash through for sure.
L439657 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ We can't climb over that. We'll break our necks!
L439656 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ The place we're going is on the other side of that.
L439655 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ What do you mean?
L439654 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ We're still not where we're going.
L439653 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Nothing.  Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?
L439652 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ What say, Louis?
L439650 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ Then come on.
L439649 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Yes, but--
L439648 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ Does she love the cat?
L439647 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ But--
L439646 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ It's going to be dark before we even get where we're going, Louis. But we can do it...and we're going to.
L439645 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Jud, this is crazy. It's going to be almost dark before we get back.
L439644 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Maybe when they call I'll just tell Ellie I haven't seen the damn cat around. You know?
L439643 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ No need to apologize.
L439641 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ Seems like you told me about a promise you made--
L439640 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I don't know.
L439639 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ Going to tell Ellie?
L439638 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ You going to bury him in the Pet Sematary?
L439637 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Bagged cat. What a mess.
L439636 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Yes.
L439635 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she?
L439634 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Ellie will, though. She'll suffer plenty.
L439633 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered.
L439632 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ It's Church.
L439631 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus.
L439630 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's.
L439629 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't go because her old man thinks I'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow night. Jud, what's this about?
L439628 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ Did you tell me Rachel took the kids back to Chicago for a few days?
L439553 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ Me neither. But I believe in knowing your enemy.
L439552 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ My wife is not crazy about cemeteries of any kind. As you may have noticed.
L439545 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I think it is so, Ellie.
L439544 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ No--not right out loud. Their stones speak...or their markers. Even if the marker ain't nothing but a tin can someone wrote on with a Magic Marker, it speaks. Ain't that so, Louis?
L439536 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ Ayuh--they get older as you go toward the middle.  Pete LaVasseur's dog is buried there...  the Stoppard boys' racing pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat got...and I think that's the cat himself right there, although it's been so many years I can't tell for sure.  Missy Ellen! Come over here just a minute!
L439535 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I can hardly read these.
L439516 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile.
L439515 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Not yet...how much further is it?
L439514 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up ahead is all that's left of their tribal lands.
L439513 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper companies?
L439510 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Sure.
L439509 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ You folks ready to go on?
L439502 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ What's at the end of it?
L439501 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ That road--and those Orinco trucks-- are the two main reasons it's there.
L439500 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ The one that goes into the woods--sure.
L439499 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ I like rock and roll. No...I guess that's too mild. I love it. Since my ears started to die out on me, it's the only music I can really hear. And since my wife died...I dunno, some- times a little rock and roll fills up night. Not always, but sometimes.  One more time--welcome to Ludlow. Hope your time here will be a happy one.
L439498 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Nice.
L439495 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ The Eat A Peach album. God, they were good before drugs and bad luck caught up with them. Listen to this, Louis.
L439494 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ What?
L439493 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ Allman Brothers.
L439492 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ What were you listening to?
L439491 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself.
L439490 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ God, that's fine.
L439489 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ Good for you.
L439488 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Not at all.
L439487 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ You need a glass?
L439472 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Well, maybe I----
L439471 +++$+++ u2461 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ JUD +++$+++ Movin' in's mighty thirsty work. I usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner. Come on over and join me, if you want.
L439470 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Hey--they actually found the place!
L439914 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Don't talk like an asshole even if you are just a bit of underdone potato or a blot of mustard.
L439913 +++$+++ u2463 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ PASCOW +++$+++ Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
L439912 +++$+++ u2462 +++$+++ m158 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I'll tell you where the ground is sour--the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong.
