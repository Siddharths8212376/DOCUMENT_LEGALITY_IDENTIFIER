L295434 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I told you you'd get your money back.
L295433 +++$+++ u1415 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ This boy's crazy. They wiped the floor with him. They beat his brains out and he wants to go back.  What for? To take another beating?
L295432 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Never been out of it. I'm gonna beat that fat man... with that curly hair, and those diamond rings, and that carnation.
L295431 +++$+++ u1415 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Are you figuring on going back to Ames to play Minnesota Fats again? Is that what's on your mind?
L295430 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I'll connect. I'll get you your money back.
L295429 +++$+++ u1415 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What kind of life have you got here? Scufflin' around the small rooms, picking up eight, ten bucks a day?
L295428 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Aah! I've got no stomach for that any more. I've had that kind of life.
L295427 +++$+++ u1415 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I want you to come back on the road with me.
L295426 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Talk to me, Charlie.
L295425 +++$+++ u1415 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Yeah, yeah, like a son.  I've known this boy since he was sixteen. The first time I saw him, back in Oakland, I said, "This is a talented boy. This is a smart boy."
L295424 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ A son.
L295423 +++$+++ u1415 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You walked out on me like that. No goodbye, no nothing. Like a thief in the dark. We were partners. We were more than partners.  He was like a... like --
L295422 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ So am I... Sit down.  Would you get us a couple of drinks?
L295421 +++$+++ u1415 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ How do you want me to play it? I'm broke.

L295243 +++$+++ u1415 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken.

L295190 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Charlie, I'm gonna take him.

L295125 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Ten grand! I mean, what other poolroom is there in the country where a guy can walk out with ten grand in one night? Jeez, you know, I can remember hustling an old man for a dime a game.
L295124 +++$+++ u1415 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Okay... Okay. Nobody can beat you.
L295123 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Ten grand. I'm gonna win ten grand in one night.  ...Well, who's gonna beat me? C'mon, Charlie, who's gonna beat me?
L295115 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I'll be alive when I get out, Charlie.
L295114 +++$+++ u1415 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Looks more like a morgue to me. Those pool tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.
L295113 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Yeah, like a church. Church of the Good Hustler.
L295112 +++$+++ u1415 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ It's quiet.

L295100 +++$+++ u1415 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I don't want it.
L295099 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Up the flagpole with the convention. C'mon, Charlie. You're into me now. I got my money on the table.
L295098 +++$+++ u1415 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Let's get back on the road. You gotta be at that convention in the morning.

L295088 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I couldn't, huh? Okay. Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before.
L295087 +++$+++ u1415 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You know what I mean. You couldn't make that shot again in a million years.
L295086 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Luck! Whaddya mean, luck?
L295085 +++$+++ u1415 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You ought to take up crap shooting. Talk about luck!
L295076 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Oh, come on, stop stalling. Grab yourself a cue.
L295075 +++$+++ u1415 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ It's gonna cost ya money. It always does.
L295072 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Yep. Fastest and the bestest... Hey, give us another round, will ya? One for him, one for yourself.
L295071 +++$+++ u1415 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Druggist supplies. Buster here is gonna get an award.  No, he sold seventeen thousand bucks' worth of stuff last month. Fastest boy in the territory.
L295894 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Yeah. Sure.
L295893 +++$+++ u1418 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ FINDLEY +++$+++ Yeah. You must come again.

L295891 +++$+++ u1418 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ FINDLEY +++$+++ Charles, will you call a cab for these gentlemen, please.  I'd show you to the door, but I...
L295890 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Yeah, sure has.
L295889 +++$+++ u1418 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ FINDLEY +++$+++ Here.  Been an interestin' evening.
L295871 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ For who, Mr. Findley? ...Bert, he only beat me by one point. Now, you can't get off me now.
L295870 +++$+++ u1418 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ FINDLEY +++$+++ Ah, that's unfortunate, Mr. Felson.
L295869 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ There it is. I'm broke.
L295845 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Okay?
L295844 +++$+++ u1418 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ FINDLEY +++$+++ Like to raise the stakes, Mr. Felson?
L295836 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Oh no, nothing for me.
L295835 +++$+++ u1418 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ FINDLEY +++$+++ Beautiful shot, Felson. Beautiful. You've played billiards before, Mr. Felson. Ah, you gentlemen sure you don't care for a drink?
L295825 +++$+++ u1418 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ FINDLEY +++$+++ I don't play pool, Mr. Felson. I play billiards. My house, my game. You don't have to play if you don't want to.
L295824 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I thought we came here to play pool.
L295823 +++$+++ u1418 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ FINDLEY +++$+++ By all means.
L295822 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ No, none for me. Come on, let's play.
L295821 +++$+++ u1418 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ FINDLEY +++$+++ You gentlemen care for a drink?
L295811 +++$+++ u1418 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ FINDLEY +++$+++ I'm having some people over for drinks right after the races. Why don't you all come over? Then about nine, ten o'clock we can play.
L295810 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What time?
L295809 +++$+++ u1418 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ FINDLEY +++$+++ Would you like to come out tonight?
L295808 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ That's right. When?
L295807 +++$+++ u1418 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ FINDLEY +++$+++ You're very direct, Mr. Felson.
L295806 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ When?
L295803 +++$+++ u1418 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ FINDLEY +++$+++ Bert, I believe Mr. Felson's making a proposition.
L295802 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ How much?
L295801 +++$+++ u1418 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ FINDLEY +++$+++ I'll bet you do, Mr. Felson. I'll just bet you do.
L295798 +++$+++ u1418 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ FINDLEY +++$+++ A little, although I'm afraid I generally lose.
L295797 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Now and then. Why, do you?
L295796 +++$+++ u1418 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ FINDLEY +++$+++ And I you.  I think I've heard about you, Mr. Felson. You play pocket billiards, don't you?
L295795 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Glad to meet you.
L295794 +++$+++ u1418 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ FINDLEY +++$+++ Findley.
L295792 +++$+++ u1418 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ FINDLEY +++$+++ Well, hello. Haven't seen you in a long time.

L295493 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What's the limit?
L295350 +++$+++ u1419 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ PLAYER +++$+++ Oh man, you're way out of our league.
L295349 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Hey, I'll tell you what -- I'll play you jack-up pool -- just keep one hand in my pocket.
L295348 +++$+++ u1419 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ PLAYER +++$+++ Now, look, fella, I saw you playing at Ames the other night.
L295347 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Who's he?
L295346 +++$+++ u1419 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ PLAYER +++$+++ Hey, you're Eddie Felson, aren't you?
L295345 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Hey, uh, mister? Hey, okay if I grab a cue?
L295597 +++$+++ u1421 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ Yeah, I'm quittin'.
L295596 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You quittin', friend?
L295591 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I don't rattle, kid. But just for that I'm gonna beat you flat.
L295590 +++$+++ u1421 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ You better not miss, friend.
L295588 +++$+++ u1421 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ Heads.
L295587 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Call it.
L295586 +++$+++ u1421 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ Okay, friend. You're on.
L295585 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Let's cut out the small stuff, huh? Hundred dollar freeze-out. Ten games, ten bucks a game, winner take all. And then we'll see who quits.
L295584 +++$+++ u1421 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ You sure you don't want to quit, friend?
L295583 +++$+++ u1421 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ Okay.
L295582 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Shoot.
L295581 +++$+++ u1421 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ Try me.
L295580 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You know what, kid? I think maybe you're a hustler.
L295579 +++$+++ u1421 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ You wanna raise the bet? Two on the five, five on the nine?
L295578 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Yeah, I guess it is, boy. Just you and me.
L295577 +++$+++ u1421 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ I guess it's just you and me, huh?
L295576 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Couple of bucks.
L295575 +++$+++ u1421 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ How much are you ahead?
L295574 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You're a pretty good player.
L295573 +++$+++ u1421 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ You quittin' too?

L295567 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ How much you playin' for?
L295564 +++$+++ u1421 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ YOUNG MAN +++$+++ Hi.
L295563 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Hi.
L295883 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Would you get off my back, Sarah? Once and for all, will you get out, will you GET OFF MY BACK?!
L295882 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Don't wear a mask, Eddie. You don't have to.  That's Turk, Eddie, the man who broke your thumbs. Only he's not going to break your thumbs. He'll break your heart, your guts. And for the same reason -- 'cause he hates you, 'cause of what you are. 'Cause of what you have and he hasn't.
L295881 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Shut up.
L295880 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Doesn't all of this come through to you, Eddie? Doesn't any of this mean anything to you? That man, this place, the people. They wear masks, Eddie. And underneath the masks they're perverted, twisted, crippled.
L295879 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Would you go on back to the hotel? Take a cab, go on back to the hotel.
L295878 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Please, Eddie, don't beg him.
L295877 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Go on back to the hotel.
L295816 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ I'm a little tired.
L295815 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Well, what's the matter?
L295814 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ If you don't mind I think I'll stay at the hotel.
L295783 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Just for luck.
L295782 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Why?
L295781 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Well, that old lovin' horse paid twenty-two forty.  Let's see... two hundred I won from the jockey last night. And today at the track... I got five hundred and forty bucks.  Here, you hold it.
L295780 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ He went off someplace.
L295779 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Where's Bert?
L295759 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I'll be up later.
L295758 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Fifty-seven.
L295702 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ No.  I made you up, didn't I, Eddie? You weren't real. I made you up, like everything else. There was no car crash, Eddie. When I was five, I had polio. I was never an actress. The rich old man is my father. He walked out on us when I was seven. He sends me a check every month. That's how he buys his way out of my life. The men I've known... after they left, I'd say they weren't real, I made them up. But you, Eddie. I wanted you to be real.
L295701 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Well, what's your idea of love? Chains?
L295700 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ I'd know it, Eddie. I'd know. For God's sakes, what are you trying to do to me? I love you.
L295699 +++$+++ u1416 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I got no idea of love. And neither have you. I mean, neither one of us would know what it was if we saw it coming down the street.
L295698 +++$+++ u1420 +++$+++ m94 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ What do you want me to do? Just sit here and wait? Faithful little Sarah. Pull the shades down and sit. When you feel like coming back, you'll come back. And you'll love me. And then you'll go away again. Is that your idea of love?
