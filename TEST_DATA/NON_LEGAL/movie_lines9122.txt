L270317 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Thank you.
L270316 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Oh, it's all right. It's organic.
L270315 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Well, I really don't drink...
L270314 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?
L270312 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Yes.
L270311 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Look, the ice is melting.
L270310 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ He's never finished one yet. He has around him every kind of hand tool known to man, but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake.
L270309 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ It is kind of rough.
L270308 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ An ice sculpture. It's Venus - the Goddess of Love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream.
L270307 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What is that he's working on?
L270306 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ We'll come back in the morning.
L270305 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ He's fallen asleep, as usual.
L270304 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Is he all right?
L270303 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Oh, my. We're too late.
L270294 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Oh, wait, Maude. Look!
L270293 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Yes, you're right. We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.
L270292 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Don't you think we should get some tools, maybe?
L270291 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Exactly.
L270290 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ But this is public property.
L270289 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Why not?
L270288 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ But we can't just dig it up!
L270287 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ We'll transplant it. To the forest.
L270286 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ But what?
L270285 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Look at it, Harold. It's suffocating. It's the smog. People can live with it, but it gives trees asthma. They can't breathe. See the leaves are all brown. Harold, we've got to do something about this life.
L270284 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ That little tree. It's in trouble. Come on.
L270283 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What is it?
L270282 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Over there by the courthouse.
L270281 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What?
L270280 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Look.
L270279 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What happened?
L270278 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Well...
L270277 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ The universal language of mankind.  What music do you like, Harold?
L270276 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Oh, it's only a machine, Harold. It's not as if it were <u>alive</u>, like a horse or a camel. We may live in a machine age, but I simply can't treat them as equals.  Of course, the age has its advantages.
L270275 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Boy, Maude. The way you handle cars. I'd never handle a car like that.
L270270 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Oooh, but they are not. Look.
L270269 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Because they are all the same.
L270268 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Why do you say that?
L270267 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I don't know. Just one of those. 
L270266 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ I should like to change into a sunflower most of all. They are so <u>tall</u> and simple. And you, Harold, what flower would you like to be?
L270263 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What do you mean?
L270262 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Well, it's all very thrilling, of course, but I ask you, Harold... Is it enough?
L270260 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Sterling silver. It was my dear mother-in-law's, part of a dinner set of fifty pieces. It's one of the few things that survived.  Oh, but I do rattle on so. Tell me about yourself, Harold.  What do you do when you aren't visiting funerals?
L270259 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ That's a nice teapot.
L270258 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
L270257 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You don't look eighty.
L270256 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?
L270255 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You look as if you could.
L270254 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Wonderful! Try something new each day. After all, we're given life to find it out. It doesn't last forever.
L270253 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Certainly a new experience for me.
L270252 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Here we are, Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger pie.
L270249 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ No, you have to touch it.  You have to run your hands over it, get close to it, really reach out and feel. You try it.
L270248 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Oh. Eh, I like it.
L270247 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ What do you think?
L270245 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ That's really great.
L270244 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ It goes on and on.
L270243 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Subways... Perfume... Cigarette...  ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u>
L270242 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Now I'll pump it up...  ... and you just turn the handles.  Okay. What do you smell?
L270240 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ It was my last. I then became infatuated with these -- my "Odorifics."
L270239 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Yes. Very much.
L270238 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ A self-portrait.  But over here is my favorite. It's titled "Rainbow with Egg Underneath and an Elephant." Do you like it?
L270237 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Oh, I'm so happy you said that because I wanted to show you my paintings. This is the "Rape of Rome" and, of course, there in the corner is quite a graphic depiction of Leda and the Swan.
L270236 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ No. 
L270235 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Really. Do you think it's wrong?
L270234 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Me! No. Of course not.
L270233 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form.  Do you disapprove?
L270232 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Do you often model for Glaucus?
L270231 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ She seemed yare to me.
L270230 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Oh, it's fine. Fine.
L270229 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?
L270228 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Eh, fine.
L270227 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ How about some ginger pie?
L270226 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Maude???!
L270225 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Harold?
L270160 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Promise?
L270159 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ All right.
L270158 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ My door is always open.
L270157 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ All right.
L270156 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Well, then, you must come back and visit.
L270155 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Sort of.
L270154 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Oh, at the dentist's?
L270153 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Thank you, but it's an appointment. I really shouldn't miss it.
L270152 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Well then.
L270151 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ No.
L270150 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ But it's oat straw tea. You've never had oat straw tea, have you?
L270149 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Thank you, but I really have to go.
L270148 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ She's very sweet, but so old- fashioned. Please sit down, Harold. I'll put on the kettle and we'll have a nice hot cup of tea.
L270146 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Oh, look! The birds.
L270145 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ It's very interesting.
L270144 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ It's all memorabilia, but incidental and not integral, if you know what I mean.
L270142 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Well, if some people are upset because they feel they have a hold on some things, then I'm merely acting as a gentle reminder - I'm sort of breaking it easy -- Here today, gone tomorrow, so don't get attached to <u>things</u>. Now, with that in mind, I'm not against collecting stuff...
L270141 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.
L270140 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ What owners, Harold? We don't <u>own</u> anything. It's a transitory world. We come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't "ownership" a little absurd?
L270139 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?
L270138 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.
L270137 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
L270136 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Of course, I've had to make some additions for the new models, but not as many as you might think. Once you have your basic set it's then only a question of variation.
L270133 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Oh.
L270132 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Yearse!
L270131 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Your hearse?
L270130 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ But this is my car.
L270129 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Well, it's a new experience for me.  Good on curves. Shall I take you home, Harold?
L270128 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Yes.
L270127 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Oh, so do I. They're such fun, aren't they? It's all change. All revolving. Burials and births. The end to the beginning and the beginning to the end -  - the great circle of life. My, this old thing handles well. Ever drive a hearse, Harold?
L270126 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Yes.
L270103 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ No.  I thought not.
L270102 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Eh, no.
L270101 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Do you sing and dance?
L270100 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What?
L270099 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Do you dance?
L270098 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Well then, I must be off.  We shall have to meet again.
L270097 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ No, thank you. I have my car.
L270096 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Can I drop you anywhere, Harold?
L270095 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Oh, thank you. I think we shall be great friends, don't you?
L270094 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Nice to meet you.
L270093 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie Chardin, but you may call me Maude.
L270092 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Harold Chasen.
L270091 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Oh, of course. What is your name?
L270090 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Eh, could I have my pen back now, please?
L270089 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ It's a question of emphasis, you might say. Accentuate the positive, so to speak.
L270085 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ I mean, seventy-five is too early, but at eighty-five, well, you're just marking time and you may as well look over the horizon.
L270084 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I don't know.
L270083 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?
L270082 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Eh, no.
L270081 +++$+++ u1273 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MAUDE +++$+++ You're welcome.  Did you know him?
L270080 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Eh, no. Thank you.
L270700 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Perhaps it is.
L270699 +++$+++ u1274 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MRS. CHASEN +++$+++ This is insane.
L270698 +++$+++ u1274 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MRS. CHASEN +++$+++ Harold!
L270697 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I'm going to marry the woman I love.
L270694 +++$+++ u1274 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MRS. CHASEN +++$+++ You don't care! "Miss Shroud of 1890 Weds the Boy of a Thousand Deaths!" Listen to me...
L270693 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I don't care what people say.
L270692 +++$+++ u1274 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MRS. CHASEN +++$+++ Oh... That's wonderful... I get an eighty-year-old pallbearer for a daughter-in-law! Be reasonable, Harold! You're dealing with your life! What will people say?!
L270691 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ At a funeral.
L270690 +++$+++ u1274 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MRS. CHASEN +++$+++ Love? Love? What do you <u>know</u> about her? Where does she come from? Where did you meet her?
L270683 +++$+++ u1274 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MRS. CHASEN +++$+++ A sunflower?
L270682 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What?
L270681 +++$+++ u1274 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MRS. CHASEN +++$+++ I suppose you think this is very funny, Harold.
L270680 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ To a girl. Here.
L270679 +++$+++ u1274 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MRS. CHASEN +++$+++ To whom?
L270678 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I'm getting married.
L270677 +++$+++ u1274 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MRS. CHASEN +++$+++ Fay, I'll call you back.  What did you say?
L270676 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Mother. I'm going to get married.
L270675 +++$+++ u1274 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MRS. CHASEN +++$+++ Harold, please! I'm on the phone.
L270674 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Mother.
L270673 +++$+++ u1274 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MRS. CHASEN +++$+++ Not now, Harold...  You can't put me down for Monday?
L270672 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Mother.
L270036 +++$+++ u1274 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MRS. CHASEN +++$+++ Well, I want you to go to bed directly after dinner. You know how susceptible you are to colds. Harold has always been a delicate child. Even as a baby he seemed to be abnormally prone to illness - Harold, dear, eat up your beets...
L270035 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I have a sore throat.
L270034 +++$+++ u1274 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MRS. CHASEN +++$+++ Of course, Harold's father had a similar sense of the absurd. I remember once in Paris he stepped out for cigarettes and the next I hear he's arrested for floating nude down the Seine - experimenting in river currents with a pair of yellow rubber water wings. Well, that cost quite a little bit of "enfluence" and "d'argent" to hush up, I can tell you. Harold, dear, stop playing with your food. Don't you feel well?
L270529 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ No. Like this.
L270528 +++$+++ u1278 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ SUNSHINE +++$+++ Like a tea ceremony?
L270527 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ An ancient Japanese ceremony.
L270526 +++$+++ u1278 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ SUNSHINE +++$+++ Ohhh. What's hari-kari?
L270525 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ This one is particularly interesting. It's a hari-kari blade.
L270522 +++$+++ u1278 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ SUNSHINE +++$+++ Oh, he's in the Army. I do so like the military, don't you? Those uniforms make men look so virile. I did "What Price Glory?" in summer stock. I played Charmaine - with a French accent.
L270521 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ No. My uncle.
L270520 +++$+++ u1278 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ SUNSHINE +++$+++ Oh, is this your father?
L270519 +++$+++ u1278 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ SUNSHINE +++$+++ Oh, I studied the guitar. I had to give it up. Gave me calluses on my fingers. As an actress I can't afford to have a tarnished instrument.
L270518 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ No. I'm learning the banjo. Do you?
L270517 +++$+++ u1278 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ SUNSHINE +++$+++ Do you play?
L270516 +++$+++ u1278 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ SUNSHINE +++$+++ Well, actually, it was the name of my drama teacher - Louis Sunshine. Perhaps you've heard of him. He was such an influence on the development of my instrument. That means my body - in theatre talk. Well, when I came to Hollywood I felt the need to express the emerging me in a new form, so I took on "Sunshine." Dore is my real name... Well, Dore, actually. My, what a lovely place you have here.
L270515 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Is Sunshine your real name?
L270514 +++$+++ u1278 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ SUNSHINE +++$+++ No, thank you. They stain my fingers.
L270513 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Would you like a cigarette?
L270509 +++$+++ u1278 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ SUNSHINE +++$+++ Can't complain.
L270508 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ How do you do?
L270192 +++$+++ u1277 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ PSYCHIATRIST +++$+++ What kind of stuff?
L270191 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff.
L270190 +++$+++ u1277 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ PSYCHIATRIST +++$+++ What would you say?
L270189 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I'd have liked to talk to him.
L270188 +++$+++ u1277 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ PSYCHIATRIST +++$+++ Why?
L270187 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ No.  I'd have liked to.
L270186 +++$+++ u1277 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ PSYCHIATRIST +++$+++ I see. Tell me, Harold, do you remember your father at all?
L270185 +++$+++ u1277 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ PSYCHIATRIST +++$+++ Very well.  Now your mother tells me she is arranging several dates for you with some young ladies. How do you feel about that?
L270184 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Yes.
L270183 +++$+++ u1277 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ PSYCHIATRIST +++$+++ We are not relating today, Harold. I sense a definite resistance. A lack of true and helpful communication. I find you a very interesting case, Harold, but this reluctance of yours is detrimental to the psycho-analytical process, and can only hinder the possibility of effective treatment. Do you understand?
L270182 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I burnt down the Chemistry building.
L270181 +++$+++ u1277 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ PSYCHIATRIST +++$+++ Then why did you leave?
L270180 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Yes.

L270177 +++$+++ u1277 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ PSYCHIATRIST +++$+++ Your classmates?

L270173 +++$+++ u1277 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ PSYCHIATRIST +++$+++ I see.  Were you happy at school, Harold?
L270172 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ No.
L270171 +++$+++ u1277 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ PSYCHIATRIST +++$+++ Is this a friend you had when you were away at school?
L270170 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ No.
L270169 +++$+++ u1277 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ PSYCHIATRIST +++$+++ Would you care to talk about this friend?
L270168 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Well, maybe one.
L270167 +++$+++ u1277 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ PSYCHIATRIST +++$+++ None at all?
L270166 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ No.
L270165 +++$+++ u1277 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ PSYCHIATRIST +++$+++ You don't seem to be listening. I asked do you have any friends?
L270164 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Huh?
L270163 +++$+++ u1277 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ PSYCHIATRIST +++$+++ Harold?
L270069 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I go to funerals.
L270068 +++$+++ u1277 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ PSYCHIATRIST +++$+++ That's very interesting, Harold, and I think very illuminative. There seems to be a definite pattern emerging.  Your fondness for useless machines and demolitions seems indicative of your present emotional state, your self-destructive urges and your alienation from the regular social interaction. What do you think? And of course this pattern once isolated can be coped with. Recognize the problem and you are half way on the road to its solution. But tell me, what do you do for <u>fun</u>? What activity gives you a different sense of enjoyment than the others? What do you find fulfilling? What gives you that certain satisfaction?
L270067 +++$+++ u1277 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ PSYCHIATRIST +++$+++ What else do you like?
L270066 +++$+++ u1272 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
