L511713 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ There is no Masbath here.  My father's loan papers are missing.
L511709 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ Yes.  I rode with him on payment days.
L511708 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Did your father take a loan?
L511707 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ Baltus Van Tassel.
L511706 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Often in such cases, property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to. And, who in this town is owed a great many debts?
L511705 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ What does it mean?
L511704 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Intestate.  Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.
L511703 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ In test... what?
L511702 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ No one yet, far as I can tell.  It has gone intestate.
L511701 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?
L511700 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Only the heirs were killed.  Proof that the Horseman slaughters by assignment.
L511697 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ Yes.
L511696 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus.  I heard him say it.
L511695 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ My father had farm land.  It was the only thing we owned of any value.
L511690 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ To discover what might have been taken from those who died, it will help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place.
L511689 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ What good is this?
L511672 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Because, I serve a fine purpose alive. It is perfection for our murderer if I return to New York City with nothing more than tales of a galloping ghoul.  We must uncover the reason these victims were targeted.  What was taken from them... other than their lives? Who benefits by their deaths?
L511671 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ If someone has the Horseman's skull... if they control the Horseman, then why haven't they sent him for your head yet?
L511670 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Business, best hidden is hidden best at night.
L511669 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ All I saw was their lantern.
L511668 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Man or woman?
L511667 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ Someone left last night.  Looked like they headed to the square, but I lost them in the forest.
L511623 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Why this tree?
L511622 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ We should go.
L511621 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Must be some sort of gateway.  But, why this place... ?
L511616 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Stay back.
L511615 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ What is it?
L511602 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply.
L511601 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And why?
L511600 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ True enough.
L511599 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ Well... I'm one of the few people who likes you.
L511598 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ You grow sharper by the minute, little man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others.
L511597 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ If the Crone's wound bled hard, that means she was not killed by the Hessian.  Someone only tried to make it look that way.
L511529 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ "Let loose his silent shrieking." Who knows, till we work at it?  I admit not being anxious to find out.  "He who holds the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand." Whatever the Horseman's desire is, other than extinguishing lives.
L511528 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ What does it mean... climb down to the Horseman's soulless place?
L511527 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ We are far from the Hollow.  Loath to say it... better to get our backs against a tree and stay till morning.
L511526 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ Should we go back?
L511525 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ We should not go much further in this murk.
L511524 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ How could something named "the tree of the dead" fail to draw attention?
L511523 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies.  To the tree of the dead.  Maybe we passed it by.
L511522 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ What happened?
L511521 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ We are leaving.
L511497 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ No crickets or cicadas calling.  No bird songs.
L511496 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ I hear nothing.
L511495 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ Listen.
L511494 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ What is it?
L511474 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Witches do not exist.  However...
L511473 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ Father said witches live there.
L511472 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ If the Western Woods are truly the Devil's Glen, we will see for ourselves.
L511471 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to business.
L511470 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ Thank you.
L511469 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ I have others.  All I need is this.
L511468 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ No, I couldn't...
L511467 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.
L511466 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ It's spectacular.
L511465 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Not for eating, I assure you.  Watch here.
L511464 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ What kind of nuts?
L511463 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Are you familiar with magnets?
L511461 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Look again.
L511460 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ The Western Woods.
L511459 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Out there.  What do you see?
L511458 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ It's payment day.  Loan monies are given to Baltus the last day each month.  Almost everyone borrows... for tools or to hire workers.
L511457 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ What is it?
L511456 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Up.
L511455 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ Where are we going?
L511454 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ His teeth.  Someone had cut them and chipped off rotten pieces far back in his mouth.  The Lenape could not have done that for himself.  Someone out there cared for him.
L511453 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ How could he?
L511452 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ The Lenape Indian had much to tell once I opened his mouth.
L511389 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ We must discover it.  The reason the murderer chose these persons.
L511388 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ I'm sure I don't know.
L511387 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ What is the common thread between these victims?
L511361 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ I did not ask you to, did I?
L511360 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Young Masbath, I am sorry for your loss.  It is a great and sad tragedy. However... I cannot be the one to look after you now.
L511359 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ I deserve to help you.  Don't you see how much this means?  My father... he... he was a good man...
L511358 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ I manage fine alone.
L511357 +++$+++ u7658 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG MASBATH +++$+++ Whatever.  You still need a second to tend to your things.
L511356 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ I am not here for revenge.  I am here to bring justice.
L511921 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ We have no choice.
L511920 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ I... I can't do this.
L511919 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ The blades will carry us to the ground. Face front and wait for me.
L511917 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ No.  Get to the crest of the roof and be ready to jump.
L511916 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ Quickly, close it.
L511913 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Keep climbing.  I will follow...
L511912 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ Ichabod...
L511906 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ His horse.
L511905 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ What was that?
L511904 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ He moves too fast.
L511903 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ The church.
L511887 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ I do not know.  Away.
L511886 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ Where are we going?
L511790 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ Speak the words, Constable.  What is stopping you?  What has happened to your ability to transcend sentimentality?
L511789 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Katrina...
L511788 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ Call me a liar, then, and a murderess. Say it, out and out.
L511787 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ The name Van Tassel is blackened.  You share that name.
L511786 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ If you think I am behind this, say it.
L511785 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ What would you have me believe?
L511784 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.
L511783 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ The loans give the land to your father. It does not matter survivors are still on their farms.  They could be thrown off... tomorrow... a year from now.
L511782 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ I have not been able to face him yet.
L511781 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ What did he say, Katrina?
L511780 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ He did not do these things.  If you knew him, you would realize...
L511779 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ And, what did he say?
L511778 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ When... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, I could not believe it.  I had to hide these... at least till I could confront him myself.
L511777 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ It was you there?
L511776 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ I have been reading your journal. I'm sorry.  I found it too fascinating to resist.  I rode to catch up with you at the Notary, out of curiosity.  Before I found you though, I overheard what you were said.
L511772 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Come with me.
L511771 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ What is so urgent?
L511659 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.
L511658 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ What... what are you doing... ?
L511629 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Yes.  I did notice that, thank you.
L511628 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ The skull is gone.
L511627 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Why is it every grave I open holds a new mystery inside?
L511620 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ He... he tries to take the heads... they will not pass.
L511619 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ My God... what has happened?
L511618 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Just... keep where you are.
L511617 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ What are you doing?
L511614 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ What did you say?
L511613 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Blood.
L511610 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ But, I am not alone, am I?  I only wished to see what you were up to, and...  To thank you.
L511609 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ A woman should not be out alone in these woods.
L511608 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ I apologize if I worried you.
L511607 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Katrina.  Why do you follow?
L511606 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ It is only me.
L511586 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ I... I do not know.  I no longer know what I think or what I feel.
L511585 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?
L511584 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Memories have come back.  I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now.  Lord, how I hate this place.
L511583 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?
L511582 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?
L511581 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ No, but... why do you ask that?
L511580 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ She is not your birth mother, is she?
L511579 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ What?
L511578 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Lady Van Tassel... she is your stepmother, isn't she?  She bears so little resemblance.
L511577 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ What has happened?
L511576 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it.
L511575 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ The things I said to you before... I was wrong to say them.
L511574 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ What troubles you?
L511573 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Allow me some time.  I have spent every hour in the company of others. I need to be alone.
L511493 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ If it had been surgery on a living person, done to save that person's life, you would not question it.  Not for a moment.  So, let me be the first to tell you, dear girl... on the other side of these sheltering mountains, a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours.  And someday, no matter how much you fear it, that world will come to roust Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber.
L511492 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ You falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it.  Can't you see? You'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it.
L511491 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ But, why?  Tell me why.
L511490 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ To avenge his father, and the others.
L511489 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ Take a lesson from Young Masbath's desires, Ichabod Crane.  He follows with you to avenge his father's death. That I understand.  But, what do you want?
L511488 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it.
L511487 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ What is it then?  Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest?
L511486 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ It was not butchery.
L511485 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ And this gives worth to butchery?
L511484 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ There was no blind stabbing.  This singular thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother.
L511483 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ Must I hear this?
L511482 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.
L511481 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ What are you on about?
L511480 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes.
L511479 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.
L511478 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
L511477 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ Why would you do such a thing?
L511442 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ Won't they still have that justice?  Or, was it a vain promise?
L511441 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ They have done nothing of the sort.
L511440 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ People have put their trust in you.
L511439 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ If these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am I?
L511438 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ You promised justice.
L511417 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ That would be a pity.  Those words might show you something you've never seen before.
L511416 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Very well.  But, it will only sit gathering dust.
L511415 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ I insist that you have it.
L511414 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Thank you.  No.  Here...
L511413 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ Then, I also have a gift for you. True magic which even you will not be able to deny.
L511412 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ If you want.  But...
L511411 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ Oh, you are hopeless.  May I keep it at least?
L511410 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ Don't you see why?  Look closely a moment.  Put your intellect aside.  Can't you see what is inexplicable?
L511409 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Yes, but listen.  The illusion is easily explained.  The eye retains each image, till they combine.  And yet, some would call this toy magic.
L511408 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ You made this, and the drawings?
L511407 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ He only appears to be inside the cage.  The point being...
L511406 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ Yes, he does.  May I try?
L511405 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Here it is.  A bird on one side. His cage on the other.  Now, stare at it.  The bird seems to be in his cage.
L511404 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ It would be interesting to find out.
L511403 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ I have had them since childhood.  I cannot remember what from.
L511402 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ These scars.  How did you get them?
L511400 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ I, um... I have something to show you, if you have a moment.
L511399 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ You pay great attention to small things.  I hide these as I hide all my books.  Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible.
L511398 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?
L511397 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ You do not disturb me.  Please stay. Having trouble sleeping?
L511319 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ You are funny.
L511318 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions.
L511317 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ Really?  Then... what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom, or even in a teardrop?
L511316 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ There is no such thing as magic.
L511315 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.
L511314 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Are you so superstitious?
L511313 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ Not all think it is the Horseman. Many say witches come from the Western Woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons.  Some believe a person in this very town kneels before Lucifer, offering death as tribute.  And, still others believe none of it.
L511311 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Extra ordinary, yes.  But first, you tell me about the Headless Horseman.
L511310 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ I've read a great deal about your New York City.  Do be a dear and tell me all about it.  Sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life.
L511309 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Which may explain his temperament. To have asked twice means the answer was "no" at least once.
L511308 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ He has proposed to me twice.
L511307 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ The massive fellow... Brom.  For someone you call "friend," he misplaces a good portion of jealousy.
L511306 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ My suitor?
L511305 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat.
L511304 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ Is it me, or are you this nervous around all women?
L511303 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ It might have been more.  Might have been positively grand talk.
L511302 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Small talk.
L511301 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ Other people?
L511300 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Excuse me... I should apologize.  I, um... I... have no great love of...
L511299 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse.  I'll leave you to your business.
L511298 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Feel free to form your own opinion.  Though it appears you already have.
