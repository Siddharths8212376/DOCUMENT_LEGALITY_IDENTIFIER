Mama, listen, I'm gonna sing this like I will if I go on the stage. You know, with this show. I'm gonna sing it jazzy. Now get this ...
L325690 +++$+++ u6119 +++$+++ m406 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Oh, no. I wouldn't go ...
L325689 +++$+++ u6118 +++$+++ m406 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yes, I'm gonna ride on the Shoot-the-Chutes. An' you know in the Dark Mill? Ever been in the Dark Mill?
L325688 +++$+++ u6119 +++$+++ m406 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Yeah?
L325687 +++$+++ u6118 +++$+++ m406 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What? Whatta you mean, no? Who is -- who is telling you? Whatta you mean, no? Yes, you'll wear pink or else. Or else you'll wear pink.  And, darlin', oh, I'm gonna take you to Coney Island.
L325686 +++$+++ u6119 +++$+++ m406 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ No, Jakie, no. I-I-I-
L325685 +++$+++ u6118 +++$+++ m406 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yes, she will. You see if she isn't. And I'm gonna get you a nice pink dress that'll go with your brown eyes.

L325683 +++$+++ u6118 +++$+++ m406 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You'll never guess. Shut your eyes, Mama. Shut 'em for little Jakie. Ha. I'm gonna steal something.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. I'll give it back to you some day, too, you see if I don't. Mama, darlin', if I'm a success in this show, well, we're gonna move from here. Oh yes, we're gonna move up in the Bronx. A lot of nice green grass up there and a whole lot of people you know. There's the Ginsbergs, the Guttenbergs, and the Goldbergs. Oh, a whole lotta Bergs; I don't know 'em all. And I'm gonna buy you a nice black silk dress, Mama. You see Mrs. Friedman, the butcher's wife, she'll be jealous of you.
L325682 +++$+++ u6119 +++$+++ m406 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ What?
L325681 +++$+++ u6118 +++$+++ m406 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'm glad of it. I'd rather please you than anybody I know of. Oh, darlin', will you give me something?
L325680 +++$+++ u6119 +++$+++ m406 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Yes.
L325679 +++$+++ u6118 +++$+++ m406 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Did you like that, Mama?
L326446 +++$+++ u6120 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ We only got one .. He doesn't drive.
L326445 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ How about any guys on your staff?
L326444 +++$+++ u6120 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Only me and Mom ..
L326443 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I'm sorry to worry you with this, but we had a real serious robbery, and we- 're chasing a white V.W. van? You guy came up an the computer, so as a matt- er of routine we have to check. Could you tell me who's driven it recently?
L326442 +++$+++ u6120 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ No, my mother's .. You better stop in .. I'm just here to feed the cat.
L326441 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Is it your vehicle?
L326440 +++$+++ u6120 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ The van?
L326439 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I'm afraid it's the "van" again.
L326438 +++$+++ u6120 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ As I said, Sergeant, you nearly ran into <u>me</u>? What's the problem?
L326274 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ That's a liability, Ross. I don't want you hanging on to my shirt. Anyone but me comes down these stairs, take em out but try and keep him alive. I want this bastard living ..
L326273 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ You ain't going in alone?
L326272 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Alright. I'll start at the top, and work down.
L326271 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ We're not <u>here</u>. I don't want the desk to hear us ..
L326270 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ What if we need a back up?
L326269 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ <u>Hit those wipers, Ross</u>.
L326268 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Policemen's bodies age at diff- erent rates. Look at me. Gut in its fifties. Balls in their six- ties. And feet in their eighties ..
L326267 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ What d'you mean, "bits."
L326266 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Bits.
L326265 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Bull shit .. I'm in my prime ..
L326264 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ It's twenty of three.
L326263 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I guess by the bed.
L326262 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Where's your watch?
L326261 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Hey ..
L326260 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Listen, you don't havta come?
L326258 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ This "cop" that's calling, thinks she gonna be there over Christmas.
L326257 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Now?
L326256 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I'm going up to the institute.
L326255 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ What exactly you doing, John?
L326253 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ I spose I'm drinking myself to sleep. It's Helena's Christmas songs .. they're really pretty ..
L326252 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Jesus. What are you doin?
L326235 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ That's just what I wanna find out.
L326234 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Hey, John, don't start getting antsy over this tonight. It may well have been the local cops?
L326233 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ You got a quiet phone somewhere?
L326228 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Are you sure you didn't call?
L326227 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Yeah .. I guess she's in the kit- chen .. We got a so-called prof- essional cook out there having a nervous breakdown over a turkey ..
L326209 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Don't thank me. Thank Margie.
L326208 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Can't thank you enough, Ross ..
L326198 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Screw Citrine. He can fire me.
L326197 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ What about Citrine?
L326196 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I dunno what I'd do with your help. I've gotta take her out of there ..
L326195 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ I dunno what I can do to help you?
L326194 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Don't give me that! <u>Not another</u> <u>word</u>! When you had the Fat Lady in there, and I asked you if she was lying, you looked me right in the eyes and said <u>yes</u>. So as far as I was concerned, <u>she's ly-</u> <u>ing</u>. And if the King of fucking England had walked in & told me different, I wouldn't have bel- ieved him - because <u>you</u> told me ..
L326193 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Everything you say sounds reason- able. But there's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite.
L326192 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ <u>I'm sick of this toy town shit</u>.
L326191 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Ease off, John ..
L326190 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ How the hell do I know <u>who</u>? Some jerk-off. Some peeping-tom prick.
L326189 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ I'm asking it.
L326188 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ That's a very stupid question, Ross.
L326186 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ No .. You didn't know that ..
L326185 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Well .. I didn't know that ..
L326184 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ <u>One hundred fucking per cent</u>! .. And you know why? Coz I never told her good-bye. O.K.? Is that good enough for the "committee?"
L326183 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ You don't really believe this?
L326182 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion.
L326181 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ I'm not in here to apologize, John. I told you what was gonna happen & it's happened? "Good-bye, Princess," & the same night she gets attacked? That's a tough one to swallow, Bro?
L326180 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Nothing you gotta say do I wanna hear right now. So save yourself saying it.
L326141 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Alright, enough, Ross. You'll bring on my "Nervous Tick" ...
L326140 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ You don't need me to tell you what hap- pens when you get emotionally involved?
L326139 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Sure.
L326138 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Alright, she wasn't lying about the van. But it could have been <u>any</u> van? Any little foreign diesel? .. She's <u>blind</u>, Bro .. It's sad .. She's pro- bably lonely, and you're a nice guy to have around .. But you're getting far too far into the element, Brother ..
L326137 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ She wasn't lying about the van.
L326136 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ You're a fucking great policeman, but give yourself a break. You're here 5 minutes, you find yourself a fucking homicide? .. Not many people could do that in a place like this .. And you gotta admit, there's a lot of shaky areas in this case? .. I mean, stop me if I'm going up the wrong nostril ..
L326135 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Just makes to so God damned mad ..
L326134 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ You gotta stop calling Los Angeles .. You're dragging L.A. around with you like an addiction.  Look at the shit you're putting yourself through? For what? For <u>nothing</u>, I know it, I been there. Remember me? Up to my asshole in anger, living off the vitamins in cigarettes?  If there's a body under the snow, <u>fuck</u> <u>it</u>. Let somebody else worry about it. You gotta accept you stopped living in that world, & try and give yourself a break in this ..
L326133 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ John, <u>stop</u> <u>it</u>. The case is on its ass, you're closed.  C'mon, let it go for once .. Have a drink. C'mon, relax, drink your beer ..
L326132 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I never knew about the sailor the- ory, Ross. He might have that one little thing I need in his files?
L326131 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Stop it.
L326120 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ No God, Brother. If there was a God, asses wouldn't be at the perfect height for kicking.
L326119 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ God, it pisses me off, Ross.
L326086 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Car accident.
L326085 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Why's she blind, Bro?
L326054 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ He didn't shoot it, Ross. And no way by accident. There's a flash-burn. It was point-blank.
L326053 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ No, I think you'll find I looked like he could have? By accident even? He's up here spraying the scenery all day.
L326052 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ You looked like you did?
L326051 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Did I say he did?
L326050 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I wish he'd tell that to Citrine.
L326049 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ I dunno, I daren't go in there - just about get her wired up, and the fucking mayor walks in - mad as hell - what are we doing fuck- ing with his staff? We should be out chasing major violators ..
L326048 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ All but .. How <u>you</u> doing?
L326047 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Did he shut you down?
L325988 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ What does it matter what I bel- ieve? .. What you gotta worry about is what Citrine believes ..
L325987 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ You believe me, don't you?
L325985 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I was wrong.
L325984 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ That isn't what you said before.
L325983 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ We've fused into a major series, Ross. This girl isn't the second victim. This is "Jennifer <u>Eight</u>."
L325982 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ For a <u>dead</u> <u>dog</u>?
L325981 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I wanna take that fucking Blind In- stitute to pieces .. Every address book, every phone call, everyone in and outta there in the last 5 years ..
L325980 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Listen to me saying what?
L325979 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ That's what I'm here for. I want you to come and see Citrine with me?  He's not gonna here it from me but I know he'd listen to you.
L325978 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Identity of whom? You got a girl, doesn't even have a driver's lic- ense? .. She's untraceable, John .. You need fifty detectives on this.
L325977 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ They possibly did - but they nev- er had a head, so they never had a bullet - and they never got an I.D. - not on any of em - never bust a homicide unless you know who your victim is - we're the first to get a positive identity.
L325976 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ How come the F.B.I. don't put anya this together? They work- ed over "Jennifer" for months?
L325975 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Six girls over a period of 18 months, and give or take a head or two, the M.O.'s exactly the same. Dark hair. No hands. All shot with a high velocity twen- ty-two in the back of the head.
L325969 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ You want me to stop the car?
L325968 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I remember the old bastard's liver! I don't believe you did that. I had a great sent- imental attachment to that.
L325967 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ It's not your friend. It keeps you sucking. Remem- ber the old Bum's lungs?
L325966 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ What are you doing, Ross? I've had that 15 years! ..
L325965 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ To throw out of the window.
L325964 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ What do you want it for?
L325963 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ I don't want excuses, I want that weird-looking stuff called "cash."
L325962 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I had one <u>puff</u> on a <u>pipe</u>.
L325961 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ I need some security. I don't trust you anymore.
L325960 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Why?
L325959 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Then give me that Zippo.
L325958 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ I haven't got it.
L325957 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Pay me, and I shut up.
L325956 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Don't start again. If you win a bet, you can't keep winning it ..
L325955 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ So am I. But where's my money?
L325954 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Maybe not? I'm feeling lucky ..
L325953 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Forget it. They got stringent hyg- iene rules. He's long gone in lime.
L325952 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ We're going.
L325951 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ No way .. not me, Mister. I'm not going up there again. Might find someone's prick in a hot-dog roll.
L325950 +++$+++ u6121 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ BERLIN +++$+++ Alright, I didn't, but I nearly did, and if I had I'd have been right .. I knew there was some- thing about that Labrador, that dog was too good to be dead .. We gotta get back up that dump ..
L325949 +++$+++ u6127 +++$+++ m407 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ No, you didn't.
