L471518 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ From this box here...
L471517 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?
L471516 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Only time will tell.
L471515 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back.  Think you'll keep it?
L471514 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ By the way, Roger, you were right about your wife.  She's a good lady.  I'm glad you got her back.
L471512 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ I guess I am at that.  Cigar?
L471511 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ No, kid, you're a real hero.
L471508 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ Hey, it's the will.  I, Marvin Acme, of sound mind and body, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the property known as Toontown to those loveable characters...
L471507 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Keep reading...
L471505 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ Good idea.
L471504 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ I think you oughta read it to her.
L471503 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ Yeah?
L471502 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Say Roger, remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint Club?
L471498 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Yeah...
L471497 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ That's because it's Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.  Shows up three days later.  Gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn't punch you in the nose.  Great gag.
L471496 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ That's not blood.  That's ink.  That goof Acme squirted me with some the other day.  Why it's comin' 'through now, I don't know.
L471456 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage.
L471455 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Real good, Rog... but maybe you better let me take over.
L471369 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ I followed you to the Maroon Studios. When I heard those shots, I thought I'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk.
L471368 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ What the hell are you doin' in there?
L471335 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ ... I'd head for Cucamonga.
L471334 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ Yeah?
L471333 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ If I don't make it back here by ten...
L471332 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ I rest my case.
L471331 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ Two bits.
L471330 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
L471329 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think.
L471328 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Forget it.
L471327 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.
L471326 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ That's why I'll be there at 8:45.
L471325 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ Gee, Eddie, you're not gonna go, are ya?  Maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine o'clock.
L471311 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ No, it's not.
L471310 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ Wrong number?
L471309 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Get away from there.
L471308 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ I'll get it.
L471307 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Piano.  Guy got away, disappeared into Toontown.  Nobody ever saw him again.
L471306 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ Safe?
L471305 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown, we took his case.  But when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all.  We went to his house to take him in.  But he was wise. He got the drop on us... literally.
L471304 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.
L471303 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Yeah, a Toon.  It was the guy who killed Bambi's mother.
L471302 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ A Toon?  Noooo.
L471301 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother.
L471300 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?
L471299 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked you for the patsy.  Always gotta play the fool.  You make me sick!
L471296 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ What is this, Twenty Questions?
L471295 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?
L471294 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Me.
L471293 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ Say, who's this guy laughin'?
L471291 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ We can't do anything till it's dark.
L471290 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ So what's our plan, our scenario, our modus operandi?
L471289 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ My brother.  Get inside.
L471288 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other Valiant?
L471264 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin' from the law with a Toon?
L471263 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'. Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the noodle, the grey matter...
L471261 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Drink it, jerk.  All of it.
L471260 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
L471259 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me.
L471256 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ I think you want a drink.  How about it, Judge?
L471255 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.
L471254 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?
L471225 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Well, right now it's gonna be your funereal.
L471224 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time.  But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!
L471223 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety.
L471222 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.
L471221 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Just because you got 'em to laugh?
L471220 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
L471219 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He just got outta prison.
L471218 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...
L471217 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
L471216 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
L471215 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.
L471214 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ Hey, don't I get an encore?
L471081 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Because he's not forty feet tall.  The safe was up on the ceiling, remember?
L471080 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective, your logic is specious.  What prevented Mr. Acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him?
L471077 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Well, Acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club.  It was gone in the morning when the cops found the body.
L471076 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ How do you know that?
L471075 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Yeah.  Except they screwed up.  I don't think they got the will.
L471074 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ The habeus corpus is thickening.
L471071 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Your wife may be a lot of things, pal, but innocent isn't one of them.
L471070 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ I resent that innuendo!  My wife is completely innocent.
L471069 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Yeah.  I think Maroon plays the part of the sound mind, your wife the sound body.
L471064 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Yeah... well you just might get your wish.
L471063 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.
L471062 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder?
L471061 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ Well, no, not <u>any</u> time.  Only when it was funny.
L471060 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ You mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?
L471059 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Yeah, that's better.
L471058 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ Does this help?
L471039 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Don't ever forget that.
L471038 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a Toon.
L471037 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Hey!  What do you think you're doin'?
L471034 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ You idiot.  I lost the key for those cuffs.
L471033 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest! Just kidding...
L471019 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always run.
L471018 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ If you're so innocent, why'd you run?
L471017 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran.
L471016 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Look, pal, if you're still here when I finish this drink, I'm callin' the police.
L471008 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ In other words, the whole goddamn world knows you're here!  Out!  Get out!
L471007 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.
L471006 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
L471005 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.
L471004 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ So I hear.  Even talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.
L471003 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.
L471002 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ What the hell are you doin'?
L471001 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ Aah!
L471000 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Aah!
L470897 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ Divorce?  Never!
L470896 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ My advice?  Hop on over to Reno, get yourself a quickie divorce.
L470882 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Baker's man... but no use ruinin' a good pair of shoes over it.
L470881 +++$+++ u7294 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ ROGER RABBIT +++$+++ Pattycake!  Pattycake!
L472155 +++$+++ u7308 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ SAMPSON +++$+++ Uh? Uh?
L472154 +++$+++ u7296 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ ABRAHAM +++$+++ No better?
L472153 +++$+++ u7308 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ SAMPSON +++$+++ If you do, sir, I am for you.  I serve as good a man as you.
L472152 +++$+++ u7296 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ ABRAHAM +++$+++ Quarrel sir! no, sir.
L472148 +++$+++ u7308 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ SAMPSON +++$+++ [Aside to GREGORY] Is the law on our side, if I say ay?
L472147 +++$+++ u7296 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ ABRAHAM +++$+++ Do you bite your thumb at us? Sir.
L472146 +++$+++ u7308 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ SAMPSON +++$+++ I do bite my thumb, sir!
L472145 +++$+++ u7296 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ ABRAHAM +++$+++ Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
L472144 +++$+++ u7308 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ SAMPSON +++$+++ I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
L472143 +++$+++ u7296 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ ABRAHAM +++$+++ Boo! Ah, ha ha. Ooh. Boo! Ha ha ha.
L472547 +++$+++ u7307 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ ROMEO +++$+++ Tempt not a desperate man!
L472546 +++$+++ u7297 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ BALTHASAR +++$+++ Then I'll leave thee.
L472545 +++$+++ u7307 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ ROMEO +++$+++ Live and be prosperous; and farewell good fellow.
L472533 +++$+++ u7307 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ ROMEO +++$+++ Tush, thou art deceived. Hast thou no letters to me from the priest? [Balthsasr shakes his head no.] No matter. Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight. I will hence tonight.
L472532 +++$+++ u7297 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ BALTHASAR +++$+++ Your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure.
L472531 +++$+++ u7307 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ ROMEO +++$+++ Leave Me!
L472530 +++$+++ u7297 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ BALTHASAR +++$+++ Have patience!
L472529 +++$+++ u7307 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ ROMEO +++$+++ Then I defy you, stars! JULIET! JULIET! I will hence tonight.
L472528 +++$+++ u7297 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ BALTHASAR +++$+++ If she is well then nothing can be ill. Her body rests in Capel's monument, and her immortal part with the angel's lives. I saw her laid low. Pardon me for bringing these ill news.
L472409 +++$+++ u7305 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ MERCUTIO +++$+++ Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze. I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
L472408 +++$+++ u7298 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ BENVOLIO +++$+++ Either withdraw unto some private place, or reason coldly of your grievences, or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.
L472401 +++$+++ u7305 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ MERCUTIO +++$+++ By my heel, I care not.
L472400 +++$+++ u7298 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ BENVOLIO +++$+++ By my head here come the Capulets.
L472399 +++$+++ u7305 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ MERCUTIO +++$+++ Thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Verona.
L472398 +++$+++ u7298 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ BENVOLIO +++$+++ Am I like Such a fellow?
L472397 +++$+++ u7305 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ MERCUTIO +++$+++ Keep away the cats! Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says, &quot;God send me no need of thee.&quot; and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
L472356 +++$+++ u7298 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ BENVOLIO +++$+++ The what?
L472355 +++$+++ u7305 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ MERCUTIO +++$+++ More than prince of cats. He is the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing prick- song, keeps time, distance, and proportion; he rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause: the immortal passado! punto reverso! the hai!
L472354 +++$+++ u7298 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ BENVOLIO +++$+++ Why, what is Tybalt?
L472353 +++$+++ u7305 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ MERCUTIO +++$+++ But alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
L472352 +++$+++ u7298 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ BENVOLIO +++$+++ Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.
L472351 +++$+++ u7305 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ MERCUTIO +++$+++ Any man that can write may answer a letter.
L472350 +++$+++ u7298 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ BENVOLIO +++$+++ Romeo will answer it?
L472349 +++$+++ u7305 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ MERCUTIO +++$+++ A challenge, on my life.
L472348 +++$+++ u7298 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ BENVOLIO +++$+++ Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet, Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
L472347 +++$+++ u7305 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ MERCUTIO +++$+++ Why that pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline. Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
L472346 +++$+++ u7298 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ BENVOLIO +++$+++ Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
L472345 +++$+++ u7305 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ MERCUTIO +++$+++ Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home to-night?
L472285 +++$+++ u7305 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ MERCUTIO +++$+++ Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes, By her high forehead and her scarlet lip, By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh! O, Romeo that she were An open ass, and thou a poperin pear! Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed; This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
L472284 +++$+++ u7298 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ BENVOLIO +++$+++ Romeo! Romeo!
L472420 +++$+++ u7298 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ BENVOLIO +++$+++ Art thou hurt?
L472419 +++$+++ u7307 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ ROMEO +++$+++ Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio.
L472250 +++$+++ u7307 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ ROMEO +++$+++ I fear, too early: for my mind misgives Some consequence yet hanging in the stars Shall bitterly begin his fearful date With this night's revels and expire the term Of a despised life closed within my breast By some vile forfeit of untimely death. But He, that hath the steerage of my course, Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.
L472249 +++$+++ u7298 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ BENVOLIO +++$+++ This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves; Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
L472239 +++$+++ u7307 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ ROMEO +++$+++ But 'tis no wit to go.
L472238 +++$+++ u7298 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ BENVOLIO +++$+++ Every man betake him to his legs.
L472209 +++$+++ u7307 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ ROMEO +++$+++ Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is; Shut up in prison, kept without my food, Whipp'd and tormented. Good day, good fellow.
L472208 +++$+++ u7298 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ BENVOLIO +++$+++ By giving liberty unto thine eyes; Examine other beauties. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
L472207 +++$+++ u7307 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ ROMEO +++$+++ Teach me how I should forget to think.
L472206 +++$+++ u7298 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ BENVOLIO +++$+++ Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
L472205 +++$+++ u7307 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ ROMEO +++$+++ She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
L472204 +++$+++ u7298 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ BENVOLIO +++$+++ Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
L472203 +++$+++ u7307 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ ROMEO +++$+++ Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit With Cupid's arrow; Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes, Nor open her lap to saint-seducing gold:
L472202 +++$+++ u7298 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ BENVOLIO +++$+++ A right fair mark, fair cuz, is soonest hit.
L472201 +++$+++ u7307 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ ROMEO +++$+++ A right good marks-man! And she's fair I love.
L472200 +++$+++ u7298 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ BENVOLIO +++$+++ I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
L472199 +++$+++ u7307 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ ROMEO +++$+++ In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
L472198 +++$+++ u7298 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ BENVOLIO +++$+++ Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
L472192 +++$+++ u7298 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ BENVOLIO +++$+++ Soft! I will go along; An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
L472191 +++$+++ u7307 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ ROMEO +++$+++ Farewell, my cuz.
L472190 +++$+++ u7298 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ BENVOLIO +++$+++ At thy good heart's oppression.
L472189 +++$+++ u7307 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ ROMEO +++$+++ Good heart, at what?
L472188 +++$+++ u7298 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ BENVOLIO +++$+++ No, cuz, I rather weep.
L472187 +++$+++ u7307 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ ROMEO +++$+++ Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still, Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will! Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here? Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. Here's much to do with hate, but more with love. Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate! O any thing, of nothing first create! O heavy lightness! Serious vanity! Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms! Feather of lead-- [Benvolio Snickers] Dost thou not laugh?
L472186 +++$+++ u7298 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ BENVOLIO +++$+++ Alas, that love, so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
L472185 +++$+++ u7307 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ ROMEO +++$+++ Out of her favour, where I am in love.
L472184 +++$+++ u7298 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ BENVOLIO +++$+++ Of love?
L472183 +++$+++ u7307 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ ROMEO +++$+++ Out--
L472182 +++$+++ u7298 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ BENVOLIO +++$+++ In love?
L472181 +++$+++ u7307 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ ROMEO +++$+++ Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
L472180 +++$+++ u7298 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ BENVOLIO +++$+++ It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
L472179 +++$+++ u7307 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ ROMEO +++$+++ Ay me! Sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?
L472178 +++$+++ u7298 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ BENVOLIO +++$+++ But new struck cuz.
L472177 +++$+++ u7307 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ ROMEO +++$+++ Is the day so young?
L472176 +++$+++ u7298 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ BENVOLIO +++$+++ Good-morrow, cousin.
L472175 +++$+++ u7307 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ ROMEO +++$+++ Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate, O anything of nothing first create. heavy lightness. Serious vanity. Misshapen chaos of well seeming forms.

L472264 +++$+++ u7309 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ TYBALT +++$+++ Uncle, 'tis a shame.
L472263 +++$+++ u7299 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ CAPULET +++$+++ He shall be endured
L472262 +++$+++ u7309 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ TYBALT +++$+++ I'll not endure him.
L472261 +++$+++ u7299 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ CAPULET +++$+++ Content thee, gentle cuz, content thee. Let him alone; I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement: Therefore be patient, take no note of him
L472260 +++$+++ u7309 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ TYBALT +++$+++ 'Tis he.
L472259 +++$+++ u7299 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ CAPULET +++$+++ Young Romeo is it?
L472258 +++$+++ u7309 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ TYBALT +++$+++ Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.
L472257 +++$+++ u7299 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ CAPULET +++$+++ Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
L472256 +++$+++ u7309 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ TYBALT +++$+++ What dares the slave Come hither, To fleer and scorn at our solemnity? Now, by the stock and honour of my kin, To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.
L472541 +++$+++ u7307 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ ROMEO +++$+++ Here is my gold. Worse poison to men's souls, than these poor compounds that thou mayest not sell.
L472540 +++$+++ u7300 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ CRUSTY +++$+++ Drink it off and, if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight.
L472539 +++$+++ u7307 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ ROMEO +++$+++ I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
L472538 +++$+++ u7300 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ CRUSTY +++$+++ My poverty, but not my will consents.
