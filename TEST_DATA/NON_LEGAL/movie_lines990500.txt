L644770 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I don't think you're being fair, sir. You assigned me this guy, and you know he's got a history...
L644769 +++$+++ u8838 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ LYNCH +++$+++ Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales.
L644768 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying!
L644767 +++$+++ u8838 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ LYNCH +++$+++ If I'm closing out this account. If he doesn't pay for it tomorrow, you pay for it.
L644766 +++$+++ u8838 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ LYNCH +++$+++ Okay, sir. I'll discuss this with the broker and I'll get back to you. You're welcome.

L645474 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I want to make it up to you. Bluestar, put all your clients in it.
L645473 +++$+++ u8840 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MARV +++$+++ I agree. Go thou and sin no more.
L645355 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Get the hell out!
L645354 +++$+++ u8840 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MARV +++$+++ You know what you need, buddy buddy--an optorectomy. That's when they cut the nerve that runs from your brain to your rectum--to change that shitty attitude of yours.
L645353 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Then get out and close it behind you.
L645352 +++$+++ u8840 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MARV +++$+++ Hey the door was open.
L645351 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Didn't I tell you to knock before you came in here?
L645350 +++$+++ u8840 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MARV +++$+++ Hey you hear the news. I just got a job at a new firm: "Dewey, Cheat 'em and Howe." Yuk yuk.
L645216 +++$+++ u8840 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MARV +++$+++ Lynch is giving him the boot... He's not pulling his quota.
L645215 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What's going on?
L645024 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Anacott Steel. Buy it.
L645023 +++$+++ u8840 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MARV +++$+++ What the hell...
L644923 +++$+++ u8840 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MARV +++$+++ That's right, next time a little birdie talks to you, talk to me too E.F. Hutton.
L644922 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ All right, I owe you one Marv.
L644921 +++$+++ u8840 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MARV +++$+++ Gimme a break. You buy Bluestar Airlines yesterday. Today they just happen to get good news and the stock goes bat shit. You must have ESP. A real Nostradamus.  Jesus Christ, what are friends for?
L644920 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Hey Marv, he demanded confidentiality...
L644919 +++$+++ u8840 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MARV +++$+++ Buddy, buddy, some buddy; why didn't you tell me to buy Bluestar.
L644896 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Marv,  ...I just bagged the elephant!
L644895 +++$+++ u8840 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MARV +++$+++ Got a little action there, eh buddy?
L644890 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Cindy. Having sex with her is like reading the Wall Street Journal 'cept the Journal don't talk back. 'Sides this AIDS crap is ruining romance, nobody trusts anybody anymore, gotta get a blood test in the toilet before you leave a bar together, somebody oughtta invent an AIDS dipstick, no kidding, make a fortune. I gotta get to work... Z's today. 
L644889 +++$+++ u8840 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MARV +++$+++ Nice guy but a loser. Lost all his equity when his firm went belly up in the recession of 71. you wanna be coming in here in your late sixties still pitching? ... Whatever happened to that cute analyst at Thudder, Wicks? ... Cindy? Susan?
L644887 +++$+++ u8840 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MARV +++$+++ Forget charts! We're not fund managers, Bud, churn 'em and burn 'em. I'm offering you the Knicks and chicks. God save you before you turn into poor Steeples over there.
L644886 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ ...gotta read my reports.
L644885 +++$+++ u8840 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MARV +++$+++ ...got tickets for the Knicks tonight. Go out and cruise some bimbos afterwards, whaddaya say?
L644881 +++$+++ u8840 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MARV +++$+++ Cheer up buddy buddy. You shook Gekko the Great's hand and you still got all your fingers. He's not the only elephant in the jungle.
L644880 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yeah, but he didn't see me.
L644879 +++$+++ u8840 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MARV +++$+++ ...well, see him?
L644780 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Of course he's busy, and so am I. Five minutes. That's all I'm asking. I know that if he could only hear what I have to say... it would change his life.
L644779 +++$+++ u8840 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MARV +++$+++ It concerns his future!
L644778 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Hello, Natalie -- guess who? That's right, and you know everyday I say to myself, today could be the day... So what do you say... will you marry me? Then please can you get me through to Mr. Gekko?
L644777 +++$+++ u8840 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MARV +++$+++ Buddy, buddy, when ya gonna realize it's big game hunters that bag the elephants, not retail brokers. I heard this story about Gekko... he was on the phone 30 seconds after the Challenger blew up selling NASA stocks short.
L644776 +++$+++ u8840 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MARV +++$+++ Just put me on the institutional side of the room where the real cheesecake is. You forgetting something?
L644775 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Thanks Marv, I'll make it good to you.  You know what my dream is? One day to be on the other end of that phone...
L644774 +++$+++ u8840 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MARV +++$+++ Hey, things could be worse. It could've been my money. Let me help you out, rookie.
L644773 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Howard the Jerk reneged on me. I've got to cover his loss to the tune of about seven grand! I'm tapped out man, American Express got a hit man looking for me.
L644772 +++$+++ u8840 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MARV +++$+++ Buddy, buddy, buddy; little trouble, huh, today.
L644750 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Thanks, Marv, with that I might be able to qualify for welfare.
L644749 +++$+++ u8840 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MARV +++$+++ Looks bearish to me, buddy. You got it all upside down.  Okay, I'm giving this to you and you alone, 'cause I feel sorry for you. Take the Knicks against the Bullets, and my pick of the day -- Duke to beat the spread against Wake Forest.
L644748 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Joke about it. I was up all night charting these stocks. You want to see this or what?
L644747 +++$+++ u8840 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ MARV +++$+++ Yeah, where's your machine gun.
L644746 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I gotta feeling we're going to make a killing today, Marv.
L645549 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Maybe that's the price, Bud, maybe so. It's gonna be rough on you but maybe in some screwed up way, that's the best thing that can happen to you...stop trading for the quick buck and go produce something with your life, create, don't live off the buying and selling of others...
L645548 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Dad, I'm going to jail and you know it.
L645544 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yeah, don't want to be late for my own funeral.
L645543 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ I guess it's time to hit the road.
L645542 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ No, thanks, I'm nervous enough.
L645541 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Another cup of coffee?
L645435 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ You speak for me, son.
L645434 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Your words, not mine...
L645332 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Your men! All my life "your men" have been able to count on you? Why is it that you've never been there for me?
L645331 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ I'll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning, wanting to know what's going on, I'm going to lie to them!
L645330 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Your responsibility, Dad, is to present the facts, not your opinions, to the men... you're gonna destroy their lives, Dad! Don't do it to 'em. Give it a chance. Let the membership decide for themselves, Dad. Please.
L645329 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ ...as far as being axed, I'm still here and as long as I am, I have a responsibility not just to me but to the union members I represent...
L645328 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Boy, if that's what you think, I must've really screwed up my job as a father.
L645327 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ That's because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim.
L645326 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ What you see, son, is a man who never measured success by the size of a man's wallet.
L645325 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ No, what I see is a jealous old machinist who can't stand that his son's become more successful than himself.
L645324 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ He's got your prick in his back pocket, son, and you're standing naked in the display window of Macy's. He's using you. Only you're too blind to see it.
L645290 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ I met them before you were born.
L645289 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Dad, you know Duncan Wilmore, pilot's union, and Toni Carpenter, flight attendants...
L645021 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ ...gotta run Dad. You stop smoking, you hear?
L645020 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Yeah, you do that huckleberry. I'll still be here.
L645019 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Wait... next week's booked. Let me check with my girl and get back to you on Monday.
L645018 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Whatever night you like.
L645017 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ ... Dad, you should've been a CEO. How about dinner?
L645016 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Problem with money is you never have enough or you got too much -- and when you got it you're never happy 'cause somebody's always trying to take it away from you. Money's one giant pain in the ass y'ask me... thanks.
L645014 +++$+++ u8831 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ What do I need a fancy suit for. I don't hobnob with the jet set. I just fix their planes.
L645013 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Don't worry about the loans. I'm doing good Dad and it's gonna stay that way now... least buy yourself a new suit.

The only good news is, we just met with the comptroller over some union stuff...'member that crash last summer? and the investigation? Well, the FAA is gonna rule it was a manufacturing flaw in the door latch mechanism. I kept telling 'em it wasn't maintenance, it was those goddamn greedy manufacturers out in Cincinnati.

L644799 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Look Dad, I'm not a salesman. How many times I gotta tell you I'm an account executive, and pretty soon I'm going to the investment banking side of the firm.
