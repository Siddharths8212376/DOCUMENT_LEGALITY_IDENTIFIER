L368694 +++$+++ u6480 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ A cat. We found a litter box downstairs but not the cat.  Neighbors are watching for it.
L368659 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Mrs. Leeds' fingernails and toenails. I think he took off his gloves, Jack.  And dust all the corneas of all their eyes.
L368658 +++$+++ u6480 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ What do you want to do?
L368657 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
L368656 +++$+++ u6480 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ You said the guy down here is good.
L368655 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Get him to Atlanta.
L368654 +++$+++ u6480 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ He's working on the single print index. What time is it?
L368653 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Jack, this is Graham. Is Price still in Latent Prints?
L368605 +++$+++ u6480 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ I'LL come back later. I got messages at the Holiday Inn to collect.
L368604 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Let's talk after dinner. Stay and eat.
L368603 +++$+++ u6480 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ These are all dead, Will.
L368602 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ As long as they're dead...
L368601 +++$+++ u6480 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ If you can't look anymore, I understand...
L368600 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I am all right.
L368599 +++$+++ u6480 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ You look all right now.
L368598 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think.  I came down here to get away from all that.
L368597 +++$+++ u6480 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ That's not entirely true, Will. It's the way you think.
L368596 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ That was three years ago. And by doing the same things you and the rest of them at the lab are doing.
L368595 +++$+++ u6480 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ Last two like this we had, you caught.
L368594 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack.
L368593 +++$+++ u6480 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors.
L368592 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago...
L368591 +++$+++ u6480 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ Why not?
L368590 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ No.
L368589 +++$+++ u6480 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ Will... you saw this in the papers. The second one was all over TV. Did you ever think about givin' me a call?
L368588 +++$+++ u6480 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ Typed him from semen. He's a secretor.
L368587 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Somebody hurt him?
L368586 +++$+++ u6480 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ Blond, right-handed, really strong, wears a size eleven shoe. The prints are all smooth gloves. He's on a full moon cycle. Both times. His blood is AB Positive.
L368585 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ What else did you keep out of the papers?
L368584 +++$+++ u6480 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces.  None of them knew that;
L368583 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.'  Confessions?
L368582 +++$+++ u6480 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ How much do you know?
L368581 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I don't want to talk about it anywhere.  If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon.
L368580 +++$+++ u6480 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ I should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work. You don't want to talk about it here...
L369009 +++$+++ u6494 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ They got shot a Telex. They're on if now...
L369008 +++$+++ u6480 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ ...twenty-eight minutes.  Cryptography at Langley?
L368991 +++$+++ u6480 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ Let's get to the physical.
L368990 +++$+++ u6494 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Not yet.
L368897 +++$+++ u6480 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ For Christ's sake get him!
L368896 +++$+++ u6494 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ He went to the men's room.
L368895 +++$+++ u6480 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ Where the hell's Graham!
L368886 +++$+++ u6480 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ Will. Get right back here. He just called.
L368885 +++$+++ u6494 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ He asked for Will. He said he might call back tonight. I tried to hold him... I'm sorry... He said 'tell Graham "broken mirrors."'
L368884 +++$+++ u6480 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ ...but if we find him, the print as evidence will get a conviction, Hold on. What?
L369451 +++$+++ u6481 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ DOLLARHYDE +++$+++ Francis did a thing for you today so I couldn't have you. And he was wrong.  I AM THE DRAGON!  Give me your hand.
L369450 +++$+++ u6492 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ REBA +++$+++ It's Dragon. Dragon... Red Dragon.
L369448 +++$+++ u6492 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ REBA +++$+++ The Tooth...
L369447 +++$+++ u6481 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ DOLLARHYDE +++$+++ Two groups of people were changed. Leeds and Jacobi. The police think they were murdered.  Do you know what they call the being that visited these people?  You can say.
L369446 +++$+++ u6481 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ DOLLARHYDE +++$+++ Some remarkable events have happened in Birmingham and Atlanta.  Do you know what I'm talking about?
L369445 +++$+++ u6492 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ REBA +++$+++ Am I alone in this room? Are you here...  Why are you doing this?!
L369393 +++$+++ u6492 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ REBA +++$+++ Francis...?
L369392 +++$+++ u6481 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ DOLLARHYDE +++$+++ Me.
L369391 +++$+++ u6492 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ REBA +++$+++ Who?
L369390 +++$+++ u6481 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ DOLLARHYDE +++$+++ It's me.
L369389 +++$+++ u6492 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ REBA +++$+++ Who is it?
L369383 +++$+++ u6481 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ DOLLARHYDE +++$+++ Yes.
L369382 +++$+++ u6492 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ REBA +++$+++ You'll come by?
L369381 +++$+++ u6481 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ DOLLARHYDE +++$+++ I'll see you later. All right?
L369380 +++$+++ u6492 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ REBA +++$+++ Are you okay...?
L369379 +++$+++ u6481 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ DOLLARHYDE +++$+++ No. Reba...?
L369378 +++$+++ u6492 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ REBA +++$+++ I want to see you, too, Francis... Should I come over?
L369377 +++$+++ u6481 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ DOLLARHYDE +++$+++ The developing room.  I need to... see you.
L369376 +++$+++ u6492 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ REBA +++$+++ Francis? Where are you?
L369375 +++$+++ u6481 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ DOLLARHYDE +++$+++ Reba...
L369325 +++$+++ u6492 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ REBA +++$+++ I'm fine, Francis.
L369324 +++$+++ u6481 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ DOLLARHYDE +++$+++ Do you want a Coke or something, Reba?
L369323 +++$+++ u6481 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ DOLLARHYDE +++$+++ I'll get it.  Stay right here. You look very good in the sun...
L369322 +++$+++ u6492 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ REBA +++$+++ I'll get my purse.
L369321 +++$+++ u6481 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ DOLLARHYDE +++$+++ I have work to do at the plant.
L369320 +++$+++ u6492 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ REBA +++$+++ My sister's coming by to pick me up for brunch. Why don't you come, too?
L369319 +++$+++ u6481 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ DOLLARHYDE +++$+++ No! Don't go back into the house...  It's too nice outside.
L369318 +++$+++ u6492 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ REBA +++$+++ Good morning...  If you show me where things are, I'll make us some coffee...
L369317 +++$+++ u6492 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ REBA +++$+++ I'm fine.
L369316 +++$+++ u6481 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ DOLLARHYDE +++$+++ Yes, are you okay...?!
L369315 +++$+++ u6492 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ REBA +++$+++ Is that you. D?
L369310 +++$+++ u6481 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ DOLLARHYDE +++$+++ I made you a gin and tonic. It's by the side of the sofa...
L369309 +++$+++ u6492 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ REBA +++$+++ That was nice of you to think of that.
L369301 +++$+++ u6481 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ DOLLARHYDE +++$+++ It's a surprise.
L369300 +++$+++ u6492 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ REBA +++$+++ Ready to tell me what kind of 'outing' this is?
L369292 +++$+++ u6481 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ DOLLARHYDE +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L369291 +++$+++ u6492 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ REBA +++$+++ I'll probably go back to it someday.
L369290 +++$+++ u6492 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ REBA +++$+++ You know you speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech. At the Riker Institute for the Blind. I trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing impaired children...
L369289 +++$+++ u6481 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ DOLLARHYDE +++$+++ You worked out well.
L369288 +++$+++ u6492 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ REBA +++$+++ They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract.
L369287 +++$+++ u6481 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ DOLLARHYDE +++$+++ How did you come to Gateway?
L369286 +++$+++ u6492 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ REBA +++$+++ In the kitchen.
L369285 +++$+++ u6481 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ DOLLARHYDE +++$+++ Tonic will be fine.
L369284 +++$+++ u6492 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ REBA +++$+++ Come on in.  How about a gin and tonic?
L369282 +++$+++ u6481 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ DOLLARHYDE +++$+++ Dandridge is a condescending prick. Ride with me. It would be because I want you to.
L369281 +++$+++ u6492 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ REBA +++$+++ Thanks, but I'll take the bus. I do it all the time.
L369280 +++$+++ u6481 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ DOLLARHYDE +++$+++ Ride with me.
L369279 +++$+++ u6492 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ REBA +++$+++ No, thanks. I manage very well.  I'll order you twelve hundred feet: of 1000 C tomorrow.
L369278 +++$+++ u6481 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ DOLLARHYDE +++$+++ I'll take you.
L369275 +++$+++ u6481 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ DOLLARHYDE +++$+++ It'll do fine.
L369274 +++$+++ u6492 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ REBA +++$+++ The 1000 C Infrared Sensitive Film must be handled in total darkness. I keep the samples straight by touch code.  It's still easier to handle than a 1200 series. Think it'll do?
L369273 +++$+++ u6492 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ REBA +++$+++ Let me stick this in the black hole.
L369272 +++$+++ u6481 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ DOLLARHYDE +++$+++ In eight days.
L369271 +++$+++ u6492 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ REBA +++$+++ When do you need it?
L369270 +++$+++ u6481 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ DOLLARHYDE +++$+++ The activities of nocturnal animals.
L369269 +++$+++ u6492 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ REBA +++$+++ What's being photographed?
L369268 +++$+++ u6481 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ DOLLARHYDE +++$+++ Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.
L369267 +++$+++ u6492 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ REBA +++$+++ Can you give me an idea of the conditions...
L369266 +++$+++ u6492 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ REBA +++$+++ Put your back against the door. Come forward three steps until you feel the tile on your feet and there will be a stool just to your left.
L369265 +++$+++ u6481 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ DOLLARHYDE +++$+++ Ms. McClain, I'm Francis Dollarhyde. I came about the low light level infrared film stock.

L369369 +++$+++ u6493 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ RED DRAGON +++$+++ THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A PIECE OF SHIT AGAIN. THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A HARELIP AGAIN. YOU BETTER GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!
L369368 +++$+++ u6481 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ DOLLARHYDE +++$+++ No.
L369367 +++$+++ u6493 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ RED DRAGON +++$+++ THEY WILL FIND OUT ABOUT YOU.  THEY WILL LOCK YOU IN A PLACE WORSE THAN BROTHER BUDDY'S.
L369230 +++$+++ u6481 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ DOLLARHYDE +++$+++ Good.  We'll seal your promise with...
L369229 +++$+++ u6489 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LOUNDS +++$+++ Absolutely,
L369228 +++$+++ u6481 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ DOLLARHYDE +++$+++ You will tell the truth?
L369227 +++$+++ u6489 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LOUNDS +++$+++ You'll let me go now?
L369226 +++$+++ u6481 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ DOLLARHYDE +++$+++ You did very well.  I apologize for the crude images.  Next time I'll have film stock that doesn't need lights.
L369225 +++$+++ u6489 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LOUNDS +++$+++ 'I have had a great privilege. I have seen with wonder the strength of the Red Dragon. All I wrote about him before was lies from Will Graham. He made me write them. Now I understand.  'Will Graham: you will learn from my own lips how much you have to dread. Because I was forced to lie, he will be more merciful to me than to you.  'I will be a testament to the truth, now.  About his work. About his becoming.'
L369224 +++$+++ u6481 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ DOLLARHYDE +++$+++ Now you will read this into the tape recorder.
L369220 +++$+++ u6489 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LOUNDS +++$+++ No.
L369219 +++$+++ u6481 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ DOLLARHYDE +++$+++ Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?
L369218 +++$+++ u6489 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LOUNDS +++$+++ God, no.
L369217 +++$+++ u6481 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ DOLLARHYDE +++$+++ Do you imply that I'm a queer?

L369215 +++$+++ u6481 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ DOLLARHYDE +++$+++ Are you a man?

L369178 +++$+++ u6489 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LOUNDS +++$+++ Let me lie down.  Listen, I want to call my office. My God, I'm in a Stryker frame.  My back's broken. Tell me the truth.
L369177 +++$+++ u6481 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ DOLLARHYDE +++$+++ Burned? Burned. No. You just rest there. I'll be right back.
L369176 +++$+++ u6489 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LOUNDS +++$+++ My back hurts, my skin. Did I get burned? I hope to God I'm not burned.

L368936 +++$+++ u6482 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ DR. CHILTON +++$+++ Put it down on my desk blotter and don't touch it again. Has anyone else handled it except you?

I know that you alone can understand what I'm becoming.  'I know you alone understand the reality of the people who die to help me in these things, understand that they are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming.  Just as the source of light is burning.  Mr. Graham, there's a hole torn and punched out, then it says...  'I have a complete collection of your press notices.  I think of them as unfair. As unfair as mine. The "Tooth Fairy." What could be more inappropriate.  Investigator Graham interests me.  Very purposeful looking. I hope we can correspond.  There's another piece missing here. I'll read the bottom part.  'After I hear back from you, I might send you something wet.  Signed: Avid Fan.  It has teethmarks pressed in it at the bottom.
L368951 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Can you read it to me?
L368948 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Where did you get it?!
L368947 +++$+++ u6482 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ DR. CHILTON +++$+++ Well, it's about goddamn time!  I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and....
L368946 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ It's Will Graham...
L368763 +++$+++ u6482 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ DR. CHILTON +++$+++ Uh... sure...
L368762 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I want to see Lecktor now.
L368761 +++$+++ u6482 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ DR. CHILTON +++$+++ When you saw Dr. Lecktor's murders, their 'style,' so to speak, were you able to reconstruct his fantasies? And did that help you identify him?
L368760 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ No.
L368759 +++$+++ u6482 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ DR. CHILTON +++$+++ The consensus around here is that the only person who has demonstrated any practical understanding of Dr. Hannibal Lecktor is you, Mr. Graham. Can you tell me anything about him?
L368757 +++$+++ u6482 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ DR. CHILTON +++$+++ As long as it's on soft paper.  You may...  Find this curious.
L368756 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him.
L368755 +++$+++ u6482 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ DR. CHILTON +++$+++ Dr. Lecktor will stay in his room. That is absolutely the only place where he is not put in full body restraints. One wall of his room is a double barrier. I will have a chair put just outside.
L368862 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ Thank you very much.
L368861 +++$+++ u6483 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRADUATE STUDENT +++$+++ 3680 DeSoto Highway. Marathon, Florida.
L368860 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ Now I'll bet it has his home address there, too
L368859 +++$+++ u6483 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRADUATE STUDENT +++$+++ Federal Bureau of Investigation, Tenth and Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C.
L368858 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ We're looking for Graham. The man the book is supposed to go to is a Mr. Will Graham.
L368857 +++$+++ u6483 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRADUATE STUDENT +++$+++ Okay.
L368856 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ Well, zip that little pointer right on down to the letter G.
L368855 +++$+++ u6483 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRADUATE STUDENT +++$+++ Yeah...
L368854 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ I'll bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone.
L368853 +++$+++ u6483 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRADUATE STUDENT +++$+++ She doesn't have a Rolodex.
L368852 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ I have to catch Federal Express within about five minutes. I'd be immensely appreciative if you'd pull it out of her Rolodex for me.
L368851 +++$+++ u6483 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRADUATE STUDENT +++$+++ She'll be in, in the morning...
L368850 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ Maybe you can help me. This is Bob Greer of Blaine & Edwards Publishing Company. Dr. Bloom asked me to send a copy of 'The Psychiatrist and the Law' to someone. Linda never sent me the address and phone number.
