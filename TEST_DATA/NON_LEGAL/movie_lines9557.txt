L49969 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ How?  Nobody this far north monitors that frequency until avalanche season.  Besides, I'm surprised a tough guy like you uses fancy electronics.

L49723 +++$+++ u3775 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ WILDER +++$+++ Back against the bars.  Now.

L49646 +++$+++ u3775 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ WILDER +++$+++ Question is why they sat here when the storm moved in.  Check their stuff while I sniff around.

L49637 +++$+++ u3775 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ WILDER +++$+++ Watch it with Meyerling.  Man's as mean and corrupt as they get. Cut his mother's throat if it'd get him a couple votes.
L49627 +++$+++ u3775 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ WILDER +++$+++ I was making my rounds, saw your hangar wide open, plane getting rained on, so I closed it up.
L49626 +++$+++ u3764 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++  +++$+++ 26   CONTINUED:
L49804 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Wasn't my intention to hurt Wilder.  I'm telling you the truth.  I liked the man.  I only meant to get loose... to survive. Your cheechako boyfriend better understand that.  Listen, I've got some money put away --
L49803 +++$+++ u3765 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ANNE MARIE +++$+++ I don't want to talk any more.
L49802 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ You should know something.
L49801 +++$+++ u3765 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ANNE MARIE +++$+++ That's why I left, moved to Washington.  When I met Eric I was doing day shoots -- products and fashion, mostly.  Pretty dull.  Eric was teaching college, and then he got the job with Northland Oil.  We wanted to stay together, so we talked them into funding some wilderness photography... and here I am.
L49800 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ What about you -- why come back? Classy girl like you seems more suited to the finer things.
L49798 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ I was gone, in September, laying traplines.  She went to our cache for some meat.  Got mauled by a bear.  Tore open her skull. -more-
L49797 +++$+++ u3765 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ANNE MARIE +++$+++ How did she..?
L49796 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Had some good years.  Met her in '66.  She showed up one day in Coldfoot.  No one knew her.  One Sunday morning, she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder.  Didn't work out in three months, she'd return the money and leave, no hard feelings.  My bid was eight thousand dollars.  Beautiful girl.
L49795 +++$+++ u3765 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ANNE MARIE +++$+++ Oh.
L49794 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ She's dead.
L49793 +++$+++ u3765 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ANNE MARIE +++$+++ Had?
L49792 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Knew you had no native blood, even with your dark hair.  Blue eyes give you away.  My wife had blue eyes.
L49791 +++$+++ u3765 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ANNE MARIE +++$+++ My dad was a Navy doctor.
L49787 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Can't be.  Too keen a sense of this place in your pictures.
L49786 +++$+++ u3765 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ANNE MARIE +++$+++ Six months.
L49785 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ How long have you been up north?
L49887 +++$+++ u3770 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ MEYERLING +++$+++ It's out by the pumping station, shot full of holes.
L49886 +++$+++ u3765 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ANNE MARIE +++$+++ Why?
L49885 +++$+++ u3770 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ MEYERLING +++$+++ Really.  I thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside.  By the way -- your truck also 'on the fritz?'
L49884 +++$+++ u3765 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ANNE MARIE +++$+++ Sam?  We haven't seen him.
L49883 +++$+++ u3770 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ MEYERLING +++$+++ What about that hotheaded marshal, Sam Wilder?  I heard he was in the middle of this mess.
L49882 +++$+++ u3765 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ANNE MARIE +++$+++ Somewhere along the pipeline.
L49881 +++$+++ u3770 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ MEYERLING +++$+++ Where'd you say Eric is?
L49880 +++$+++ u3765 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ANNE MARIE +++$+++ The radio's on the fritz.
L49879 +++$+++ u3770 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ MEYERLING +++$+++ What happened here?
L49876 +++$+++ u3765 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ANNE MARIE +++$+++ -- Corbett's a killer.
L49875 +++$+++ u3770 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ MEYERLING +++$+++ -- Get this straight: I'm the District Supervisor.  Whatever you do reflects on me.  It wasn't my idea to bring you people up here, but I'm stuck with you. You are absolutely not to involve yourself in any local disputes. Whichever side you take, you alienate the other.  Mr. Corbett is quite well-known in this region.  People admire him --
L49874 +++$+++ u3765 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ANNE MARIE +++$+++ I was hoping you had some news --
L49873 +++$+++ u3770 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ MEYERLING +++$+++ I have not, but I very much want to.  What do you know about the trouble in Devil's Cauldron?
L49872 +++$+++ u3765 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ANNE MARIE +++$+++ Have you talked to Eric?
L50167 +++$+++ u3765 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ANNE MARIE +++$+++ My home is here.  With you.
L50166 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ When you ran off, I thought you'd keep going 'til you were back home in Washington.
L50163 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ I've got an idea.  We'll have to work fast.
L50162 +++$+++ u3765 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ANNE MARIE +++$+++ Technology in the wilderness. Only problem is talking to you on your way to the landing strip.
L50125 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Nothing broken.  C'mon, we have to hurry.
L50124 +++$+++ u3765 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ANNE MARIE +++$+++ You're hurt.
L50110 +++$+++ u3765 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ANNE MARIE +++$+++ I'm staying.
L50109 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Please, Anne Marie, you being here only complicates things.
L50105 +++$+++ u3765 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ANNE MARIE +++$+++ So what's the problem?
L50104 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Here.  A transport plane is due at eleven.  Once I put him on it, it's all over.
L50103 +++$+++ u3765 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ANNE MARIE +++$+++ Where's Corbett?
L50102 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ I'll tell you everything later.
L50101 +++$+++ u3765 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ANNE MARIE +++$+++ What's going on?
L50100 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ You can't stay here.  Go back to the Turtle.  I'll meet you back there in a few hours.
L50099 +++$+++ u3765 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ANNE MARIE +++$+++ Oh, Christ, sweetheart.  Four days!  I thought you were dead, or worse.
L49814 +++$+++ u3765 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ANNE MARIE +++$+++ That's my line.
L49813 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Be careful, okay?
L49812 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Fairbanks is a three-hour flight. I'll be back by dinnertime.
L49811 +++$+++ u3765 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ANNE MARIE +++$+++ Maybe you should drive him into Devil's Cauldron, let them decide what to do with him.
L49810 +++$+++ u3765 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ANNE MARIE +++$+++ Wait a second.
L49809 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Let's go.
L49740 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Come here...
L49739 +++$+++ u3765 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ANNE MARIE +++$+++ High-tech in the wilderness. Gets me excited, too.
L49737 +++$+++ u3765 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ANNE MARIE +++$+++ Not me.  I'm equipped.
L49736 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Prolonged darkness makes people crazy.
L49735 +++$+++ u3765 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ANNE MARIE +++$+++ Winter.  Two straight months of night -- we may never get out of bed.  Which would suit me fine.
L49732 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ I thought I should check our emergency transmitters.
L49731 +++$+++ u3765 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ANNE MARIE +++$+++ I still can't believe I'm being financed by an oil company. Especially when they get a look at these pictures.  Technology in the wilderness; not too pretty.  What's that?
L49716 +++$+++ u3765 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ANNE MARIE +++$+++ Do I want to be with you permanently?  Yes, I think I do. But be with what you do and the way you live?  That I don't know. C'mon, Eric, until I met you, coming back to Alaska was totally
L49715 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ -- Permanently?
L49714 +++$+++ u3765 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ANNE MARIE +++$+++ Look, why get into this again. As long as it's working, let's leave it alone.  It's been nice so far.  We're together --
L49713 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ It's exactly what you meant.
L49712 +++$+++ u3765 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ANNE MARIE +++$+++ That's not what I meant.
L49711 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ You make it sound like a prison sentence.
L49710 +++$+++ u3765 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ANNE MARIE +++$+++ I'll wear it for you.  And I can wear it when we go home.  We won't be here forever.
L49709 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ You were looking at it in the catalog.  Don't know where you can wear it...
L49708 +++$+++ u3765 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ANNE MARIE +++$+++ Oh, sweetheart.  It's beautiful!
L49706 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Can't help myself.  Corbett's type always pisses me off.  Oh, I found this at the post office.  Had your name on it.
L49705 +++$+++ u3765 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ANNE MARIE +++$+++ Going after killers isn't the same as chasing poachers, Eric.
L49704 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ He was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker.
L49703 +++$+++ u3765 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ANNE MARIE +++$+++ Was there any trouble?
L49702 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Sure did.  He was one of the trappers we rousted from the Haul Road.
L49701 +++$+++ u3765 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ANNE MARIE +++$+++ Did you catch Corbett?
L49658 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ No way can he get away with this. I'll be back by tonight.
L49657 +++$+++ u3765 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ANNE MARIE +++$+++ Eric, leave it alone.  It's not your business.
L49656 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ I'll go into town with you.
L49636 +++$+++ u3765 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ANNE MARIE +++$+++ The little creep hates it that Eric actually does what the company hired him to do.
L49635 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Best thing is, Meyerling has to chase around to find us.
L49634 +++$+++ u3765 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ANNE MARIE +++$+++ I call it 'the Turtle,' as in carrying your home on your back.
L49629 +++$+++ u3765 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ANNE MARIE +++$+++ I bet you haven't had lunch.
L49628 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Thanks.
L49564 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Bastards took off, though, didn't they?
L49563 +++$+++ u3765 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ANNE MARIE +++$+++ Great idea -- pointing a lousy dart gun at some nut with a high-powered hunting rifle.
L49551 +++$+++ u3765 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ANNE MARIE +++$+++ Be careful -- there're two of them.
L49550 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Stay here.
L49546 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ He still might be around.  I saw fresh tire tracks coming in.
L49545 +++$+++ u3765 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ANNE MARIE +++$+++ What are you doing?
L49538 +++$+++ u3765 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ANNE MARIE +++$+++ Be right back.  I left my camcorder in the car.
L49537 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ He's coming around fine.
L49625 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Leave my traps.  We'll tag up, couple days.
L49624 +++$+++ u3771 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Okay by me.  You're the one likes these hot springs so much.
L49623 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Go ahead.  Take the jeep.  I'll come to Cache with Bob when he gets here.
L49620 +++$+++ u3771 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ I know.  Least you didn't shoot all of them.
L49619 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Had no choice...  ...Given the situation.
L49571 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Relax.  I just want to ask them how the hunting is.
L49570 +++$+++ u3771 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Let's keep going.  We're only an hour from Devil's Cauldron.
L49569 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Leave it here.
L50231 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ You're wrong.  Everything we do leaves its mark.  You said it yourself -- there are hundred- year-old footprints in the tundra.
L50230 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Look down there, tell me what any of this matters.  Struggles of men get swallowed by the bigness. Soon there won't be a trace of our troubles... or us.
L50227 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ We'll get you to a hospital, soon as we get to Fairbanks.
L50226 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Like I said, I'd still be up on that mountain, frozen solid, it wasn't for you.
L50225 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ How come you didn't let him shoot me?
L50224 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Let's get out of here.
L50223 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Wound's a through-and-through. Missed my liver, I think.
L50222 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Can you walk?
L50154 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ The time has passed for men like them and me.  I know it.  But they're still fighting for survival, like cornered animals. That's why they'll kill you. -more-
L50153 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Why offer a buyoff with your gunmen waiting outside?
L50152 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Snow's to their advantage, kid. You can't see them, but soon as that plane comes, they'll sure as hell know where we're going. Wise up.  Take me to the Yukon. I'll give you that money and guarantee you'll walk away.
L50139 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ You kill me, you sign your death warrant.  And hers.
L50138 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Answer and I'll shoot!
L50129 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ 
L50128 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Shut up!
L50127 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Maybe you can talk sense into your boyfriend.
L50086 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ No way they'll find you on a five-minute signal.  And no way -more-
L50085 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Lets us watch each other's backs over a wide area.  Only thing messed me up this time was getting arrested in the baths. ELT was in my duffel bag, not around my neck where it should've been.
L50084 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Emergency transmitter?  What happened to signal mirrors or two-tone smoke fires?
L50052 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ You're damn lucky, glimpsing this country before it's ruined, gone for good.  You saw wonders you'd only dreamed of.  That alone makes you different than the sorry bastards back where you came from, because you have dreamt them.
L50051 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ I liked you better frozen.  You didn't talk so much.
L50050 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ You were real resourceful out there.  Got me thinking of this perimeter man, froze all his fingers one winter.  So he hacked the tips off and sharpened the exposed bones.  Gets along better than ever.  Yeah, maybe I underestimated you.
L50049 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ I'm sure she's fine.  Seemed like a clever kid.
L50048 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ You broke the radio, remember?
L50047 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Talk to that good-looking girl of yours?
L50019 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Hell, I still get a knot in my gut every season, wondering how much longer I can go on.  No 'Home for Retired Trappers' that -more-
L50018 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Maybe...maybe not.  I'll tell you what scares me -- stumbling through life, like an ordinary jerk.  That's why I want to work on the front lines, where what I do means something.  Soon as I got here, I realized my job was bullshit.  Oil company propaganda.  I was ready to leave, then I thought screw it, I'll outsmart them, do the work anyway.  I don't know anymore.  Maybe I am fooling myself.  That's what I'm afraid of most of all.
L50015 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ You don't know how true that is.
L50014 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ I already have.
L50013 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Don't bet on it.
L50012 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ They think you're in Fairbanks. If not, they still won't find you before the plane comes tomorrow.
L50005 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Cowardly bastard.  I'm in handcuffs and I still scare the piss out of you.
L50004 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Don't push me..!
L50002 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ I'm real sad you don't approve of me.
L50001 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ What do you know about people? You live like an animal!  A savage goddamn throwback like you belongs out here, as far away from the rest of us as possible.
L49999 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ All you do is keep folks from working the land, living like they're meant to.  You don't understand shit!  Trappers, hunters -- we're part of the environment.  Who's protecting us?  I've seen plenty like you.  So -more-
L49998 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Yeah, it is fucked up -- but it's not too late to keep that from happening here.
L49997 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Don't judge me.  You're a joke, coming here from a fucked-up culture, telling us what to do!
L49996 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ You got a knack for seeing things the way you want to see them.
L49995 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Killing wildlife not good enough anymore, so you go on to bigger and better things.
L49994 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Told that's what our old man was. Planned on going to sea, me and Bob, 'til I read Jack London. Started trapping when I was ten. Mailed the furs to Sears.  Eight bucks for a skunk, three for a muskrat.  That was fine money.
L49993 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Nome?  I figure you'd be a whaler, coming from there.
L49973 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Hate to disappoint you.
L49972 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ An appetite.  Maybe you won't die after all.
L49971 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ I'm hungry.  Go kill me some dinner.
L49967 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Too bad.  We'd be out of here in a few hours.
L49966 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ It was blown up with the plane.
L49965 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ You got one?
L49964 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Emergency transmitter?  All your gear is back at Wilder's.
L49963 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Where's my ELT?
L49962 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Stay still.
L49958 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ It's a spring day...
L49957 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ You don't feel cold?
L49956 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ What?!  Fuck off.  Save yourself.
L49955 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ How many do you see?
L49954 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Told you I'm fine!
L49953 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ If that means freeze my balls off, no thanks.  I'll be okay.
L49952 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Stay awake!  You want to go hypothermic?
L49949 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ You're not going to slow us down! Keep moving!
L49948 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Have to get these wet things off.
L49944 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ You don't get it, do you?
L49943 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ There's a snowmobile. Inside a day we could be on the Yukon.  I got money there.  Remember that five thousand?  Make it ten.  Be smart.  Take it and walk away.
L49942 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Too bad we're heading west.
L49941 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ There's a cabin, maybe twenty miles south of here.
L49935 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Yep.  Sometimes they do, but usually they end up crazy or dead.
L49934 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Yeah?
L49933 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Folks come to Alaska for a real short list of reasons:  Money. Adventure.  Solitude.  Those cover most everyone.  But frontiers also draw another type of man.  One with a demon in his gut.  He comes to the edge of the world to face that demon, and lay it to rest.
L49930 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ You want to fool yourself about that bullshit job, fine.  Damn shame you have to drag your girlfriend along.  You think a woman like that will be happy making moose stew for a man -more-
L49929 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ I'm here to do my job.
L49928 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Sure love to know where you fit in up here.
L49925 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Sure.  The People's Friend.  Kiss your ass with precision if there's a vote in it.
L49924 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ You know Meyerling?
L49923 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Where in hell Meyerling dig you up?
L49920 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ I'm still figuring: You're either real brave or real dumb.
L49919 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ It could blow over tomorrow, too.
L49918 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Damn lucky this storm didn't blow down when we were on those baldheaded mountains.  It continues, we better stay put.
L49891 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Going to be a bit of a challenge with handcuffs on.
L49890 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Forget it.  It would take days.
L49889 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Have to backtrack, find another way down.
L49870 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Pushing it is flat wrong.  All you prove is your ignorance about breaking trail.
