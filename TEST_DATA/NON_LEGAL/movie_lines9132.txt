L279346 +++$+++ u1325 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ That wasn't part of the deal.  I want to be poisonous but fair.
L279345 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Look.  Can I pay you properly?  You don't have to tell him what you got. Send him forty-five bucks and blow the rest.  Give it to charity.  Or something.
L279344 +++$+++ u1325 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Years.  This collection is as close as he's ever come to an achievement.
L279343 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ It must have taken him a long time to get them together.
L279342 +++$+++ u1325 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ He's in Jamaica with a twenty-three- year-old.  A friend of my daughter's. He had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and I told him to fuck off, so he asked me to sell his singles collection and send him a check for whatever I go, minus a ten percent commission. Which reminds me.  Can you make sure you give me a five?  I want to frame it and put it on the wall.
L279341 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ And you must not be getting along too well right now, huh?
L279340 +++$+++ u1325 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ I must have nothing.  Their my husband's.
L279339 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ But you must have --
L279338 +++$+++ u1325 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ I know what they're worth.  Give me fifty and get them out.
L279337 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ These are worth at least, I don't know --
L279336 +++$+++ u1325 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Give me fifty bucks and they're all yours.
L279335 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ It's the best collection I've ever seen.
L279334 +++$+++ u1325 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ What do you think?
L279977 +++$+++ u1324 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ What's the name of your label?
L279976 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Nice.
L279975 +++$+++ u1324 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ We saw this ad in the personals for two swingers lookin' for a Renaissance fair.
L279971 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Whatever.
L279970 +++$+++ u1324 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ I'm Vince.
L279969 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ We're not there yet, Justin.
L279968 +++$+++ u1324 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ Wait a minute.  Island Records charged U2 a million five against their overhead for one plane ride.
L279967 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ It's rough.  But it shows promise. We record a couple of songs right, in a studio.  I'll take care of the rest.  I'll put out your record. Any profits after recouping expenses get split down the middle, between us and you guys.
L279414 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Fuck off.
L279413 +++$+++ u1324 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ Records are those big round black things, right?
L279412 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Uh, yes I, like, do... It's simple. You make the tracks -- recording studio -- deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut, the master is then dubbed to submasters, which are the "mothers," as their called, for each press in the plant. You press the CD's or records, put in your cover art, and that's it.
L279409 +++$+++ u1324 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ No, we...
L279408 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Jesus.  That thing's been in the bargain bin for six months!  Was it just your criminal nature or what? Hell, I would've given it to you for free.
L279407 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I can't frisk you but the cops can.
L279406 +++$+++ u1324 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ Well we don't.
L279405 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I think you have more.
L279402 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Oh really.  You two are slamming to Nico now?
L279401 +++$+++ u1324 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ Naw.  Those are for us.
L279400 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Eno import.  Sigue Sigue Sputnik. Break beats.  Serge Gainsbourg. Ryuchi Sakamoto, Syd Barrett... What's going on here?  Are you guys stealing for other people now?
L282389 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Go to hell.
L282388 +++$+++ u1328 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ I warned you.
L282065 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Sure.
L282064 +++$+++ u1328 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Well, the cream of society awaits.  If you're ever in the neighborhood...
L282063 +++$+++ u1328 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Uncle Joey's little girl.  Can't get the taste out of her mouth.
L282062 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Mr. Congeniality?  Let him find his own clues.  There's a journal article in this somewhere.
L282061 +++$+++ u1328 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ He'd want to know about all this.
L282060 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Yeah.
L282059 +++$+++ u1328 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Taupin, isn't that the guy Moran picked up the other night?
L282058 +++$+++ u1328 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Find the father.  That should clear things up.
L282057 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30.
L282056 +++$+++ u1328 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ How old is Richard?
L282055 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Dr. Kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral.  The father looked just like Richard.  Even had a mark on his cheek.
L282054 +++$+++ u1328 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Probably just some exec ducking an ex-wife.
L282053 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Some guy named Smith was asking about him in Church Hill.  I passed his name around with your buddies downtown but they drew a blank.  So he isn't a cop.  District anyway.
L282052 +++$+++ u1328 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Maybe he's hiding from something.
L282051 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ I can't figure out why he's doing it. He's been Richard Taupin at least since 1967.  And the guys rich.  You should see the stuff he has in that shop.
L281887 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ It's in good condition.
L281886 +++$+++ u1331 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ EXAMINER +++$+++ You're the expert.
L281885 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Scottish claymore.  Take a French epee, add twenty pounds of ballast so it means business, and you've got a claymore.
L281884 +++$+++ u1331 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ EXAMINER +++$+++ Huh?
L281883 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Claymore.
L281882 +++$+++ u1331 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ EXAMINER +++$+++ Figured you knew more about swords than I did.
L281881 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Didn't think it was my buddy over there.
L281880 +++$+++ u1331 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ EXAMINER +++$+++ Didn't look like it came from "Toys-Are-Us", that's why I called you.
L281878 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Fine.
L281877 +++$+++ u1331 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ EXAMINER +++$+++ How's your uncle?  I hardly ever see him anymore.
L281874 +++$+++ u1331 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ EXAMINER +++$+++ This one came unassembled.
L281873 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Doesn't have a head, does he?
L282217 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Thanks.
L282216 +++$+++ u1343 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ Happy birthday.
L282215 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ It's my birthday.
L282214 +++$+++ u1343 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ You're very macabre.
L282213 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ There was a Count.  Count Dusan.  He would invite the local peasants to his chateau, fill them full of wine, then slice their bellies so he could reuse it.  The symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me.
L282212 +++$+++ u1343 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ That stuff'll put you away if you're not careful.
L282036 +++$+++ u1338 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KIDELL +++$+++ Carl Smith.
L282035 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Would you remember his name?
L282034 +++$+++ u1338 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KIDELL +++$+++ There was this one fella.  Asked a lot of questions.  I was out of town but I heard he spent near a full day in the records office.
L282033 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Have you spoken to anyone else about this?
L282031 +++$+++ u1338 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KIDELL +++$+++ Mother too.  Sad case it was.  The young lady just couldn't make it through labor.  Never even saw her son.
L282030 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ The boy _died_?
L282029 +++$+++ u1338 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KIDELL +++$+++ Poor little tyke didn't have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days after he was born.
L282028 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ I don't follow you.
L282027 +++$+++ u1338 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KIDELL +++$+++ Don't know about any of that. Suppose nobody does.
L282026 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ I've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies.
L282025 +++$+++ u1338 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KIDELL +++$+++ No.
L282024 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Then you didn't know Richard later on.
L282023 +++$+++ u1338 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KIDELL +++$+++ Well, this is a small town, and it was even smaller then.  Most all the babies I delivered were from local families.  Richard's parents were just passing through when his mother's time came.  I did it right here at the house.
L282022 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Why?
L282021 +++$+++ u1338 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KIDELL +++$+++ He was unsual.
L282020 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ No thank you, I'm fine.
L282019 +++$+++ u1338 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KIDELL +++$+++ Would you like more tea?
L282002 +++$+++ u1329 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ DESK OFFICER +++$+++ Anything in Maryland is close.
L282001 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?
L282000 +++$+++ u1329 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ DESK OFFICER +++$+++ Taupin, Richard Marshall.  Born March 16, 1945 in Church Hill, Maryland.  Received first driver permit 1967 in Philadelphia.
L281999 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ You owe me.  Besides, I'm cute.
L281998 +++$+++ u1329 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ DESK OFFICER +++$+++ -Okay okay.
L281997 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ So's playing choo-choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of-
L281996 +++$+++ u1329 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ DESK OFFICER +++$+++ This is against the rules.
L282738 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Yes.
L282737 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ It will be horrible.  The future.  I may die tomorrow or 10,000 tomorrows. I can promise you nothing.  Nothing but a moment.  Maybe two.  But a moment of love, is that not worth a lifetime?
L282736 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Life is only life when it is bounded by death.  The inheritance is death. The gift is the finality of life. To be part of the fabric.  The inside.  I love you Brenna.
L282735 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ You have lived forever.
L282734 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Life.  It is the gift and the under- standing of life.
L282733 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Not power.  Not control.
L282732 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ The inheritance.
L282731 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ The emptyness.  The years and years of void.  Nothingness.  Bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness. Who would have guessed?
L282727 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ I'll destroy you.  I've destroyed everything I've ever touched!  Oh God...
L282726 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ No!
L282725 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Get out.
L282724 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ I'm the last.  Oh Christ, I'm the _last one_!
L282723 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ What is it?
L282721 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ I can't stand it.  Oh God, I can't stand it!
L282720 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ What's wrong?
L282659 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Be careful.  Don't stay any longer than you have to.
L282658 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Will I see you again?
L282657 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Gettysburg's an hour's drive at most.  You should be back by nightfall.
L282656 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ All of it finished.
L282655 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ What is it you want?
L282654 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away.
L282653 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ But you're known so much. History I'll only read about.
L282652 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Empty.  And fear.  Fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you.  It can never last, and in the end you always end up destroying both.
L282651 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ What is it like?  Being you?
L282640 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Damn you.
L282639 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Come here, Brenna.
L282638 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Don't.
L282636 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Is that a threat?
L282635 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ I haven't killed _you_.
L282634 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ You kill with your left hand?
L282633 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ There are differences.
L282632 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ You and your buddy make a real team, don't you?  Exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen- tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between.
L282631 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Sometimes innocents become involved.
L282630 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ What about that family in '31?
L282629 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Not the same.
L282628 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ You killed those other two.
L282627 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ I didn't kill the watchman.
L282626 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Of bodies.
L282625 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Perhaps.  There is something more. An inheritance.
L282624 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ That's insane.
L282623 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Sometimes I think it's just for something to do.  A conquest to be the last.  Something to hold onto while everything else around you withers and blows away.  Some- thing to replace the love that can never work.
L282622 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ What could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction.
L282621 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ He is older than I.
L282620 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ He knows about you.
L282619 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Yes.
L282618 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ That's why Smith called you MacLeod.
L282617 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ I carried that rifle in World War I.  This book is a 16th Century policy report for the King of Austria.  The diploma is my con- ference of degree in Latin from Trinity College.  Class of 1672.  It goes on.
L282614 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ I'd like you to try.
L282613 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ That would be difficult to explain.
L282612 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Who are you?
L282607 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Just a little crazy.
L282606 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ You are a very perceptive young woman.
L282605 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ My life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses.  I can't stand it.  But you're different.  It's in your hands.  A clarity.
L282604 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer.
L282603 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ I'm not even sure why.
L282602 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ I see.
L282601 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write.  But it's not.  It's you.
L282600 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Why are you here?
L282599 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ I must be insane.  Leaving work, ditching cops.  All to follow a murderer.  A very old murderer, but a murderer just the same.
L282598 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ You won't.
L282597 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ I hope I never get that old.
L282596 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ A factor of age.
L282595 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ It's frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people's lives.
L282594 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ That's impossible.
L282593 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ At least.
L282592 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Then you must be at least 70 years old.
L282590 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ No.  Just the child of some lonely girl I gave a ride to.  When they died I put them in a grave with my name on it. Twenty years later I became the son.
L282589 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ You're using your son's name.
L282588 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Yes.
L282587 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ And you are William Taupin, aren't you?
L282586 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Yes.
L282585 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ William Taupin seems to have left his mark.
L282584 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Follow me.
L282583 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ I don't know any of these.  I'll make a fool of myself.
L282536 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ A little dusty.
L282535 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ It's beautiful.
L282534 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Here, try this.  I suppose they're still making women the same as back then.
L282532 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ There's a catch.  You're supposed to wear 19th century clothing.
L282531 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Maybe it would do us both good.
L282530 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ I thought it might be a nice break from all of this.
L282529 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ They do it each year.
L282528 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ It's some sort of party the town is throwing.
L282527 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Well, as long as we're stuck here.
L282526 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Yes.
L282525 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ No.  So what now?  We just wait?
L282523 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ It will take some time for the forms to clear before you go to Gettysburg.
L282522 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ The estate stuff is pretty straight forward.  Just lots of forms and an appearance at the county seat.
L282521 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ I wish I could.
L282520 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Yes.
L282519 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ There was a man once.  Just a simple woodcarver.  But he understood.  More than anyone he could see to the heart of it.  It never ends.  Today is the same as the first.  Tomorrow will be the same as today.  So much time.  And all of it wasted.  You love history?
L282418 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ The less exposure I recieve around government buildings the better.  You, as Mrs. Taupin, will attract considerably less attention than I.
L282417 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ You want me to front for you.
L282416 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ The only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property I've aquired.  That requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in Gettysburg.  But that's where you come in.
L282415 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ You make it all sound so simple.
L282414 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ I go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad Mr. Taupin.
L282413 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ When you finish, what then?
L282412 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Not all of them.
L282411 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ You did kill those men.
L282410 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Richard Taupin has become cumbersome.  It would be best if he just disappeared.
L282409 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ What's all that?
L282403 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ You are.  Now.
L282402 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Our cars were seen together in Felton.  They're calling me an accessory to murder.
L282401 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ You've been listening to rumors.
L282400 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Is this what you killed them with?
L282398 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ Maybe.
L282397 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ You're a fool.
L282396 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ You're wrong.
L282395 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ You had to do _nothing_!
L282394 +++$+++ u1326 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ BRENNA +++$+++ No.  I had to talk to you.
