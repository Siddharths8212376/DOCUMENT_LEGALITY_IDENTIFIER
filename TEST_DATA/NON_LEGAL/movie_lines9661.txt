L123396 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again?
L123395 +++$+++ u4384 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ LIBRARY CLERK +++$+++ It's seeing-eye dogs, ma'am. If I let the cat stay, will you go out with me?
L123394 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ But I'm blind.
L123393 +++$+++ u4384 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ LIBRARY CLERK +++$+++ I'm sorry, ma'am, there are no pets allowed in the library...
L123556 +++$+++ u4385 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Trust me, you won't have to.
L123555 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ I don't know if I can do it alone.
L123554 +++$+++ u4385 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Do you always listen to what your mother says?  Selina. Something you choose your life. Sometimes your life chooses you.  Save the day..
L123553 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ But I'm not a hero. I'm nobody's heroine..I'm nothing. You've said so yourself many times.
L123552 +++$+++ u4385 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Yes, you do. You have to go rescue all those people...
L123551 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ Mom, not now!  I, I don't know what to do..
L123550 +++$+++ u4385 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ I hate it when you let your hair just hang like that...you have such pretty eyes...
L123549 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ They're going to attack Frank's Fun Palace!
L123543 +++$+++ u4385 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Yes, I'm pretty amazing. You should see this...It came this evening.
L123542 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ I never thanked you..the arrow..the motorcycle..the computer disc..You're so different from what I..and so the same.
L123541 +++$+++ u4385 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ What kind of name is "Brock Leviathan?"
L123540 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ Mom?  Oh Mom, I messed up...
L123026 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ It's because I didn't come in. I live in the Hut, now. I meant to tell you..See ya.
L123025 +++$+++ u4385 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Where were you last night?  I didn't hear you come in.
L122887 +++$+++ u4385 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Because she asked me--and I couldn't very well turn her down. Don't you remember-- of course you don't remember--that "Hag" is the one who brought you to that hospital in Gotham City. For what it's worth-- currently not much--we owe her your life...When I think about a single woman in Gotham City--amnesia is probably the best thing that could happen to a girl like you...Oh, don't forget your visor.
L122886 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ Uh, it's just--that woman out there-- that horrible Hag. She's the one who keeps following me on her creepy little scooter--And now she's built a hut in the back..Why did you...
L122885 +++$+++ u4385 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Don't sneak up on me...
L122883 +++$+++ u4385 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Oh, so now even the keepers of the city don't meet your standards...You're late.
L122882 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ I'll take your abuse, but it's way too early for the sanctimonious Cult of Gag...
L122879 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ Pretty good...Mom, I don't want you to think I don't appreciate...letting me stay, getting me the job--I've been a mess. I'm still a mess. It's just...we have to start having a different conversation. I can't take..
L122878 +++$+++ u4385 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ It's funny, I've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career. And I've heard of foregoing a career to start a family-- but I think you're onto something new, Selina. "Absolutely nothing"-- Has a ring to it. I think it could catch on...How's that for sarcasm?
L122877 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ Maybe.
L122876 +++$+++ u4385 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Is every single thing out of your mouth since your "accident" have to be a monotone mumble of cheap sarcasm?
L122875 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ Oh Mommy, you're embarrassing me.
L122874 +++$+++ u4385 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Oh, I forgot to tell you, you're on a diet...The fact you're still reasonably pretty is the one thing you got going for you.
L122873 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ A hearty breakfast is the start of a great morning...
L122872 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ Yes, Mother. Dear.
L122871 +++$+++ u4385 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ You're late.
L123314 +++$+++ u4387 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SPOOKY +++$+++ Thanks.
L123313 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ Nice breasts.
L123311 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ You going to talk all day?
L123310 +++$+++ u4387 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SPOOKY +++$+++ You're the One. I thought I told you to stay hidden behind the couch, CAT! You've torn the unit apart.  You've driven a great leader insane...
L123304 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ The kicks..the rush..you mean, like pulling heists..faking your own deaths..killing innocent bystanders...like Mexican angels.  I know you're a woman. Do you?
L123303 +++$+++ u4387 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SPOOKY +++$+++ I'm not sad, no, I owe the Captain my life. It's just you think you want to help prevent crime, but you realize that's too complicated. It's a lot more fun to punish crime. Then after a while, you don't care what's a crime and what's not, what you became a Warrior for. You just want the kicks. The rush.
L123302 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ You seem sad, Spooky.
L123301 +++$+++ u4387 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SPOOKY +++$+++ We met on the Internet. The Captain put out a cryptic message calling for a new order of crimefighters. We don't even know each other's true identities...
L123300 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ What's it like being a superhero?  It must be frightfully exciting..How did you guys all get together?
L123299 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ Oh pooh, come now. If you turn me down, I just might throw a fit..you know how us girls can be..
L123298 +++$+++ u4387 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SPOOKY +++$+++ I'm sorry, Miss, one of us needs to keep surveillance...
L123297 +++$+++ u4386 +++$+++ m290 +++$+++ SELINA +++$+++ What's a powerful man like you standing all alone for?  Dance with me?
L123728 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I would appreciate a little space. Thank you.
L123727 +++$+++ u4388 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ 2ND DRIVER +++$+++ I don't see anybody in there but you.
L123726 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I know.  But it's an emergency. Somebody dying.  Okay?
L123725 +++$+++ u4388 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ 2ND DRIVER +++$+++ This is one way.
L123724 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Any place.
L123723 +++$+++ u4388 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ 2ND DRIVER +++$+++ Where do you think you're going?
L123722 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Hey Buddy!  Can you let me pull over?  Give me some space to pull over.
L124415 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ I won't let him.  He belongs to me now.  Bye, sweetie.
L124414 +++$+++ u4389 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ I know he's there!  He doesn't even have the balls to pick up the phone!
L124413 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ I'm sure he'll be heartbroken.
L124412 +++$+++ u4389 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ He ran out on me to be with you? Well fuck him!  Everything worked twice as good without him.  We didn't need him then and I don't need him now.
L124411 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Taking messages.
L124410 +++$+++ u4389 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ What are you doing on Theo's line?
L123784 +++$+++ u4389 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ Matter of fact I did have a kid once.  But he's a lot better off with his father in Milwaukee.
L123783 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Don't you have children?
L123782 +++$+++ u4389 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ I'm sorry for whatever's happened to you but we're definitely not the right people to do you any good.
L123762 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Do I hear a woman's voice?
L123761 +++$+++ u4389 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ Was someone in an accident?
L123821 +++$+++ u4392 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ KLINGER +++$+++ Any trouble, we whip out our Treasury Department badges -- show them the wire I'm wearing and read them their rights.  Theo seizes the Krugerands as evidence. Naturally they start negotiating. Offer to give us up somebody else. And we listen.  Take notes on who bought what stolen art and tell them we have to clear it with our superiors at Justice.  We pick up their passports -- escort them to their room and leave them all in the bathroom handcuffed to the plumbing.
L123820 +++$+++ u4389 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ I am not!  Fuck you!  Theo's a genius.
L123819 +++$+++ u4392 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ KLINGER +++$+++ Oh.  Seems yours girlfriend is casting doubts on your expertise.
L123818 +++$+++ u4389 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ What if they do question the authenticity?
L123787 +++$+++ u4392 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ KLINGER +++$+++ Wake up.  Make a right at Ocean Avenue.  The hotel's a few blocks up on the left.
L123786 +++$+++ u4389 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ This is my conversation.  I'll say what I fucking please.
L123785 +++$+++ u4392 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ KLINGER +++$+++ Have you got to tell her your life story?
L123757 +++$+++ u4392 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ KLINGER +++$+++ That's all we need.  Better let me drive.
L123756 +++$+++ u4389 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ Be careful.  There were people in that crosswalk.
L123841 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I'm sorry.  You'll do all right without me.  Keep my share.
L123840 +++$+++ u4389 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ You gotta just look the other way.
L123839 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Then whose is it?
L123838 +++$+++ u4389 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ I know you feel awful but it's not your responsibility.
L123835 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Look -- I've got the lives of maybe three innocent people hanging on the end of this line.
L123834 +++$+++ u4389 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ He's right, Theo.  She might not be around to back up your story. You could end up in the middle of this.
L123808 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ This Mercedes of yours, what's it look like?
L123807 +++$+++ u4389 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ Will you two cut it out?
L123792 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Did you have to tell her my name?
L123791 +++$+++ u4389 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ Theo wants to talk again.
L123790 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ She can't!  It's busted.  Now hand that on back!
L123789 +++$+++ u4389 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ I'm not finished.  Under other circumstances I'd gladly go out of my way.  I don't understand why you just don't phone some other person.
L123788 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I know where it is.  Give me that phone back.
L123755 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ How was I in the wrong?
L123754 +++$+++ u4389 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ He's at it again.  Like that night at the Emerald.  This piece of Euro-trash is slapping shit out of his little wife in a back booth -- so Mr. Good Deed here has got to step in and pound the fucker's head into the wall.  Meantime "Wifey" recovers enough to pull off her high heel and nearly take our hero's eye out.  It took six stitches.
L123753 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I'm trying to help somebody. Okay?
L123752 +++$+++ u4389 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ Me, he won't stay on the phone with for five fucking minutes without bitching.
L123751 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Say something ...
L123745 +++$+++ u4389 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ You couldn't hurt me.  But it's the principle.
L123744 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I didn't hurt you.
L123743 +++$+++ u4389 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ So what?  What could be important enough to put your hands on me?
L123742 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You could've made me lose my call.
L123741 +++$+++ u4389 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ What was that for?
L123735 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I'll explain later.  I'm sort of on hold.
L123734 +++$+++ u4389 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ CAITLIN +++$+++ Who's on the phone?
L124299 +++$+++ u4396 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ NELSON +++$+++ I'm not staying in here with him puking all over the place.  Get this door open!
L124298 +++$+++ u4390 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ COP'S VOICE +++$+++ We've already got an ambulance on the way.  Don't try to get out.
L124297 +++$+++ u4396 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ NELSON +++$+++ No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
L124296 +++$+++ u4390 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ COP'S VOICE +++$+++ It was the fugitive in the Chrysler that caused this.  We were trying to overtake him.
L124295 +++$+++ u4396 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ NELSON +++$+++ You could've killed us.
L124294 +++$+++ u4390 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ COP'S VOICE +++$+++ Are you guys all right?
L124425 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I want the gun emptied.  I want to see all six slugs tossed up here. And then I want out.  That's all. <u>OUT</u>!
L124424 +++$+++ u4391 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ GRILLO +++$+++ I told you I should've cuffed him.
L124406 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I'm the one they'd be looking for.
L124405 +++$+++ u4391 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ GRILLO +++$+++ Which is why we had a lot more to worry about than the law.  These are people who don't worry about reading you your rights.
L124397 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Mind letting me make the best of a rotten situation?
L124396 +++$+++ u4391 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ GRILLO +++$+++ Can you make him stop!
L124395 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Yeah, I suppose getting whacked has got to be one of your best ways to die.  Particularly if you're not expecting it.  You don't know what hit you.
L124391 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Bear right till the fire road ends.  It's not far.
L124390 +++$+++ u4391 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ GRILLO +++$+++ How do we get back to the freeway?
L124380 +++$+++ u4391 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ GRILLO +++$+++ Any time you decide to let me in on it.
L124379 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You missed.
L124368 +++$+++ u4391 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ GRILLO +++$+++ Only I was sloppy.  I let you take me out.  That was quite a humiliation.
L124367 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Or relieve me of it later.
L124366 +++$+++ u4391 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ GRILLO +++$+++ In case you crapped out it was my job to go after that briefcase.
L124351 +++$+++ u4391 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ GRILLO +++$+++ Yes sir.
L124350 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Nels reporting in.  Sit down where you are.  Arms folded.
L124343 +++$+++ u4391 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ GRILLO +++$+++ You almost brain me and lock me in a fucking trunk and you're on my side?  You stupid fuck!
L124342 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You got it wrong.  I'm the one that's on your side.
L124341 +++$+++ u4391 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ GRILLO +++$+++ Lady, don't let him do it!
L124077 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ See for yourself, federal agent, U.S. Treasury.  On the job.
L124076 +++$+++ u4391 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ GRILLO +++$+++ What's this?
L124075 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I'm going to level with you officer.
L124074 +++$+++ u4391 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ GRILLO +++$+++ Let's have your license, mister.
L124073 +++$+++ u4391 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ GRILLO +++$+++ Why would I do that?
L124072 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ What'd you do?  Tail me from Brentwood?
L124071 +++$+++ u4391 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ GRILLO +++$+++ They'll wait.  Meantime, raise the lid.
L124070 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I got to get going.  An agent is showing me a house up on Broad Beach in ten minutes.
L124069 +++$+++ u4391 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ GRILLO +++$+++ Now that'd be a misdemeanor.
L124388 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ I'll see that he stays calm.  Pack the money up and put it in the trunk.
L124387 +++$+++ u4391 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ GRILLO +++$+++ You never miss a trick.
L124386 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Put those away.  We can't have marks on his wrists.
L124385 +++$+++ u4391 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ GRILLO +++$+++ Now turn around.  I'm going to cuff you.
L124383 +++$+++ u4391 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ GRILLO +++$+++ So Theo and Nels will appear to have whacked each other out and we never existed.  A thing of beauty. Jesus, the shit you come up with!
L124382 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ I prefer to have the sucker die at a more convenient location.  Once Nels arrives with his backpack full of goodies.
L124364 +++$+++ u4391 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ GRILLO +++$+++ You can tell she was really worried about me.
L124363 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ With all those holes Nels pumped in I knew you wouldn't suffocate.
L124362 +++$+++ u4391 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ GRILLO +++$+++ It took you long enough to get my ass out.
L124346 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ What else did you expect him to say?  Do it, Theo -- or give me the gun.
L124345 +++$+++ u4391 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ GRILLO +++$+++ Look, I've got a wife.  I don't care if either of you ever get caught.
L124344 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ He's seen both of us now.
L123829 +++$+++ u4392 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ KLINGER +++$+++ Sure -- and they record your voice.  And later on we all get slammed for kidnap and murder. That's out!
L123828 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Okay, okay, Lenore, calm down. Either let me call the school or better yet, the F.B.I.
L123827 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ What do you keep making me out to be?
L123826 +++$+++ u4392 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ KLINGER +++$+++ In any event, whatever occurs you do not belt anybody.
L123825 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Satisfied, Wiseass?
L123824 +++$+++ u4392 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ KLINGER +++$+++ Got your badge?
L123815 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ It's rolled up in the tube on the floor back there.
L123814 +++$+++ u4392 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ KLINGER +++$+++ Let's hope so.  Once you come out and okay everything I'll give Caitlin the sign that she can bring the painting on over.
L123813 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I improved on the fucking original.
L123812 +++$+++ u4392 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ KLINGER +++$+++ First off, this Mr. Chow Yen doesn't speak a lot of English. The girl with him will interpret. There will be a third person to accompany you into the men's room where you can take count.  I hope you know Krugerands better than they know a <u>Hockney</u>.
L123811 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Go ahead then.  I'm covering the receiver.  She can't hear.
L123810 +++$+++ u4392 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ KLINGER +++$+++ We still gotta run the drill before we walk in that lobby.
L123806 +++$+++ u4392 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ KLINGER +++$+++ <u>You're</u> doing all the talk.
L123805 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ That's illegal.  You want us pulled over?  I'll turn around at the corner if you'll shut the fuck up.
L123804 +++$+++ u4392 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ KLINGER +++$+++ Make a "U" and go back.
L123803 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ And stop with the directions.
L123802 +++$+++ u4392 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ KLINGER +++$+++ Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
L123801 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ If you know that just back off.
L123800 +++$+++ u4392 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ KLINGER +++$+++ Just like they say; no fucking self control.
L123799 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I don't like anybody laying their hands on me.
L123779 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ That's what I deserve for listening in the first place.
L123778 +++$+++ u4392 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ KLINGER +++$+++ Just hand up on the bitch!  Fuck you, madam.  And goodbye!
L123771 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Will you relax?  This in no way affects our business.  Go on.
L123770 +++$+++ u4392 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ KLINGER +++$+++ What do you mean tip the cops?  Is the man a lunatic or what?
L123749 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Wait!  I hear her breathing now. There, she just picked it up again.
L123748 +++$+++ u4392 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ KLINGER +++$+++ That's your "rep."

L123746 +++$+++ u4392 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ KLINGER +++$+++ That was definitely out of line and totally unprovoked.  I heard you were a hitter.

L123738 +++$+++ u4392 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ KLINGER +++$+++ We have never worked a gig together but I am a firm believer in preparation.  So let's go over this again step by step.

L124503 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ We've had our share of fuck-ups but it's going to work out fine.
L124502 +++$+++ u4396 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ NELSON +++$+++ I was worried about you.  Both of you.
L124501 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Any minute.
L124500 +++$+++ u4396 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ NELSON +++$+++ I'm still in my cab -- jammed up in traffic.  Are you there yet?
L124499 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Nels?
L124374 +++$+++ u4396 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ NELSON +++$+++ There's a taxi stand here.  I can meet you.
L124373 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ He took it like a man.  Toss him in that drainage ditch.

L124369 +++$+++ u4396 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ NELSON +++$+++ Don't fuck around.  Pop a cap in him.

L124273 +++$+++ u4396 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ NELSON +++$+++ What am I supposed to do?
L124272 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ Nels, don't let that cop pass you.
L124219 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ I'm doing fine.  Theo wants to deal.
L124218 +++$+++ u4396 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ NELSON +++$+++ I thought you said you could handle him.
L124525 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ I told you ... sooner or later you'd have to trust me ...
L124524 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Sure, like I'm gonna take advice from you.
L124523 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ My fence in San Francisco ... 305-4410.  Maurice.  Don't take less than a third on the face value of those bonds.

L124521 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ I've got ... one last number for you, Theo ...
L124519 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ -- The phones, Theo.  Don't leave any of them behind.  The cops could pull up a record of all our calls and -- find you.
L124518 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.
L124517 +++$+++ u4393 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ LENORE +++$+++ I picked the wrong number when I chose you ... didn't I?
L124427 +++$+++ u4398 +++$+++ m291 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Toss them -- one at a time.  I don't want to lose count.
