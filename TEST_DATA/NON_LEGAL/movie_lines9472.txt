L611719 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ -- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --
L611718 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van --
L611717 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ When did we get that?
L611716 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Genetic ditto on evidence found at the site with evidence you found in his belongings. An incontrovertible motive. And definite footprints on Jimmy Looks Twice at Maisy Blue Legs house.
L611706 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Whoever dusted Leo, dusted him from the driver's seat of a moving car then drove those eight miles to the Badlands. Jimmy Looks Twice has never been behind the wheel of a car. It's a known fact out here that he's petrified of driving. His parents were killed in a car wreck.
L611705 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ The right man? Talk to me, Ray.
L611644 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ A long way from home. You be careful out there.
L611643 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Cooch.  Where the fuck did they send us?
L611641 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Jesus, I don't know. You tell me. You're the Indian.
L611640 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
L611639 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Her oil pan is shot.
L611638 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Her own people start to suspect her, it creates discord from within. The Warriors don't know who to trust, they start infighting, and Jimmy loses his support.
L611637 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?
L611636 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ That's good goddamn work, Ray. Let the salmon run. Let 'em run Upriver.
L611631 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I gave it back to her.
L611630 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Let's see it.
L611629 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ She took something from the house. What she called a medicine bundle. Most likely Jimmy's.
L611628 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ She talks a lot of shit. We're not doing our job. Jimmy's innocent. "What's the FBI really doing here." Some shit about the Fort Laramie Treaty.
L611627 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ What'd she say?
L611509 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Alright. Alright.
L611508 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Easy, Cowboy. No vendettas on my ship. Now: remember what I told you about Nam? Watch the grass, watch the trees, watch the shit house, be on your toes, and if we get committed, don't hesitate to empty that sucker.
L611507 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I'd just like five minutes alone with the motherfucker who hung that flag upside down.
L611506 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Jimmy Looks Twice put Leo's head through a glass door of the tribal offices three months ago. And threatened him several times since. President Clear Moon and the regional FBI feel he made good on that threat.
L611505 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ They obviously wanted it to be known that they offed Leo. Some kind of statement.
L611504 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ That's right.
L611503 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ White eagle feather through the circle. That's their symbol.
L611501 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ One of the leaders of the Warriors of All Red Nations. Militant organization.
L611500 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Who is he?
L611498 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Cooch. You're my hero.
L611497 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Meet me at base. Over.
L611496 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ I've got the doer. I know who he is.
L611495 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Go ahead.
L611494 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ I got one up on ya.
L611493 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ How'd you know?
L611492 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Maisy Blue Legs place?
L611445 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Good.
L611444 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Couldn't sleep.
L611443 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I already did.
L611442 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Get the plate numbers off everyone of these cars.
L611441 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Water. Worth killing for out here, I'd think.
L611405 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Ray Levoi, Sir. Pleasure.
L611404 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ No. That's Ray here. Ray...
L611398 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Beats the hell outta me.
L611397 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Keeping of the souls. Do they still burn their dead or something?
L611390 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ I think Leo's retired from quillwork for the moment.
L611389 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Leo's gonna need his hands, Cooch. He does quillwork.
L611381 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ We'll have to give Leo a refund. Because he's gotta go to the M.E. In case you don't know, Officer, violation of the Major Crimes Act on --
L611380 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Leo has to take the journey, Cooch.
L611372 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ -- a fucking cop.
L611371 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Who the fuck is he?
L611370 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I did.
L611362 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Check him out, Ray.
L611361 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ This is a restricted area.
L611357 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Ray.
L611356 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Somebody was serious about doing this guy, that's for sure.
L611355 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ That's what it looks like, doesn't it? But that's what a ten gauge, choke-bored, shotgun will look like when it hits your lower back from five feet away.
L611354 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Six rounds. 357.
L611345 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ No. I consulted it. We're going into Indian Country, I wanna know what kind of individual is covering my ass. Don't you?
L611344 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You crashed my file?
L611343 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Hey, hey, hey. J. Edgar would've loved you. He'd love anybody who joined the bureau to, what was it? "To enforce the laws of my country and protect her interests"?
L611341 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Airborne. That's where they used to get us agents from. Now we get 'em from Carnegie-Melon, Ivy League. Accountants and computer whiz-kids. Yuppies with guns.  That's scary shit.
L611340 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Were you in Nam?
L611339 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ The agents who have worked out here say its like going into Nam. Unfamiliar terrain, foreign language, foreign customs... and you never know when you might walk into a few rounds. They hold a lot of old anger for the white man out here.
L611338 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Jesus...
L611337 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Those are two agents who went into a reservation a few years ago to serve a warrant. They were executed at close range. That one there is a police officer killed by the Mohawks up in Canada more recently.
L611334 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Seven.
L611333 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I didn't know him, Sir. He passed away when I was six.
L611321 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ No, Ray. You're gonna have to blame that on your grandmother.
L611320 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ South Dakota...  Did I do something unsatisfactory, Sir?
L612020 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ If you ever need a place to come back to and listen to the trees a little... we'll be here.
L612019 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You take care.
L612017 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ You didn't have another vision...
L612016 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I'll have to see what the visions say about that one.
L612013 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Some Indian time?
L612012 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ You bought her some time, Kola. Ain't never gonna be over... but you bought her some time.
L612011 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What about the water...
L611999 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ We're in there. We're in there --
L611998 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ That's it. The Stronghold. Get us in there, we got a chance.
L611989 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ We're going for The Stronghold.
L611988 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ They got us sealed. What are we gonna do?
L611984 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ He hasn't left this place in twenty years. They got him.
L611983 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ He's gone.
L611980 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Bullshit, let's get outta here,
L611979 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die.
L611978 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I know. Come on. We gotta get off the reservation or we're dead.
L611977 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Ain't no Council Fire, Brother. Clear Moon...
L611949 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Ray.
L611948 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You go to the council fire. I'm going back in.
L611947 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Ray. Ray, don't let go now, Man. Ray...
L611940 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ He's looking at a few hundred years in Leavenworth. He's not gonna come out without a fight.
L611939 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ I thought it was a rare case of a brother getting a break in the courts. We did an honorin' song for him and everything.
L611938 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What we need... is Richard Yellow Bird.
L611937 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Alright. Shit's comin' down. He's callin' council fire. All the old chiefs and the warriors, too. I gotta be at Grandpa's place in two hours. We need to get the tribe together. We need to block this thing.
L611936 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Yeah. It's time to beat the drum. You better wait here. He don't trust the white man.
L611935 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ This Clear Moon's house?
L611932 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Listen to the water... the river keeps goin' down then rising again.
L611931 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ So they took care of Leo.
L611930 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Leo knew about it. Tried to tell Jimmy, get the Warriors involved.
L611929 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ We're standin' on broken treaty ground, Ray. This ain't supposed to be here. It'll poison the water.
L611928 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ That's what we're doing here. National interest. National security. Only this time it's not gold. It's uranium.
L611927 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ What?
L611926 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ 1868...
L611925 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Uranium. Test holes. Somebody came in from the Nebraska side, and did some shotgun testin'. They're gettin' ready to suck this baby dry.
L611924 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Jesus. Oil?
L611923 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Ain't prayer flags, that's for sure.
L611922 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What's that?
L611921 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Stop.

L611919 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Bullshit. You had a vision. You got sign from the old ones.

L611917 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Maybe it was just a dream. Ya know, just one of them, what do ya call 'em, fitful dreams?
L611916 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ We've driven a long way. Where is this place?

L611913 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ You had a vision. You had yourself a vision. A man waits a long time for a vision. Might go his whole lifetime and never get one. And along comes some instant Indian with a Mastercard and brand-new shoes, has himself a vision.
L611912 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Nothin'. Forget it.
L611911 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What do you mean?

L611908 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ You were running with the old ones. At The Knee. Heavy duty.
L611907 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ At Wounded Knee. I mean, that's where I was, and that's where the dream was. Why?
L611906 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Where was this?
L611905 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Just before we caught Jimmy... I had a dream that I was being chased. And I was running with other people. Old- fashion Indian people. I got shot in the back. Like Leo.
L611904 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Oh yeah. Dreams. Sometimes durin' sickness. Vision quest. Sweat Lodge. Ya never know when.

L611901 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ No. So we can do what the old man said. Red Deer Table, Walter. We have to go.

L611763 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ I can't, Hoss. I don't talk to FBI's.

L611760 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Yeah. Jimmy's prints are there. But they cross over Benjamin Black Star's prints. And he wasn't there until six o'clock the mornin' after to get eggs from the chickens. So Jimmy wasn't there til the next day. Follow?
L611759 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ They found prints at Blue Legs' place.

L611750 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ You're right about the old man. His power's long dried up. He's supposed to be a medicine man but he won't go see the people. He says we changed, and we don't listen. Well, he don't go out and talk no more. I haven't had a drink in three years but I just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar, and this Hoss is gettin' watered.
L611749 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?

That one, single, print he left in the Badlands -- the one the FBI missed and then stepped all over -- it belongs to a man who walks heels first. Like a white man. Jimmy has a serious Ind'n walk -- ball of the foot first. The man who murdered Leo walked like a Wasi'cu.
L611658 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ That's not solid.
L611657 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ The connection is, it did a head number on him. He's petrified of cars. Won't drive. I've known him all my life, and he's never gotten behind the wheel of a vehicle. He rides passenger and he rides horses, and that's it. The man that shot Leo down was behind the wheel of a moving car.
L611656 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I don't see the connection.
L611655 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Was-te. 'Cept for one thing. Jimmy Looks Twice was nowhere near there. Ya see, when Jimmy was twelve years old, his mother and father was killed in a car wreck right down there near Elk Mountain.
L611654 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ -- Leo Fast Elk was sitting in the outhouse at Maisy Blue Legs when a car pulled into the yard. He came out, approached the vehicle then saw that the man behind the wheel was Jimmy. He tried to get back into the trailer, but the car came highballing at him. He started running for the open grass. With the car moving, Jimmy hung his shotgun out the window, took aim -- missed once, hitting the shitter -- fired again, and severed Leo's spine. Leo fell, rolled, and came to a stop in the grass. And some chicken feed. Stale chicken feed with four days mold.  Electromagnetic printing.
L611653 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ So did this one. Wambli is a rare and sacred creature. When someone finds a dead one, the feathers get around the res. We share everything. A lot of power in the eagle feathers. But you think that's bullshit too, don't --
L611650 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ She's your sister?
L611649 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Jimmy didn't do it, Ray. I checked it out. You can stop taggin' my sister.
L611647 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I see. Forgive my cultural ignorance.
L611646 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Don't be mad. That was just an old traditional gesture that means hello, how are you.
L611578 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Go back to your DNA finger-printin'.
L611577 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Listen to the water. Listen to the owl. He also said, don't trust the fucking Cookie Monster.
L611576 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ He also said "listen to the water."
L611575 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ The owl told him about Leo. That's incredible. I guess we just broke the back of this investigation, didn't we? Evidence doesn't get any harder than that -- not for my money. Is there anyway we can seduce this owl into Federal Court?
L611574 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ The owl is a messenger. When one shows itself to a Sioux... it means someone's gonna die. The owl told him about Leo.
L611573 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ So what?
L611572 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ He saw an owl.
L611571 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ And...
L611570 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ The old man saw an owl. Over there in the dry wash. Last week.
L611568 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Because he was talking to me.
L611567 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Why should I tell you.
L611566 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What was he saying?
L611564 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ He just did the Gettysburg Address in Sioux. What did he say?
L611563 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ He said he doesn't know.
L611562 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What did he say?
L611556 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Sacred herbs. Tobacco. Don't worry, we don't smoke no Mexican agriculture in The Pipe. That's a white man's myth. This is a sacrament.
L611555 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What's he smoke in that?
L611552 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ He says he saw you in a vision some time ago.
