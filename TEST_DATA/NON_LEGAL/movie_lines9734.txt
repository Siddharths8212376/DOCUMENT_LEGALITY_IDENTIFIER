L151683 +++$+++ u4730 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You have some weird friends. What does her thinking she's a werewolf have to do with us having the cat?
L151682 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ It's so bad she becomes a werewolf.
L151681 +++$+++ u4730 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'm supposed to put up with a fuckin' cat I'm allergic to cause your friend's got PMS?
L151626 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Tell her I'm eating.
L151625 +++$+++ u4730 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ It's for you. Frida.
L151617 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ So now being with Frida is lucky? I thought you said she was a flake.
L151616 +++$+++ u4730 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Carlton insisted on leaving with her. Maybe he got lucky.
L151615 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I wonder how Frida and Carlton are getting along?
L151563 +++$+++ u4730 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ She'll talk about PMS and stare at her salad.
L151562 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ She's just insecure. Once you get to know her she's fabulous.
L151561 +++$+++ u4730 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ She's just so... pathetic.
L151560 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Come on, I've been working with Frida. Carlton won't even recognize her now. She's really coming out of her shell.
L151205 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Yeah and when we're mad at each other we're out of sync. It only works if you're on good terms.
L151204 +++$+++ u4730 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ He was saying that when women are close friends they get their periods at the same time.
L151171 +++$+++ u4730 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Two bags for them, and one bag for your head in case her two fall off.
L151170 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ So I asked the bartender what "coyote ugly" meant. It's like the "bagger" system. You know, a two- bagger -- someone so ugly that you need two bags -- one bag to put on their head and another one in case it blows off. Or a three-bagger...
L151838 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ He's been running money for the Mafia.
L151837 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ See he was cheating from the get go.
L151817 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I don't know, I guess the outfits are cool. And I want a big gun.
L151816 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Why would you want to be a cop?
L151815 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I was thinking about becoming a cop myself. Do you take a test or something or just sign up?
L151386 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ We can just take this pillowcase.
L151385 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ You want her sheets?
L151381 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ We're just trying to figure out what happened.
L151380 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ How the hell is that your business?
L151371 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yeah, sorry. Uh... Gregory's roommate told us you were out with him last night.
L151370 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Jesus Christ she got her period. Relax guys. It happens.
L152002 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Can't figure out the species. Similar to a wolf. They're jokin' at the lab that a werewolf probably killed him. Ain't that the stupidest thing you ever heard?
L152001 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What kind of animal?
L152000 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
L151999 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Did we get those DNA tests back?
L151998 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ And that was 28 days ago today.
L151997 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ So... they're on some cycle. The murders... Gregory... then 28 days later... Carlton.
L151996 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ She says she's on the rag every time I get called in to investigate a murder.
L151995 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What makes her think that?
L151994 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ My girlfriend's predicting another murder in the next few days.
L151924 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Which brings up an interesting point. I wasn't following you. I was following the suspect. And you just happened to be there...
L151923 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
L151922 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...
L151921 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L151920 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ And fifth, you're dating her.
L151919 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third, she's the one in danger. She's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her. Fourth, I look in her eyes and know she's no killer.
L151918 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
L151917 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
L151916 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ You think mafia hit?
L151860 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Like a vampire or some shit?
L151859 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ It's like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes.
L151858 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ It's a bit farfetched that Mark would rip guys to shreds just outta jealousy. This makes no sense.
L151857 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Spencer's the key here. Frida is in no way associated with him. And her blood hasn't matched with any of the killings.
L151842 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ One of our only leads... You had dates with both men right before they were killed.
L151841 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Seems he's stolen money from them. He's desperate and our only lead.
L151828 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ This one walk you home too?
L151827 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ He means the last that we know of.
L151797 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ She wasn't the last one to see them alive. Whoever killed them was.
L151796 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Yeah okay. I still say Frida's involved. She's the last one to see two dudes alive...
L151795 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.
L151794 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. And his eyes were open. That always bugs me out. Do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes.
L151793 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ The park dude was missing an arm.
L151792 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Nah, East Village poseur was grosser than the dude in the park.
L151726 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You take the cake Lloyd. Come on, she's not here. Let's check out her psycho ex.
L151725 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Sounds like you got a conflict of interest.
L151724 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ She's not a suspect. What is her motive? There's nothing, NOTHING connecting her to either crime except that she dated both guys.
L151723 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ She's got a hidden pitbull. Maybe she hired someone to kill them.
L151722 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Okay Lloyd, you tell me how she killed them.
L151721 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ This is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead.
L151720 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ We only live a few blocks apart.
L151719 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I still don't get when you gave her back the pillowcase.
L151697 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ And he was missing an arm.
L151696 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ He was found nearly ripped to shreds in Central Park.
L151455 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ And you think I'm sick?
L151454 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What?
L151453 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Hairy women are kind of sexy. Women in their natural state.
L151452 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Back in the '80's. You didn't see the pictures? They were from before she got famous. She was hairy as hell. Her pits, her bush.
L151451 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Madonna's in Penthouse?
L151450 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than Madonna in Penthouse.
L151449 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Maybe. What about all those hairs they found on his body?
L151448 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I checked all the zoos. No missing animals. You think a pitbull?
L151447 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.
L151446 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Hey, there was a lot of blood.
L151445 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I told you she was innocent.
L151444 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Frida's sheets checked out fine. It was just her own blood. From her... you know.
L151427 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Nah, man, I'm just saying, you should never date a woman who was the last one to see a guy alive.
L151426 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I can tell she's not a killer. You just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.
L151425 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ No man. Blood is not a turn on. You sure let that Frida off the hook. You weren't even going to take the sheets. If I didn't know better, I'd think you liked her.
L151424 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Oh, so you decide to be a cop? Seriously? You don't have sex with a woman cause she's on the rag?
L151423 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Hell no, I'm not into that shit. The sight of blood makes me sick.
L151422 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?
L151421 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I didn't trust her. All that blood on the sheets. She may look sweet, but she could be a wolf in sheep's clothing. Something's weird.
L151368 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Torn apart. Limb from limb. A bloody gruesome mess.
L151367 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ He was found a few blocks away.
L151281 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Hey, you hear about the chick that came in today? Said some chick bit her at Victoria's Secret. Bitches are outta control these days.
L151280 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You're some catch Lloyd.
L151279 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ You kiddin'? They try to get ME drunk.
L151278 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Man, you're livin' dangerously. Let me ask you somethin', you always have to get women drunk before they'll sleep with you?
L151277 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Nah, I don't wanna break up with Wanda, I just wanna see Carmen too.
L153146 +++$+++ u4739 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BARBER +++$+++ Yeah, Iím like that.  Senility says the wife.  But she sure canít complain.  Heh.  The erector set still works good.  And this ainít no fucking rug! Gíhead.  Feel it!  All mine!
L153145 +++$+++ u4749 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ WHITE +++$+++ Not really...
L153144 +++$+++ u4739 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BARBER +++$+++ Mnunn.  Cold lately.  That night, couple weeks ago.  That was <u>real</u> cold.  Remember that?
L153141 +++$+++ u4739 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BARBER +++$+++ Nope.  No maps.  Ocean, huh?  On vacation?
L153140 +++$+++ u4749 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ WHITE +++$+++ The city.  I need to get to the ocean.
L153139 +++$+++ u4739 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BARBER +++$+++ What of?
L153138 +++$+++ u4749 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ WHITE +++$+++ Sell maps?
L153135 +++$+++ u4739 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BARBER +++$+++ Only two bucks.  Shave as well...
L153134 +++$+++ u4749 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ WHITE +++$+++ Thanks.  Just some pills.
L153133 +++$+++ u4739 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BARBER +++$+++ Looks like you need a haircut to me.
L153132 +++$+++ u4749 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ WHITE +++$+++ I need something to keep me awake.
L153400 +++$+++ u4741 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ COP +++$+++ Well, sir...  I don't know exactly.
L153399 +++$+++ u4740 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BUMSTEAD +++$+++ How will we interrogate them?
L153398 +++$+++ u4741 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ COP +++$+++ They don't speak English...
L153393 +++$+++ u4741 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ COP +++$+++ No one available.
L153392 +++$+++ u4740 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BUMSTEAD +++$+++ Jesus.  Small world.  Where's the photographer?
L153391 +++$+++ u4741 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ COP +++$+++ His wife.
L153390 +++$+++ u4740 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BUMSTEAD +++$+++ The other one?
L153389 +++$+++ u4741 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ COP +++$+++ All the same entry wounds.  It's definitely him.  She lives...  lived here.  A prostitute.
L153293 +++$+++ u4740 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BUMSTEAD +++$+++ I <u>know</u> it's his doctor...  I need the file on..  Daniel Paul Schreber M.D.
L153292 +++$+++ u4741 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ COP +++$+++ Says he is the man's doctor...  You know...
L153291 +++$+++ u4740 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BUMSTEAD +++$+++ What's he doing here?
L153174 +++$+++ u4740 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BUMSTEAD +++$+++ Spinning backwards?
L153173 +++$+++ u4741 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ COP +++$+++ Maybe ten minutes...  Thatís strange.
L153172 +++$+++ u4740 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BUMSTEAD +++$+++ How long have you been here?
L153488 +++$+++ u4746 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ SCHREBER +++$+++ I'm afraid so.
L153487 +++$+++ u4740 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BUMSTEAD +++$+++ Was that for real down there?
L153467 +++$+++ u4746 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ SCHREBER +++$+++ You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector.  Have patience  - you'll see for yourself.
L153466 +++$+++ u4740 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BUMSTEAD +++$+++ What is this place?
L153465 +++$+++ u4740 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BUMSTEAD +++$+++ Just like that?
L153464 +++$+++ u4746 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ SCHREBER +++$+++ In there.
L153463 +++$+++ u4740 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BUMSTEAD +++$+++ I think it's time you introduced us to your little friends.
L153462 +++$+++ u4746 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ SCHREBER +++$+++ Please, they'll kill me...
L153459 +++$+++ u4746 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ SCHREBER +++$+++ You are mistaken.
L153458 +++$+++ u4740 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BUMSTEAD +++$+++ That's surprising.  He was leaving your office at the time...
L153457 +++$+++ u4746 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ SCHREBER +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about.
L153456 +++$+++ u4740 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BUMSTEAD +++$+++ I met a friend of yours the other night, doctor.  Tall fellow.  No hair.  Rather pale skin...
L153322 +++$+++ u4746 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ SCHREBER +++$+++ Loose ends?
L153321 +++$+++ u4740 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BUMSTEAD +++$+++ To tell you the truth, I'm glad we've run into each other like this.  Maybe you can help me tidy some loose ends.
L153320 +++$+++ u4746 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ SCHREBER +++$+++ Yes, of course.  Everything's fine...
L153319 +++$+++ u4740 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BUMSTEAD +++$+++ You seem a little edgy.  Everything okay?
L153318 +++$+++ u4746 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ SCHREBER +++$+++ He's seriously disturbed...
L153317 +++$+++ u4740 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BUMSTEAD +++$+++ Really?  And how is his state of mind?
L153316 +++$+++ u4746 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ SCHREBER +++$+++ Just visiting my patient.
L153315 +++$+++ u4740 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BUMSTEAD +++$+++ Doctor!  What brings you here?
L153255 +++$+++ u4740 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BUMSTEAD +++$+++ Shut up!  Everybody stay calm...
L153254 +++$+++ u4746 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ SCHREBER +++$+++ He tried to kill me!
L153253 +++$+++ u4740 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BUMSTEAD +++$+++ Police.  Nobody move.
L153340 +++$+++ u4740 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BUMSTEAD +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L153339 +++$+++ u4747 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ STROMBOLI +++$+++ Bumstead, you're starting to annoy me.  This case is very important to me.  Just a little warning:  I've got my eye on you inspector, remember that.
L153335 +++$+++ u4747 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ STROMBOLI +++$+++ How could you have been so stupid?
L153334 +++$+++ u4740 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BUMSTEAD +++$+++ Yes, sir.  I'm sorry...  But I don't understand how it was possible.  The only window was twenty feet up a vertical wall, he was cuffed...
L153329 +++$+++ u4740 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BUMSTEAD +++$+++ I see...
L153328 +++$+++ u4747 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ STROMBOLI +++$+++ Yes.  That's right.  He's ill  -  he needs expert help.
L153131 +++$+++ u4747 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ STROMBOLI +++$+++ What makes you think that!  If you would learn to concentrate on facts, not get so side-tracked  -  you might get things done faster, Bumstead...
L153130 +++$+++ u4740 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BUMSTEAD +++$+++ Lost something?
L153129 +++$+++ u4740 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BUMSTEAD +++$+++ Actually, I was wondering, sir, if you could let me have a few uniforms, to follow up for me...
L153128 +++$+++ u4747 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ STROMBOLI +++$+++ Iíll be the judge of that.  Anything else?
L153127 +++$+++ u4740 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BUMSTEAD +++$+++ Itís extremely important to my investigation...
L153126 +++$+++ u4740 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BUMSTEAD +++$+++ A hunch.  He might be able to...
L153125 +++$+++ u4747 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ STROMBOLI +++$+++ Why do you want to speak to him?
L153072 +++$+++ u4740 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BUMSTEAD +++$+++ Sheís getting better, thanks.  She...
L153071 +++$+++ u4747 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ STROMBOLI +++$+++ Thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing.  Anyway he isnít with us any longer.  The case is yours.  Go through his files. Take what you need.  By the way, howís your mother?
L153070 +++$+++ u4740 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BUMSTEAD +++$+++ What about Thompson, sir?  Wasnít this his case?
L153068 +++$+++ u4747 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ STROMBOLI +++$+++ I see.  One thingís for sure, heís ambitious. Youíll be a busy man from now on.
L153067 +++$+++ u4740 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BUMSTEAD +++$+++ Germs, sir.  These places are full of them.
L153066 +++$+++ u4747 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ STROMBOLI +++$+++ Why are you wearing that thing on your face?
L153062 +++$+++ u4747 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ STROMBOLI +++$+++ Yes.  This way.
L153061 +++$+++ u4740 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BUMSTEAD +++$+++ Good evening, sir.
L153417 +++$+++ u4740 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BUMSTEAD +++$+++ All the important stuff.  Wrap it up for me.
L153416 +++$+++ u4743 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ MISS CRENSHAW +++$+++ Yes, sir.  <u>Everything</u>?
L153415 +++$+++ u4740 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BUMSTEAD +++$+++ I need everything on the Jonathan White case.
L153413 +++$+++ u4740 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BUMSTEAD +++$+++ Put it through...
L153412 +++$+++ u4743 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ MISS CRENSHAW +++$+++ Won't say.  Says he must talk to you.

L153118 +++$+++ u4743 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ MISS CRENSHAW +++$+++ Why, yes.
L153117 +++$+++ u4740 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BUMSTEAD +++$+++ Do you wash your hands before you type things?
L153116 +++$+++ u4743 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ MISS CRENSHAW +++$+++ Iím sorry...

L153112 +++$+++ u4740 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BUMSTEAD +++$+++ Wrong?  Look at this!
L153111 +++$+++ u4743 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ MISS CRENSHAW +++$+++ Yes, sir.  Anything wrong?
L153110 +++$+++ u4740 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BUMSTEAD +++$+++ You typed this report?

L153094 +++$+++ u4743 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ MISS CRENSHAW +++$+++ Iíve taken the liberty and had Inspector Thompsonís office searched, as I believe you instructed.  All clear now, sir.  They found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories... Poor man.
L153093 +++$+++ u4743 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ MISS CRENSHAW +++$+++ The Chief-Inspector thought you might need a hand.
L153092 +++$+++ u4740 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BUMSTEAD +++$+++ I didnít requisition a secretary.
L153091 +++$+++ u4743 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ MISS CRENSHAW +++$+++ Iím your new assistant.

L153087 +++$+++ u4740 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BUMSTEAD +++$+++ Dammit!
L153492 +++$+++ u4740 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BUMSTEAD +++$+++ This ocean business...  I know where I can find a map.  I need to go back to the station.  Where will you be?
L153491 +++$+++ u4749 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ WHITE +++$+++ What now?
L153472 +++$+++ u4740 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BUMSTEAD +++$+++ It sure isn't the fun-fair.
L153471 +++$+++ u4749 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ WHITE +++$+++ Where do you think this goes?
L153454 +++$+++ u4740 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BUMSTEAD +++$+++ Why, that's ridiculous.  You just...
L153453 +++$+++ u4749 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ WHITE +++$+++ Well.  The only thing I've been certain of, all this time, is that I need to get to the ocean.  The point is no one seems to know how to get there.
L153452 +++$+++ u4740 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BUMSTEAD +++$+++ Go on.
L153449 +++$+++ u4740 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ BUMSTEAD +++$+++ That's right.  Just seamless flesh across the front of their heads.  No mistake.  I just hadn't remembered it that way.  Up until then they had been normal little girls in my memory.  That's not all.  Once I started examining them, all sorts of things about my life, had... inconsistencies.  It was like a game. I would think about a person or a place, or an event.  Then I would turn the lights off.  Sit down in a comfortable chair...  And study each detail of this subject.
L153448 +++$+++ u4749 +++$+++ m315 +++$+++ WHITE +++$+++ What?
