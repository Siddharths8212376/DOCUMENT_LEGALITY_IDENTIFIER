L651524 +++$+++ u3470 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ I'm pissin' fire man.
L651523 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ We all have problems.
L651522 +++$+++ u3470 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ Listen man, I think I have a problem.
L651213 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Well, and it's pretty cool too, ya know?  Bein' here together an all...
L651212 +++$+++ u3470 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ Sorry to here it.
L650797 +++$+++ u3463 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ MIDDY +++$+++ I know you will.
L650796 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Goodbye Mom.  I'll be okay.
L650795 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Look, I just better go.
L650794 +++$+++ u3463 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ MIDDY +++$+++ Passport?
L650793 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Yes.
L650792 +++$+++ u3463 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ MIDDY +++$+++ Do you have your ticket?
L650788 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Me too.
L650787 +++$+++ u3463 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ MIDDY +++$+++ It says she was originally Schooner rigged, but Captain Sheldrake turned her into a brigantine.  I think square rigs look so much more romantic.
L650786 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ No, I didn't.
L650785 +++$+++ u3463 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ MIDDY +++$+++ Honey, did you know that the Albatross was captured by the Germans during World War II?
L651474 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ What are you talking about.
L651473 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I can't go in there.
L651337 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I can't make it out?
L651336 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ What are they doing?
L651237 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I couldn't.
L651236 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Jesus, you never told them?
L651235 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ My brother.  He fell out of the old beech tree.  Broke his neck.  I was on a camp out.  They started going at it, throwin' things, a real knock down...  They didn't find him 'till the next morning.  They didn't even know why he was up there.
L651234 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Who?
L651233 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ That's how he died you know.
L651231 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Swear to God.  Only good advice he ever gave me.  Now, go back to sleep.
L651230 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ It works?
L651229 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ My dad.
L651228 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Who told you that?
L651227 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Here's the thing; whenever you're having a nightmare, all you have to do is say 1-2-3 wake up!  You'll be out of it.  You'll wake up.
L651226 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ It was so real...
L651211 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Kennet Square, PA.  'Mushroom capital of the world'.
L651210 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Depths of hell... Ohio.  How 'bout you?
L651209 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Where are you from any way?
L651191 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ 'Cause they're getting a divorce.  That's why they sent me here.  My sister's at Tabor.  They just wanted us out of the house so they could get down to business.
L651190 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ How do you know?  They might.
L651189 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ My parents don't do it anymore.
L651186 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ I said "Sorry, wrong room" and walked away.
L651185 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ What'd you do?
L651184 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ My mother says in this really low, but very awake kind of voice "What?"
L651183 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ So... What happened?
L651177 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Come on man, what'd they look like?
L651176 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ No way!
L651168 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ That's like wondering if your mom and dad do it.  Who wants to know?
L651167 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Ya know... "It".
L651166 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Do what?
L651165 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ You think Skipper and Alice do it?
L651067 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ It doesn't matter.  Really.  I'm just sorry you got chewed out.
L651066 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I'm sorry I left you hanging up there.
L651065 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ I'm used to spending a lot of time alone.  I guess that's what I thought it would be out here.  But, it's not is it?
L651064 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Forget it.
L651063 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ I feel like I got you into this.
L651062 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ I just brought you something to eat.
L651061 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Look, I appreciate, you know, the concern and all, but like he said, I can take care of myself.
L651060 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Good.
L651059 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Fine.
L651058 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ How ya doing?
L650879 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I can't watch this.
L650878 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Jesus.
L650860 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Maybe it's an air raid.
L650859 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ What the hell is going on?
L651497 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ You should tell him.  That's something he can take with him.
L651496 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ I don't know.
L651495 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Does Phil know how you guys feel?
L651492 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ They send us because they want us to change, or grow up or something and then they try to keep us the same.
L651491 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ They have every right Chuck.
L651490 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ I mean he has all these expectations and he doesn't even know who his own kid is.  What right did then have to show up here?
L651489 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ It's his father sir.  He's suffocating him.  We've all seen it...
L651488 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Of a fight he can't win out here.
L651487 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Of what?
L651486 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ The Dolphin was a symptom.
L651485 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ He killed the dolphin.
L651484 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Why do you think I'm sending him home?
L651483 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Close the door.  Sit down.
L651482 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Sir...?
L651481 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Can't do it.
L651480 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ The fact is... We'd like you to give Phil another chance.
L651479 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Well, spit it out.
L651478 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ I'm here on behalf of the crew, sir.
L651477 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ What's on your mind?
L651088 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ You can't run from the wind son. You trim your sails, face the music and let the chips fall.  Bill, let's close her up, dog, tight.
L651087 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Shouldn't we turn away?
L651084 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Sometimes it gets exciting out here.
L651083 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Would you, um, say it's a big storm?
L651082 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Uh, huh.
L651045 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Face what?
L651044 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Remember something, sooner or later... we all have to face it.
L651009 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ It was my fault.  I slipped.
L651008 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ You all right?
L650973 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ All stop on the engine.
L650972 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L650969 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Unfurl the squares!
L650968 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Northeast sir!
L650967 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Speak up boy!
L650966 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Ah... Northeast... sir.
L650945 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Gentleman, when you hear an order, sing out.  I want to know that you've heard and understand.  Raise the mainsail.
L650944 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Yes sir.
L650943 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Hold her steady into the wind. Southwest by west.
L651558 +++$+++ u3457 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ That is unfortunate.  We'll have to take him with us.
L651557 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ He left his passport in Curacao. It's being mailed to Panama.
L651556 +++$+++ u3457 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ Stow away?
L651555 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Your cannons made a compelling argument.
L651554 +++$+++ u3457 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ But you invited is aboard.
L651553 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ So is violating international law.
L651552 +++$+++ u3457 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ COMMANDER +++$+++ Chicken is a fool's game captain.
L651813 +++$+++ u3470 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ No.
L651812 +++$+++ u3458 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ DOWNING +++$+++ So when the captain gave you an order contrary to your training, you thought he was making a mistake?
L651811 +++$+++ u3470 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ Let the blow drive the boat down wind.  Neutralize our canvas.
L651810 +++$+++ u3458 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ DOWNING +++$+++ Then what do you think he was trying to do.
L651809 +++$+++ u3470 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ No.
L651808 +++$+++ u3458 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ DOWNING +++$+++ Is that what you were trained to do?
L651807 +++$+++ u3470 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ Twice.
L651806 +++$+++ u3458 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ DOWNING +++$+++ But the Captain ordered you hard to starboard.
L651805 +++$+++ u3470 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ I thought we'd have a better chance if I headed into the wind so we could spill air from our sails.
L651804 +++$+++ u3458 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ DOWNING +++$+++ Why didn't you turn hard to port as the wind hit?
L651367 +++$+++ u3459 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ Well, we've come to give our boy a little break from the monotony.
L651366 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ What is it we can do for you today?
L651365 +++$+++ u3459 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ Well, you never can tell these days, can you?
L651364 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ And, of course, we are.
L651363 +++$+++ u3459 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ Well, we thought we'd drop in and see if you were all still in one piece.
L650936 +++$+++ u3459 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ He's a big boy.
L650935 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ We'll do our best.  You're welcome to say goodbye.
L650934 +++$+++ u3459 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ Take good care of my son.
L650933 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ It will be more than that, I can promise you.
L650932 +++$+++ u3459 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ I'll be frank with you.  This was his mother's idea.  A romp through the Caribbean on a sailboat sounds more like a vacation than an education if you ask me.
L650931 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Happily, it all worked out... This time.  Bill, take Philip below and help him find a bunk.
L650930 +++$+++ u3459 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ And I would have expected compensation for my time and expense coming all the way down here.
L650929 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ This is a working ship.  Promptness is not a luxury, it's a necessity, as is the work to maintain her.  Had we been ready, I can assure you we would have sailed.
L650928 +++$+++ u3459 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind.
L650927 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ As you can see, there's a lot to do.
L650926 +++$+++ u3459 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ Your cable said you wouldn't be putting out until mid-October.
L650923 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ I know.
L650922 +++$+++ u3459 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ I'm Francis Boutillier.  This is my son, Philip.
L650921 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Oh, on the contrary, the Albatross is considered a very good omen.  It is said they embody the spirits of sailors passed on.  It's very bad luck if you kill one.  And dolphins too.
L650920 +++$+++ u3459 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ Albatross?  Doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.
L651738 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ It's okay.  I'll be in, in a minute.  Look, what do you want?
L651737 +++$+++ u3459 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ Who is it Philip?
L651399 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ No.  Look, it's me okay?  Can't it just be about me?  For once?
L651398 +++$+++ u3459 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ Well, what does it have to do with? Us?
L651397 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ It has nothing to do with him.
L651396 +++$+++ u3459 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ Listen to me, you thankless little prick.  We're your parents, so don't you dare talk to me disrespectfully. What the hell is it, this captain? Because I'll see him in a rowboat...
L651394 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Look, you put me on this boat in the first place.  I didn't want to come but I did.  Why do you have to embarrass me.  Why can't you just leave me alone?
L651393 +++$+++ u3459 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ Oh, really?
L651392 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ I can take care of myself.
L651391 +++$+++ u3459 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ Spying?!
L651388 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Why are you here?
L651387 +++$+++ u3459 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ Humor me.  Eat it anyway.
L651386 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ I should be eating with the crew.
L651385 +++$+++ u3459 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ FRANCIS +++$+++ What's wrong, you don't like steak?
L651543 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Not a chance.  Remind them that according to the Geneva Convention, firing on a civilian vessel on the high sea is an act of war.
L651542 +++$+++ u3460 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ They think we're carrying Cuban refugees.  Skipper, they mean to board us.
L651534 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ She's Cuban.
L651533 +++$+++ u3460 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Jesus.  She's got guns.
L651273 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ They'll know about it in the morning.
L651272 +++$+++ u3460 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What's that?
L651271 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ They're in a hurry to grow up.  They don't know about consequences or responsibility.  That's being sixteen too.  I promise you one thing...
L651270 +++$+++ u3460 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ And being sixteen.
L651269 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Spirits have a way of bringing that out.
L651268 +++$+++ u3460 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Immortality.
L651252 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ A padlock.
L651251 +++$+++ u3460 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What's that?
L651250 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ I guess we know what the next acquisition for the galley is going to be...
L651245 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ We're short one long boat too.  Come on.
L651244 +++$+++ u3460 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Son-of-a-bitch.
L651243 +++$+++ u3460 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'm sorry, Skip.  It's this damned book.  Lawford gave it to me.
L651242 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ You're officer of the watch, George.
L651241 +++$+++ u3460 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What?!  What's happening?!!
L651053 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ You know the best thing about being a Skipper is the worst thing.  It's all my responsibility.  So I'll tell you what George, you stay off of my bridge, and I'll stay out of your galley.  We'll get along that way.
L651052 +++$+++ u3460 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yes sir.
L651051 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ I need to know what I'm working with; what their boundaries are. Their lives depend on it, and for that matter so does yours.  We've got to bring them together.  Make them a crew.  We're as strong as our weakest link and I don't want to find that out the hard way.  So, I will challenge them and they will come together.
L651050 +++$+++ u3460 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yes.  I do.
L651049 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ You do?
L651048 +++$+++ u3460 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I think you were too hard on Weathers.
L651432 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Lemme go!  Lemme go!!
L651431 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Jesus!  What the hell happened to him.
L651334 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Why would you do that?
L651333 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Me, too.
L651327 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ I can show you how to use a slide rule.
L651326 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Hell, they even kicked me outa vo- tech 'cause I couldn't read a slide rule.
L651293 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Oh, praise the lord.  Relax everybody.  Everything is under control.  The jug head's going to think of something.
L651292 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ We'll think of something.
L651291 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ How the hell are we gonna get outta here?
L651290 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ That's enough.
