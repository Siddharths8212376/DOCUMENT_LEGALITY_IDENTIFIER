L650995 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I'll read it.  I mean I don't mind.
L650905 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Come on, he didn't mean anything.
L650904 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Don't ever call me stupid.
L650899 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Well, as soon as you grow some balls, let me know.
L650898 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I couldn't do it.
L650897 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Because I felt like it.  What do you care?
L650896 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Why'd you jump?
L650895 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What's your problem?
L651438 +++$+++ u3462 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ LAWFORD +++$+++ Read on, young John.  Read on. College boards are coming.
L651437 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford.
L651436 +++$+++ u3462 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ LAWFORD +++$+++ The rust won't wait for you to read Conrad, Goodall.
L651005 +++$+++ u3462 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ LAWFORD +++$+++ If it were only that simple, my young friend.  Read on, gentlemen. Read on.
L651004 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What?
L651003 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What is it... the secret?
L651002 +++$+++ u3462 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ LAWFORD +++$+++ This isn't just a story!!  It's history made allegory.  It is a philosophical handbook for life!  It holds the secret of this very voyage.
L650998 +++$+++ u3462 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ LAWFORD +++$+++ You know what he is talking about here?
L650997 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Much have I traveled in realms of gold/ And many goodly states and kingdoms seen/ Round many western islands have I been/ Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold/ Oft of one wide expanse had I been told/ That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne.
L650992 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Look, save it for somebody else will ya.  This ancient shit doesn't have anything to do with me.
L650991 +++$+++ u3462 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ LAWFORD +++$+++ That's not a satisfactory answer.
L650870 +++$+++ u3462 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ LAWFORD +++$+++ You will if you wanna eat.  Right George?
L650869 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I don't.
L651560 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Nobody aboard my ship is going anywhere.
L651559 +++$+++ u3462 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ LAWFORD +++$+++ If he's a Cuban, Castro wears a dress.
L651551 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ No.  Bring him on deck with the others.
L651550 +++$+++ u3462 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ LAWFORD +++$+++ Terry left his passport in Curacao. We could hide him...
L651549 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ What's that?
L651548 +++$+++ u3462 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ LAWFORD +++$+++ We've got a problem.
L651086 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Barometer's dropping.  The first blow'll come from the south.  Might get interesting.
L651085 +++$+++ u3462 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ LAWFORD +++$+++ What do you think?
L650958 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Outer.
L650957 +++$+++ u3462 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ LAWFORD +++$+++ Tie it off!!
L650954 +++$+++ u3462 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ LAWFORD +++$+++ It seems we're short on singers.
L650953 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ What's wrong Mr. Lawford.
L650938 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ He didn't get to be Under Secretary of the Air Force by being neighborly.
L650937 +++$+++ u3462 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ LAWFORD +++$+++ Well, that was neighborly.
L651461 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ About anything.
L651460 +++$+++ u3465 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ About yourself?
L651459 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ It hurts too much to care.
L651458 +++$+++ u3465 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ You're the one who doesn't care, Phil.
L651442 +++$+++ u3465 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ No, Phil.  It's a mammal.
L651441 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Fuck off man.  It's just a fish.
L651340 +++$+++ u3465 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ What?
L651339 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ They're waving... handkerchiefs or something.
L651141 +++$+++ u3465 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ No self respecting shark is gonna take a bite out of you.
L651140 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ You gotta be kidding?  He's a human chum line!
L651434 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Son of a bitch!!
L651433 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I don't know.  We gotta get 'im outta here before Skipper sees him like this.
L651428 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Come on man.  Let's just talk about it.
L651427 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ It's outta here!
L651426 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Roger Meris, steps up, it's a corker down the pipe...
L651425 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ No way Phil.  Not like this.
L651424 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Fandango, Junior.  I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!
L651423 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Phil.  What are you doing?
L651350 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ There are some things that everybody does in the same language.
L651349 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ But, they don't speak English.
L651348 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ You've gotta be kidding?
L651347 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ What are we supposed to talk about?
L651329 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Long enough.
L651328 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ How long you been standing there?
L651449 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ You already have.  Now go on.  Do it.
L651448 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ I'm not gonna kill it.
L651220 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Each one of you will be responsible for one student.  I'll expect you to be courteous.  You represent this school and your country.  We'll sail in the morning.
L651219 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Joy, rapture...
L651218 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ I have arranged to host a good will cruise for the Dutch students of the local school there.
L651095 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ I'm not staying out here.
L651094 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Do me a favor and tell Bill once she's dogged down I want everyone to break out their slickers and make sure their gear is stowed or we'll spend the next week sorting underwear.  Lawford, Bill, Mike, John, and Phil will stand the watch.  Everyone else hit the racks.
L651043 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Excellent.  Bill, find Mr. Weathers a position to suit his condition.
L651042 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ No, sir.
L651022 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Then keep your mouth shut.
L651021 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ No.
L651020 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Do you have something to say?
L650984 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ The first thing is I don't like people talking when I'm talking so the two of you, shut up.
L650983 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Suicidal...
L650925 +++$+++ u3464 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Sir.
L650924 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ You're a day late.  We keep a schedule aboard ship.  Lives depend on it.  Hello, Philip.
L651036 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ No.  Hate the fear inside of you! Climb like a man mister!  Hate it! Hate it away.  Hate your way up one more rung!!  Do it right now!!
L651035 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I hate you, you son of a bitch!!!
L651034 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Are you hating this?!  Are you!
L651033 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Aaauuuhhh!!!
L651032 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ You climb damn it, or so help me I'll haul you to the foretop by your diaper and leave you there!
L651031 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I can't.
L651030 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Don't look down.  Look in my eyes! Climb!  We'll do it together.
L651028 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I don't know...
L651027 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ What are you blubbering about?
L651025 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Sorry won't cut it.
L651024 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I'm sorry...
L651023 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ What's it going to be?
L651019 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Up you go.  Right now.
L651018 +++$+++ u3466 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ What?
L651017 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Swing up, son.
L651792 +++$+++ u3467 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SANDERS +++$+++ Isn't also true that his vessel went down off of Nantucket?  Lost everyone on board.  In fair weather no less.
L651791 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Yes.
L651788 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ I don't think one second of this is funny, sir.
L651787 +++$+++ u3467 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SANDERS +++$+++ Do you think this is funny?  Some kind of joke?  You lost six people out there.
L651786 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Yes, that's true.
L651785 +++$+++ u3467 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SANDERS +++$+++ ... and that you invited him to strike you?  To fight it out on the deck of your ship?!
L651784 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ For killing a dolphin.
L651783 +++$+++ u3467 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SANDERS +++$+++ Is it true that the reason you expelled Philip Boutillier...
L651782 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ They are much more than that, sir.
L651781 +++$+++ u3467 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SANDERS +++$+++ Except, a "White Squall".  With all due respect Captain Sheldrake, they're only boys...
L651780 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ We'd come twelve thousand miles together, through every kind of seas imaginable...
L651779 +++$+++ u3467 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SANDERS +++$+++ You really felt that your crew were up for the conditions.
L651778 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ I can't be sure.
L651777 +++$+++ u3467 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SANDERS +++$+++ What makes you so sure it was one?
L651776 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ No.
L651771 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Yes, I was.
L651770 +++$+++ u3467 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SANDERS +++$+++ Sir, were you aware at any time of the use of alcohol among the crew.
L651767 +++$+++ u3467 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SANDERS +++$+++ Were you aware that his brother was killed in a fall.
L651766 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ He climbed when he was ready.
L651765 +++$+++ u3467 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SANDERS +++$+++ Is it true that you forced Robin Weathers to climb the mast when it was clear that he was acrophobic.
L651821 +++$+++ u3471 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ Then what are you trying to say then?
L651820 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ I don't know that anything could have prevented what happened.
L651819 +++$+++ u3471 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ If this young man had responded instantly to your command, do you believe the ship might have been spared?
L651773 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ No.  I didn't.
L651772 +++$+++ u3471 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ And you didn't do anything about it?
L651701 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ I am accountable.
L651700 +++$+++ u3471 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ The papers are going to eat you alive.  Even if you beat it, you'll never get another commission.  They want someone to be accountable.
L651699 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ ... Absolutely not.
L651698 +++$+++ u3471 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ The families... want your ticket. Turn it in, we forget the whole thing.  Everybody goes home.
L651696 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ The Coast Guard 'Eagle'.  She never lost a race while you were Skipper.
L651695 +++$+++ u3471 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ I used to helm a school ship.  A long time ago.
L651694 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ It wasn't hard.
L651693 +++$+++ u3471 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ How'd you manage to piss off a guy as powerful as Francis Boutillier?
L651692 +++$+++ u3471 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ May I ask you something?
L651691 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ I understand.
L651690 +++$+++ u3471 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ There are allegations questioning your competence with regard to the command of the Albatross.  I have been instructed to convene a formal tribunal to determine whether or not negligence played a part in the sinking.
L651714 +++$+++ u3469 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ That's not what Skipper thought.  He was trying to spill air from the main!
L651713 +++$+++ u3470 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ I was trying to get her up wind! That's what you do when you're hit a-beam.  Or maybe you're too stupid to know that!
L651712 +++$+++ u3469 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Everybody knows why she went over Tod.  You jibed the boat.
L651711 +++$+++ u3470 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ What's that supposed to mean?!
L651710 +++$+++ u3469 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Easy for you to say.
L651379 +++$+++ u3469 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Screw you, Valentino.  I haven't seen you swapping spit with anybody.
L651378 +++$+++ u3470 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ Don't mind him, Chucky.  You're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of Vaseline.
L651377 +++$+++ u3469 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Soon as we ship it'll be "forgetta".
L653397 +++$+++ u3473 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ ARTIE +++$+++ Thank you. It's listeners such as yourself who made me want to get up out of that hospital bed and back into the studio as fast as I could.
L653396 +++$+++ u3478 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ CALLER #1 +++$+++ Well, that's so good to hear, Artie. You know some of us depend on you down this way. You're so entertainin' and you get so many interestin' guests.
L653395 +++$+++ u3473 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ ARTIE +++$+++ I'm fine, thank you. I had a cardiac infarction but I'm on a new diet and exercising regularly. I've never felt better.
L653394 +++$+++ u3478 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ CALLER #1 +++$+++ How ya feelin', Artie? I heard you wasn't doin' too well recent.
L653393 +++$+++ u3473 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ ARTIE +++$+++ Yes, ma'am. What's on your almost- perfect mind this evening?
L653392 +++$+++ u3478 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ CALLER #1 +++$+++ Artie? That you, Artie?
L653391 +++$+++ u3473 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ ARTIE +++$+++ Come in, Montgomery, Alabama.
L652808 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Real soon... I'll be makin' the swap tomorrow, and thanks again, Beany.
L652807 +++$+++ u3474 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ BEANY +++$+++ So you're gonna be needin' the "blue- bird" pretty soon?
L652806 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Can't all husbands be perfect, and your Elmo prob'ly wouldn'ta ever got that second one pregnant, you hadn't kicked his ass out.
L652805 +++$+++ u3474 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ BEANY +++$+++ I didn't hate me so much, I'd feel better wishin' you luck.
L652804 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Meetin' him at the gate. That phone call this afternoon was the signal. My deranged mama's hid the keys to my car. But of course, I know exactly where they are.
L652802 +++$+++ u3474 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ BEANY +++$+++ Yeah, well, if he says that all that flab turns into dick at midnight, he's a liar.
L652801 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Seein's how you're about as thick as a used string of unwaxed dental floss, don't know how you can criticize.
L652800 +++$+++ u3474 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ BEANY +++$+++ He's so ugly. Guys with beards and beer guts ain't quite my type.
L652799 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Why? He's right in the groove.
L652798 +++$+++ u3474 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ BEANY +++$+++ I can dig this music... But not that singer.
L653117 +++$+++ u3481 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ ERV +++$+++ We don't have no paper bags.
L653116 +++$+++ u3475 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ BLACK MAN +++$+++ I'd just soon have a paper bag rather than a plastic one, if it's same to you.
L653114 +++$+++ u3475 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ BLACK MAN +++$+++ Then lemme throw in a couple more things.
L653113 +++$+++ u3481 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ ERV +++$+++ Yessir.

Bunny jump fast - you jump back slow... Mean somethin', don't it?... Means somethin' to me... Means you want Bobby Peru...

L653648 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Get out.

You like it like a bunny?... Huh?... Cause baby, I'll fuck you like a real good like a big ol' jack-rabbit bunny... Jump all around in that hole... Bobby Peru doesn't come up for air.

L653779 +++$+++ u3476 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Panty hose. Work better'n stockin's. Pull one of the legs down over your face and let the other leg trail behind your head. You get the pistol.  Remember, soon as we get inside, you keep that bad boy up where those hicks can see it. Once they notice the Ithaca and the Smith, they'll know we ain't foolin' with 'em.

L653699 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ She really say she was pregnant?
L653698 +++$+++ u3476 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Talked to her this afternoon... While you was out.
