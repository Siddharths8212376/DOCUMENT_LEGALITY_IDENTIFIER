L173299 +++$+++ u4917 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ TEN YEAR-OLD KID +++$+++ Fine. Give me the doll hairs.
L173298 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Ha! I said "doll-hairs." Psych! But a deal's a deal, my friend. In you go.
L173297 +++$+++ u4917 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ TEN YEAR-OLD KID +++$+++ Yeah, deal. Give me the two dollars.
L173296 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Do we have a deal?
L173295 +++$+++ u4917 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ TEN YEAR-OLD KID +++$+++ Okay.
L173294 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Go in there and get us two slushees.
L173293 +++$+++ u4917 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ TEN YEAR-OLD KID +++$+++ Sure.
L173160 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ It's too close to call.  Okay next contest, now lets...
L173159 +++$+++ u4913 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MRS. DUNNE +++$+++ How was that?
L173152 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Oh yeah, give it to me.
L173151 +++$+++ u4913 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MRS. DUNNE +++$+++ You know I do!
L173150 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Have you got what I want?
L173149 +++$+++ u4913 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MRS. DUNNE +++$+++ Oh honey, I wouldn't miss this for the world.
L173148 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Mrs. D! I was hoping you'd show up.
L172764 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Hey can be on top?
L172763 +++$+++ u4913 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MRS. DUNNE +++$+++ Hey you two. Lights out.
L172734 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I liked it a lot.
L172733 +++$+++ u4913 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MRS. DUNNE +++$+++ It was meatloaf. You just put everything in your soup.
L172732 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Well he missed a great pot of stew!
L172731 +++$+++ u4913 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MRS. DUNNE +++$+++ He passed away three years ago.
L172730 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Thanks for the grub, Mrs. D. Where's Mr. D?
L172826 +++$+++ u4916 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I reckon so.
L172825 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ So I guess you'll need a new spot for your moonshine.
L172824 +++$+++ u4916 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different.
L172823 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ We're not crazy. We're "special". PRINCIPAL COLLINS wants us to have our own classroom!
L172822 +++$+++ u4916 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What are you crazy kids doing in my tool shed?
L172817 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Class, please study on your own. There seems to be a family emergency because there's no other reason why my father would interrupt me WHILE I'M WORKING!
L172816 +++$+++ u4916 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ LLOYD, may I see you a minute?
L172576 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Thanks, Pop.
L172575 +++$+++ u4916 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Senior year. My little boy. Who woulda thunk it?  You're a good kid, Lloyd. I don't say it enough, but I'm proud of you son.
L173366 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ So miss snoopy reporter girl, it appears that you've snooped yourself into a corner and snoopcuffed yourself to a desk. Whose wearing the Coconut bra now?
L173365 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Obviously.
L173268 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Or maybe crossing a river!
L173267 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ That's not bad. How about a float of George Washington crossing the Delaware?
L173256 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ People! Come on. "Parade" float.
L173255 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Sorry, Ms. Heller. I think they're used to me teaching.
L172690 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ No.
L172689 +++$+++ u4910 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Will that be on the midterm?
L172688 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ Your assignment is to pick the class. Find some other students just as special as you.
L172976 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ What the hell are you talking about?
L172975 +++$+++ u4911 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Damn right I did it. Went back and set the house on fire, his little floozy testified in court - and I ended up doing ten years at Rikers, got my teeth knocked out by Mike the Dyke.
L172974 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ I think you did it.
L172973 +++$+++ u4911 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ No, it actually fit quite nicely.  Well, except for the fact that it wasn't really as long as it was wide.
L172972 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ Ha! Too big to make the turn!
L172971 +++$+++ u4911 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ You bet I left him, took the dog and we was history.
L172970 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ Left here! Left!
L172969 +++$+++ u4911 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Oh, yeah he was straight all right, just wasn't very good in the sack. I used to give him directions. Higher, lower, faster, harder, small circles, do the alphabet. Useless.
L172968 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ That's great, now make a left, then straight!
L172964 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ Uh, no and I don't appreciate...turn down here!
L172963 +++$+++ u4911 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ He was a big loser! What are you deaf!?
L172962 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ What?
L172961 +++$+++ u4911 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Loser... oh yeah he was a loser alright. A big loser.
L172960 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ Looking for a scoop, huh? I'll give you a scoop... of short bus.  Lose her!
L172957 +++$+++ u4911 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Museum huh, haven't been there since my husband left me. I love art.
L172956 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ Let's go Margie. The museum ain't going to teach itself.
L173463 +++$+++ u4920 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ ZIMMER +++$+++ But we don't drink from the house do we.
L173462 +++$+++ u4912 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MOFFIT +++$+++ I can turn on all the faucets in my house.  Even the hose.
L173461 +++$+++ u4920 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ ZIMMER +++$+++ Yes you are. 
L173460 +++$+++ u4912 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MOFFIT +++$+++ I am strong!
L173450 +++$+++ u4912 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MOFFIT +++$+++ Yeah, I get it. Don't worry I studied acting at the police academy just let me do the talking and you'll be fine.
L173449 +++$+++ u4920 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ ZIMMER +++$+++ Well you know Detective, he's expecting  'Moffit' to be someone who has... certain... well...
L173448 +++$+++ u4912 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MOFFIT +++$+++ I don't think he'll smell anything - just make sure he takes the check. I've been through this a hundred times.
L173447 +++$+++ u4920 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ ZIMMER +++$+++ Collins can be a pretty crafty guy, what do I do if he smells the trap.
L173446 +++$+++ u4912 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MOFFIT +++$+++ Sure you can. We gotta nail this guy. You'll be fine.
L173445 +++$+++ u4920 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ ZIMMER +++$+++ I'm not sure if I can do this.
L173427 +++$+++ u4915 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLLINS +++$+++ No... no it's not horse, you see I sold the horse.
L173426 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ This is horse?
L173425 +++$+++ u4915 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLLINS +++$+++ Well there's a reason why that mascot isn't a stallion anymore.
L173424 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ Love it!
L173423 +++$+++ u4915 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLLINS +++$+++ I sold all the wind instruments.  Hawaiian Air, business class. And you like that new fur coat?
L173422 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ This band sounds terrible.
L173421 +++$+++ u4915 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLLINS +++$+++ Yes. So as soon as Zimmer shows up, we'll get our check and blow this pop stand before anyone finds out anything.
L173420 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ So the chest is still out there somewhere.
L173249 +++$+++ u4915 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLLINS +++$+++ Why don't you see to it the kids are ready for the parade tomorrow. I have to pay somebody a little visit.
L173248 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ Are you going to kill her?
L173247 +++$+++ u4915 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLLINS +++$+++ Okay, I'll take care of Jessica.
L173246 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ She's been snooping around a lot, asking questions.
L173245 +++$+++ u4915 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLLINS +++$+++ JESSICA. Are you sure?
L173244 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ It was Jessica. That girl who tried to follow me on the field trip.
L173243 +++$+++ u4915 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLLINS +++$+++ No you don't know who stole it. Just let me do the thinking.
L173242 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
L173241 +++$+++ u4915 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLLINS +++$+++ I don't know where it is. It's not here. It's been stolen.
L173240 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ Where is it?
L173239 +++$+++ u4915 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLLINS +++$+++ Sweetheart keep up with me for half a minute. The evidence of every scam we ever pulled. The evidence that's going to put us away for twenty years.
L173238 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ The evidence of what?
L173237 +++$+++ u4915 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLLINS +++$+++ The documents. The photos! The tapes! The evidence.
L173236 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ What papers?
L173235 +++$+++ u4915 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLLINS +++$+++ The chest! The chest that I put my papers in.
L173234 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ Baby, I'm going to spend the morning at the mall. You know, shop for Waikiki. Honey, what are you looking for?
L172913 +++$+++ u4915 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLLINS +++$+++ Just like the President.
L172912 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ Oh, just like the President.
L172911 +++$+++ u4915 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLLINS +++$+++ Everything. Just for the record.
L172910 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ Everything?
L172909 +++$+++ u4915 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLLINS +++$+++ Oh, things. Photos. Tapes. I tape everything that goes on in this office.
L172908 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ So what do you keep in there?
L172906 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ Monkey, this is too exciting! I can't believe our dream is coming true.
L172905 +++$+++ u4915 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLLINS +++$+++ No. No. I heard from Superintendent ZIMMER this morning and evidently he's so impressed with our Special Needs class, he's bringing Richard MOFFIT himself to the Thanksgiving Day parade- check in hand.
L172904 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ You got the Extender?
L172903 +++$+++ u4915 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLLINS +++$+++ Well I've got a little surprise for you.
L172902 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ It's a surprise.
L172901 +++$+++ u4915 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLLINS +++$+++ What?
L172900 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ Guess what"s under these coconuts.
L172899 +++$+++ u4915 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLLINS +++$+++ Who's there?
L172898 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ Knock knock.
L172806 +++$+++ u4915 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLLINS +++$+++ And you are great in bed.
L172805 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ Wow, you are smart.
L172804 +++$+++ u4915 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLLINS +++$+++ And, take some more pictures.
L172803 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ And...?
L172802 +++$+++ u4915 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLLINS +++$+++ So far so good. We'll need more pictures. Why don't you take them on a field trip tomorrow.
L172790 +++$+++ u4915 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLLINS +++$+++ Yes!
L172789 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ To take a picture for Superintendent Zimmer?
L172677 +++$+++ u4915 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLLINS +++$+++ I think you'll make a good teacher.
L172676 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ Times two.
L172674 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ Oh wow. Look at you.
L172673 +++$+++ u4915 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLLINS +++$+++ Aloha means hello and goodbye.
L172672 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ You said "aloha" twice.
L172671 +++$+++ u4915 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLLINS +++$+++ Maybe someday. Aloha cold weather, aloha hot weather.
L172670 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ We start our own class?
L172669 +++$+++ u4915 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLLINS +++$+++ No. No. That's not it. We don't kill him. We don't kill anybody. But I like the way you're thinking. You're focused and you're trying to follow. No, what we need to do is start a fake Special Needs class.
L172668 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ Oh, this is fantastic. So all we have to do is kill this Moffit guy and we get all the money!
L172667 +++$+++ u4915 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLLINS +++$+++ Anyway, the state is giving a hundred thousand dollars in his name to every school that has a Special Needs class.
L172665 +++$+++ u4915 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLLINS +++$+++ Yes, it's the big potato. Just have a look at this.
L172664 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ It's the big potato.
L172663 +++$+++ u4915 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLLINS +++$+++ Small potatoes. This one is big time. This is visionary. This idea is genius.
L172662 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ How baby-cakes? You've done it all.
L172661 +++$+++ u4915 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLLINS +++$+++ You know honey, I've finally figured out a way of bilking enough money from the school to get us that condo in Waikiki.
L172650 +++$+++ u4915 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLLINS +++$+++ And I you.
L172649 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ God, I've missed you.
L172648 +++$+++ u4915 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ PRINCIPAL COLLINS +++$+++ Good. Good. Good. Well, that's good.
L172647 +++$+++ u4914 +++$+++ m327 +++$+++ MS. HELLER +++$+++ ... and, Principal Collins, you'll be pleased to know that this year Wednesdays are "South of the Border" days. We'll serve a spicy tuna tamale along with a cheese quesadilla.
L173879 +++$+++ u4921 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ You killed the doctor too soon, you fool!
L173878 +++$+++ u4930 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ PITER +++$+++ The ring?... he was brought to us as is, Baron.  I...
L173877 +++$+++ u4921 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ It was Feyd?  It was Feyd!  Where is the ducal signet ring?  I must have his ring.
L173682 +++$+++ u4921 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ I made my peace gesture... the forms of Kanly have been obeyed.
L173681 +++$+++ u4930 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ PITER +++$+++ He wishes to inform you that Vendetta -- as he puts it, using the ancient tongue, the art of Kanly -- is still alive. He does not wish to meet or speak with you.
L173680 +++$+++ u4921 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ What does Leto say, Piter?
L173679 +++$+++ u4930 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ PITER +++$+++ The Atreides will be leaving Caladan soon, Baron, and I have here your answer from Duke Leto.
L173678 +++$+++ u4921 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ Piter.
L173677 +++$+++ u4930 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ PITER +++$+++ My Lord!
L173811 +++$+++ u4926 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ KYNES +++$+++ Nothing.
L173810 +++$+++ u4922 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ DUKE LETO +++$+++ What's that you're saying?
L173792 +++$+++ u4926 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ KYNES +++$+++ The carryall will come and lift off the spice harvester. Try and get in close over the harvester... you'll find this interesting Sire. -- The Duke accelerates the ornithopter in the direction of the harvester. Paul can SEE...
L173791 +++$+++ u4922 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ DUKE LETO +++$+++ What happens now?
L173765 +++$+++ u4926 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ KYNES +++$+++ With your permission...
L173764 +++$+++ u4922 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ DUKE LETO +++$+++ My thanks.
L173754 +++$+++ u4926 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ KYNES +++$+++ They are Fremen suits. I hope they fit well, my lord.
L173753 +++$+++ u4922 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ DUKE LETO +++$+++ I understand we have you to thank for these stillsuits, Doctor.
L173749 +++$+++ u4922 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ DUKE LETO +++$+++ This is my son, Paul.
L173748 +++$+++ u4926 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ KYNES +++$+++ I prefer the more ancient term, planetologist... Noble Born.
L173747 +++$+++ u4922 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ DUKE LETO +++$+++ So you are Dr. Kynes, the Imperial Ecologist?
L173540 +++$+++ u4923 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ EMPEROR +++$+++ We are alone...
L173539 +++$+++ u4931 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ REVEREND MOTHER +++$+++ Yes, my Lord.
L173536 +++$+++ u4931 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ REVEREND MOTHER +++$+++ I am your Truthsayer, my lord...  He is here, my lord.
L173535 +++$+++ u4923 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ EMPEROR +++$+++ He will not permit anyone but me to see him. You must be outside this room.... Do what you can.
L173534 +++$+++ u4931 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ REVEREND MOTHER +++$+++ Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him.
L173533 +++$+++ u4923 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ EMPEROR +++$+++ Yes?
L173532 +++$+++ u4931 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ REVEREND MOTHER +++$+++ Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....
L173531 +++$+++ u4923 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ EMPEROR +++$+++ I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished.
L173530 +++$+++ u4931 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ REVEREND MOTHER +++$+++ We felt his presence.
L173529 +++$+++ u4923 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ EMPEROR +++$+++ A Third Stage Guild Navigator will be here within minutes!
L173561 +++$+++ u4928 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ NAVIGATOR +++$+++ Do not interrupt!!! Do not speak lightly of the spice... ONE SMALL POINT...
L173560 +++$+++ u4923 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ EMPEROR +++$+++ I can assure you...
L173557 +++$+++ u4928 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ NAVIGATOR +++$+++ LISTEN TO ME!! The spice must flow... the spice has given me accelerated evolution for four thousand years... it has enabled you to live two hundred years... the spice helps make the sapho juice, which gives the red-lipped mentats the ability to be living computers... the secret side of spice... the water of life.
L173556 +++$+++ u4923 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ EMPEROR +++$+++ Can you hear me?... If this visit has anything to do with spice... -- The Guild Navigator shudders and swishes quite violently in his tank.
L173552 +++$+++ u4923 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ EMPEROR +++$+++ Yes.
L173551 +++$+++ u4928 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ NAVIGATOR +++$+++ So the Harkonnens will rid you of House Atreides...
L173550 +++$+++ u4928 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ NAVIGATOR +++$+++ You must share with us. -- EMPEROR The Atreides house is building a secret army!... using a technique unknown to us... a technique involving sound. The Duke is becoming more popular in the Landsraad... he could threaten me.... I have ordered House Atreides to occupy Arrakis to mine the spice... thus replacing their enemies the Harkonnens.... House Atreides will not refuse because of the tremendous power they think they will gain. Then, at an appointed time Baron Harkonnen will return to Arrakis and launch a sneak attack on House Atreides... I have promised the Baron five legions of my Sardaukar terror troops.
L173549 +++$+++ u4923 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ EMPEROR +++$+++ Yes.
L173548 +++$+++ u4928 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ NAVIGATOR +++$+++ I see two Great Houses -- House Atreides, House Harkonnen -- feuding... I see you behind it.
L173544 +++$+++ u4923 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ EMPEROR +++$+++ Oh yes? -- NAVIGATOR Better than those on Richesse.. You are transparent... I see many things... I see plans within plans.
L173543 +++$+++ u4928 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ NAVIGATOR +++$+++ Many machines on Ix... new machines.
L173542 +++$+++ u4923 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ EMPEROR +++$+++ Yes?... How was your journey?
L173541 +++$+++ u4928 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ NAVIGATOR +++$+++ We have just folded space from Ix...
L173784 +++$+++ u4926 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ KYNES +++$+++ That's it... spice mining... no other cloud quite like it. See the spotters over it? They're watching for wormsign... the telltale sand waves. Seismic probes on the surface, too Sire... worms can travel too deep for their waves to show... Looks like a good patch of spice.
L173783 +++$+++ u4924 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ GURNEY +++$+++ Dust cloud ahead, Sire.
L173762 +++$+++ u4926 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ KYNES +++$+++ It's a high-efficiency filter and heat exchange system. Perspiration passes through the first layer and is gathered in the second. The salt is separated. Breathing and walking provide the pumping action. The reclaimed water circulates to catchpockets from which you can drink through this tube at your neck. Urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads. Should you be in the open desert, remember to breathe in through your mouth, out through the nose tubes.
L173761 +++$+++ u4924 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ GURNEY +++$+++ Yes, Sire.
L173759 +++$+++ u4924 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ GURNEY +++$+++ Sire!
L173758 +++$+++ u4926 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ KYNES +++$+++ Basically...
L173757 +++$+++ u4924 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ GURNEY +++$+++ The Duke is to be addresses as... -- Kynes comes forward and adjusts the Duke's suit, checking seals and pulling on straps.
L173745 +++$+++ u4926 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ KYNES +++$+++ Play out your little comedy while you can off-worlders...
L173744 +++$+++ u4924 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ GURNEY +++$+++ I hope I made myself clear. You may call him "The Duke," "My lord," or "Sire." And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- "Noble Born."
L173743 +++$+++ u4926 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ KYNES +++$+++ So, this is Leto the Just...
L174130 +++$+++ u4929 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ The Emperor's blade.
L174129 +++$+++ u4924 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ GURNEY +++$+++ This is a Harkonnen animal.  Let me, please, my Lord.
L174102 +++$+++ u4929 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Let him stand free!
L174101 +++$+++ u4924 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ GURNEY +++$+++ My Lord?
L174100 +++$+++ u4929 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Gurney... I see Thufir Hawat among the captives.  Let him stand free.
L174043 +++$+++ u4924 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ GURNEY +++$+++ They said you were dead.  They said...
L174042 +++$+++ u4929 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Don't you trust your own eyes.
L174041 +++$+++ u4924 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ GURNEY +++$+++ Paul!!  Paul!!
L174040 +++$+++ u4929 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You've no need of your weapons with me Gurney Halleck.
L173590 +++$+++ u4924 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ GURNEY +++$+++ Yes. I sensed the play in you lad, but this can no longer be play. Tomorrow we leave for Arrakis! Arrakis is real. The Harkonnens are real.
L173589 +++$+++ u4929 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Things have been so serious here lately.
L173588 +++$+++ u4924 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ GURNEY +++$+++ If you'd fought one whit below your abilities I'd have scratched you a good one.
L173587 +++$+++ u4929 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Would you really have drawn my blood?
L173586 +++$+++ u4924 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ GURNEY +++$+++ We'd have joined each other in death. However, you did seem to finally get the "mood".
L173585 +++$+++ u4924 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ GURNEY +++$+++ Good... the slow blade penetrates the shield... but look down.
L173584 +++$+++ u4929 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Is this what you seek?
L173583 +++$+++ u4929 +++$+++ m328 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What's gotten into Gurney? He's not faking. Paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly around the room. The smell of ozone grows stronger as the shields hit and SPARK off one another. Paul directs a parry downwards, turns, and leads Gurney against the table, plunging at just the right moment to pin Gurney against the table top with his blade right at Gurney's neck.
