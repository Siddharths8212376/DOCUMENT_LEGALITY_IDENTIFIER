L284903 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
L284902 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee.
L284901 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Don't remind me. That's how we happened to --
L284900 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach.
L284899 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.
L284898 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we?
L284897 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!
L284896 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?
L284895 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ We've certainly been in some swell jams.
L284894 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ I mean -- working together. Just like the old days. The things we've been through, Hildy.
L284893 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ In a way.
L284892 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Uh-uh. As long as we were in there together pitching -- they couldn't lick us. Well, it's been a lot of fun.
L284891 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?
L284890 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Don't tell me you were worried!
L284889 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ How was that for a tight squeeze?
L284882 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ And your arrest. You'll each get about ten years, I think.
L284881 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.
L284880 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Which ought to be about three hours more, I'd say.
L284855 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Who did you talk to?
L284854 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ When did you deliver this first?
L284851 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Hanging an innocent man to win an election!
L284850 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Murder, uh?
L284849 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Wait a minute!  Let go there!
L284724 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Yes! What are you afraid of Hildy? I dare him to move that desk out of here.
L284723 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ No!
L284695 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ What is it? Here!
L284694 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ No, you don't! Walter!
L284658 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Who says so? I'm going to the morgue -- to look --
L284657 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Don't open that!
L284656 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ I don't care what you say. I'm going to find Bruce's mother.  Oh-h...  I'm going out and find her!
L284655 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Hildy, you just can't leave me out on a limb now. It -- it wouldn't be cricket!
L284654 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Yes.
L284653 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ When I'm surrounded, with my back against the wall, you're not going to lay down on me, are you --
L284652 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Oh, I see. I beg your pardon.
L284651 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Will you come here?
L284650 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Hello -- hello! Is this the Lying -- In Hospital? Did you have an auto accident in the last --
L284649 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Come here. See if we can move it.
L284648 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Ring that number, will you?
L284646 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ That dumb immigrant'll flop on me. I know it.  Can you imagine Butch doing this to me -- at a time like this?
L284645 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Lafayette two-one-hundred.
L284633 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Duffy!!!!   Duffy!!!!  Well, where is Duffy?  Diabetes! I ought to know better than to hire anybody with a disease.  Louie.
L284632 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Shut up, will you?  You sure? Nobody?
L284631 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Butch! I'd put my arm in fire for you -- up to here!  Now, you can't double-cross me!... She does? All right -- put her on. I'll talk to her... Hello! Oh, hello, Madam... Now listen, you ten-cent glamour girl, you can't keep Butch away from his duty... What's that? You say that again and I'll come over there and knock your eye out! Hello?  I'll kill 'em! I'll kill both of 'em!  Duffy!  Mousing around with some big blonde Annie on my time! That's co-operation!  Duffy!!
L284630 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Hello, Max, Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady --?
L284629 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ I don't care if you've been after her for six years! Butch, our whole lives are at stake! Are you going to let a woman come between us after all we've been through?
L284628 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Is this the Community Hospital?
L284627 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ I can't hear... You got who? Speak up! A what?... You can't stop for a dame now!
L284626 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Nobody?  Morningside three-one-two-four.
L284625 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Oh, for --  H. Sebastian -- Butch! Listen, it's a matter of life and death! Listen!
L284624 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Hello -- Eddie? Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup?
L284623 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ What are you doing there? Haven't you even started?
L284622 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.
L284621 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?
L284620 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.
L284619 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Hello -- hello...
L284616 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Louie, where'd it happen? I'm going out!
L284615 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ If it was my own mother, I'd carry on! You know I would. For the paper!
L284614 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ I'm looking at you -- you murderer!
L284613 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Look at me, Hildy --
L284612 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ I killed her. I'm responsible. Oh- h... what can I do now? How can I ever face him? Oh, I hope he never comes back!
L284611 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ If he really loves you, you won't have to tell him anything.  Snap out of it! Would you rather have had the old dame dragging the whole police force in here?
L284610 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ What am I going to say to Bruce? What'll I tell him?
L284609 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ It's Fate, Hildy. What will be, will be.
L284606 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Was she? Did you notice?
L284605 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Don't tell me -- was she killed?
L284595 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Louie!
L284594 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Where is she? Tell me!
L284587 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ You been in a fight?
L284586 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ What happened?
L284585 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ What did you do with her?
L284584 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Where's Mrs. Baldwin?
L284579 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Hildy, you think I could? After this story?  Here! You're just nervous.
L284578 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter, you're not trying anything again, are you?
L284576 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Finished!
L284575 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ I'm finished.
L284574 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Tear into it, will you? Don't sit there like a frozen robin!
L284573 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ You said it! But this'll teach him a lesson. He won't quit his paper without giving notice after this.
L284572 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Double-crossing swine!
L284529 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Didn't you hear him? Of course he's coming back here. Keep going, will you?
L284528 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Is he coming back here?
L284527 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Railroad tickets.
L284526 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ What tickets?
L284525 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
L284524 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Where's Bruce?
L284523 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Well, keep going! We want an extra out on the streets before it's too late!
L284520 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Where's Butch?
L284519 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Listen, did you impress it on Butch that I want him and his gang here right away? You did? Every minute counts. All right.  Duffy's getting old!
L284493 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ All right, Walter.
L284492 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Hildy!
L284464 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Okay, Walter. 
L284463 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ For Pete's sake, Hildy, they're waiting for the rest of that story!
L284451 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Give him the works.  Hello, Duffy, get set! We've got the biggest story in the world. Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post -- exclusive!
L284450 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ How about the time he had his house painted by the Fire Department?
L284449 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Call him a love-child, if you want to.  Duffy!
L284448 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Can I call the Mayor a bird of prey -- or is that libelous?
L284446 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Where's some paper?
L284445 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ All the words you've got.
L284444 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ How much do you want on it?
L284443 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Get the lead out of your typewriter and start pounding out a load, will you? Snap into it!
L284442 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Huh!
L284441 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Hildy!
L284440 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ We'll lower it out of the window with pulleys. Quit stallin'.
L284439 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.
L284438 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Not if he's inside the desk. We'll carry the desk over.  Give me Duffy!
L284437 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ That one -- how you gonna take him? They'll see him.
L284436 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ We're going to take him over to my private office.  Where's our phone?
L284435 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Whoa -- wait a minute. We can't leave Williams here. One of the other fellows'll --
L284434 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Attagirl! Why, they'll be naming streets after you -- Hildy Johnson Street! There'll be statues of you in the parks, Hildy. The radio'll be after you -- the movies!  By tomorrow morning I'll betcha there's a Hildy Johnson cigar! I can see the billboards now. Light up with Hildy Johnson!
L284433 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Let me get at that typewriter and I'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write!
L284432 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ You've kicked over the whole City Hall like an apple-cart. You've got the Mayor and Hartman backed against a wall. You've put one administration out and another in. This isn't a newspaper story -- it's a career! And you stand there belly-aching about whether you catch an eight o'clock train or a nine o'clock train! Still a doll-faced mugg! That's all you are.
L284431 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ I get it!
L284430 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Well, think it then, because it's true! We'll crucify that mob. We're going to keep Williams under cover till morning so the Post can break the story exclusive. Then we'll let the Governor in on the capture -- share the glory with him.
L284429 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ I'd like to think.
L284428 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Don't get technical at a time like this! Do you realize what you've done? You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia! We'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even their wives!
L284427 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley who discovered Livingstone?
L284426 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ You know! You've got the brain of a pancake! That wasn't just a story you covered -- it was a revolution! Hildy! This is the greatest yarn in journalism since Livingstone discovered Stanley for the New York Herald! 
L284425 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ I know, but --
L284424 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ You drooling idiot! What do you mean, you're getting out! There are three hundred and sixty-five days in the year one can get married -- but how many times have you got a murderer locked up in a desk? -- Once in a lifetime! Hildy, you've got the whole city by the seat of the pants!
L284423 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Oh, get off that trapeze!  There's your story! Smear it all over the front page -- Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post! And take all the credit -- I covered your story for you and I got myself in a fine mess doing it -- and now I'm getting out! I know I told you that twice before today -- but this time I mean it!
L284422 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Get Bruce out of jail! How can you worry about a man who's resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on? Hildy, this is war! You can't desert now!
L284421 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me?
L284420 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Where do you think you're going?
L284410 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ I know. Where is he, I said.
L284409 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ She jumped out of the window.
L284408 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Yes. Where is he?
L284407 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Walter! D-did you see --  -- that?
L284079 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Hold on a minute.
L284078 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ It better be fifteen minutes, because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band.
L284077 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ That's great work, Hildy... Huh? Oh, will you stop worrying about the money? I'll see you get it in fifteen minutes.
L284076 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ No, this is on the level, Walter. I'm not good enough to make this one up. The Sheriff gave his gun to the Professor, the Professor gave it to Earl, and Earl gave it right back to the Professor -- right in the stomach! Who? No, Egelhoffer wasn't hurt badly. They took him to the County Hospital where they're afraid he'll recover.
L284075 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ No kidding, Hildy.  Say, this isn't a rib?
L284074 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Well, I'm coming to it. It seems the Professor had to have a gun to re- enact the crime with -- and who do you suppose supplied it? Nobody else but that great thinker, Sheriff Hartman!
L284073 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer, from New York, decides to make Williams re-enact the crime --
L284072 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!
L284071 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.
L284070 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ You'll get it. Now what's the story?  I'll have the paper send the money right down to you. I swear it on my mother's grave.
L284069 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money!
L284068 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Never mind that. What's the story?
L284067 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley.
L284066 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Exclusive? That's great.
L283683 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ No thanks, I've still got those. Well, I'll step into some working clothes and hop over to the Press Room for the background on this yarn. It'll be kind of fun to see the boys again, too. Remember, Bruce, it must be certified.
L283682 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?
L283681 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?
L283680 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ What do you think I am -- a crook?
L283677 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Oh, nothing! Of course, you might cancel the check. Yes! Wait a minute! What would be his first payment on that policy?
L283676 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ What tricks would I pull?
L283675 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train.  And no tricks, Walter!
L283674 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Now you're talking!
L283666 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Maybe you'll be. You're a smart young man. You let Hildy do this story for me and you can write out a $100,000.00 insurance policy for me. What do you say?
L283665 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ We're not interested.
L283664 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ All right, Hildy, I'm licked. But I'll make you and Bruce a business proposition.
L283663 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ I happen to know Sweeney was married only three months ago. If he's got twins this morning, I claim it was done with mirrors.
L283662 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ What do you mean?
L283661 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.
L283660 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ What do you mean, only an act? Haven't you got any feeling?
L283659 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ What a performance! Bravo! Don't let him fool you, Bruce -- it's only an act!
L283658 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ How can you have any happiness after that? All through the years you'll remember that a man went to the gallows because you were too selfish to wait two hours! I tell you, Earl Williams' face will come between you on the train tonight -- and at the preacher's tomorrow -- and all the rest of your lives!
L283657 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ You see what I had to put up with? She never trusted me! You argue with her -- otherwise you're going on a honeymoon with blood on your hands!
L283656 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Why, Walter, you're getting poetic!
L283655 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ I'm an editor. I know what ought to be written, but I can't write it the way you could. It needs a woman's heart --
L283654 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ No, Bruce, dear. Don't you see? This is a trick to get your sympathy. No, Walter, I've been waiting for something like this -- but I wasn't sure when you'd spring it. If you want to save Earl Williams' life, you can interview him yourself. You're still a good reporter. Bruce and I will be on that four o'clock train -- and thanks just the same.
L283644 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Especially with an election coming up in a few days.
L283643 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ The colored vote happens to be very important to the Mayor of this town.
L283642 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
L283641 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?
L283638 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl Williams gets hanged tomorrow.
L283637 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ You said it.
L283636 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. They can't even find him.  I tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation.
L283635 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ What now?
L283615 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Thank you.
L283614 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Here's luck to the bride and bridegroom.
L283594 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Anyway, I'm glad you two are going to be happy and have all the things I couldn't give her. You know, Hildy is about the best reporter in the country -- and that goes regardless of sex. But all she really ever wanted was a home.
L283593 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ I might have, Walter, but you were never there.
L283592 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Well, I'll tell you one thing, old man, she never looked at me the way she's looking at you.
L283562 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ How do you like that? Here I am being nice to you and your sweet-heart and that's the thanks I get!
L283561 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ I suppose I can't call this off without creating a scene -- but remember, it's your last fling.
L283530 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Thanks.
L283529 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Allow me.
L283527 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Oh, I'm sorry.
L283526 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her!
L283525 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ What for?
L283524 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ And he takes his hat off when he's with a lady.
L283523 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ No kidding?
L283522 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ You wouldn't believe this, Walter, but Bruce holds the door open for me.
L283520 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Nothing personal. I was just asking.
L283519 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Now you got me.
L283518 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Then what does he want with you?
L283517 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Better.
L283516 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ All right then, come on and let's see this paragon.  Is he as good as you say?
L283515 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Afraid? I should say not!
L283514 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ You're not afraid, are you?
L283513 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.
L283512 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Say, could I meet him?
L283511 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now.
L283510 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Too bad I couldn't see this guy first. I'm pretty particular about whom my wife marries.
L283509 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Thanks...
L283508 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.
L283507 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.
L283506 +++$+++ u1357 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ BURNS +++$+++ Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?
L283505 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.
