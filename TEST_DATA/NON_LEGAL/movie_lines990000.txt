L273000 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ hurries over.
L272999 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ I'm so happy to see you!
L272899 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Oh, no . . . Mummy's awfully good at it.
L272898 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ I wouldn't want my private business being discussed with a complete stranger!
L272895 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Well, actually, Mummy's left that programme now . . she's far too busy with The Marriage Guidance Council.
L272894 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ I've heard your mother on 3YA. The Woman's Session has lots of lively debate.
L272893 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ and HERBERT exchange a glance. HONORA smiles at Juliet.
L272892 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ And so, in a blazing fury, Charles runs Lancelot Trelawney through with his sword . . . leaving Deborah free to accept Charles's proposal of marriage!
L273285 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ Let's go for a walk down here . . . come on, Mummy!
L273284 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Isn't it beautiful!
L273280 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Goodbye, Mr. Rieper.
L273279 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ Bye, Dad.
L273266 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ I think she knows what's going to happen . . . she doesn't appear to bear us any grudge!
L273265 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept Bernard's marriage proposal . . .
L273264 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . isn't she?
L273263 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ It's a three-act story with a tragic end.
L273261 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ All right, then.
L273260 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ Let's go upstairs, Deborah. I wrote the last 10 pages of my opera last night.
L273244 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ Mummy!
L273243 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Mummy!
L273232 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ I know what to do about mother.
L273231 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Yes . . .
L273230 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ I'm coming with you.
L273204 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ I need my sodding parents' consent.
L273203 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ But that's not true! I've got one.
L273159 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Don't worry, Gina! Mummy and Daddy love each other.
L273158 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ Poor Father . . .
L273157 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Too right . . . but he doesn't have a show! Nobody gets into Mother's draws except Daddy!
L273156 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ Do you think Bloody Bill's trying to get into her draws?
L273155 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Poor Mother was completely taken in.
L273152 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ That was what we were led to believe . . .
L273151 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ I thought he was supposed to be terribly ill.
L273145 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ That's great! We'll have the fare in no time!
L273144 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ I can try my father's safe. I'm sure I can get the keys to his office.
L273143 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ This lot's got to be worth 50 quid!
L273142 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ They'll blame the bloody housekeeper. She nicks stuff all the times!
L273141 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ I'm sure they'll notice things missing.
L273140 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ I know, I'll lean forward and show more cleavage!
L273139 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ Just a couple more . . .
L273138 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Hurry up! I'm freezing!
L273137 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ Stay still or they'll be blurry . . .
L273133 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ You mean travel by ourselves?
L273132 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ Let's go overseas . . .
L273131 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ No, you're not, Gina-it's everybody else who is bonkers!
L273130 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ I think I'm going crazy.
L273028 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ Well . . . no. But it's so obvious.
L273027 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ How do you know? Did he tell you?
L273026 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ That idiot boarder?
L273025 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ John has fallen in love with me!
L273024 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ What??
L273023 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ You'll never guess what's happened!!
L272953 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ I couldn't have done it without you, Charles.
L272952 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ You're such an incredible woman.
L272951 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ I shall call him Diello.
L272944 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ What???
L272943 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ It's so beautiful!
L272942 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ What?
L272929 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ God, yes!
L272928 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ He flings open the door and launches himself at the bed, ravishing her!
L272874 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ That . . .
L272873 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ That.
L272872 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ This . . .
L272871 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ This.
L272870 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ Him . . .
L272869 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Him.
L272868 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ He . . .
L272867 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ To be known as He!
L272866 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ Saint Mario!
L272865 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ James will be there . . . and Mario! Only they'll be saints.
L272863 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ I'm not! I'm going to the Fourth World! It's like Heaven, only better because there aren't any Christians.
L272862 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ But, we're all going to Heaven!
L272861 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Daddy says the Bible's a load of bunkum!
L272860 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ I wish James would do a religious picture . . . he'd be perfect as Jesus!
L272853 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Don't . . . please! Please, don't!
L272852 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ I think I'm dying . . .
L272844 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Of course it matters! It's Mario!
L272843 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ It doesn't matter.
L272842 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ 0h, God . . . I'm so sorry!
L272771 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Somebody's got to help us!
L272770 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ She's terribly hurt . . .
L272768 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ Mummy!
L272767 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Mummy!
L276401 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ Maybe I wasn't responsible for the car accident...
L276400 +++$+++ u5806 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss. Everybody does things they regret. You just couldn't remember doing these things and now you are so it's a shock to the system. I'm telling you. You will never get better if you keep blaming yourself for your wife's death.
L276399 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ Allison I think I did some very, very bad things. I mean very bad.
L276301 +++$+++ u5806 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Just get better okay?
L276300 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors!
L276299 +++$+++ u5806 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore.
L276298 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ I understand... I won't-
L276297 +++$+++ u5806 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ If it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control I had. Trevor, I never date patients.
L276296 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ Sorry.
L276293 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ What was it?
L276292 +++$+++ u5806 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ No. But at one point you did repeat something though. A phrase. You must have been having this recurring dream, you just kept saying this one thing over and over
L276291 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ Did I ever talk about Kirsty?
L276290 +++$+++ u5806 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ No.
L276289 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ Did I ever talk about the accident?
L276288 +++$+++ u5806 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Trevor if someone is talking from a sleep state they are obviously dreaming. So practically everything say is going to sound strange.
L276287 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ Well?
L276286 +++$+++ u5806 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Sure plenty of times.
L276284 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ No. She just would have loved it up here... Allison when I was under... did I ever talk?
L276283 +++$+++ u5806 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Don't tell me. Kirsty used to smoke?
L276282 +++$+++ u5806 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Oh I knew about the chairs already. This is where the emphysema patients come to sneak cigarettes.
L276281 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ Lucky for us these chairs happened to be here.
L276280 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ I did more then that.
L276279 +++$+++ u5806 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.
L276278 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew.
L276277 +++$+++ u5806 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ I understand, I think. Other women?
L276276 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ We startred off to be. She was, I guess I was. I just sort of....butchered up the relationship somehow.  Bad choice of words.
L276274 +++$+++ u5806 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ You just made that up.
L276273 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ Pitbull attacks.
L276272 +++$+++ u5806 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Eighty third most common.
L276271 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ Skin cancer.
L276270 +++$+++ u5806 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Second most common?
L276269 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.
L276268 +++$+++ u5806 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Okay Mr. Statistics I've got one for you. What's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen?
L276267 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ Millions of people around the world get on busses every day. When was the last time you heard of anybody anywhere dying on a public transit bus?
L276266 +++$+++ u5806 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Okay so... what's the safest place?
L276265 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ I've got numbers to back me up. Over the course of one year more Americans die in car accidents than did during the entire span of World War II.
L276264 +++$+++ u5806 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Bull...
L276263 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ It's inside a moving car.
L276262 +++$+++ u5806 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ I'm stumped.
L276261 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ Hint. It's not a geographical location.
L276259 +++$+++ u5806 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ All finished.
L276258 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ So, I'm done. Thats it for today?
L276257 +++$+++ u5806 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ I know, my bedside manner's horrendous.
L276256 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ The way you just looked at me...
L276255 +++$+++ u5806 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Of course, yes.
L276253 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ Some call it resilience. Others, stupidity.
L276252 +++$+++ u5806 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ You're one tough cookie, Trevor Gooding. You keep coming back to your corner for a quick fix up then go right back out into the ring for another round.
L276249 +++$+++ u5806 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ I'm all over it.
L276248 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ Allison we have GOT to talk about this medication you've got me on.
L276247 +++$+++ u5806 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Well Trevor? What have you got to say for yourself? Que pasa?
L276202 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ I miss her. I miss my wife.
L276201 +++$+++ u5806 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.
L276200 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ If they're blocked memories... I'm starting to realize the reason why I blocked them out. Allison I think I really... screwed everything up.
L276199 +++$+++ u5806 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?
L276198 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ These hallucinations I'm having. I think they're more like memories coming back to me in a strange way.
L276105 +++$+++ u5806 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ You need to get better first Trevor. Way better.  It's okay to miss somebody. It's okay to still love someone after they're gone. But you've got to quit blaming yourself okay...? Okay?
L276104 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ No I need to remember. Look whatever it is take me off it. I can handle pain. I can't handle not knowing...
L276103 +++$+++ u5806 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Easy there Trevor. You need to relax.
L276102 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ Allison? Why can't remember what happened to my wife? Is it something I'm on that's... that's making me forget?
L276098 +++$+++ u5806 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ No wisdom, no insight, no plan.
L276097 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ Your insight is enlightening.
L276096 +++$+++ u5806 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit you Trevor. Listen, I don't mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. Everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time. You might see things a litlle differently from now on.
L276095 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ Let me see. Oh yeah. My head feels like it's going through a meat grinder. I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or...
L276094 +++$+++ u5806 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Well? What do you say Trevor? Que pasa?
L276092 +++$+++ u5806 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ You came in for your EEG. You fell asleep and well, I took the liberty of...I'm sorry. You looked like a wreck Trevor.
L276091 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ What's happening to me? What are you doing?
L275995 +++$+++ u5806 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Your wife...?
L275994 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ Where's Kirsty? Where's my wife?
L275993 +++$+++ u5806 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ It's the morphine Trevor. You're on so much of it, you could be asleep and dreaming even with your eyes wide open.
L275992 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ What just happened to me anyway? It looked like a dream but it felt like reality.
L275991 +++$+++ u5806 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Still hallucinating as well. Hmm...
L275990 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ Are you a dream too?
L276430 +++$+++ u5807 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ BRET +++$+++ I followed her Trevor. I got to know her life. And what a boring one it was. Six a.m. gym, nine a.m. trendy coffee shop, noon bookstore, one soap operas, four o'clock news, five wait for Trevor to come home. And wait and wait and wait. Nine o'clock get ready for bed. 
L276429 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.
L276428 +++$+++ u5807 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ BRET +++$+++ We were gonna be millionaires you said. Nobody'd suspect a thing. I had never even met her. No connection. Then you went and had that fucking car accident.
L276427 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ Bret. What the hell is going on?
L276426 +++$+++ u5807 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ BRET +++$+++ Tonight was supposed to be the night, Trevor. Remember? I couldn't believe you went through five dart games and didn't even joke about it.
L276425 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ Bret... what the fuck...?
L276332 +++$+++ u5807 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ BRET +++$+++ Someone special.
L276331 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ Yeah? You and who else?
L276330 +++$+++ u5807 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ BRET +++$+++ Almost that fast. I got a few loose ends to tie up first. Came into a shitload of money recently. I've always wanted to go to take a trip. We're just gonna walk into the airport and decide right then and there.
L276329 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ So you're just packing it up just like that?
L276327 +++$+++ u5807 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ BRET +++$+++ As much as he feels like. Its a much more pleasurable line of work.
L276326 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ How much time off?
L276325 +++$+++ u5807 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ BRET +++$+++ I've got a better offer. More time off. A sort of career shift, more in the engineering line of work.
L276324 +++$+++ u5807 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ BRET +++$+++ I quit. Today's my last day.
L276323 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ What's the occasion?
L276322 +++$+++ u5807 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ BRET +++$+++ Hey if you're not doing anything I'd like to buy you a beer after work. Be just like old times.
L276124 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ Serious as a heart attack my friend. I think she literally fucked me brains out.
L276123 +++$+++ u5807 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ BRET +++$+++ You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?
L276122 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ I crap you not. She was all over me yesterday in the break room. And she was a total machine last night too.
L276121 +++$+++ u5807 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ BRET +++$+++ GWEN?
L276120 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ Gwen.
L276119 +++$+++ u5807 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ BRET +++$+++ Really? Do tell.

L276116 +++$+++ u5820 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ TREVOR +++$+++ The boss won't notice me doing a bad job because I'm not. Even if the boss thought I was slacking I'd know right away.
L276112 +++$+++ u5807 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ BRET +++$+++ Getting paid for doing shit.

L276383 +++$+++ u5808 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ DR. AMBROSE +++$+++ Why don't you relax for the next couple of hours? Barring any relapses you should be able to go home after that.
L276381 +++$+++ u5808 +++$+++ m385 +++$+++ DR. AMBROSE +++$+++ Take no offense Trevor. I see many patients a day and have an awful memory.
