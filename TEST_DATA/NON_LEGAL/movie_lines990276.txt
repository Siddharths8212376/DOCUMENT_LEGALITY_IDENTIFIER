L489762 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Then, he must write about these murders.
L489761 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Well, there are at least five thousand notebooks in this room, and near as I can tell, each notebook contains two hundred and fifty pages.
L489760 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ I'm trying, alright?  Just tell me what we've got.
L489759 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ We could use about fifty more men here.
L489749 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ We had him.
L489748 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L489731 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ No point in arguing anymore...
L489730 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ You stupid son of a...
L489729 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Okay... okay... get off.
L489728 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Think it through.  If we leave a hole like this, we'll never prosecute.  He'll walk.  We have to come up with some excuse for knocking on this door.
L489727 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ By the time we clear a warrant someone else is going to be dead.
L489725 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Think about how we got here!
L489724 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ What the fuck is wrong with you?
L489723 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Think about it...
L489722 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ We have probable cause now.
L489721 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ We need a warrant.
L489720 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ The hell I can't!  We get in there and we can stop him.
L489719 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ You can't go in there.
L489718 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ It was him.
L489717 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Wait... just wait.
L489715 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ What happened?
L489714 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ I'm fine.
L489713 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Are you alright?
L489702 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Who told you about my silver tongue?  You been talking to my wife?
L489701 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ You do the talking.  Put that old silver tongue of yours to work.
L489700 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ What are you going to say?
L489699 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Sure.  Uh, excuse me... are you by any chance a serial killer?  Oh, you are? Well, come with us then, if it's okay.
L489698 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ We'll take a look at him.  Talk to him.
L489697 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ This is stupid.  It'd be just too easy.
L489696 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ That's what it says.  Jonathan Doe.
L489695 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ You're sure you're reading that right? John Doe?
L489694 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Saint Thomas Aquinas.  He wrote about the seven deadly sins.
L489693 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ The Writings of Saint Thomas Aqu... Aquin...
L489692 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ That is.
L489691 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ The Marquis de Sade and Origins of Sadism.
L489690 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ It's not what you think it is.
L489689 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Modern Homicide Investigation.  In Cold Blood.  Of Human Bondage.  Human Bondage?
L489688 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ The Divine Comedy.  A History of Catholicism.  A book called Murderers and Madmen.
L489687 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ I know, I know... focusing on one little thing.
L489686 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ We're focusing.
L489685 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ This is a waste of time.
L489684 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ I don't.  Neither do you.
L489683 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ How do you know all about this?
L489682 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Yeah, well... at least we're out of the office.  We've got pizza.
L489681 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Yeah.  Some college student who's taking English 101 and just happens to be writing a paper on Twentieth Century Crime.
L489680 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ If you want to know who's been reading Paradise Lost, Purgatory, and say... The Life and Time of Charlie Manson, the Bureau's computer will tell you.  It might give us a name.
L489679 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ So they ran our list.
L489677 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Legal... illegal.  These terms don't apply. I don't applaud it.
L489676 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ How is this legal?
L489675 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Flagged books cover every topic the Bureau deems questionable... communism to violent crime.
L489674 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ You got to be kidding.
L489673 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ They monitor reading habits.  Not every book, but certain ones are flagged.  Books about... let's say, how to build a nuclear bomb, or maybe Mein Kampf.  Whoever takes out a flagged book has their library records fed to the F.B.I. from then on.
L489672 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ What?  Assessing fines?
L489671 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ For a long time, the F.B.I.'s been hooked into the library system, keeping accurate records.
L489670 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Him?
L489669 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ It's probably nothing, but even if it is, it's no skin off our teeth.  The man at Hot Dog World is a friend, in the Bureau.
L489668 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ It's be best if you got to the point, cause I'm about ready to punch you in the face.
L489667 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ By telling you this, I'm trusting you more than I trust most people.
L489666 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Let's go.
L489665 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Well, that was money well spent.
L489652 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ I don't know... like fifty.
L489651 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ How much money do you have?
L489648 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ What does all that matter anyway?  It's not our job to figure him out, is it?  All we have to do is catching him.
L489647 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Just, realize... this is not some common lunatic.  The type of intestinal fortitude it must take... to keep a man bound for a full year.  To connect tubes to his genitals.  To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints.  He's methodical and exacting, and worst of all, he's patient.
L489646 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Just because the bastard has a library card, it doesn't make him Einstein.
L489645 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Well, he's been right so far, hasn't he?
L489644 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ And so what?
L489643 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ This quote... his first words to us.  I looked it up.  It's from Milton's Paradise Lost.  "Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light... "
L489642 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Yes we do.  Here...
L489641 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ We don't know for sure...
L489640 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ No.  He's not depending on luck.  You've seen that.  We walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied Victor to the bed, to the day.  To the day! Because he wanted us to.
L489639 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Sooner or later his luck's goning to run out.
L489638 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ No.
L489637 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Hey, Freud, what brand of bullshit are you shoveling, huh?  Right now he's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy's panties, singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter...
L489636 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ It's a fine line between insane and inspired.
L489635 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Oh, blah, blah, blah.  The guy's insane.
L489634 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ It's too dismissive to call him a lunatic. We can't make that mistake.
L489633 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ There must be something in this pile of garbage we can follow.  I mean, Christ... do we have to let this lunatic make all the moves.
L489632 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ This is the job.  It's not an Easter egg hunt.
L489631 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ I'm sick of sitting around, waiting for him to kill again.
L489630 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Who pays the rent on time.
L489629 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ A landlord's dream tenant: a paralyzed man with no tongue.
L489628 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Victor's landlord says an envelope of cash was in the office mailbox each month.  He says, quote, "I never heard a single complaint from the tenant in apartment three-o-one, and nobody ever complained about him.  He's the best tenant I've ever had.
L489620 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Oh, it's alright.
L489619 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Sorry about that... I just...
L489618 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well.
L489617 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ How do those cockroaches get here so quick?
L489608 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ He'll string us along all the way if we're not careful.
L489607 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ I don't know about you, but I feed off my emotions.
L489606 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ We have to divorce ourselves from emotions here.  No matter how hard it is, we have to stay focused on the details.
L489605 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ No kidding!  No fucking kidding!
L489604 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Listen to me.  He's all about playing games.
L489603 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ I want him bad.  I don't just want to catch him anymore.  I want to hurt him.
L489602 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ The way this has gone till now, I wouldn't have thought it was possible, but we may have underestimated this guy.
L489586 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Call an ambulance.
L489585 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ It is Victor.
L489572 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Sounds like he knew what he was talking about.
L489571 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I can't remember where, but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this, you have to have the ability to kill.  I think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, too survive.
L489570 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ I expected it to be bad, you know.  I took a human life... but I slept like a baby that night.  I never gave it a second thought.
L489569 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ How was it?
L489568 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ I got him.  I got the son-of-a-bitch. See, I was doing really good up till then. Lots of street busts.  I've always had this weird luck... everything always went my way, but this was wild.  I got him with one shot... right between the eyes.  Next thing I know, the mayor's pinning a medal on me.  Picture in the paper, whole nine yards.
L489567 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ How did the fire fight end?
L489565 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ It was my first one of these.  We were a secondary unit, and I was pretty shaky going in.  I was still considered a rookie.
L489564 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ And?
L489563 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Never took a bullet.  I pulled my gun once. fired it once.
L489562 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Never in my twenty-four years, knock on wood.  I've only ever taken my gun out five times with the actual intention of using it.  Never fired it though.  Not once.  You?
L489560 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Satisfy our curiosity?
L489559 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Why would we?
L489558 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ We'll tag along.
L489557 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Yes.  They were there... so, it must be.
L489556 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ The fingerprints.
L489555 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ He doesn't have the desire somehow.  Our killer seems to have more purpose.  More purpose than Victor could ever conceive of.
L489554 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ You tell me.  I'm new in town.
L489553 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Doesn't seem like our man, does it?
L489552 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Does this make it with you?
L489539 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ In this city, if all the skeletons came out of all the closets... if ever hidden body were to suddenly rise again, there'd be no more room for the living.
L489538 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ I've seen the same.  I'm not the country hick you seem to think I am.
L489537 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ I'm, sorry, but even the most promising clues usually lead only to other clues. I've seen so many corpses rolled away... unrevenged.
L489536 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Bullshit.
L489535 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ We put it in a nice neat pile and file it away, on the slim chance it's ever needed in a courtroom.  It's like collecting diamonds on a desert island.  You keep them just in case you ever get rescued, but it's a pretty big ocean out there.
L489534 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Oh, that's all.
L489533 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ All we do is pick up the pieces.  We take all the evidence, and all the pictures and samples.  We write everything down and note what time things happened...
L489532 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Then, you tell me what you think we're doing.
L489531 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ I wish I still thought like you.
L489530 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ And you don't?
L489529 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ You meant what you said to Mrs. Gould, didn't you?  About catching this guy.  You really want to believe that, don't you?
L489527 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Who the hell knows?  There's plenty of freaks out there doing dirty deeds they don't want to do.  You know... little voices tell them bad things.
L489526 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ It doesn't fit.  He doesn't want us to help him stop.
L489525 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ He just may be nuts enough.
L489523 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ No.
L489522 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Just, honestly... have you ever seen anything like this... been involved in anything like this?
L489519 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Just wait!
L489518 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Oh, yeah, sure.  You got to be kidding?!
L489517 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Bear with me.
L489516 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ What?
L489514 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ We're screwed.  He's fucking with us.
L489513 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ There must be something.
L489510 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ A switchblade.
L489509 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ What the fuck is that?
L489507 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ It's got to be.
L489506 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Nothing.
L489505 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Even if they did, those photos were taken before forensics.
L489504 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ You're sure your men didn't move this?
L489487 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Okay.  But, what?
L489486 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ What if it's not that she's seen something?  What if she's supposed to see something, but she just hasn't been given a chance to see it yet?
L489485 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ I know.
L489484 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ This is the one thing.
L489482 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ None.  Which I don't understand.  He had to get back out.
L489481 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ No witnesses of any kind?
L489480 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Totally unrelated victims.
L489479 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Nothing.
L489478 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ No fingerprints?
L489477 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Like, because someone's holding a gun on you.
L489476 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Attrition.  When you regret your sins, but not because you love God.
L489475 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Forced what?
L489474 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ For now, let's just consider the books as the murderer's inspiration. The books and sermons are about atonement for sin.  And, these murders have been like forced attrition.
L489473 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Right.  But there, pride comes first, not gluttony.  The sins are in a different order.
L489472 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Seven Terraces of Purgation.
L489471 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Yeah.  Parts of them.  Anyway, in Purgatory, Dante and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain... seeing all these other guys who sinned...
L489470 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Did you read them?
L489469 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Like in the Parson's Tale, and Dante.
L489468 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ The sins were used in medieval sermons. There were seven cardinal virtues, and then seven deadly sins, created as a learning tool, because they distract from true worship.
L489467 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Punishing.
L489466 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ He's preaching.
L489463 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ We put her in a safe house.
L489462 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ And, if it's a threat.
L489461 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Gould's wife.  She was away on business. If this means she saw anything, I don't know what.  We've questioned her at least five times.
L489460 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ This is just to satisfy my curiosity.  I'm still leaving town Saturday.
L489459 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but, uh...
L489458 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ He must have left another puzzle piece.
L489457 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ He cut along the side of his stomach.  The love handle.
L489456 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ All day Saturday, and all day Sunday.  The murderer would want Gould to take his time.  To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut?  There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?
L489455 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ The leather chair was soaked through with sweat.
L489451 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Well, his body was found Monday night, okay?  But, get this... the office was closed all day Monday.  Which means, as long as the gluttony killing was done before the weekend, our killer could've gotten in here on Friday.  He could've spent all day Saturday with Gould, and all day Sunday.
L489450 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.
L489449 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Our guy got into office, probably before the building closed and security tightened up.  Gould must have been working late.
L489448 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ I vaguely recall a large, angry man, and someone called Norton.
L489447 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ You've never seen "The Odd Couple?"  This is sick.  "The Honeymooners?!"
L489446 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ I just have to say, I can't respect any man who's never seen "Green Acres."
L489445 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ I read.  Remember reading?
L489444 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ You go to movies at least?
L489443 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ What about them?
L489442 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ What about sports?
L489441 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ All television does is teach children that it's really cool to be stupid and eat candy bars all day.
L489403 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Hello.
L489402 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ I'd like you to meet Somerset.
L489398 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Tonight.
L489397 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ How's that?
L489396 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ I'm invited to have a late supper at your house.  And, I accept.
L489395 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Well?
L489393 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ What?
L489392 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ It's my wife.
L489390 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Detective Mills here.  Honey... I asked you not to call me here. I'll call you back...  What?  Why?
L489389 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ It's a package deal.  You get the phone with the office.
L489330 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Can we talk about this in private?
L489329 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ It's too soon for him.
L489318 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Whoa, whoa... what?!
L489317 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ I'm declining this case.  I want us reassigned.
L489315 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ This is a premeditated puzzle, and it's only the beginning.
L489314 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ This is his stuff.  I've been out in the cold all day.
