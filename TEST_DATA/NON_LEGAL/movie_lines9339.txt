L457211 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ Your words drove Bouchon to --
L457210 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ Oh, I'm to be blamed now, am I?
L456987 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ Your wig. Remove your wig.
L456986 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ It's a potent aphrodisiac, isn't it? Power over another man.
L456980 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ NOW STRIP.
L456979 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ Oh, but you must, my pumpkin! Sex without flirtation is merely rape!
L456978 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ I DO NOT MEAN TO FLIRT, MARQUIS!
L456977 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ Coulmier, you animal!
L456976 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ OFF WITH YOUR CLOTHES!
L456975 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ I wasn't talking about Madeleine.
L456974 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ You expect me to pimp Madeleine?
L456973 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ A night spent with the partner of my choice.
L456972 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ What on earth would that require?
L456971 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ I could be convinced to abandon my writing, quite voluntarily.
L456970 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ What in God's name am I to do with you? The more I forbid, the more you're provoked!
L456969 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ A man after my own heart...
L456968 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ If it were up to the Doctor, you'd be flayed alive.
L456937 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ Morbid gratification? NO! I write what I've seen; the endless procession to the chopping block. We're all lined up at the guillotine, waiting for the crunch of the blade. Rivers of blood are flowing beneath our feet, Abbe.
L456936 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ Its horrors, perhaps! Its darkest nightmares! And to what end? Nothing but your own morbid gratification --
L456935 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ I DIDN'T CREATE THIS WORLD OF OURS! I ONLY RECORD IT!
L456934 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ Because your writing continues, unchecked.
L456933 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ WHY THIS SUDDEN TORTURE?
L456932 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ -- and your meat shall be de-boned.
L456931 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ -- water! --
L456930 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ Orvolle. His wine.  From now on, nothing but water at every meal --
L456929 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ Virgin birth -- ha! An entire religion, built on an oxymoron!
L456925 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ Valcour. His chair.
L456924 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ That's a Turkish weave, you numbskull; it costs more than you'll earn in your lifetime --
L456923 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ And my chaise -- am I being denied the privilege of sitting -- of plopping down my ass --
L456922 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ His rug.
L456921 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ My bed, gone! Am I to freeze to death?
L456799 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ THEN BUGGER ME!
L456798 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ Good day, Marquis.
L456797 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ You're tense, darling. You could use a long, slow screw.
L456796 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ That's enough.
L456795 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ "Part the gates of heaven," as it were --
L456794 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ I don't know who you insult more; her or me.
L456793 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ Madeleine. She's besotted with me; she'd do anything I ask. She could pay you a midnight visit --
L456792 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ You always do.
L456791 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ I have a proposition.
L456790 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ Whores and pederasts? You're better off without them.
L456789 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ I'll die of loneliness! I've no company but the characters I create --
L456788 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ You know what sacrilege is, don't you? The last refuge of the failed provocateur.
L456787 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ That monstrous God of yours? He strung up his very own son like a side of veal; I shudder to think what He'd do to me.
L456786 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ Start with the Bible; it's cheerier, and more artfully written.
L456785 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ Try reading, for a change. The writer who produces more than he reads? The sure mark of an amateur.
L456784 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ You can't --! You mustn't --! I've all the demons of hell in my head; my only salvation is to vent them on paper --
L456783 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ Perhaps -- in time -- you'll earn them back through good behavior --
L456781 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ If you won't be true to your word, then you've left me no choice.
L456780 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ What the devil --
L456779 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ We held a mirror up to the Doctor, and -- apparently -- he didn't like what he saw.
L456778 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ How can one man possibly be so selfish?
L456777 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ He can't do that to me.
L456765 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ Don't be absurd; it's only a play.
L456764 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ You mean to take us all down with you?
L456665 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ Honestly! You cut me to the core! What's the point of all your valiant attempts at rehabilitation if -- when I finally succumb -- when at long last, I pledge myself to righteous conduct -- you regard me with nothing but suspicion? Have you no faith in your own medicine?
L456664 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ If you only mean to dupe me again --
L456661 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ Do I have your word?
L456660 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ You've a touch of the poet, too; perhaps you should take up the quill.
L456658 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ You among them?
L456657 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ Fuck 'em! They're half-wits and pinheads. Let 'em die on the streets, as Nature intended.
L456656 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ Put yourself in my place. I've your fellow patients to consider. If Charenton falls, they've no place to go. No manner in which to clothe or feed themselves --
L456655 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ Mightier than the sword indeed.
L456654 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ Our future lies in the stroke of your pen.
L456653 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ They can't be serious.
L456652 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure.
L456651 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?
L456650 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ One more trick like this, and I'll be forced to revoke all your liberties!
L456649 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ I thought that was your duty, Abbe, not mine.
L456648 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?
L456647 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.
L456646 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ But we also fall in love; we build cities, we compose symphonies, and we endure. Why not put that in your books as well?
L456645 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ I write of the great, eternal truths that bind together all mankind! The whole world over, we eat, we shit, we fuck, we kill and we die.
L456644 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ And such puny scope! Nothing but the very worst in man's nature!
L456643 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ There I was taxed; it's true.
L456642 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ It's not even a proper novel! It's nothing but an encyclopedia of perversions! Frankly, it even fails as an exercise in craft. The characters are wooden; the dialogue is inane. Not to mention the endless repetition of words like "nipple" and "pikestaff" --
L456641 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ And --?
L456640 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ Enough to discern its tenor.
L456639 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ Have you truly read the book in question? Or did you run -- straightaway -- to the dog-eared pages?
L456638 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ But you've no right to publish! Behind my back, without my sanction!
L456637 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ But you implored me to write! For curative purposes, to stave off my madness --
L456636 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ What did you do? Bribe one of the guards?
L456635 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ Yes! It is! The paper's cheap, the type's too small --
L456563 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ I'll fill page after page, I promise.
L456562 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ Take your pen in hand, Marquis. Purge these wicked thoughts of yours on paper; maybe they'll govern you less in life.
L456561 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ Don't be so sure.
L456560 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
L456559 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ I'm entertaining you now, aren't I?
L456558 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ In exchange, we ask only that you follow the rules. Now you know as well as I do... you're not to entertain visitors in your quarters.
L456557 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ It's true, dear-heart, you've spoiled me pink.
L456556 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ We treat you well enough here, don't we Marquis? Your very own featherbed, in lieu of a straw mat. Your antique writing desk, all the way from LaCoste. Enough quills to feather an ostrich --
L456555 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ I should've told you it was the blood of Christ; you'd believe that, wouldn't you?
L456551 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ Conversation, like certain portions of the anatomy, always runs more smoothly when it's lubricated.
L456550 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ It's not even noon --
L456549 +++$+++ u2544 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ THE MARQUIS +++$+++ Care for a splash of wine, Abbe?
L457293 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ Gibberish, my friend. He rants and he raves --
L457292 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ I've stared into the face of evil...  ...and I've lived to tell the tale. Now... for your own sake... let me write it down.
L457253 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ No, sir. Plainly put, I never expect to sleep again.
L457252 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ Will you sleep soundly tonight?
L457251 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ I'm not the first man God has asked to shed blood in His name. I will not be the last.
L457250 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ And you? It must've been an ordeal.
L457249 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ Poorly.
L457248 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ How is the patient faring?
L457247 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ And my own.
L457246 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ My, my. You have exceeded my expectations.
L457206 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ HER NAME, ABBE.
L457205 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ I beg you, Doctor, don't make me say it.
L457204 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ Perhaps you'll be so kind as to remind me of her name...
L457203 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ He was so impressed with the Marquis' tale that he chose to re-enact it, yes?
L457202 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ As you say, Doctor.
L457002 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ You'd suffer in her stead?
L457001 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ If only blood will appease you, then shed mine.
L456996 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ Madeleine's not wicked. It's the Marquis who's corrupted her. That's not her fault; it's mine.
L456995 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ This child let loose the beast from its cage --
L456994 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children --
L456993 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ He'll do no such thing.
L456909 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ What could cause a tincture like this?
L456908 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ You'll get more from her with kindness than you will with force.
L456775 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ Do more. Otherwise, I'll be forced to report to the Ministry that the inmates are indeed running the asylum.
L456774 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ I'll do everything in my power --
L456773 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ -- a veritable freak show for tourists and curiosity seekers. Charenton is a sanatorium; she is not a circus. The theater is henceforth closed. As for your avowed friend -- playwright emeritus of the madhouse --
L456772 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ That's not our intent --
L456771 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ You ought to be ashamed, Abbe. Exploiting those drooling, pathetic cretins for financial gain --
L456770 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ No. It most certainly was not.
L456769 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ It was not inspired by circumstance.
L456768 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ Of course.
L456767 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ It was fiction, of course.
L456724 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ Oh indeed?
L456723 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ Madame Bougival; Mademoiselle Clairwil -- and of course -- the Marquis' wife --
L456676 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ -- then I've friends of my own to visit.
L456675 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ I have.
L456674 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ You keep strange company, Abbe. But if you truly have matters in hand here --
L456673 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ He's more than a patient, Doctor; the Marquis is my friend --
L456672 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ He's sworn to obedience.
L456671 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ And --?
L456670 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here.
L456669 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ Well?
L456626 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ Charenton is my life's work. To have her wrested from beneath me now --
L456625 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ And place my reputation at stake?
L456624 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ On the contrary. Let me take up this matter with the Marquis myself --
L456623 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ You find this amusing, do you?
L456622 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ A practical man, sir. Given the Marquis' unusual tastes, a sound thrashing on bare flesh may not qualify as a deterrent.
L456621 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ You're a sentimental man.
L456620 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ Why? So he'll learn to fear punishment, rather than pursue virtue for its own reward?
L456619 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ Have you tried bleeding him with leeches? The calming chair? Maybe you should flog him at the stake?
L456618 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ But he's one among some two hundred wards --
L456617 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ In their eyes, the Marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here.
L456616 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ Shut down?
L456615 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ Unless we set Charenton on a straight and narrow course, she'll be shut down forever by order of the Emperor.
L456614 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ Yes?
L456613 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ Abbe, I admire you; I do. You've a conviction... an idealism... peculiar to the very young. And so I'll be candid. The Ministry has sent me here with the most explicit... the most severe instructions.
L456612 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ I've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them.
L456611 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ All France is aghast at this book, yet you've not heard of it?
L456610 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ You have to believe me, I had no idea --
L456608 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ For sale? To the general public? Certainly not; it's unprintable.
L456607 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ Do you favor its publication?
L456606 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ It's essential to his recovery; a purgative for the toxins in his mind.
L456605 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ Well...?
L456604 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ Oh. That.
L456603 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ And his writing?
L456602 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ He no longer roars or spits. He no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards --
L456601 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ What is the impact of all these amenities upon his psyche?
L456600 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ Besides, every wholesome thing he might desire, he has at Charenton. A library, filled with the world's great books, music lessons, watercolor exercises --
L456599 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ A man of his notoriety? He wouldn't last a day on the streets without capture.
L456598 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ And he's never once attempted escape?

L456596 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ His wife's?
L456595 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ His wife's influence.
L456594 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ Why is he in your care, and not a proper prison?
L456589 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ Playing dress-up with cretins? That sounds like a symptom of madness; not its cure.
L456588 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ He's made a great success of our Little Theater; there's seldom an empty seat. Not to mention its therapeutic value.
L456587 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ I hope you'll judge him by his progress here, and not his past reputation.
L456586 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ Indiscretions, Abbe? Please. I've read his case history. At sixteen, he violated a serving girl with a crucifix. After six months in the dungeon at Vincennes, he mutilated a prostitute, cutting her flesh with a razor, then cauterizing the wounds with wax --
L456585 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ A few indiscretions in his youth.
L456584 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ I understand he practices the very crimes he preaches in his fiction.
L456577 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ It seems a particular patient of yours has captured his fancy.
L456576 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ If you don't mind my asking... why has the Emperor taken such sudden interest in my... our... affairs?
L456575 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ I'll need an office on the grounds; someplace to store my things.
L456574 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ You're a man of Science; I'm a man of God. Charenton stands to profit from us both, I'm certain.
L456573 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ It's a formality; truly.
L456572 +++$+++ u2532 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ COULMIER +++$+++ Of course.
L456571 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ This may feel a tad awkward, my friend, but it needn't be. I've merely come to oversee your work here; understood?

L456469 +++$+++ u2533 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ DELBENÈ +++$+++ Of course, Your Highness. Nevertheless... cure the Marquis de Sade... succeed, where countless physicians and priests have failed...
L456468 +++$+++ u2540 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ But I am history.
L456467 +++$+++ u2533 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ DELBENÈ +++$+++ A word of caution, Sire: we all remember what happened to Robespierre, Danton and Marat. Put the Marquis to death, and history might even regard you as a despot.
L456466 +++$+++ u2540 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ As for the author... shoot him.
L456464 +++$+++ u2540 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ NAPOLEON +++$+++ Enough!
L456463 +++$+++ u2533 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ DELBENÈ +++$+++ "As he loosened his manhood from beneath his robes, The Bishop muttered a Latin prayer. And then -- with a mighty thrust -- drove it into her very entrails --"
L456697 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ I don't shed tears over the past, Monsieur Delbenè; I look to the future.

L456482 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ Do you know how I define "idealism," Monsieur Delbenè?
L456481 +++$+++ u2533 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ DELBENÈ +++$+++ I'm afraid so; he's an idealist. You'll have to be politic.
L456480 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ Charenton? The administrator there is quite well-loved, is he not?
L456476 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ I don't seek popularity or renown, Monsieur Delbenè. Mine is a higher mission.
L456475 +++$+++ u2533 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ DELBENÈ +++$+++ Quite.
L456474 +++$+++ u2542 +++$+++ m164 +++$+++ ROYER-COLLARD +++$+++ But here at the Hotel Dieu we favor an... aggressive... course of treatment.
