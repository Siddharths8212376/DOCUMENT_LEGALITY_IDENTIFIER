L83670 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?
L83659 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Make him stop.
L83658 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ You can see my predicament. My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish.
L84239 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ I see. We need to get you one of those plant misters. We can spray you like a fern.
L84238 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I was drying out.
L84104 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Go out with me.
L84103 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ How can I convince you to stop?
L84086 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I have the rest of my life to find out.
L84085 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ You don't even know me.
L84084 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way I could get my wife to marry me.
L84083 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ How did you get so many?
L84082 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ They're your favorite flower.
L84081 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Daffodils?
L84074 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you.
L84073 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Oh.
L84071 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Don't need to apologize to me. I mean, I'm the luckiest person you're going to find today...
L84070 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L84229 +++$+++ u496 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ NORTHER WINSLOW +++$+++ Edward, it's got your deposit slip on it.
L84228 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ 'Fraid so.
L84227 +++$+++ u496 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ NORTHER WINSLOW +++$+++ This is it? The whole vault.
L84218 +++$+++ u496 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ NORTHER WINSLOW +++$+++ I'm robbing this place.
L84217 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ So what are you up to now?
L84216 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ That's great, Norther. I'm happy for you. I can't believe I helped.
L84215 +++$+++ u496 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ NORTHER WINSLOW +++$+++ I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.
L84214 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I don't believe it!
L84213 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas.
L84212 +++$+++ u496 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ NORTHER WINSLOW +++$+++ It's me. Norther Winslow.
L83915 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ You're a poet. You oughta be able to. And maybe if you'd seen more, you could.
L83914 +++$+++ u496 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ NORTHER WINSLOW +++$+++ I can't imagine any place better than here.
L83913 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
L83912 +++$+++ u496 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ NORTHER WINSLOW +++$+++ This is why you don't show work in progress.
L83910 +++$+++ u496 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ NORTHER WINSLOW +++$+++ There's a lot of expectation. I don't want to disappoint my fans.
L83909 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Really.
L83908 +++$+++ u496 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ NORTHER WINSLOW +++$+++ I've been working on this poem for 12 years.
L83903 +++$+++ u496 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ NORTHER WINSLOW +++$+++ There is no softer ground than town.
L83902 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Wait! I need those!
L84326 +++$+++ u493 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Well, therapy. And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back. I was living in a fairy tale.
L84325 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You didn't become crazy.
L84324 +++$+++ u493 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
L84323 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young.
L84267 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about. I'm just trying to reconcile the two.
L84266 +++$+++ u493 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this. You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it. Especially this late in the game.
L84265 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Because he's dying.
L84264 +++$+++ u493 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?
L84263 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I've seen him with women. He flirts. He always has. On some level, I presumed he was cheating on my mother. I just never had proof.
L84262 +++$+++ u493 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.
L84261 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Were you and my father having an affair?
L84260 +++$+++ u493 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. Everyone in town knew him.
L84259 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ How did you know my father?
L84255 +++$+++ u493 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ I am. And you're Will. I've seen your picture, that's how I recognize you. I almost said something at the store, but it would have been awkward.  Like this.
L84254 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Are you Jenny Hill?
L84253 +++$+++ u493 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ I wasn't expecting you.
L84252 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Hello.
L84251 +++$+++ u493 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Oh. Oh.
L84351 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ I loved it. It sounds peculiar, but I loved every minute of it. I did. Eddie was travelling a lot, so he was gone, but I felt like I always had a piece of him with me. A little part of his soul inside me. I could feel it. It was alive and kicking.
L84350 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ I do.
L84349 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Do you like it, being pregnant?
L84348 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ I know. It was the same when I was carrying Will. Like clockwork.
L84347 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ I'm sorry. It seems every hour I have to...
L84200 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ I need to lie down for a bit.
L84199 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ I'm going to check on him.
L84175 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ I'll help you.
L84174 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ I'm going to get started on dishes.
L83955 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ We'll have to pick up a copy.
L83954 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ I spent a week in Morocco for the story. It was incredible.
L83758 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Down the hall on the right. The door sticks. You have to really pull it.
L83757 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ Yes.
L83756 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Thank you. I'll bet you need to --
L84336 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Is he going to be okay?
L84335 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.
L84334 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ What happened?
L84164 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ I am always on your side. And I think you should talk to him.
L84163 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I need you on my side.
L84162 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ You're not.
L84161 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Look, I know why you like him. I know why everyone likes him. But I need you to tell me I'm not crazy.
L84160 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ What is "true?" I've never heard my father say a single true thing.
L84159 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ But it's not true.
L84158 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You have to understand. When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was here. And I started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else. With another house, another family. He leaves us, he goes to them. Or maybe there is no family. Maybe he never wanted a family. But whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life better. And the reason he tells all those stories is because he can't stand this boring place.
L84157 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ Do you love him?
L84156 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.
L84155 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ Do you love your father?
L84154 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Mmm, what. I know better than to argue romance with a French woman.
L84153 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ Mmm, what?
L84152 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Mmm.
L84151 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ But it's romantic.
L84150 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ That's because most of it never happened.
L84149 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
L84148 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ They met at Auburn.
L84147 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ You never told me how your parents met.
L84146 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Did you?
L84145 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ I talked with your father last night.
L83701 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ I'm going with you.
L83700 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You don't have to.
L83699 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ I'm going with you.
L83698 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Probably tonight.
L83697 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ You need to go.
L83696 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo.
L83695 +++$+++ u494 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ JOSEPHINE +++$+++ It's bad.
L84346 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Yes. Thank you.
L84345 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Mom, do you want some time with Dad?
L84341 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ That's okay?
L84340 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I'll stay. Why don't you go home with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.
L84339 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ I don't suppose one of us could stay with him. In case he...  In case he wakes up, one of us should be there.
L84249 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Heavens no. We had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place.
L84248 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ So you never bought any land.
L84247 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
L84246 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Did you and Dad have any other property?
L84245 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Yes?
L84244 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Mom?
L84243 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
L84242 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Is he awake?
L84198 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication.
L84197 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ That really happened?
L83982 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Do you know who that is?
L83981 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.
L83980 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Was she one of your teachers?
L83979 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde hair.
L83978 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Before I forget, your father has papers in the basement I'd like you to go through. I wouldn't know what's important.
L83977 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Well, clearly you don't. But I'm not the mystery you're trying to solve right now.
L83976 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ But I understand you, Mom. I always have.
L83975 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ I know it's not easy. Just remember, he didn't choose to be your father and you didn't choose to be his son. You just ended up together. You could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it'd be just the same. If you ask me, it's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all.
L83974 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ True. But I've known him my whole life, and I don't feel like I know him at all. Or ever will.
L83973 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.
L83972 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Josephine and I have a lot in common.
L83971 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ No it's not. It's exactly the same. Your father and I met, we dated, and we married -- we chose each other -- because we understood each other on some fundamental level. Just the same as you two.
L83970 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Yes. But that's a different...
L83969 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Would you say you understand Josephine?
L83968 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know.
L83967 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.
L83966 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Yes.
L83965 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?
L83964 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Of course.
L83963 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Mom, would you say you understand Dad?
L83953 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Really! That's wonderful.
L83952 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I don't know if you've seen it, but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek.
L83764 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ You don't talk about those things. Not yet.
L83763 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ How much time does he have left?
L83762 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
L83761 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ How is he?
L83760 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ He's up with your father.
L83759 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
L83751 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ You didn't need to do that. You just didn't.
L83750 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ We rented a car.
L83749 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
L83748 +++$+++ u498 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
L83747 +++$+++ u497 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ How did you get here?
L85802 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ The sets were excellent. Everything was big, you know, all the rubbish, coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, so when you were watching it you felt cat size. It was really clever.
L85801 +++$+++ u499 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ ALEXEI +++$+++ The sets were good.
L85800 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.
L85799 +++$+++ u499 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ ALEXEI +++$+++ Yeah it was okay.
L85796 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ I paid for those guitar cases.
L85795 +++$+++ u499 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ ALEXEI +++$+++ Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff
L85794 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ When we went to the Hard Rock Cafe. Who paid? When we went to see 'Cats'. Who paid?
L85793 +++$+++ u499 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ ALEXEI +++$+++ Such as?
L85792 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
L85791 +++$+++ u499 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ ALEXEI +++$+++ I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.
L85790 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ No I don't.
L85789 +++$+++ u499 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ ALEXEI +++$+++ You know what for.
L85788 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ What for?
L85787 +++$+++ u499 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ ALEXEI +++$+++ Put it in the cases. Split it up. And don't forget you owe me £150.
L85783 +++$+++ u504 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ YURI +++$+++ Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.
L85782 +++$+++ u499 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ ALEXEI +++$+++ You first.
L86050 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ No I haven't.
L86049 +++$+++ u499 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ ALEXEI +++$+++ You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.
L86048 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Leave him!
L86047 +++$+++ u499 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ ALEXEI +++$+++ What. You're what? You're with this creep now.
L86045 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L86044 +++$+++ u499 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ ALEXEI +++$+++ What? What are you doing?
L85832 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Name it.
L85831 +++$+++ u499 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ ALEXEI +++$+++ A baby? What are we supposed to do with a baby?
L85829 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.
L85828 +++$+++ u499 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ ALEXEI +++$+++ What?
L85826 +++$+++ u499 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ ALEXEI +++$+++ Thank you.
L85825 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Say thank you.
L85824 +++$+++ u499 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ ALEXEI +++$+++ Yeah.
L85823 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Do you like it?
L85816 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ It is. I did it cooking.
L85815 +++$+++ u499 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ ALEXEI +++$+++ That's not a burn.
L85814 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ It's nothing. I burnt myself.
L85813 +++$+++ u499 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ ALEXEI +++$+++ What's this?
L85812 +++$+++ u499 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ ALEXEI +++$+++ We'll stop then.
L85811 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Yes.
L85810 +++$+++ u499 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ ALEXEI +++$+++ Do you want to stop?
L85809 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.
L85808 +++$+++ u499 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ ALEXEI +++$+++ What do you mean?
L85807 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ It's enough isn't it?
L85785 +++$+++ u499 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ ALEXEI +++$+++ There's over eighty thousand here.
L85784 +++$+++ u502 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ NADIA +++$+++ Sixty four thousand, eight hundred.
L85760 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Right.
L85759 +++$+++ u500 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ BRANCH MANAGER +++$+++ I thought you could give us the tour this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide.
L85758 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Hello.
L85710 +++$+++ u501 +++$+++ m31 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Uh... Yes.
