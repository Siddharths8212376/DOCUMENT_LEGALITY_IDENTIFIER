L341671 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ But then I would've missed the pleasure of your company.
L341670 +++$+++ u6265 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CHILTON +++$+++ You might have suggested that in my office, and saved me the time.
L341669 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Dr. Chilton - if Lecter feels you're his enemy - as you've said - then maybe I'll have more luck by myself. What do you think?
L341667 +++$+++ u6265 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CHILTON +++$+++ I'm going to show you why we insist on such precautions... On the afternoon of July 8, 1981, he complained of chest pains and was taken to the dispensary. His mouthpiece and restraints were removed for an EKG. When the nurse bent over him, he did this to her...
L341666 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ I understand.
L341665 +++$+++ u6265 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CHILTON +++$+++ Do not reach through the bars, do not touch the bars. You pass him nothing but soft paper - no pens or pencils. No staples or paperclips in his paper. Use the sliding food carrier, no exceptions. Do not accept anything he attempts to hold out to you. Do you understand me?
L341664 +++$+++ u6265 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CHILTON +++$+++ Good. Then you should be able to remember the rules.
L341663 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor. It's not a charm school.
L341662 +++$+++ u6265 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CHILTON +++$+++ A pretty young woman, to turn him on? I don't believe Lecter's ever seen a woman in eight years. And oh, are you ever his "taste" - so to speak.
L341661 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?
L341660 +++$+++ u6265 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CHILTON +++$+++ Lecter carved up nine people - that we're sure of - and cooked his favorite bits. We've tried to study him, of course - but he's much too sophisticated for the standard tests. And my, does he hate us! Thinks I'm his nemesis... Crawford's very clever, isn't he? Using you.
L341659 +++$+++ u6265 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CHILTON +++$+++ I see.  Let's make this quick, then. I'm busy.
L341658 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ I'm sure it's a great town, Dr. Chilton, but my instructions are to talk to Lecter and report back this afternoon.
L342263 +++$+++ u6270 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ KRENDLER +++$+++ The market in Lecter hints is way down, today, okay? I've got two good men dead in Memphis, and three civilians. I've got -
L342262 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ But then he had to cover up, make her seem just like all the rest of them. That's what Lecter was hinting!
L342261 +++$+++ u6270 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ KRENDLER +++$+++ Starling -
L342260 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Maybe he lives in this, this Belvedere, Ohio, too! Maybe he saw her every day, and killed her sort of spontaneously. Maybe he just meant to... give her a 7-Up and talk about the choir. But then -
L342122 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Yes sir. I can find it by myself.
L342121 +++$+++ u6270 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ KRENDLER +++$+++ Do you need a police escort, Starling? Or do you think you can find the airport by yourself?
L342120 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Sir, doesn't this "William Rubin" strike you as - I don't know - kind of vague?
L342119 +++$+++ u6270 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ KRENDLER +++$+++ He gave us a perfectly good description, and we're on it now, so we won't be needing your little novelty act any longer - or his, either. He's under close guard at the courthouse, pending a prison transfer. The next plane, Officer.
L342118 +++$+++ u6270 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ KRENDLER +++$+++ Lecter has already named Buffalo Bill.
L342117 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Mr. Krendler... Dr. Lecter trusts me. Or at least, he used to. If I could just -
L342116 +++$+++ u6270 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ KRENDLER +++$+++ Gun. Jesus. Turn in the ID as soon as you get back. The gun, too. Be on the next plane, Starling, there's one in 90 minutes.
L342115 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ I need the ID to fly with my gun. The gun belongs in Quantico.
L342114 +++$+++ u6270 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ KRENDLER +++$+++ Your instructions are what I'm giving you now. Jack Crawford answers to the Director, and the Director answers to me. My God, Crawford's losing it...! He shouldn't even be on this, with his wife sick as she is... How the hell did you get in here, anyway? He gave you - what? Some kind of special ID? Let's have it.
L342113 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Sir, Mr. Crawford instructed me -
L342112 +++$+++ u6270 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ KRENDLER +++$+++ You're out of line, Starling, and you're off this case. Back to Quantico.
L341776 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Not yet! - just wait for me.  Maybe in about two seconds.
L341775 +++$+++ u6272 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ MR. YOW +++$+++ Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better come out now, Miss Starling.
L341774 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Mr. Yow? Oh Mr. Yow...? It looks like somebody is sitting in this car.
L341773 +++$+++ u6272 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ MR. YOW +++$+++ Oh.
L341772 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ That wasn't me.
L341771 +++$+++ u6272 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ MR. YOW +++$+++ You're playing a piano, Miss Starling?
L341770 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Okay, Mr. Yow...
L341769 +++$+++ u6272 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ MR. YOW +++$+++ Okay, Miss Starling?
L341768 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Good idea.
L341767 +++$+++ u6272 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ MR. YOW +++$+++ Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks? To prevent mouse intrusion.
L341766 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Mr. Yow, if this door should fall down -ha ha! - or anything else - would you be kind enough to call this number? It's our Baltimore field office. They know you're here with me... Do you understand?
L341761 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ I won't disturb anything, Mr. Yow, I promise. Be gone before you know it.
L341760 +++$+++ u6272 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ MR. YOW +++$+++ Not to my knowledge. Privacy is a great concern to my customers. But, if you say this is an FBI matter...
L342352 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Did she leave any records here? Tax or business records? Maybe a list of employees?
L342351 +++$+++ u6271 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ MR. GUMB +++$+++ Yes. I bought the house from her, two years ago.
L342350 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Mr. Gordon, did you take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died?
L342349 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ I think we may be, yes.
L342348 +++$+++ u6271 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ MR. GUMB +++$+++ Are they close to catching somebody, do you think?
L342345 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Thanks.
L342344 +++$+++ u6271 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ MR. GUMB +++$+++ Mrs. Lippman had a son, maybe he could help you. I have his card somewhere. Do you mind stepping inside, while I looks for it?
L342343 +++$+++ u6271 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ MR. GUMB +++$+++ No. Wait... Was she a great, fat person? I may have seen her, I'm not sure...
L342342 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Mr. Gordon, did you know Fredrica when she worked for Mrs. Lippman?
L342341 +++$+++ u6271 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ MR. GUMB +++$+++ Jack Gordon.
L342340 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ I'm investigating the death of Fredrica Bimmel. Who are you, please?
L342339 +++$+++ u6271 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ MR. GUMB +++$+++ Just briefly. What's the problem, Officer?
L342338 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Excuse me, but I really do need to talk to you. This was Mrs. Lippman's house. Did you know her?
L342318 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Yes sir. Thank you, sir...
L342317 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ Starling - you've earned back your place in the Academy. We never would've found him without you, and nobody's ever going to forget that. Least of all me.
L342316 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Yes sir... I'll do my best.
L342315 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ No, Starling, there isn't time. And you've still got crucial work to do in Ohio. We want him for murder, not kidnapping. I'm counting on you to link him to the Bimmel girl, before he's indicted.
L342314 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Chicago's only about 400 miles from here. I could be there in -
L342313 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ Take a bow. Customs had some paper on his alias. They stopped a carton two years ago at LAX - live caterpillars from Surinam. The addressee was "John Grant." Calumet Power & Light's given us two possible residences under that alias. We're hitting one, Chicago SWAT's taking the other.
L342312 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Sewing...
L342311 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ This Gumb's a real beauty. Slaughtered both his grandparents when he was twelve, and did nine years in juvenile psychiatric. Where, Starling, he took vocational rehab, and learned a useful trade...
L342310 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ Johns Hopkins finally came up with a name for us. We fed him into Known Offenders, and he came up cherries.  Subject's name is "Jamie Gumb," AKA "John Grant." Lecter's description was accurate, he just lied about the name.
L342309 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Sir, that's great news. But how -
L342307 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Where?
L342306 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ Starling, we know who he is! And where he is. We're on our way now.
L342305 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ That's why they're all so big - because he needs a lot of skin! He keeps them alive to starve them awhile - to loosen their skin, so that -
L342304 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ Starling -
L342303 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ He's making himself a "woman suit," Mr. Crawford - out of real women! And he can sew, this guy, he's really skilled. A dressmaker, or a tailor -
L342280 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ He's going to kill her, Mr. Crawford. This morning, or maybe at noon, but today, and Belvedere's our last chance. I'm flying there, right now, unless you stop me. You want my ID? Here - take it...
L342279 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ With ID and a gun...? Impersonating a federal agent is a felony.
L342278 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to.
L342277 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I won't disobey orders, not even now.
L342276 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ But not from this angle. Not thinking he knew her. You've got to send me!
L342275 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ Ohio is cold ground. Picked over, ten months ago. Our people worked it, so did the locals.
L342274 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ You do until six p.m.
L342273 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ You heard them. I don't have that authority anymore.
L342272 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ All his victims are women... His obsession is women, he lives to hunt women. But not one women is hunting him - except me. I can walk in a woman's room and know three times as much about her as a man would.  I have to go to Belvedere.
L342076 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ They'll use their best men. But they better be paying attention...
L342075 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter?
L342074 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ Good idea. Meantime, try to get a feel for Catherine Martin. Her apartment, her friends... how he might've stalked her. I'm going to the other two clinics, Minnesota and Ohio.  Now's the hardest part, Starling. Use your anger, don't let it keep you from thinking. Just keep your eyes on Catherine. We've got less than 30 hours.
L342073 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ I lied to Lecter. I'll need some kind of peace offering... Can I get the drawings from his cell?
L342072 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ Or just as worthless. But I want you in Memphis, close to him. Maybe when he gets tired of toying with Senator Martin, he'll talk to you again. There's a plane waiting for you now at the airstrip.
L342071 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Lecter is still the key, I know he is. Whatever he told me about Bill is just as good now as it was before.
L342070 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ If you didn't want me chasing him, you shouldn't have taken me to that funeral home.
L342069 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have to retire in two years. It's not a consideration. But you are...  You've done enough. If I keep you out of school any longer, you'll be recycled. Cost you six months, at least. I can guarantee you readmission here, but that's about it.  Now's your chance, Starling. Go back to class. Leave Bill to me.
L342068 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Are you in trouble over this, Mr. Crawford? Can Senator Martin do something to you?
L342067 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ Let's get some coffee and talk.
L342066 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Chilton has killed her, hasn't he? That slimy little bastard! We were so close with Lecter - and now her last chance is gone.
L341969 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ She doesn't know what we're up to. And we can't afford to let her find out.
L341968 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ You'll back me up with some paperwork?  Then I'll try. But wouldn't this have more weight coming from the Senator herself?
L341967 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ State to federal jurisdiction... We can do it - eventually - but we'll never get all the clearances in time. Can you convince him a deal's already in place?
L341966 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?
L341965 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ What would it take?
L341964 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ I think he means it, this time. I think he'll deal.
L341963 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ If we act too anxious, he'll make us wait. He'll let the Senator keep hoping, day after day, until Catherine finally washes up. That'd be the most fun of all.
L341962 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ But if he knew we have so little time -
L341961 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ He offered to help, Starling, not to snitch. That wouldn't give him enough chance to show off. Remember, Lecter looks mainly for fun. Never forget fun.
L341960 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ He's already offered to help... What would happen if we just showed our cards - asked him for Bill?
L341959 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ But for Catherine Martin, it all comes down to you and Lecter. You're the one he talks to.
L341908 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Raspail was killed by the same man who's killing these girls. And Lecter knows him. Maybe even treated him... You think so, too, don't you? Or you'd never have sent me to that asylum.
L341907 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ You seem pretty sure of that.
L341906 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Then have the lab check Raspail's head.  Dr. Lecter's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues... They'll find another cocoon.
L341905 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. I'll do it if I have to, but -
L341904 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ I'm wondering if he's done that before - placed a cocoon, or an insect. It would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater... Can we check back on that?
L341903 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ When we get back, I want you to run that bug by the Smithsonian, see if they can identify it. Maybe it's got some limited range, or it only breeds at certain times of year... You found it, Starling, you deserve the credit.
L341902 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ Point taken.
L341901 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters.
L341900 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ When I told that sheriff we shouldn't talk in front of a woman, that really burned you, didn't it?  That was just smoke, Starling, I had to get rid of him. You did well in there.
L341897 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ They weren't there. Get close-ups.
L341896 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ I don't know. I didn't see those on any of the other girls...
L341880 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Well, she's not local. Her ears are pierced three times each, and she's wearing green glitter nail polish. Looks like town to me...
L341879 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ What do you see, Starling?
L341860 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ He starts this - buzzing in me, in my head. He makes me feel violated... You used me, Mr. Crawford.
L341859 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ Are you finished?
L341858 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ You knew. You knew from the start that Lecter held the key to this... But you weren't up front with me. You sent me in to him naked.
L341857 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ What should I say? You did fine work. We'll wait on the lab.
L341856 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ You haven't said a word today about that garage. Or what I found there.
L341855 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ Okay, Starling. Let's have it.
L341854 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Like I have a "knack" for Dr. Lecter?
L341853 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ Maybe you've got a knack for this... I guess we're about to find out.
L341852 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ He's got a real taste for it now. And he's getting better at his work.
L341851 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ Why not?
L341850 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ What he does with them - takes privacy... Time, tools... He's in his 30's or 40's - he's got real physical strength, but combined with an older man's self-control. He's cautious, precise, never impulsive... This won't end in suicide, like they often do.
L341849 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ Why?
L341848 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ He's a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere. Not an apartment.
L341847 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ Talk about him, Starling. Tell me what you see.
L341846 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ Good idea, but he thought of it, too. We've run simulations, using different vectors and the best dates we can assign. You put it all in the computer, and smoke comes out. No, this one is different. This one has seen us coming...
L341845 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ There's no correlation at all between where they're kidnapped and where they're found...?  What if - what if you trace the heaviest-traffic routes backwards from the dump sites? Do they converge at all?
L341844 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ Blue square for Belvedere, Ohio, where the Bimmel girl was abducted. Blue triangle where her body was found - down here in Missouri. Same marks for the other four girls, in different colors. This new one, today... washed up here.  Elk River, in West Virginia, about six miles below U.S. 79. Real boonies.
L341755 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ You don't have to feel any way about it. Lecter did it to amuse himself. Why not, what can they do? Take away his books for awhile, and no jello...  I know it got ugly today. But this is your report, Starling - take it as far as you can. On your own time, outside of class. Now carry on.
L341754 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know how to feel about it.
L341753 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him, all afternoon, and Miggs crying. They found him at bed check. He'd swallowed his own tongue... Chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit, and he's trying to blame it on you. I told the little prick your conduct was flawless.  Starling...?
L341752 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Murdered...? How?
L341751 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ Miggs has been murdered.
L341750 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Sir, what is it? There's something you're not telling me.
L341749 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ Then do that, Starling. Do just exactly that.
L341748 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
L341747 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ Do you recall my instructions to you, Starling? What were they?
L341746 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Sir, that's a field job. It's outside the scope of my assignment. And I've got a test tomorrow on -
L341745 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ Well? Why aren't you there right now?
L341744 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ I spent all evening on the mainframe. Lecter altered or destroyed most of his patient histories, prior to capture. No record of anyone named Mofet. But "Split City" sounded like it might have have something to do with divorce. I tracked it down in the library's catalogue of national yellow pages.  It's a mini-storage facility outside Baltimore, where Lecter had his practice.
L341743 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ He mentioned a name, at the very end. "Mofet..." Any followup on her?
L341742 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Right down to the kleenex I used.  Sir, why? Is something wrong?
L341741 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ Every word, Starling? Every gesture?
L341740 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.
L341739 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ I've read your interim memo on Lecter. You sure you've left nothing out?
L341652 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ And what is that, sir?
L341651 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter. Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go over the physical procedures used with him. Do not deviate from them, for any reason. You tell him nothing personal, Starling. Believe me, you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head... Just do your job, but never forget what he is.
L341650 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Yes sir.
L341649 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ Now. I want your full attention, Starling. Are you listening to me?
L341647 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ You're qualified and available. And frankly, I can't spare a real agent right now.
L341646 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Yes, well... Okay, right. I'm glad for the chance, sir, but - why me?
L341644 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ The psychiatrist - Dr. Hannibal Lecter.
L341643 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Who's the subject?
L341642 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ You see, the one we want most refuses to cooperate. I want you to go after him again today, in the asylum.
L341641 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Not yet.
L341640 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ We're trying to interview all of the serial killers now in custody, for a psychobehavioral profile. Could be a big help in unsolved cases. Most of them have been happy to talk to us. They have a compulsion to boast, these people... Do you spook easily, Starling?
L341639 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ A job's come up and I thought about you. Not really a job, more of - an interesting errand. Walk me to my car, Starling.
L341638 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ I hope so. They haven't posted anything.
L341637 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ Your instructors tell me you're doing well. Top quarter of the class.
L341636 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Good morning, Mr. Crawford.
L341635 +++$+++ u6267 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CRAWFORD +++$+++ Starling, Clarice M., good morning.
L341956 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Dr. Lecter...
L341955 +++$+++ u6273 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ PILCHER +++$+++ They live in Malaysia. In this country, they'd have to be specially raised, from imported eggs.
L341954 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ And there's no way - no natural way - these could've wound up in the bodies?
L341948 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Not lately. But maybe someday.
L341947 +++$+++ u6273 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ PILCHER +++$+++ Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? The amusing house wine...?
L341946 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.
L341945 +++$+++ u6273 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ PILCHER +++$+++ What do you do when you're not detecting, Officer Starling?
L342335 +++$+++ u6276 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Freddie was so happy for me when I got this job. This - toaster giveaways, and Barry Manilow on the speakers all day - she thought this was really hot shit. What did she know, big dummy...
L342334 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Sometimes you do.
L342333 +++$+++ u6276 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ You get to travel around and stuff? I mean, better places then this?
L342332 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ I think so.
L342331 +++$+++ u6276 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Is that a pretty good job, FBI agent?
L342330 +++$+++ u6276 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ She died. She went to Florida to retire, like two years ago? She dies own there.
L342329 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd like to talk to her.
L342328 +++$+++ u6276 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Oh sure, me'n Pam Malavesi used to help her do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman. Lots of people worked for her, she had the business from all these retail stores? But she was like, totally old, it was more'n she could handle.
L342327 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Did you ever work with her?
L342326 +++$+++ u6276 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ No way. She had a guy, I'da known, believe me. Sewing was her life, she was really great at it. Poor Freddie.
L342325 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man named Jamie Gumb? Or John Grant?  Do you think she could've had a friend you didn't know about?
L342324 +++$+++ u6276 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ They said she was just rags, like somebody -
L342387 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Goodbye, Clarice...  You looked - so very lovely today, in your blue suit.
L342386 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ You know I can't make that promise.
L342385 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ I have no plans to call on you, Clarice, the world being more interesting with you in it. Be sure you extend me the same courtesy.
L342384 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Dr. Lecter -
L342383 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Your lambs are still for now, Clarice, but not forever... You'll have to earn it again and again, this blessed silence. Because it's the plight that drives you, and the plight will never end.
L342378 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Well, Clarice, have the lambs stopped screaming...?
L342377 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Starling.
L342189 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Promise...?  Then why not take your case file? I won't be needing it anymore.
L342188 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Yes. I'll tell you.
L342187 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Brave Clarice. Will you let me know if ever the lambs stop screaming?
L342184 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Dr. Chilton... I believe you know each other?
L342183 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter.
L342182 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Thank you, Clarice.
L342181 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Yes! I don't know...! I don't know.
L342180 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ Do you think if you saved Catherine, you could make them stop...? Do you think, if Catherine lives, you won't wake up in the dark, ever again, to the screaming of the lambs? Do you...?
L342179 +++$+++ u6266 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ CLARICE +++$+++ Yes...
L342178 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ You still wake up sometimes, don't you? Wake up in the dark, with the lambs screaming?
L342177 +++$+++ u6269 +++$+++ m419 +++$+++ DR. LECTER +++$+++ But what became of your lamb?  Clarice...?
