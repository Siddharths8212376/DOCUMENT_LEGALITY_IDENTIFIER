L271290 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Time out....Jason Dean. Your Pop's Fred Dean Construction. Must be rough. Moving place to place.
L271289 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ My father seems to enjoy tearing things down more than putting things up. Seen the commerical? "Bringing every State to a Higher State."
L271288 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ I don't know. Should you?
L271287 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Just a humble perk from my Dad's Construction company or should I say Deconstruction company?
L271285 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ I didn't. Cherry.
L271284 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ The extreme always makes an impression, but you're right, it was severe. Did you say a Cherry or Coke Slurpee?
L271283 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Really? That thing in the caf today was pretty severe.
L271282 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ I've been moved around all my life; Dallas, Baton Rouge, Vegas, Sherwood Ohio, there's always a 7-11. Any town, any time, I can pop a Ham and Cheese in the microwave and feast on a Big Wheel. Keeps me sane.
L271281 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well.
L271280 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ You going to pull a Big Gulp with that?
L271230 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ How very.
L271229 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Probably just row on out to the middle of a lake. Bring along my sax, some tequila, and some Bach.
L271224 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ That's the stupidest question I've ever heard.
L271223 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ If you inherit five million dollars the same day aliens tell the earth they're blowing us up in two days, what would you do?
L271222 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ There are no stupid questions.
L271601 +++$+++ u5799 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ RAM +++$+++ Lighten up, dude. In those woods is some of the finest pussy in the school and we don't even have to buy it a hamburger and a Diet Coke. Punch it in!
L271600 +++$+++ u5796 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ Shut the fuck up, all right.
L271599 +++$+++ u5799 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ RAM +++$+++ Sex and Drugs and HBO is all I ever need! Whoa! Can you hear me! Hello Tokyo! I said Sex and Drugs and...
L271537 +++$+++ u5799 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ RAM +++$+++ Punch it in!
L271536 +++$+++ u5796 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ Then get over on my side. Oh shit, cowtipping is the fucking greatest.
L271535 +++$+++ u5799 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ RAM +++$+++ I think so, man.
L271534 +++$+++ u5796 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ Is it sleeping, dude?
L271521 +++$+++ u5799 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ RAM +++$+++ Goddamn Geek!
L271520 +++$+++ u5796 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ Cool off, we're seniors.
L271519 +++$+++ u5799 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ RAM +++$+++ Let's kick his ass.
L271518 +++$+++ u5796 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ That pudwapper just stepped on my foot.
L271517 +++$+++ u5796 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ Pretty weird.
L271516 +++$+++ u5799 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ RAM +++$+++ I still got to talk to Heather, dude. Weird funeral, huh?
L271515 +++$+++ u5796 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ We on tonight man?
L271236 +++$+++ u5796 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ Hey Ram, doesn't this cafeteria have a No Fags Allowed Rule?
L271235 +++$+++ u5799 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ RAM +++$+++ Answer him dick!
L271234 +++$+++ u5796 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ What did your <u>boyfriend</u> say when you told him you were moving to Sherwood, Ohio?
L271233 +++$+++ u5799 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ RAM +++$+++ You going to eat this?
L271228 +++$+++ u5796 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ Shit, we're seniors, Ram. Too old for that crap. Let's give him a scare though.
L271227 +++$+++ u5799 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ RAM +++$+++ Let's kick his ass.
L271226 +++$+++ u5796 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ Veronica is into his act. No doubt.
L271225 +++$+++ u5799 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ RAM +++$+++ Who does that new kid think he is with that coat? Bo Diddley?
L271812 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ All we want is to be treated like human beings, not like guinea pigs to be experimented on and not like bunny rabbits to be patronized.
L271811 +++$+++ u5797 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ I'm lost. You don't get enough attention, you get too much attention. Which is it? Where are your shoes?
L271810 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Everybody cares for youth but nobody cares about Joey Blow. When that news reporter gets home he'll scream at his son for not mowing the lawn in the right pattern.
L271807 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ This condescending junk makes suicide seem like a cool thing to do. Hey kids, make your parents and teachers feel like shit! Get the respect in death you'll never get in life.
L271806 +++$+++ u5797 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Turn that back on!
L271659 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Superb.
L271658 +++$+++ u5797 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ How was the funeral?
L271501 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Greate pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the funeral tomorrow.
L271500 +++$+++ u5797 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ You two....
L271496 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ May<u>be</u>.
L271495 +++$+++ u5797 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Terrible thing. So will we get to meet this dark horse prom contender?
L271278 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Great pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the party tonight.
L271277 +++$+++ u5797 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ You two....
L271273 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ May<u>be</u>. There's kind of a dark horse now in the running.
L271272 +++$+++ u5797 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Any contestants worth mentioning?
L271271 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ I guess.
L271270 +++$+++ u5797 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Hey kid, isn't the prom coming up?
L271921 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Get a job.
L271920 +++$+++ u5798 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ We have to talk.  Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.
L271919 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Where is he? Where's J.D.?
L271918 +++$+++ u5798 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ Veronica! J.D. told me you committed suicide last night!
L271790 +++$+++ u5798 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ What, the wine? I realize you're all under 21, but it seemed like such a perfect touch.  Could we get some more light up here?
L271789 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ But Ms. Fleming, it's just not right.
L271788 +++$+++ u5798 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ Everyone take their places on the stage!  Isn't this thrilling?!
L271439 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Heather was cool, but cruel. The good looks and bad manners gave her power, but it could not give her happiness.
L271438 +++$+++ u5798 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ Dear Veronica, Heather was your soulmate.....Share.
L271787 +++$+++ u5801 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ WHITNEY JAMES +++$+++ Sure. Ciao.
L271786 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ It's all yours, Heather. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go throw up.
L271785 +++$+++ u5801 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ WHITNEY JAMES +++$+++ Stained with loserness. Oh, I like it. Can I use that. It'd be dynamite on interoffice memoranda.
L271784 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ The world wants winners, I guess. Not people stained with loserness.
L271781 +++$+++ u5801 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ WHITNEY JAMES +++$+++ Oh, I was scared of the same thing, Heather. The minute you try to deal with the actual teenagers who have contemplated suicide you're stepping into quicksand. Quicksand filled with bad complexions, bad grades, bad parents, bad drugs, and all sorts of doody nobody wants to hear let alone bend down to clean up.
L271780 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ I'm so sorry. I was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering.
L271779 +++$+++ u5801 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ WHITNEY JAMES +++$+++ People just don't take the name Heather seriously. They should, shouldn't they?
L271778 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ But my name's not...
L271777 +++$+++ u5801 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ WHITNEY JAMES +++$+++ I got a confession to make. My name used to be Heather, too.
L271663 +++$+++ u5801 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ WHITNEY JAMES +++$+++ It rained everyday of my Maui vacation, but hey, I didn't kill myself. I'm Whitney James, Commentary.
L271662 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ That's three things.
L271661 +++$+++ u5801 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ WHITNEY JAMES +++$+++ Heather Chandler, Kurt Kelly, and Rupert "Ram" Sweeney all had good looks and popularity, but there's one thing they didn't have: Values, Ambition, and Hope.
L272921 +++$+++ u5802 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HERBERT +++$+++ Is that a fact! You'd better put me name down for an advance copy!
L272920 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Actually, Mr. Rieper . . . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to New York. That's where all the big publishing houses are based.
L272919 +++$+++ u5802 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HERBERT +++$+++ This story of yours-maybe the school newspaper will print it when it's finished.
L272913 +++$+++ u5802 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HERBERT +++$+++ I work at Dennis Brothers Fish Supply.
L272912 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head.
L272911 +++$+++ u5802 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HERBERT +++$+++ I've never cottoned on to Plasticine like you girls, but I enjoy making things out of wood.
L272910 +++$+++ u5802 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HERBERT +++$+++ We're pretty handy with model making, too, eh?
L272909 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ I adore anything to do with the arts.
L272903 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ I'm not sure . . . but it's proving to be very popular!
L272902 +++$+++ u5802 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HERBERT +++$+++ What's that?
L272901 +++$+++ u5804 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ JULIET +++$+++ Mummy has a special technique called "Deep Therapy."
L273282 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ Well . . . I better make myself a bit more presentable.
L273281 +++$+++ u5802 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HERBERT +++$+++ wanders out. HONORA turns to Pauline and Juliet.
L273278 +++$+++ u5802 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HERBERT +++$+++ Have a nice outing, you lot.
L273277 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ Bye.
L273276 +++$+++ u5802 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HERBERT +++$+++ pulls his coat on. HONORA gives him a peck cheek.
L273275 +++$+++ u5802 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HERBERT +++$+++ I'd better be getting back. Bye, love.
L273222 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ breaks down into heavy sobs.
L273221 +++$+++ u5802 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HERBERT +++$+++ accompanies Hilda into the hallway.
L273212 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ She says Juliet's in a terrible state . . .
L273211 +++$+++ u5802 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HERBERT +++$+++ What now?
L273210 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
L273209 +++$+++ u5802 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HERBERT +++$+++ is chopping firewood in the back garden. HONORA approaches him.
L273109 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ Is it hurting, dear?
L273108 +++$+++ u5802 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HERBERT +++$+++ waves a pair of new socks around. The family laughing and talking. Pauline is not participating. She is leaning back, looking morose. HONORA looks at her with concern.
L273089 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ frowns at Henry.
L273088 +++$+++ u5802 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HERBERT +++$+++ No arguments there, Dr. Hulme! All that time inside working on those novels of theirs. They don't get fresh air or exercise!
L273087 +++$+++ u5802 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HERBERT +++$+++ sits down next to Honora, glass of sherry in hand.
L273086 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ Yvonne hasn't been herself, either. Locking herself away in her room . . . endlessly writing.
L272986 +++$+++ u5802 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HERBERT +++$+++ Thought I'd have a go at building the birdhouse on Saturday . . . anyone want to give me a hand?
L272985 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ pops a couple more potatoes on Pauline's plate. HERBERT glances at Pauline.
L272984 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ I've booked you in for a chest X-ray . . . just to be on the safe side.
L272889 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ whips off her pinny as HERBERT leads Juliet into the dining room.
L272888 +++$+++ u5802 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HERBERT +++$+++ Look who I've found!
L272887 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ and Pauline hurriedly work together, setting out plates and cutlery.
L272886 +++$+++ u5802 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HERBERT +++$+++ Come on through.
L272885 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ Come on! Sausage rolls.
L272809 +++$+++ u5802 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HERBERT +++$+++ sighs as HONORA puts the frying pan on the stove.
L272808 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.
L272807 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ playfully shoves his hand away.
L272806 +++$+++ u5802 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HERBERT +++$+++ Let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, Nora?
L273298 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ looks down at the ground in front of her.
L273297 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ Look, Mother!
L273290 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ Oh, no. I'm watching my figure.
L273289 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ You have it.
L273272 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ That's enough, Yvonne!
L273271 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ I bet he pitches a tent in the middle of their bedroom, and they have to pretend to be on some mountain!
L273197 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ Love, you can still write to each other.
L273196 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ I felt thoroughly depressed and even quite seriously considered committing suicide. Life seems so much not worth the living, death such an easy way out.
L273193 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ stands and walks toward the door.
L273192 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ You have to let me go!
L273191 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!
L273190 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!
L273189 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ Don't be so ridiculous. You're our daughter, you belong here with us.
L273188 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ The Hulmes will look after me. They want me to live with them!
L273168 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ Open this door!
L273167 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++  I'm bloody dressing as fast as I can, for God's sake!
L273128 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ All right! You go out there and get a job and you damn well pay your own way!
L273127 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ I don't wanna be in bloody school!
L273126 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ You're rude . . . rude and insolent! I don't see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.
L273125 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ is very angry.
L273124 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ What do you know? You wouldn't know the first thing about writing. You're the most ignorant person I've ever met!
L273123 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ These stories are not going to get you School Certificate! You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?
L273122 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ snatches up an exercise book from a large pile.
L273121 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ You're failing English . . . you used to be top of the class- PAULINE I'm doing my own writing!
L273120 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ I'm educating myself!
L273119 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ I care . . . your father cares . . . we want you to have a good education.
L273118 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ Who cares!
L273117 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ She says the standard of your work is slipping. At this rate she doesn't think you'll get School Certificate.
L273116 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ What does old Stew want?
L273115 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart.
L273114 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ My name is Gina!
L273061 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ steps back.
L273060 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ You ran off with Dad when you were only 17! Nana Parker told me!
L273059 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ whirls around and slaps Pauline on the cheek.
L273058 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ Well, I guess I take after you then!
L273057 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ My God, what a disgrace you are! You shame me, you shame the family. You're nothing but a cheap little tart!
L273055 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ grabs Pauline by the shoulders.
L273054 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ Can I go now?
L273053 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ sighs.
L273052 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ If you think for one minute that your father and I will tolerate this sort of behaviour, you've got another thing coming! You're only 14!!! You're a child! What on earth's the matter with you, Yvonne? You know what can happen with boys . . . Don't you have any self-respect?
L273051 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ From now on, you're sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you.
L273050 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ I had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now I realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture.
L272982 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ Her parents won't be going overseas now . . . they'll have to cancel their trip. Don't worry about Juliet.
L272981 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ But she'll have no one to look after her!
L272980 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ Juliet's infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital.
L272979 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?
L272978 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.
L272977 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!
L272976 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.
L272975 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ I just want to be on my own for a while.
L272974 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.
L272973 +++$+++ u5805 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ I'm not hungry.
L272972 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ Come on, sit up.
L272971 +++$+++ u5803 +++$+++ m384 +++$+++ HONORA +++$+++ comes in with a breakfast tray: bacon and eggs, tea and toast.
