L17400 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ DO YOU SEE TEEM?
L17399 +++$+++ u174 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SHEPHERD +++$+++ IT'S OPEN!
L17396 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ They better. Fuel's almost gone.
L17395 +++$+++ u174 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SHEPHERD +++$+++ Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment.
L17325 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Twenty-five years.
L17324 +++$+++ u174 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SHEPHERD +++$+++ How long's it been since you flew, sir?
L17323 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Shit.
L17322 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Iraq? Shep, you're fired.
L17321 +++$+++ u174 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SHEPHERD +++$+++ Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.
L17313 +++$+++ u174 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SHEPHERD +++$+++ A MiG? Where the hell are we?
L17312 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ My god. I think that was a MiG.
L17260 +++$+++ u174 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SHEPHERD +++$+++ Sir...
L17259 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Shepherd.
L17116 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
L17115 +++$+++ u174 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SHEPHERD +++$+++ Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?
L16684 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Okay.  Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me all about it later, right?
L16683 +++$+++ u174 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SHEPHERD +++$+++ Mr. President... they're ready for you in the conference room.
L16648 +++$+++ u174 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SHEPHERD +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L16647 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Defense and State Department in the conference room in one hour.  I want to review the Iraq situation.
L16635 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ That's my job.
L16634 +++$+++ u174 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SHEPHERD +++$+++ You give me ulcers.
L16633 +++$+++ u174 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SHEPHERD +++$+++ We'll just say it was in bad taste.
L16632 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ I said it's not worth the fight.  Steward, please.
L16605 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Did we tape the Duke game?
L16604 +++$+++ u174 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SHEPHERD +++$+++ Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging.
L16603 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ It's bait.  Don't take it.
L16597 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Right... Christ I'm tired.  Do me a favor and keep me away from the press.
L16596 +++$+++ u174 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SHEPHERD +++$+++ Other way around, sir.
L16595 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  Besides, Shep, I told you...  I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.
L16594 +++$+++ u174 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SHEPHERD +++$+++ *                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that.
L16593 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ I might still have a few chips left.
L16592 +++$+++ u174 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SHEPHERD +++$+++ With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one.  Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch.
L16589 +++$+++ u174 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SHEPHERD +++$+++ He and the NRA don't like the wording.
L16588 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the Speaker say?
L16587 +++$+++ u174 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SHEPHERD +++$+++ You wanna knock of f?
L16577 +++$+++ u169 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.
L16576 +++$+++ u174 +++$+++ m11 +++$+++ SHEPHERD +++$+++ *                     CBS said they'll give us four minutes.  They thought the Russian was a nice touch.
L19087 +++$+++ u178 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ COMMISSIONER +++$+++ Commissioner, Aquarius.
L19086 +++$+++ u184 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ KRUGER +++$+++ Kruger, Sagittarius.
L19032 +++$+++ u184 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ KRUGER +++$+++ I was asking McCrosky, Commissioner.
L19031 +++$+++ u178 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ COMMISSIONER +++$+++ Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
L19030 +++$+++ u184 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ KRUGER +++$+++ What's the story?
L19029 +++$+++ u178 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ COMMISSIONER +++$+++ I was reading too.
L19028 +++$+++ u184 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ KRUGER +++$+++ Forget it.  I was reading.
L18588 +++$+++ u184 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ KRUGER +++$+++ You've made your point, Commissioner. There's only one other pilot who can handle that shuttle and that's Clarence Oveur.  He's got a lunar flight today.  I want him pulled.  Jacobs, pull Oveur!
L18587 +++$+++ u178 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ COMMISSIONER +++$+++ I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...
L18586 +++$+++ u184 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ KRUGER +++$+++ I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
L18585 +++$+++ u178 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ COMMISSIONER +++$+++ That just doesn't make any sense.
L18584 +++$+++ u184 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ KRUGER +++$+++ That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago.
L18382 +++$+++ u184 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ KRUGER +++$+++ I just wish it was that simple.
L18381 +++$+++ u178 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ COMMISSIONER +++$+++ What?
L18380 +++$+++ u184 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ KRUGER +++$+++ Commissioner.
L18379 +++$+++ u178 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ COMMISSIONER +++$+++ You handle your front office people, I'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board.
L18375 +++$+++ u178 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ COMMISSIONER +++$+++ Bud, get wise to the political realities. The boys on the board are under a lot of pressure from the boys downtown.
L18374 +++$+++ u184 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ KRUGER +++$+++ And what do the boys on the board know about safety, Commissioner?  Let <u>me</u> talk to them.
L18373 +++$+++ u178 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ COMMISSIONER +++$+++ Forget it.  The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.
L18372 +++$+++ u184 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ KRUGER +++$+++ Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing.
L18863 +++$+++ u185 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Um...  Do you people scream right when you... you know.
L18862 +++$+++ u179 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ DUNN +++$+++ What is it, Mary?
L18861 +++$+++ u185 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?
L18860 +++$+++ u179 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ DUNN +++$+++ Felt like a large asteroid.
L18859 +++$+++ u185 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Yes I did...
L18858 +++$+++ u179 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ DUNN +++$+++ Did you feel that?
L18825 +++$+++ u186 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ You better take this.
L18824 +++$+++ u179 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ DUNN +++$+++ Sir?
L18823 +++$+++ u186 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ Dunn.
L18822 +++$+++ u186 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ You better check on it, Mr. Dunn.  I'll stay here and fly the ship.
L18821 +++$+++ u179 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ DUNN +++$+++ Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four.
L18785 +++$+++ u186 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ You better check it, Unger.
L18784 +++$+++ u179 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ DUNN +++$+++ We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four, sir.
L18716 +++$+++ u179 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ DUNN +++$+++ Accelerators down.
L18715 +++$+++ u186 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ Shut down accelerators.
L18636 +++$+++ u186 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ OVEUR +++$+++ Dunn.
L18635 +++$+++ u179 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ DUNN +++$+++ Oveur.
L19239 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Kramer, the WORP control handle just came off in my hand.
L19238 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted, the lever!
L19215 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Compute!
L19214 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Now!
L19213 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Set!
L19212 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ We've blown the computer!  Elaine!  Set course change!
L19199 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I guess you'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this.
L19198 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Not when I'm with you, Ted.
L19197 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Are you afraid?
L19196 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds.  He'll roast like a pig on a spit.
L19195 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ What will happen to him, Ted?
L19194 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ That's right -- premature ejection.
L19193 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ You mean...
L19192 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.
L19191 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Simon just ejected!
L19132 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ That might be the news we've been waiting for.
L19131 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
L19130 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.
L19119 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ That was very well put, Ted.
L19118 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place.  You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly.  You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program.
L19113 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I mean until we start to burn up.
L19112 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Not now, Elaine.
L19111 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted, we've only got ten minutes.
L19053 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted, please be careful.
L19052 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Elaine, I'm going back there.  Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can.
L19012 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted, there's no time to explain.
L19011 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Elaine, what's going on?
L19010 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted!
L19009 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Elaine!
L18801 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted, a toilet's not going to kill anyone.
L18800 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
L18799 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I'd use the word insane.
L18798 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
L18797 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
L18796 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ What word would you use, Elaine?
L18795 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I've never used the word insane, Ted.
L18794 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
L18793 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted, get a grip on yourself.  You should never have left the hospital.
L18792 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Elaine, I mean the mission has to be aborted.  This ship should never have passed FSA inspection.  This thing is held together by string and chewing gum.
L18791 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.
L18790 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Elaine, we have to go back.
L18789 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
L18788 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Elaine.
L18698 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted!
L18697 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Not now, Elaine!
L18696 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted.
L18695 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I've got it, Elaine!  I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!
L18694 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ What are you doing, Ted?
L18677 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Let me by, Elaine.
L18676 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted, we're taking off!
L18675 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I have to get in there.  I have to stop this flight.
L18674 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted!  What are you...?
L18569 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Goodbye, Ted.  I don't want to hurt you.
L18568 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.
L18567 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ If that's the way you want it.
L18566 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.
L18564 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick.  Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time.  And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon.
L18563 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ His name's David Stockman.  He's been here twenty years, that's all he says.
L18559 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now.
L18558 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way.
L18557 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Sammy Davis Junior.  Terrible car accident.  He hasn't been the same since.
L18556 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Who's that, Ted?
L18555 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It'll make you feel a lot better.
L18548 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game, Ted.  He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man.
L18547 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Elaine, what happened to us?
L18546 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself.
L18545 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Elaine.
L18529 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You're as bad as the rest of them, Elaine!  It's all here in the design specifications!  Look!  It's all here!
L18528 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
L18527 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ There's nothing wrong with me!
L18526 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground.
L18525 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Ask Simon.
L18524 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted, what's wrong?
L18512 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I mean the Mercury flight.  It's not safe and, Kurtz, you know why.
L18511 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
L18510 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ It's got to be stopped!
L18506 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ That's not important now, Elaine.  We have to talk.
L18505 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Te...!
L18504 +++$+++ u193 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Elaine.
L18701 +++$+++ u190 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ RUMACK +++$+++ Yes -- last week that pile of mud was only this high.
L18700 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Is he making any progress, Doctor?
L18699 +++$+++ u190 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ RUMACK +++$+++ The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.
L18690 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Is that a good sign, Doctor?
L18689 +++$+++ u190 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ RUMACK +++$+++ You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.
L18688 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I mean for Ted.
L18687 +++$+++ u190 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ RUMACK +++$+++ You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol.
L18686 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ What can <u>I</u> do, Doctor Rumack?
L18685 +++$+++ u190 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ RUMACK +++$+++ So you see, our task isn't made any easier by Ted's refusal to admit that he's sick.
L18684 +++$+++ u190 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ RUMACK +++$+++ The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder.  Let me show you.  Ted's problem is in this area.  This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here...
L18683 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.
L19179 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Simon, what are you saying?!
L19178 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Maybe.
L19177 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends!  You'll die out there.
L18907 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Your career!  What about the lives of those people out there.  Simon, what happened to the man I thought I loved?
L18906 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ My career is shot.
L18904 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down.
L18903 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Can't we change course?
L18902 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.
L18901 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Simon, what's happening?!
L18757 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Roger.
L18756 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.
L18750 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ That's my girl.
L18749 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I think so.
L18748 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Have you got it straightened out now?
L18543 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Don't be too long.
L18542 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.
L18533 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ So mentally ill?
L18532 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Simon, why has he become so... so...
L18531 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.
L18503 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ No, I've been excited before.
L18502 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ I guess this is a first for you.
L18501 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I'm so excited, Simon.
L18500 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Frank's the best pilot in the program.
L18397 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ You're heading up the division in charge of babies for Mr. and Mrs. Simon Kurtz.
L18396 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.
L18395 +++$+++ u191 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Women <u>and</u> the space program have come a long way, sweetheart.  But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl.
L18394 +++$+++ u180 +++$+++ m12 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you, Simon.  I'm a very lucky woman.
