L513398 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Frank, he went off, too. He ain't gonna be in there when you get indoors.
L513397 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Well, okay. I got you some.
L513396 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.
L513395 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Where are you goin', Karl? Didn't you want some chicken and things?
L513331 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I could shore use some. Thank ye.
L513330 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ You're a hell of a boy, Frank. Someday you're gonna get all the good things you deserve. And Karl here's gonna get some more biscuits tonight. What do you think about that?
L513221 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ All right then.
L513220 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Karl, why don't you and Melinda go take a walk. It's nice out.
L513165 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I believe you. I really do.
L513164 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Yes ma'am.  I like your garage.  I wouldn't never hurt you or your boy. I'd lay my hand on the Bible and say the same thing.
L513163 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Was that you? I remember that. I was only three or four, but I always heard about it growin' up.  They say you're well?
L513162 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I killed my mother and a old boy name Jesse Dixon. I thought they was a-doin' wrong. I was about your boy's age. They say I'm well now from it.
L513161 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ That's okay. It's not really my business. I have wondered though. Why was it? Was it like a nervous breakdown?
L513160 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Hit ain't right for me to keep from tellin' you how come me to be put in the state hospital.
L513159 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I like Frank. He's a good boy. Me and him's made friends.
L513158 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Vaughan's "friend" will be there, too. He works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot. He says you make him feel calm.
L513157 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I wouldn't mind a havin' supper.
L513156 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ It's all right.  You know I was thinkin' there's this girl that works with me. She's real heavy, but she's cute in the face. Well, you know, she's slow. She's a little bit, I think. She's not retarded, just -- it don't matter, listen to me. I thought you might like to meet her. Vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her. Would you like that?
L513155 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Thank ye.
L513154 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Okay.
L513153 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Mustard's good on 'em to me.
L513152 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Well, set down and I'll make some biscuits and gravy.
L513151 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Yes ma'am.
L513150 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all?
L513149 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out.
L513148 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Right now?
L513147 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Do you reckon you can make me some biscuits?
L513146 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I'll be dog.
L513145 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Two fellers was on a bridge a takin' a leak and one feller says the water was cold and the other said it was deep water. One of 'em came from Arkansas, I believe.
L513144 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ No ma'am.
L513143 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?
L513142 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I didn't aim to.
L513141 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ You scared me.
L512959 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Karl, this is my boyfriend, Doyle. Frank, why don't you and Karl go out in the garage and fix him up a place or play a game or somethin'. Vaughan, you ready to go?
L512958 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Tolerable, I reckon.
L512957 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?
L513445 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I don't reckon you have to go with women to be a daddy to a boy.  You've been real square dealin' with me. The Bible says two men ort not lay together. But I'll bet you the Good Lord wouldn't send nobody like you to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.  That boy lives inside of his own heart. Hits an awful big place. You take care of that boy.
L513444 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ What about you, Karl? Do you want to stay here?
L513443 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Naw, not yet.  I want ye to give this to Mizz Wheatley. Hit ain't much, but maybe there's a little somethin' to hep out. Hits what I've earned fixin' lawnmowers and whatnot fer Bill Cox.
L513442 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ Well, sure, okay. He hasn't hurt them, has he?
L513441 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ That dern Doyle is in a bad way again with that drinkin' and bein' mean to folks. Will you give me your word you'll do it?
L513440 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ What's wrong? Is everything okay?
L513439 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ This evenin' I want you to go get Mizz Wheatley and that Frank and have them stay with you tonight.
L513438 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ Okay.
L513437 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I ain't a-stayin'. I need to ast you fer a favor.
L513436 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ Karl, what are you doing here? Come in.
L513193 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I ain't read 'em yet except two or three of 'em. I can't understand a lot of what I try to read. My mind, hit wonders off to somethin' else when I try to read.
L513192 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ I think Karl is going to be a writer or a librarian eventually. You should see all the books he has. He must read constantly.
L513010 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Before that I was thinkin' it'd be good if I could get another three or four cans of that potted meat if you got any extry.
L513009 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ Oh. How about before that?
L513008 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I was thinkin' I could use me another helpin' of these potaters.
L513007 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ That's what I thought. I hope I haven't offended you in any way. You seem like a thinker. You seem to always be in deep thought. Tell me something. What are you thinking right now?
L513006 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I wouldn't never hurt them.
L513005 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ Anyway, it's hard to live gay, that's the right way to say it, in a small town like this. I've wanted to leave many times, but my love for Linda and Frank and another certain person that we won't go into have kept me from it. Anyway, I'm rambling. If you're going to live in the Wheatly garage you need to know that it won't be easy. Doyle is a monster. Not just a closed minded redneck, but a monster. A dangerous person. I've told Linda that one day that man is going to really hurt her or that boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I see it in his eyes. I'm very in tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle will make your life hell. You're a perfect target. When I first saw you I was afraid of you. Not really afraid, I guess, just taken aback. But also, I felt a real sensitive feeling from you. And for some reason, Frank has adopted you. Much like a stray animal. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that. In a good way. Anyway, I just want you to know what you're in for. I have a good feeling about you. You're good for Frank. Maybe it's that he can have an adult friend on a child's level. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it in a bad way.  There's one more thing. It's none of my business why you were in the state hospital. Everyone has something in their past, maybe you tried suicide, maybe you did something -- terrible. But what I see before me is a gentle, simple man. All I want you to promise me is that you're capable of being around Linda and Frank. You know. You would never hurt them under any circumstances, would you?
L513004 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I've heard it said that way.
L513003 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ Well that's a very offensive way to put it. You shouldn't say that. You were taught that, weren't you?
L513002 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.
L513001 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.
L513000 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I reckon not.
L512999 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ Okay, Karl, the reason I brought you here was to talk to you about something that is on my mind.  I guess I'll put it right out on the table. Where do I start. Linda and Frank are very important to me. They're like family. My own family was never like family. They're horrible people. As a matter of fact I prayed every night for years that my father would die. I finally realized through a lot of therapy that I was wasting my energy on hating him. Now I just don't care.  You see, you and I are a lot alike, strange as that may seem. I mean not physically or even mentally really, just well, maybe emotionally or actually the hand we've been dealt in life. We're different. People see us as being different anyway. You're -- well you have your affliction or whatever and I, well mine's not as easy to see. I'm just going to say it. I'm gay.  Does that surprise you?  That I'm gay. You know what being gay is, don't you?
L512955 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ Okay, I'll come by Mr. Cox's and get you at noon.
L512954 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I reckon I can stand to eat a little somethin' or 'nother at noontime tomorrow. Bill Cox generally gets me a box of french fried potaters. But I reckon he can lay off doin' it tomorrow.
L512953 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ I mean tomorrow or the next day.
L512952 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I done et just a little bit ago.
L512951 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ Listen, before you get very used to staying here, I think you and I need to talk about a few things. Can I take you to lunch?
L512950 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Quite a spell, I reckon.
L512949 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ How long have you been standing here?
L512948 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Naw, I ain't.
L512947 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ Did you knock on the door yet?
L512946 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ That boy wants me to.
L512945 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ So, you're really going to stay here?
L512944 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Yes sir.
L512879 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Not really to speak of.
L512878 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ Do you have family here?
L512877 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.
L512876 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ Is that right?  Are you going to be staying here long?
L512875 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ They turned me loose from the state hospital.
L512874 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ Why are you here now?
L512873 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ What's that you say?
L512872 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ What brings you back?
L512871 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I's horned and raised here up till I's twelve year old.
L512870 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ It's been here seventeen years. Did you live here before or something?
L512869 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Naw, I don't believe you have. I don't reckon I never been in here. This store didn't used to be here.
L512868 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ I don't think I've ever seen you before.
L513213 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ That's very sweet of you Vaughan. We care about you, too. Don't we y'all?
L513212 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ Listen everybody, I know this may sound corny, I've had a few glasses of wine and that kind of makes me a little emotional, but I'm going to say it anyway. It just came over me in a rush. I want you all to know that I care about each and every one of you at this table.
L513203 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L513202 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Vaughan, don't get pushy.
L513201 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ Karl, maybe you and Melinda might want to take a walk or something after dinner. It's a nice night.
L513198 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Hey Karl, you know what? Melinda was voted employee of the month at the Dollar Store last February. Isn't that somethin'?
L513197 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ Good. I haven't decided yet if I'm a good cook.
L512892 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ Karl is a guy guy?
L512891 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I don't think he sees you as a guy guy.
L512890 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ What about me?
L512889 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ He's retarded's all. You know he's always after a father figure and Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass.
L512888 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ He's been in the state hospital a long time, something must be wrong with him.
L512887 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Frank's just crazy about him. He likes the way he talks. He helped him carry home the clean laundry.
L512886 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ Are you sure it's safe to let him around that guy?
L512883 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I know.
L512882 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ He just got out of the state hospital.
L512863 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ Can I help you, sir?
L512862 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Frank, don't talk that way. Who's that strange lookin' man behind you? Did he follow you in here?
L512659 +++$+++ u7668 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ MARSHA +++$+++ Why won't he talk to women?
L512658 +++$+++ u7672 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ THERESA +++$+++ I thought you'd be happy to leave.
L512657 +++$+++ u7668 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ MARSHA +++$+++ No, we have to get this story.
L512656 +++$+++ u7672 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ THERESA +++$+++ Let's just go, Marsha.
L512640 +++$+++ u7672 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ THERESA +++$+++ Yeah.
L512639 +++$+++ u7668 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ MARSHA +++$+++ Do you smell shit?
L512638 +++$+++ u7672 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ THERESA +++$+++ Hey, you're the one that wanted to major in journalism. Anyhow, wasn't the guy something like twelve or thirteen when he did it, it was twenty-five years ago, he probably doesn't even remember it.
L512637 +++$+++ u7668 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ MARSHA +++$+++ In a few minutes we're gonna be in a room with a killer. That doesn't bother you?
L512636 +++$+++ u7672 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ THERESA +++$+++ I don't know why you're so weirded out, this is not San Quentin, it's just a nuthouse. Most of these people don't even know where they are, they're not gonna hurt you.
L512699 +++$+++ u7674 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ WOOLRIDGE +++$+++ As much as anybody else is, I guess. Y'all have a good rest of the day now.
L512698 +++$+++ u7668 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ MARSHA +++$+++ Will he be supervised?
L512697 +++$+++ u7674 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ WOOLRIDGE +++$+++ Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here.
L512696 +++$+++ u7668 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ MARSHA +++$+++ Where will he go?
L512695 +++$+++ u7674 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ WOOLRIDGE +++$+++ I hope the best for you, Miss Dwiggins, with your school and your paper and all.
L512694 +++$+++ u7668 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ MARSHA +++$+++ I didn't mean that.
L512693 +++$+++ u7674 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ WOOLRIDGE +++$+++ We've got some paperwork to take care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry, you won't run into him in the parking lot.
L512692 +++$+++ u7668 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ MARSHA +++$+++ Is he leaving right this minute?
L512683 +++$+++ u7674 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ WOOLRIDGE +++$+++ Homicidal signs. Oh, we're gonna change the light in here for Karl. I hope you can see to write.
L512682 +++$+++ u7668 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ MARSHA +++$+++ Signs?
L512681 +++$+++ u7674 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ WOOLRIDGE +++$+++ He's free. His time's up. That's the rules. He's been treated and reevaluated. He doesn't show any signs any more.
L512680 +++$+++ u7668 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ MARSHA +++$+++ Can I ask you a question? If he's so troubled, why are you letting him out? What if he does it again? It happens all the time.
L512679 +++$+++ u7674 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ WOOLRIDGE +++$+++ It's the best you're gonna get. I'm sorry.
L512678 +++$+++ u7668 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ MARSHA +++$+++ How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions?
L512677 +++$+++ u7674 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ WOOLRIDGE +++$+++ But, here's the thing. He'll only talk to you. He doesn't want you to ask him anything. And you shouldn't stare at him.
L512672 +++$+++ u7674 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ WOOLRIDGE +++$+++ One of his Daddy's Bible lessons I imagine. Y'all pull up a chair. I'll go out and talk to him.
L512671 +++$+++ u7668 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ MARSHA +++$+++ That's really strange. What does it mean?
L512670 +++$+++ u7674 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ WOOLRIDGE +++$+++ I don't think so. Just period, I think. She told him... God gave them the ugliest creation he could think of. Karl has an entire book -- a notebook. On every page it says "Franklin Chapter 1 Verse number 1." He wrote that a few years ago after he'd learned to write. His father's name was Franklin.
L512669 +++$+++ u7668 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ MARSHA +++$+++ Before they were married?
L512668 +++$+++ u7674 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ WOOLRIDGE +++$+++ His mother told him that he was their punishment. Hers and his father's; from God, for having sex--
L512667 +++$+++ u7668 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ MARSHA +++$+++ I knew he slept in a toolshed.
L512666 +++$+++ u7674 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ WOOLRIDGE +++$+++ You see, Karl, growing up, only knew that sex was wrong and that people who did it should be killed for it. He couldn't really read but, well, neither could his mother. But, his father made sure that his mother knew what the Bible said. And she made sure Karl knew. You know he slept in a hole in the ground under a toolshed, right?
L512664 +++$+++ u7674 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ WOOLRIDGE +++$+++ Melvin, go get Karl and take him down to the old classroom.
L512663 +++$+++ u7668 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ MARSHA +++$+++ Can't you talk to him? Maybe talk him into it. I'm a real good interviewer. Just get me in the room with him.
L512655 +++$+++ u7668 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ MARSHA +++$+++ Well, what do we do? We drove all the way out here.
L512654 +++$+++ u7674 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ WOOLRIDGE +++$+++ I don't know what to tell you. I'm sorry. I made myself pretty clear I thought. He probably got busy and wasn't thinking. I know how that is. I used to teach shop and eighth grade science.
L512652 +++$+++ u7674 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ WOOLRIDGE +++$+++ The other thing is I told your boss on the phone to send a man. Karl won't talk to women.
L512651 +++$+++ u7668 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ MARSHA +++$+++ No thank you.
L512650 +++$+++ u7674 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ WOOLRIDGE +++$+++ Karl's real sensitive about having his picture made. He wouldn't even be on the bulletin board for the Easter Collage.  Melvin, would you get me a good hot cup with two sugar substitutes? You girls want some coffee?
L512649 +++$+++ u7668 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ MARSHA +++$+++ Well, yeah, it's for the school newspaper. But it has pictures. I mean it's a regular paper, you know.
L512648 +++$+++ u7674 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ WOOLRIDGE +++$+++ I think there must have been a little mix up. I told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is, there couldn't be any pictures. It's s'posed to be just a little story or article or something, isn't that right?
L512647 +++$+++ u7668 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ MARSHA +++$+++ Yes sir.
L512646 +++$+++ u7674 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ WOOLRIDGE +++$+++ Y'all have a seat. Is this all of you?
L512645 +++$+++ u7668 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ MARSHA +++$+++ Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans. She's here to take the pictures.
L512644 +++$+++ u7674 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ WOOLRIDGE +++$+++ My name's Jerry Woolridge.
L513219 +++$+++ u7669 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ MELINDA +++$+++ I think everybody at the store knows that already. They always talk about it. Maureen Ledbetter told a awful story about why you ain't allowed over at the First Baptist Church no more.
L513218 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ Yes.
L513217 +++$+++ u7669 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ MELINDA +++$+++ You mean about y'all bein' together in "that" way?
L513216 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ Well, a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors. Unfortunately, I have to keep certain parts of my life private.
L513215 +++$+++ u7669 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ MELINDA +++$+++ Why?
L513214 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ Also, Melinda, please don't tell anybody at the store that Albert was here tonight, okay.
L514579 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ No wonder it's such a screwed-up place.
L514578 +++$+++ u7675 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ APRIL +++$+++ I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another.
L514577 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Like me, too.
L514570 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Actually, I'm his father.
L514569 +++$+++ u7675 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ APRIL +++$+++ And what are you, his chaperone?
L514568 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Three's a crowd. Yes, I'm aware of that. But I have to keep an eye on Mr. Benjamin wherever he goes. To make sure he doesn't get himself into trouble.
L514567 +++$+++ u7675 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ APRIL +++$+++ Ah-hah, I see. A cozy dinner. But aren't threesomes a little awkward? How does the phrase go--
L514566 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ I wouldn't actually call it a party. It's more along the lines of a dinner in celebration of my birthday.  The guest list is quite restricted. So far, there's Mr. Benjamin and myself. If you accept, that would make three of us.
L514565 +++$+++ u7675 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ APRIL +++$+++ And how many people will be attending this birthday party?
L514564 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ It's my birthday.
L514563 +++$+++ u7675 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ APRIL +++$+++ And what's the occasion of this celebration?
L514560 +++$+++ u7675 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ APRIL +++$+++ An invitation?
L514559 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?
L514558 +++$+++ u7675 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ APRIL +++$+++ No! At least I don't think I am!
L514557 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ Perhaps I should rephrase the question. What I mean to say is, are you married or seriously involved with a significant other?
L514556 +++$+++ u7675 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ APRIL +++$+++ What!
L514553 +++$+++ u7675 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ APRIL +++$+++ Wonderful. When your next book is published, maybe you could come into the store and do a signing. I'm sure we could get a lot of people to show up.
L514552 +++$+++ u7683 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RASHID +++$+++ It's coming along. At the rate he's going, he'll have a story finished by the end of the summer.
L514776 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Forty-one pages.
L514775 +++$+++ u7675 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ APRIL +++$+++ Okay. I'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow.  It doesn't seem to be too long.
L514774 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Uh ... actually, it might be better if you read the story first. Call me when you're finished, okay?
L514773 +++$+++ u7675 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ APRIL +++$+++ I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger?
L514772 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.
L514771 +++$+++ u7675 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ APRIL +++$+++ I'd love to.
L514770 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I finished my story. I thought you might want to take a look at it.
L514765 +++$+++ u7675 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ APRIL +++$+++ Almost done. A week or ten days, and I'll be there.
L514764 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission.  How's Melville?
L514763 +++$+++ u7675 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ APRIL +++$+++ It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in touch.
L514762 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I'll tell you all about it...  ... but not here.
L514761 +++$+++ u7675 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ APRIL +++$+++ What happened?
L514760 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It looks worse than it is. I'm okay.
L514759 +++$+++ u7675 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ APRIL +++$+++ Jesus, what happened to you?
L514591 +++$+++ u7675 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ APRIL +++$+++ Which explains why this hasn't been the easiest summer of my life.
L514590 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Not an easy book.
L514589 +++$+++ u7675 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ APRIL +++$+++ That's the subject of my last chapter.
L514588 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Melville, huh?  It's been a while.
L514587 +++$+++ u7675 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ APRIL +++$+++ Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true.  Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?
L514586 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Wow. You don't fool around, do you?
L514585 +++$+++ u7675 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ APRIL +++$+++ Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction.
L514584 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis?
L514583 +++$+++ u7675 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ APRIL +++$+++ American literature. What else?
L514582 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Your dissertation? What subject do you study?
L514581 +++$+++ u7675 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ APRIL +++$+++ It's just a summer job. Something to help pay the bills while I finish my dissertation.
L514580 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ And the bookstore? Have you been working there long?
L514576 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Just like me.
L514575 +++$+++ u7675 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ APRIL +++$+++ Muncie, Indiana. He and my mother met as students. But I'm from Brooklyn. My sisters and I were all born and bred right here.
L514574 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ And your father? Is he from New York?
L514573 +++$+++ u7675 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ APRIL +++$+++ Until she was twelve. She moved here in 'forty-nine.
