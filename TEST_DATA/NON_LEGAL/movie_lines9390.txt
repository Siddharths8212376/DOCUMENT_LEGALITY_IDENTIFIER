L516291 +++$+++ u2836 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ LOCKE +++$+++ -- Brought against Sparazza by Israel's mother Laverne who was nineteen at the time. They had a brief affair which Israel was the by- product of.
L516290 +++$+++ u2838 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ MESSNER +++$+++ ...A paternity suit, filed 1967...
L516288 +++$+++ u2838 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ MESSNER +++$+++ And you just figured that out?  The Swede isn't a hitman, is he? He's a surgeon. Sparazza didn't want Israel's heart for a trophy, he wanted it for a transplant... why?
L516287 +++$+++ u2836 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ LOCKE +++$+++ You're finished.
L516286 +++$+++ u2838 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ MESSNER +++$+++ -- You can and you will.
L516285 +++$+++ u2836 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ LOCKE +++$+++ I can't discuss --
L516282 +++$+++ u2838 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ MESSNER +++$+++ -- no, we need to handle it now.
L516281 +++$+++ u2836 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ LOCKE +++$+++ -- will be handled back in --
L516280 +++$+++ u2838 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ MESSNER +++$+++ My debrief --
L516279 +++$+++ u2836 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ LOCKE +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L516278 +++$+++ u2838 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ MESSNER +++$+++ Where's Israel?
L516234 +++$+++ u2836 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ LOCKE +++$+++ We have to transport Mr. Israel to Las Vegas, time is of the essence. The gulfstream is standing by on the jetway at Tahoe International. I'm sorry, I'm restricted from disclosing anymore information. Return to Washington. You'll be debriefed in the coming days.
L516233 +++$+++ u2838 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ MESSNER +++$+++ What the hell -- What is this!? People died. Agent Carruthers is dead!
L516231 +++$+++ u2836 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ LOCKE +++$+++ Difficult to explain everything now...  And much larger issues loom.  I'm sorry about Carruthers... Damndest thing to have to die for.
L516230 +++$+++ u2838 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ MESSNER +++$+++ This is him? The hitman hired to kill Israel? He's a doctor?
L516229 +++$+++ u2836 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ LOCKE +++$+++ Here. Sit.   Please.
L515659 +++$+++ u2836 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ LOCKE +++$+++ Israel's legal representation, the firm of Culpepper, Brody and Reed, which is currently the subject of a joint SEC and Treasury Department probe, were left holding the bag after he skipped bail. Over three- quarters of a million dollars on a bond that's set to expire in less than a day. Rupert Reed, one of the firm's partners, has learned of Israel's whereabouts and dispatched a local bondsman by the name of Jack Dupree to pick him up and return him to Las Vegas... that can't happen.  We have a Gulf Stream standing by at Reagan International to transport you two to Lake Tahoe.  It's very simple gentlemen. Valacchi, Fratiano, Gravano -- no former witness against the mob has been as crucial or has brought more to bear on the potential dissolution of The La Cosa Nostra, than Buddy Israel.
L515658 +++$+++ u2838 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ MESSNER +++$+++ It's the last place they'd look.
L515621 +++$+++ u2836 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ LOCKE +++$+++ Possibly. Acosta is pure mercenary. And a million dollar hit fee will draw some huge flies. But forget about Sparazza's money for a moment and remember, there's no shortage of those who want Israel killed and no shortage of cash to do just that...
L515620 +++$+++ u2838 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ MESSNER +++$+++ You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit?
L515619 +++$+++ u2836 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ LOCKE +++$+++ On an extradition flight back to El Salvador, he murdered a security detachment and vanished.
L515604 +++$+++ u2836 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ LOCKE +++$+++ -- Your intel corroborates what we already know. Sparazza's health is in rapid decline and before his date with destiny, it seems he wants one last thing... The heart of his sworn enemy. A recently opened, cash rich escrow account has been traced back to Sparazza. This and the mention of this mysterious Swede makes the million dollar contract on Israel very real.
L515603 +++$+++ u2838 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ MESSNER +++$+++ So the wiretaps we conducted on Serna and Padiche, the mention of Israel's heart?
L515602 +++$+++ u2836 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ LOCKE +++$+++ His testimony has the potential of blowing the lid off what's left of the La Cosa Nostra is this country. That alone warrants total immunity from prosecution and and a vanishing act with Witness Protection.
L515601 +++$+++ u2838 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ MESSNER +++$+++ A marked man gets wise and wants to come in.
L515595 +++$+++ u2836 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ LOCKE +++$+++ Sparazza was the one who introduced Israel to the life, gave him his first big break, brought him through the ranks.
L515594 +++$+++ u2838 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ MESSNER +++$+++ So he's personally issued the contract on Israel?
L515587 +++$+++ u2838 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ MESSNER +++$+++ I thought Heller was a double op?
L515586 +++$+++ u2836 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ LOCKE +++$+++ Sparazza is rumored to have performed in excess of one-hundred and thirty contract murders, including one of the bureau's most celebrated agents. Freeman Heller. You heard of "The Turnpike Murders" that was Sparazza.
L515966 +++$+++ u2839 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ PADICHE +++$+++ It's gettin' done Sid.
L515965 +++$+++ u2841 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ SERNA +++$+++ Bag this fucker Buzzy.
L515964 +++$+++ u2839 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ PADICHE +++$+++ I'm working on it.
L515963 +++$+++ u2841 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ SERNA +++$+++ Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel.
L515962 +++$+++ u2839 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ PADICHE +++$+++ -- No, no, not when y'can see the shore. I hear ya.
L515958 +++$+++ u2839 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ PADICHE +++$+++ Well, uh -- damn, alright, so he's headed in, does that -- where does that leave us?
L515957 +++$+++ u2841 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ SERNA +++$+++ Well, I'm hearin' the Swede's been dispatched, he's flying so --
L515956 +++$+++ u2839 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ PADICHE +++$+++ How are we on time...?
L515955 +++$+++ u2841 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ SERNA +++$+++ Okay -- yeah, I can, I respect that.
L515954 +++$+++ u2839 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ PADICHE +++$+++ Lil' cagey, y'know, don't like t'share trade secrets, that type'a thing.
L515952 +++$+++ u2839 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ PADICHE +++$+++ Cold blood Sid, dead eyes, y'know?
L515951 +++$+++ u2841 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ SERNA +++$+++ Fuckin' thrilled t'hear it. So the scout, the sitdown, y'musta felt it from 'em then huh?
L515950 +++$+++ u2839 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ PADICHE +++$+++ Good. This thing's on track, looks like it's gonna get done.
L515949 +++$+++ u2841 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ SERNA +++$+++ So how we lookin'?
L515948 +++$+++ u2839 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ PADICHE +++$+++ Nah, nuthin' on my end --
L515947 +++$+++ u2841 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ SERNA +++$+++ Right, you got clicks, anything?
L515946 +++$+++ u2839 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ PADICHE +++$+++ Yeah... Sid?
L515945 +++$+++ u2841 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ SERNA +++$+++ Buzzy... Buzz...?
L515574 +++$+++ u2841 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ SERNA +++$+++ None whatsoever.
L515573 +++$+++ u2839 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ PADICHE +++$+++ No shit.
L515572 +++$+++ u2841 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ SERNA +++$+++ A million flat.
L515571 +++$+++ u2839 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ PADICHE +++$+++ Shoot.
L515570 +++$+++ u2841 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ SERNA +++$+++ That's the punchline, y'ready?
L515569 +++$+++ u2839 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ PADICHE +++$+++ Well just so I got a quote in my head. What's the rate for the Swede?
L515568 +++$+++ u2841 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ SERNA +++$+++ Yeah, I can front this.
L515567 +++$+++ u2839 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ PADICHE +++$+++ That's not a problem. Are we goin' outta pocket ourselves?
L515566 +++$+++ u2841 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ SERNA +++$+++ Chances are, they're gonna get into some shit too, hafta put people down.
L515565 +++$+++ u2839 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ PADICHE +++$+++ Yeah, there's a pair'a broads I'm thinking might be good for this.
L515564 +++$+++ u2841 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ SERNA +++$+++ Hey, we nab Israel, they pay t'get'm back, I'll cut the fuckin' thing out m'self, no extra charge. My thing is, we crew up, let's not fuck around, someone's cousin, some Zip off the boat from Naples, let's get pros, people who know how to behave.
L515563 +++$+++ u2839 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ PADICHE +++$+++ Wow.
L515562 +++$+++ u2841 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ SERNA +++$+++ -- who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate.
L515561 +++$+++ u2839 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ PADICHE +++$+++ ... Jesus... what for?
L515560 +++$+++ u2841 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ SERNA +++$+++ Yeah, y'ain't heard the punchline, yet and before I get to it, one more thing I heard, little curious, should probably bring it up... Primo wants Israel's heart. The actual thing, the organ.
L515559 +++$+++ u2839 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ PADICHE +++$+++ Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.
L515558 +++$+++ u2841 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ SERNA +++$+++ Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
L515557 +++$+++ u2839 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ PADICHE +++$+++ No question, no, you're right. We gotta do what's good for us now.
L515554 +++$+++ u2841 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ SERNA +++$+++ So what I heard downstairs there is that they got a guy, some Swede, real badass, supposedly a "specialist" and they're bringing him over. Now he ain't coming cheap -- so, I'm thinkin' we jump, do this in the next day or so, get to Israel before the Swede can, we got chits, y'see? We're in a power position. Grab him, ransom him back, pick up that nut, we're that much closer to having our own thing.
L515553 +++$+++ u2839 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ PADICHE +++$+++ -- okay, g'head --
L515552 +++$+++ u2841 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ SERNA +++$+++ -- yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose --
L515551 +++$+++ u2839 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ PADICHE +++$+++ -- he's doing it then, huh --
L515550 +++$+++ u2841 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ SERNA +++$+++ Okay, he's gonna clip Israel, I just gotta outta there --
L515549 +++$+++ u2839 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ PADICHE +++$+++ I'm here.
L515548 +++$+++ u2841 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ SERNA +++$+++ Alright, now Buzzy -- this is, this is it, here, okay, so listen to me careful and wait till I'm finished 'cuz we got no room for slop.
L515546 +++$+++ u2841 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ SERNA +++$+++ -- Okay... hang on, I gotta move --
L515545 +++$+++ u2839 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ PADICHE +++$+++ Nah, nuthin' on my end --
L515544 +++$+++ u2841 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ SERNA +++$+++ You got clicks, anything?
L515543 +++$+++ u2839 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ PADICHE +++$+++ Yeah... Sid?
L515542 +++$+++ u2841 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ SERNA +++$+++ Buzzy... Buzz...?

L515613 +++$+++ u2843 +++$+++ m186 +++$+++ SYKES +++$+++ What else did Padiche say?

L518524 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ You're not Gibarian...
L518523 +++$+++ u2846 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ GIBARIAN +++$+++ You'll end up like me.
L518522 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ I can trust Rheya.
L518521 +++$+++ u2846 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ GIBARIAN +++$+++ What I'm saying is: Don't trust anyone.  Find yourself a weapon of some sort.
L518520 +++$+++ u2846 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ GIBARIAN +++$+++ It can.  Ordinary matter, like ours? Not affected.  Everything else, disintegrates.
L518519 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Can it work?
L518518 +++$+++ u2846 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ GIBARIAN +++$+++ You're being tricked.  Sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors.  He's figured out they're made of subatomic particles called neutrinos, and he's going to create a negative neutrino field.  Twenty four hours a day, until they're back on Earth.
L518517 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ What do you want?
L518516 +++$+++ u2846 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ GIBARIAN +++$+++ You think you're dreaming me, like you dream her.  Understand something: I am the real Gibarian.  Just a new incarnation.
L518514 +++$+++ u2846 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ GIBARIAN +++$+++ Leave the light off.
L518513 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Gibarian.
L518668 +++$+++ u2849 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SARTORIUS +++$+++ Yes.
L518667 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Where's Snow?  Did you call him?
L518666 +++$+++ u2849 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SARTORIUS +++$+++ If it continues, it will implode from its own weight and turn into a black hole in about four hours and pulls us in with it.
L518665 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ How quickly?
L518664 +++$+++ u2849 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SARTORIUS +++$+++ It's changing characteristics.  It's solidifying taking on weight.
L518663 +++$+++ u2849 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SARTORIUS +++$+++ Whose side are you on?
L518662 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ You fucking bastard...
L518661 +++$+++ u2849 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SARTORIUS +++$+++ It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever it is, it's not human, and I am threatened by that.  Evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. And I want to win.  I want humans to win.  So I am killing it before it kills me.
L518660 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Why would you let her to do that?
L518659 +++$+++ u2849 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SARTORIUS +++$+++ No, she won't.
L518658 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ She'll come back.
L518657 +++$+++ u2849 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SARTORIUS +++$+++ Kelvin, she begged me.  I had a short- range version of the destabilizer prototype, a miniature with a range of a few meters.  She walked into it and disappeared.  She was gone.
L518656 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ You murdered her!
L518655 +++$+++ u2849 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SARTORIUS +++$+++ Not her.  It.
L518654 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ You killed her!
L518476 +++$+++ u2849 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SARTORIUS +++$+++ Why did you agree to come here?
L518475 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ That's fantastic.
L518474 +++$+++ u2849 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SARTORIUS +++$+++ Yes.
L518473 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Meaning Man can do whatever the fuck it wants?
L518375 +++$+++ u2849 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SARTORIUS +++$+++ She reappeared exactly as she had before?
L518374 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ No.  There's no behavior modification.
L518236 +++$+++ u2849 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SARTORIUS +++$+++ We're done.  Oh, I should tell you, I don't trust Snow.  There's something wrong with him.
L518235 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Listen --
L518234 +++$+++ u2849 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SARTORIUS +++$+++ Just so you know: I'm not going back until I understand what it is.  I am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then I will go home.
L518233 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ They shouldn't let people like you into space.
L518231 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Her?  Who are you talking about?
L518230 +++$+++ u2849 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SARTORIUS +++$+++ In the lab.  With her, probably.
L518229 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ Where's his body?
L518228 +++$+++ u2849 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SARTORIUS +++$+++ The same thing that could happen to any of us.
L518227 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ I am here to recover this mission, report my findings, and make a recommendation.  Now: What happened to him?
L518226 +++$+++ u2849 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SARTORIUS +++$+++ Who, here, could possibly care what you want?  At best, you're Employee of the Month for the highest bidder in the Solaris auction.  They have no idea what's going on up here. They've never even been in space. And I'm supposed to listen to you?
L518225 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ I want to hear your version.
L518224 +++$+++ u2849 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ SARTORIUS +++$+++ Didn't you talk to Snow?
L518223 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ What happened to Gibarian?
L518222 +++$+++ u2847 +++$+++ m187 +++$+++ KELVIN +++$+++ All right.
