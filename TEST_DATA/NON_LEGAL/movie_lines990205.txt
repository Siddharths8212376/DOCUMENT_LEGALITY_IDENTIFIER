L446801 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You, too?  My name is Betty Mayfield. I was born, and I am here. Message ends. That's what I told him. He didn't like it.
L446800 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Just who are you, anyway?
L446799 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Certainly not to me.
L446798 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Let's not pretend Mitchell meant anything to either of us.
L446797 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Dance? Tonight?
L446796 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ So there is. You don't want to go to bed. I don't want to go to bed. Let's go somewhere and hear some music--have something to drink-- something to eat--even dance.
L446795 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ There's a lot of night left to live through.
L446794 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Quarter after one. Why?
L446793 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ What time is it?
L446792 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ That's putting it mildly.
L446791 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ He could hardly help suspecting you.
L446790 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Bad enough.
L446789 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Bad?
L446786 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ You didn't have to tell him that.
L446785 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ There's one thing I may as well tell you. You'll find it out anyhow. I tried to run away--when I found him out there on the balcony. There wasn't any plane.
L446657 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No thanks.
L446656 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Want a spike in it?
L446655 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ It's always a mistake to run away. Always.
L446654 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ There wasn't any plane.
L446653 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ You tried to run away.
L446652 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I'd rather wait until it does matter.
L446651 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Go ahead...if you want to. It doesn't matter.
L446649 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ That's all there is.
L446648 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ He was a great boy for that. What else?
L446647 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ He knew the immigration officer. He eased himself in.
L446646 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Nice of him.
L446645 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ On a train. He said he lived here, and he offered to make a reservation for me.
L446644 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ How did you meet him?
L446643 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I don't.
L446642 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ They'll know whether he killed himself.
L446640 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Sure... but somebody always does..
L446639 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No. And I've never fired a gun in my life, Aren't you supposed not to touch it?
L446637 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Not with my consent, strange as it seems. I don't know how he got in. I don't know anything.
L446636 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ He got in here how?
L446635 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ There isn't one.. That anyone would believe. I went for a walk after dinner, down to the ocean...alone... I came up and went to bed. I didn't sleep very well. Then there was a thunderstorm. And it began to rain. I went across to close the French door. That's the first time I saw him out there.
L446632 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ There's one less tonight.
L446631 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ What's funny about that? If you pick up people like Larry Mitchell other people are bound to get funny ideas about you. The world is full of Larry Mitchells.
L446630 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You said it wasn't a tragedy.
L446628 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Don't take it so big... it isn't a tragedy.
L446627 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Much too late.
L446626 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I know it's a littler late for an apology.
L446569 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No thank you.
L446568 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Dance?
L446488 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ He doesn't even know half the people who come up to drink his liquor.
L446487 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?
L446486 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.
L446485 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Do you think I don't?
L446484 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Neatly said...but to the wrong man. The trouble with pretty girls is that they can't imagine anyone thinking of anything else but the fact they are pretty girls. I get tired of it.
L446483 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I hate to be alone. But I've heard all the approaches there are... even yours.
L446482 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I don't know you and you don't know me. I made a reasonably polite suggestion. But I'm sure you'd rather be alone.
L446481 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I didn't say anything.
L446480 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Whatever you say.
L446479 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Would it make you anymore amusing?
L446478 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I can be talked out of it. As a matter of fact, I'd like a dry Martini myself.
L446477 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You're drinking it.
L446476 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ No.  Are you really going to drink that stuff?
L446475 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ And do you amuse the guests?
L446474 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I never pay for anything. They just keep me here to amuse the guests.
L446473 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You're not paying for this. It's quite enough that you let me sit at your table.
L446472 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Sure. But I'd hate like the Dickens to be held to everything I've said before, wouldn't you?
L446471 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ As I said before...
L446470 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But..  If you really want a good dry Martini..
L446469 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You don't sound as if you liked him very much.
L446468 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow about my age. Lot of money... that he didn't make. Former American. Now naturalized in Canada. Social standing indeterminate. Manners not quite perfect. Scotch superb.
L446467 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ What did you say his name was?
L446466 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.
L446465 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
L446464 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ It might be worth a Martini to you.
L446463 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I see.
L446462 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ A fellow named Brandon has a penthouse here. He's holding open house. I was up there. Too noisy. Bored.
L446461 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Disgusting, aren't they? If you really want a Martini, I know where you can get one.
L446460 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Your liquor laws..
L446450 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I see.
L446449 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Sit down then. We often have a double up here.
L446448 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No, please.
L446447 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ You can have the table yourself, if you'd rather. I'm only killing time.
L446459 +++$+++ u7105 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ Right, Miss.
L446458 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Ale. I don't mind.
L446457 +++$+++ u7105 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ Beer or ale, Miss?
L446456 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Beer?  Well, all right.
L446455 +++$+++ u7105 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law.
L446454 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry, please.
L446453 +++$+++ u7105 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ Yes, Miss.
L447469 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I understand, Betty.  I understand perfectly.
L447468 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ But I tell you---if you'd only understand.
L447467 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I hope he can prove it.  Come on. You don't want to get pneumonia.
L447466 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No, Jeff.  You don't.  He's not a murderer, I tell you.  He;s not a murderer.
L447465 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ We know everything.
L447464 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ He could have killed me a dozen times.  You'd never have known.
L447092 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Goodbye, Betty.
L447091 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Not sometimes.  Always.  Just because it is the hard way.  You're that kind of man, Jeff.
L447090 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Sometimes.
L447089 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You do things the hard way, don't you?
L447088 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ There's an empty taxi across the street.  If you're so anxious, take it.  He'll know the way to the police headquarters.
L447087 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ But even if you were in love with me.
L447086 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I know that.
L447085 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ What proper grounds?  You can't be in love with me.  You hardly know me.  I'm not in love with you.
L447084 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I've been a soldier too.  There is a difference.  A policeman, like a judge, has a right to disqualify himself on proper grounds.
L447083 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ What are you going to do--toss your job into Puget Sound?  Because I make you think of magnolias?  I thought policeman was something like a soldier.  That his duty came first.  However much he might happen hate it.
L447082 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You're still a police officer, Jeff.  I saw you send those two men away. I know they were watching me.
L447081 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ That's they're business.  Can I drop you somewhere?
L447080 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ What will they do to you?
L447079 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I can't answer that.
L447078 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ To do what?
L447077 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ You've got a couple of hours, maybe.
L447076 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I'm enough of a copper to do my duty.  My boss made it tough for me.  If I don't arrest you, I've gone soft.  If I do, it's to save my face.  I don't play those rules.
L447075 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Because you think your in love with me?
L447074 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ That's something I can't spare you.  But I won't do it myself.
L447073 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ They'll only find someone else-- who won't be so kind.
L447072 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Time's up.  I'm off the case. 
L447071 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I always wear gloves when I shoot people.  A bad joke--but better than tears.
L447070 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ So Mitchell had handled it. Afterwards, Brandon picked it up.  There's no indication you handled it.
L447069 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Looking for peanuts, I suppose.
L447068 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Not quiet yet.  We know who the gun belonged to. Margo West.  She told us this morning.  It doesn't mean much.  Mitchell took it away from her.  He had a habit of going through her bag.
L447067 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Jeff.  Shall we go now, Jeff, and get it over with?
L447066 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ They call me Jeff.
L447065 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ What do your friends call you?-- The ones that know you well?--and like you very much?
L447064 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ That's my hard luck--I'm man enough to tell you about it--and not be sorry.
L447063 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Very ridiculous.
L447062 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Palm trees against a sunset--waves breaking on a coral reef--the Taj Mahal by moonlight--roses in an English garden, just after a shower--  Clichés, one and all--but good ones, with a lot of mileage left in them--there's one thing he does not see--murder--and murder was what he was sent to find.  Pretty ridiculous, isn't it?
L447061 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ What does he see?
L447060 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ He looks at the girl, looks into her eyes--
L447059 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Points very straight to her.
L447058 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I'm about to be very silly.  A man passes a girl on the street--a very lovely girl--his eyes meet her eyes, and something reaches out and takes hold of his heart-- and then she goes on and is lost in the crowd--and he says to himself, "There goes my lost love"-- and it's true--if he never sees her again, it's still true.  Of course, after a while, he forgets-- or almost forgets--because after a while we forget almost everything.  But this man is a copper.  He gets orders--routine orders--to go to a place and investigate a murder-- and everything points to a certain girl.
L447054 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ There must be-- but when I'm with you I can't find it.
L447053 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You wouldn't even try  There must be some copper in you, or you wouldn't be an inspector.
L447052 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I might be able to save you.  If I knew enough.
L447051 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I expected nothing else.
L447047 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I've come here to arrest you for murder.
L447046 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I don't want to talk.
L447045 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ This isn't a very good place to talk.
L446954 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ There isn't anything you can do.
L446953 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Then there isn't much I can do, is there?
L446952 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You understand perfectly.
L446951 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ If I understand what you meant by that.
L446950 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Nobody can help me. You, least of all.
L446949 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ You won't tell me who you are? You won't even give me a chance to help you?
L446948 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You're a police officer. A very nice one--but you have a job to do. I'm a girl who's in a jam, and it's your job to keep me there. Don't go considerate on me. I might start to bawl.
L446947 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ We try to be decent.
L446946 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You--or the Vancouver Police Department?
L446945 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I wouldn't make you talk about it. My job is the death of Marry Mitchell.  Why can't you give me your confidence?
L446944 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ You've has an experience that you don't want to talk about. An unhappy marriage, for example.
L446943 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ The police always do, don't they?
L446942 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I'll find out, you know. Perhaps not today--perhaps not tomorrow. But in the end, I'll find out.
L446940 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I'd like to believe that. It's not too easy.
L446939 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You were there when I last saw him.
L446938 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ We're 98 per cent certain Mitchell was murdered. There are a lot of reasons.  Was he very drunk when you last saw him?
L446937 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Is it a crime?
L446936 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ But not in the investigation of a major crime, I hope.
L446935 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Who hasn't--one way or another?
L446934 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ You've had dealings with the police before?
L446933 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You were a galahad, compared to some cops I've known.
L446932 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ True. I was a bit irritable last night. I apologize.
L446931 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ We wouldn't have met at all.
L446930 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Down below's Stanley Park. On the other side of the trees, there's a beach. You can see it.  Steveston's over there. Coast Guard station.  There's the Yacht Club, and beyond it, the docks. The over on the other side of the inlet, there's Grouse Mountain. It's about 4000 feet high. There's a restaurant on top of it. Very nice restaurant.  I'm sorry we couldn't have met in pleasanter circumstances, Miss Mayfield.
L446883 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I've never been to Florida.
L446882 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ FLorida?
L446881 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ You must come from pretty far South.
L446880 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Deep blue? I'd call it grey-blue.
L446879 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Care for a stroll outside? Beautiful morning. The air is like wine, the sky is a deep blue.
L446878 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ They're all crude, when they don't work. Had breakfast?
L446877 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Good morning, Mr. Killaine. I'm sorry I can't give you the name of my bank--because I have no bank at the moment.  That was a crude trick.
L446782 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I probably shall--after I've tortured you a little more.
L446781 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Why don't you arrest me and be done with it.
L446780 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ An unhappy marriage hardly seems a sufficient reason for that.
L446778 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ A graduation present.
L446777 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Where's you get it?
L446776 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Yes.
L446775 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ What this?
L446774 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Would you be satisfied if I said I shot him?
L446773 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Stop saying you're sorry. I want information, not regrets.
L446772 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L446771 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.
L446770 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Your family coat of arms, Mr. Killaine?
L446766 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ There's the clear mark of a wedding ring on your finger.
L446765 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Who told you I was married?
L446764 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Well, that's not getting us anywhere. You won't tell me who you are, or give any account of yourself. You won't even give me your address in the United States. Why? Unhappy marriage?
L446738 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ It is?
L446737 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ That's an evasion and you know it.
L446736 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You didn't ask a question. You made a speech.
L446735 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Please answer my question.
L446734 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Miss Mayfield, the humor of the situation escapes me. Within 24 hours I shall know officially whether Mitchell was murdered. Privately, I'm quite sure of it now. It happened in your room, and you came to Vancouver with him.. At any rate, he made your hotel reservation.. And you arrived together. Here in this room he behaved nastily to you, and you said something to him which might be taken as a threat.  A few hours later he was found dead on your balcony. Would it be too much too suggest that all these circumstances taken together are a little suspicious?
L446733 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I'm sorry, that's all there is.
L446732 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ I'll have to know a little more than that.
L446731 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I was born in New York City. I grew up. And here I am.
L446730 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ You probably know the type. You find them in hotels and resorts all over the world. They always have clothes, and money, and usually have had three or four husbands. They dress and enamel themselves with great care. They worry a great deal about those little lines at the corner of the eyes.. And they demonstrate their incompetence at the art of living bet getting mixed up with people like Larry Mitchell.  Tell me about yourself, Miss Mayfield.
L446729 +++$+++ u7088 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I don't know her.. or particularly want to.
L446728 +++$+++ u7095 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ KILLAINE +++$+++ Mrs. West is a very emotional woman.
L446894 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ This way.
L446893 +++$+++ u7103 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ Mr. Reed, please, for Mr.  Brandon.  Very well. Have him call. Mr. Brandon is in his office now.  Mr. Reed stepped out, Mr.  Brandon.
L446889 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Who's Goble?
L446888 +++$+++ u7103 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ And there's a Mr. Goble to see you. Says his business is personal.
L446887 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ All right. Get him.
L446886 +++$+++ u7103 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ Mr. Reed would like you to call him.
L446885 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ Morning. Any calls?
L446884 +++$+++ u7103 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ Good morning, Mr. Brandon.
L446928 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ Charlie's suits me fine. I don't scare.
L446927 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ I don't like your perfume in my office. Make it somewhere else if you don't like Charlie's.
L446926 +++$+++ u7093 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ GOBLE +++$+++ Why not here?
L446925 +++$+++ u7089 +++$+++ m475 +++$+++ BRANDON +++$+++ There's two hundred. I'll meet you in an hour--where we met last night
