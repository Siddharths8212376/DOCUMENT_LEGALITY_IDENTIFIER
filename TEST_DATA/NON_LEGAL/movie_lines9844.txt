L230354 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ This place becomes famous. Tour buses. Blind people feeling around for bullet holes in the wall.
L230353 +++$+++ u5453 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ What happens if somebody comes in here right now and shoots you?
L230291 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Show him who we are.
L230290 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What do you want me to do?
L230289 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ So what are you going to do about it?
L230288 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I was in a hurry to do big things, make big mistakes. Any mistakes were okay as long as it was big. But I'm trying to see these things clearly and honestly. That's the play they're going to kill starting tonight. There's a guy out there getting ready to rip it apart. And that's us. Who we were and where we come from.
L230287 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You tell your friends your father used to work the docks. Callused hands. But you had an attitude when you were growing up that wasn't easy for your mother and me to understand.
L230286 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Normal boy's ambition. I like coming back. You know that.
L230285 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You didn't think it was okay when you lived here. You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were running a marathon.
L230284 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I think the building's okay. At least for the time being.
L230283 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I'm lucky they don't knock down the building. It could happen anytime. And everything worth remembering is right here.
L230282 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I know, Pop.
L230281 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ `Why doesn't he come live with us?' Because everything is here.
L230278 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I'll go get you another one. You have to wear it.
L230277 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I lost it. I lose everything.
L230276 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble.
L230275 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I can't find it.
L230274 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Where's your elastic brace?
L230273 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ My back is killing me.
L230272 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Let's not start that again.
L230271 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Since when did that matter?
L230270 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.
L230269 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Don't make me sit through one of your plays.
L230268 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You'll need these. Tonight. For the play.
L230267 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I could have grown up happy. A Yankee fan. A divorce lawyer.
L230266 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ But the son is suppose to stop crying.
L230265 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember.
L230264 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things.
L230263 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Remember 1949? Last two games of the season. Against the Yankees. The Sox lost on Saturday. Then they lost on Sunday. First I cried for twenty-four hours. Then I had fist- fights the rest of the week.
L230262 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ The Red Sox are your problem. I never understood about you and the Red Sox. Everybody rooted for the Yankees.
L230261 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Of course they're gonna lose. We'll watch them lose. What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand?
L230260 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ They're only gonna lose.
L230259 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I do know the answer to that. Why don't we watch the ball game later? We'll go to Mannion's.
L230258 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You know the answer to that.
L230257 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'
L230256 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.
L230255 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ We must have been heroic.
L230254 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Get yourself something to eat.
L230253 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ It's a constant shock to me, how small this place is. How did we do it? Five people in these little rooms.
L230252 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ It was rummy, not poker. But I'll take a chance and let you in.
L230251 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Across Ninth Avenue. Dodgie's. Where you've been getting your hair cut for fifty years. Where Uncle Billy and Uncle Marty got their hair cut. Where Jim Rorty shot a man for cheating at poker.
L230250 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Where does Nicky get his hair cut?
L230249 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I'm on my way to get a haircut.
L230248 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ If it's you, what are you doing here?
L230247 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Where are your glasses? Go get them.
L230246 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Nicky comes on Sunday's.
L230245 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ It's me. Nicky.
L230244 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ What do you want?
L230243 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Right here. At the door.
L230242 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Where the hell are you?
L230241 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Pop, will you let me in?
L230240 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Go way. I'll call a cop.
L230239 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I'm at the door.
L230238 +++$+++ u5454 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Who is it?
L230495 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ This could be it!
L230494 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ This could be it!
L230480 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ It's a test all right. They're bringing in Stanley.
L230479 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ Don't worry. It's a test.
L230471 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ Because faith is rewarded.
L230470 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Because life is good.
L230469 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ Washed away.
L230468 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ All the times I died when the Red Sox lost an important game they should have won. All the awful things I said to my mother and father. To Tmy wife and daughter.
L230466 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ He used to love losers. But the laws of physics changed.
L230465 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ Because God loves a winner.
L230464 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ This is something no one has been privileged to see in almost seventy years. Very few people now alive can say that they have seen what you are about to see, Matthew. The Red Sox win a World Series. This is deeply, intensely personal. All the mistakes I've made, all the envy, fear and violence that's encased in this little envelope we call a person -- all washed away in the next few minutes. And your grandmother knows why.
L230450 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ Matthew.
L230449 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I don't know.
L230444 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ Speak it like it's real. Matthew.
L230443 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Life is good.
L230442 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ Then say it.
L230441 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments.
L230440 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ Say it and you'll believe it. Life is good. Say it.
L230435 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ If you believed, you wouldn't be walking around with a handgun in your belt. What does that tell me? You want to make the night come down.
L230434 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I want to believe.
L230433 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ You're afraid to risk believing. Believe in them. Believe in your self. Take a risk. It will humanize you as a person.
L230432 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ "It looked extremely rocky for the Boston nine that day."
L230431 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ You made him strike out. You wished it on him. You want to lose. It's too hard for you to believe in something. It's hard to have faith. It's hard Nwork to trust somebody.
L230428 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ It may be work but it's not honest work. Faith is the real work.
L230427 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. It's a lifetime's work.
L230426 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ Your problem is you take the easy way out. Losing is easy.
L230380 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ It's a simple subject.
L230379 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ It's a complicated subject.
L230378 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ And the people he hurts the most are the people who love him. Despite who he is and what he does for a living. We're always saying we want to take control of our lives. You don't want to take control. You want to lose control. Jesus knows it.
L230377 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I don't know Toyota. What does he do?
L230376 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do?
L230375 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Wife and daughter. My father's still alive. He outlives me, starting tonight. Because the Mets just tied the score. It was only a matter of time, wasn't it?
L230374 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ You're a family man, Frankie?
L230372 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ It's complicated. It's a whole life. A person doesn't commit an act of violence out of nowhere. There are strong forces at work.
L230371 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ Go on, tell him. Tell the truth. Tell him how you feel, shooting a piece of hot metal in somebody's flesh who was once a child, who was once the same age as this boy. Somebody's flesh who was innocent once.
L230360 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ That's my cousin, Angelo.
L230359 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury.
L230358 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
L230357 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ You're charming the boy.
L230356 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What am I doing?
L230355 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ You see what you're doing, don't you?
L230348 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Look, we're stuck here front and back. It's dinnertime for you, game time for me. Let's park the cab and go to Mannion's. What do you say, Matthew? We'll drink beer and talk baseball.
L230347 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ That's a simple subject.
L230346 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Now that's a complicated subject.
L230345 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ This is one charming crook. If shooting people is charming.
L230344 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ It's the kid's lucky day.
L230343 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.
L230342 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ A grandmother. God bless you.
L230341 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ Matthew's my grandson.
L230340 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ How come you got the kid with you?
L230339 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
L230338 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
L230337 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
L230336 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Some little kid stole the hubcaps.
L230335 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ Matthew, look at him. When I lived in Roxbury, the media followed this man everywhere. He was bigger than ten movie stars.  Where's your white Lincoln limo?
L230334 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Oh yeah?
L230333 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.
L230332 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Everybody else does. Why not you?
L230331 +++$+++ u5461 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ TOYOTA +++$+++ I'm looking at you trying to think. Put your face in the mirror. I know I recognize you from somewhere.
L230594 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ You're out of bullets.
L230593 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ And you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand?
L230586 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What about my play?
L230585 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ When I traveled through Asia this summer, I went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so I could call up Sports Phone in New York and get the scores. I drove through the war in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone like every hour on the hour, for updates.
L230584 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I was six years old the day Pesky hesitated throwing home and Slaughter scored all the way from first. That's when I knew the Red Sox were my team. Pity and terror.
L230583 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ Because I can't bear to watch. When they lose, I die inside. It's like some little person named Steve just crumples up and dies. I wait for the scores. I still die, hearing the scores, but it's over in a second. I can't survive the game pitch by pitch, inning by inning. I've done it too many times. And I can't do it anymore.
L230582 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ If you're such a devoted fan, why were you at the play tonight instead of the game? Answer carefully. This is important. You could have gone to the theater last night. There was no game last night.
L230581 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ The Red Sox were my world. I surrendered my existence to a team that couldn't win the big one.
L230580 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I went to college in Boston so I could be near the Red Sox. I took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game. My wife is from Boston. Lillian Ziegler?
L230579 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ They're my team, too. I grew up on Boyleston Street. Right by Fenway Park. I went to fifty or sixty games a year. All by myself. I was one of those kids with scabby elbows. I called out to the players. `Look over here. Hi, I'm Steven. My parents are divorced.'
L230578 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ No. They're not your team. They're my team.
L230577 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ They're my team.
L230576 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Why do you care?
L230575 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ If they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's all over.
L230574 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Why does it matter?
L230573 +++$+++ u5460 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ Then they lost?
L230142 +++$+++ u5459 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ You're dangling from the last letter of your last name.
L230141 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I've had three straight washouts, Sidney.
L230140 +++$+++ u5459 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Too late. All the elements are in place. Delay the opening and we lose the theater.
L230139 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Postpone. We have every right.
L230138 +++$+++ u5459 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Well I am. Worried sick. Everybody quotes Steven Schwimmer. He's here to announce the death of civilization. He kills a play every time he farts.
L230137 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ 'm not worried about this kid.
L230136 +++$+++ u5459 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ So what happened since? You're worried about this kid who writes these reviews?
L230135 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ hat was this morning.
L230134 +++$+++ u5459 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I had lunch with Joanna. She said she told you about Peter. You weren't concerned, she said.
L230133 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ appreciate that, Sidney. But our leading man can't remember his lines. And his understudy can't carry the play.
L230132 +++$+++ u5459 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Joanna loves this play. She has sunk tons of money. She is completely Ncommitted.
L230131 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ aybe we ought to postpone the opening.
L230515 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You're not making sense.
L230514 +++$+++ u5458 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ SECOND MAN +++$+++ Game six is history,pal.
L230509 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Eleventh inning. What else?
L230508 +++$+++ u5458 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ SECOND MAN +++$+++ Hurry back. Hurry back to what?
L230507 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Have to hurry back.
L230064 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ When the Mets lose, they just lose. It's a flat feeling. But the Red Sox -- here we have a rich history of interesting ways to lose a crucial game. Defeats that keep you awake, that pound in your head like the hammer of fate.
L230063 +++$+++ u5458 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ SECOND MAN +++$+++ How come?
L230062 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I hate the Mets.
L230457 +++$+++ u5462 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ But I know you, don't I? I seen you on a poster in the theater district. I'll think of your name in just a --
L230456 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Finally, I get a waiter who doesn't know "Macbeth".
L230394 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Get the hell out of here. I don't want you bringing our food. Send a real waiter.
L230393 +++$+++ u5462 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ Yessiree, Bob.
L230073 +++$+++ u5462 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ Because he is so deeply hated by so many people in the business.
L230072 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Why?
L230071 +++$+++ u5462 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ To go to the theater. Wears I don't know what. Make-up, padding.
L230070 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What do you mean?
L230175 +++$+++ u5457 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I know it sounds easy. But something happens between the time I hear the line and the time I'm suppose to Jrepeat it.
L230174 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ This could be it.
L230171 +++$+++ u5457 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ That's the line I can't ever, for the life of me remember. I just can't get it.
L230170 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ And the Father replies?
L230162 +++$+++ u5457 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I can see her face so clearly. Dear God. My heart was flying out of my chest with love.
L230161 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yes.

L230154 +++$+++ u5457 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What color?
L230153 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You have to see the words. Try to build a mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen.

L230151 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yes, Peter.

L230201 +++$+++ u5456 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PAISLEY +++$+++ He feels he has to defend himself if necessary.

L230189 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ So everything. That's so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm.
L230188 +++$+++ u5456 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PAISLEY +++$+++ If I'm sleeping with him, and I haven't said I am, then so what?
L230187 +++$+++ u5455 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ There's a certain kind of wounded young man who uses his oddness to get laid. Is that our Steven?
L230186 +++$+++ u5456 +++$+++ m363 +++$+++ PAISLEY +++$+++ No one's waiting.
