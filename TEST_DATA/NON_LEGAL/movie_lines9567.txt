L53327 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Well not any more, now I'm a serious writer and above this crap.
L53326 +++$+++ u3810 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ KATKA +++$+++ You used to read.

L53301 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Ooh, well excuse me.
L53300 +++$+++ u3810 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ KATKA +++$+++ So why don't you get up and speak something, then we will see who is crazy.
L53287 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ I think he's jealous of Havel.
L53286 +++$+++ u3810 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ KATKA +++$+++ Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
L53285 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Lawrence is getting derogatory again.
L53989 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Cool....So, if we say eight o'clock.
L53988 +++$+++ u3807 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ JAHN +++$+++ About forty minutes.
L53987 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Great....How long will it go for?
L53986 +++$+++ u3807 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ JAHN +++$+++ Yes, it's looks good.....We will use this for the soundtrack and we will have two guys up there with the spotlights. The others will just be house lights.
L53838 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Don't worry. Thanks.
L53837 +++$+++ u3807 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ JAHN +++$+++ No thanks, I must go, but maybe you could get some beers for the guys.
L53835 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Don't go making it too simple, we're on the cutting edge here.
L53834 +++$+++ u3807 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ JAHN +++$+++ Yeah, it's a simple piece. If they get the floor done in time, me and the others will rehearse tomorrow afternoon, but it's not critical.
L53833 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Great. And your all set for the performance?
L53832 +++$+++ u3807 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ JAHN +++$+++ They'll do it.

L53805 +++$+++ u3807 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ JAHN +++$+++ Can we charge admission?
L53804 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Look, if you can get them to finish it by Friday, you and your friends can do the opening performance that night.
L53803 +++$+++ u3807 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ JAHN +++$+++ It's not so much.
L53802 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ There's three thousand crowns, it's all I got.
L53800 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Well, I want them to put down a floor and a walkway.
L53799 +++$+++ u3807 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ JAHN +++$+++ Sure, they are students.
L53798 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ So I hear, do you know some of the stage hands?
L53797 +++$+++ u3807 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ JAHN +++$+++ Yes, The Obelisk but it's closed for repairs.
L53796 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Later. Jahn, I've been let down by the guys who were going to do the flooring. They brought the materials but took my money and ran. You guys have a school theatre don't you?
L53795 +++$+++ u3807 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ JAHN +++$+++ Hi, want to take up dancing?
L53446 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Hey Chris, keep an eye on things.
L53445 +++$+++ u3807 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ JAHN +++$+++ Sure, I've done it easily.
L53444 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Interesting. Do reckon I could fit through here?
L53437 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Don't worry, I've got lots of friends.
L53436 +++$+++ u3807 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ JAHN +++$+++ No, I am an actor not a labourer, I am just warning you, that's all.
L53429 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ And, since it's only two streets away, I suggest we go take a look. Now!
L53428 +++$+++ u3807 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ JAHN +++$+++ Yeah, for sure.
L53876 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ It's perfect, you've done a great job.
L53875 +++$+++ u3814 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ STUDENT +++$+++ Tomorrow, we will bring some lights and also hang some fabric. I think it will be finished in the morning.

L53864 +++$+++ u3814 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ STUDENT +++$+++ Yo, dobree!
L53863 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Okay?
L53589 +++$+++ u3804 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Insurance!
L53588 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ What for?
L53587 +++$+++ u3804 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ And take Jiri with you?
L53586 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Deal!
L53585 +++$+++ u3804 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ There's three thousand and if you don't come through, I'm going throw you clean out of that window. Deal?
L53584 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Two hundred dollars, make it six thousand crowns?
L53583 +++$+++ u3804 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I got a bad feeling about this.... How much do you need?
L53582 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Henry, I've been working my tail off on this. Look, all I need is a little cash to loosen up some tongues and you've got the scoop. It'll send those scum-bags down for life; be a big feather in the cap for the Bugler and your board of directors back home!
L53581 +++$+++ u3804 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ What pay-check? You ain't done nothing!
L53580 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ You can hold back this months pay-check until I come through with the story.
L53579 +++$+++ u3804 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ A month, Jesus! And how do I know you're not crapping me?
L53578 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ I'm in close with these guys, it isn't easy, but slowly they're opening up to me. Give me a month and I'll blow their movement wide open.
L53577 +++$+++ u3804 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ How?
L53576 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Henry, these guys already push most of the drugs in this town and now they want to move into pornography, right? Believe me, it won't stop there either, next it'll be a church and pretty soon they'll have their own department store or something...... Henry, we've got to stop them. The foundation's got to put an end to it!
L53575 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ That's only the half of it. I've heard a rumour they're taking over a theatre to use for alternative arts; you know what that means?
L53574 +++$+++ u3804 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Ah, so what?
L53573 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ You mean you don't know, Henry! We got a bunch of anarchists, controlling a six-level block of luxury apartments down on Janovska street here in the Old Town, and you don't know about it?
L54077 +++$+++ u3808 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ JAROSLAV +++$+++ I will tell you - within a week I will have the transcript and we can go through it.
L54076 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ How do I know what's being said?
L54075 +++$+++ u3808 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ JAROSLAV +++$+++ Of course, you can see that lady over there, she is recording everything.
L54074 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ You mean it's started?
L54073 +++$+++ u3808 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ JAROSLAV +++$+++ No, it should be over soon.
L54072 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Will this thing take long?
L54071 +++$+++ u3808 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ JAROSLAV +++$+++ I don't know - maybe they are talking about it now. Mr Vitovetch is a good friend of the Judge.
L54070 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Will they free me?
L54069 +++$+++ u3808 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ JAROSLAV +++$+++ What is bail?
L54068 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Any chance of getting me out on bail?
L54271 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Cool....Either of you know the way to Krakow?
L54270 +++$+++ u3805 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ It's Josh's.
L54269 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Where did you steal the car?
L54008 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Oh shit, yeah. Can you lend some more money?
L54007 +++$+++ u3805 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Weren't you going to get some glasses?
L54005 +++$+++ u3805 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Cool!
L54004 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Head the flyers up with Asylum and then put Debut of....Psychosis, Theatre experimental. That'll cover us if it flops. On the bottom put seek Asylum where the stars shine on Betlemska.
L53984 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Alright!
L53983 +++$+++ u3805 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Why don't we both forget about him?
L53982 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Hmm, I still owe him.
L53981 +++$+++ u3805 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Better than you.

L53942 +++$+++ u3805 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ I'd better get going, do you need a hand to get into bed?
L53939 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Sometimes.

L53934 +++$+++ u3805 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Are you sure I shouldn't get a doctor.
L53933 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ I had it coming from someone.
L53932 +++$+++ u3805 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ It's all my fault, I'm so sorry Doug.
L53929 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ I'll be okay, just get me home.
L53928 +++$+++ u3805 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ I'd better get you to a hospital.
L53911 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ One beer, one coffee, thanks.
L53910 +++$+++ u3805 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ No, just a coffee.
L53909 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ What would you like, beer?
L53879 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Yeah seems okay.
L53878 +++$+++ u3805 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Is it dry?
L53866 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Yeah, we'd better keep them for now, I'll try and get some glasses for tomorrow night.
L53865 +++$+++ u3805 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Shall I wash these out?
L53861 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ I know, some are trapped, usually by money.
L53860 +++$+++ u3805 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ We_re not all running away
L53859 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ No, I'm just running scared, same as everyone else.
L53858 +++$+++ u3805 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ A champion of lost causes huh?
L53857 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ I moving more to Communism now it's dying out.
L53856 +++$+++ u3805 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ I figured you more as a Socialist?
L53855 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ It's a student magazine networked through Eastern Europe and funded by Republican do-gooders back in the States.
L53854 +++$+++ u3805 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ What's the Bugler?
L53853 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Well, I've failed at everything else I've done and I can't hack it as a journalist, even for the Bugler.
L53852 +++$+++ u3805 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Why are you doing all this, what for?
L53824 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ The way I look at it, I've carried the camel to water and stuffed it's head under - if it doesn't drink now, we might as well shoot the thing and call it a day.
L53823 +++$+++ u3805 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Seems a shame!
L53815 +++$+++ u3805 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Thanks.
L53814 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Alright, go help Chris shovel up the last of the crap.
L53813 +++$+++ u3805 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ That's not what you said last night. And, I didn't bring that "prick" Josh.
L53812 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ We don't need you.
L53811 +++$+++ u3805 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ I thought I'd help out.
L53690 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Sure as long as you don't bring that prick Josh. Thanks Lawrence.
L53689 +++$+++ u3805 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Am I invited?
L53688 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ I'll put one on the notice-board too.
L53297 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Well she sure isn't normal.
L53296 +++$+++ u3805 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ No act of love but willing violence demanded by one and begged by the other. As life turned to fantasy and reality to ecstasy a need, so deep no light could reach, surfaced like a nocturnal creature unearthed for momentary and glorious display. Left alone in a rose-tinted afterglow dimming fast she tasted the moisture of her body and wondered why light came to day and such desires to her pale-skin body.
L54237 +++$+++ u3813 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ PAVEL +++$+++ I insist, it is the least we can do.
L54236 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ That's okay I like the metro, it's only a couple of stops from here.
L54235 +++$+++ u3813 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ PAVEL +++$+++ Yes, you are free to go, Karel here will drive you home.
L54234 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ We had a deal!
L54210 +++$+++ u3813 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ PAVEL +++$+++ Good, wait here, it will not take long and then you may go.

L54199 +++$+++ u3813 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ PAVEL +++$+++ You may use my office.
L54198 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ I'll need to make a phone call.
L54197 +++$+++ u3813 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ PAVEL +++$+++ You have the letter and my word, if you wish you may wait upstairs....Now, where are the disks?
L54196 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ How do I know this isn't a trap?
L54195 +++$+++ u3813 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ PAVEL +++$+++ I have the Director's word, there will be no action against them. You may go once we have the disks.
L54194 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ And the students?
L54180 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ The choice is yours, it's not negotiable.
L54179 +++$+++ u3813 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ PAVEL +++$+++ I'm not sure it's possible.
L54178 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ First, I want to walk free with a letter, in English, from the Prosecutor General dropping all charges. Second, I want two first class tickets to London leaving tonight and three thousand crowns in a stamped envelope. Lastly, all actions against the students are to be stopped!
L54177 +++$+++ u3813 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ PAVEL +++$+++ What is it you want?
L54175 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ I didn't get to see what's on the disks but I can guess. Do you want to hear my terms or not.
L54174 +++$+++ u3813 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ PAVEL +++$+++ You are playing a very dangerous game, I suggest you make it easy on yourself and tell me where they are.
L54172 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Not all of them!
L54171 +++$+++ u3813 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ PAVEL +++$+++ Good try Mr. Greenwell but a little late. We have analyzed the contents of that drum, the remains of the disks are there, just as you said.
L54169 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ I lied to you, I didn't destroy the floppy disks.
L54168 +++$+++ u3813 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ PAVEL +++$+++ Really!
L54167 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Thanks, but I don't intend to stay.
L54166 +++$+++ u3813 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ PAVEL +++$+++ We'll have to see what more we can do for you, while you are still our guest.
L54165 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ No!
L54164 +++$+++ u3813 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ PAVEL +++$+++ Enjoying our hospitality?
L54041 +++$+++ u3813 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ PAVEL +++$+++ Either you're a liar or you are a fool.
L54040 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ A kind of freedom.
L54039 +++$+++ u3813 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ PAVEL +++$+++ What was the real purpose behind this venture?
L54038 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ It was the biggest I could find.
L54037 +++$+++ u3813 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ PAVEL +++$+++ Why did you break into that particular building?
L54030 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Fuck you!
L54029 +++$+++ u3813 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ PAVEL +++$+++ You will wish you hadn't.
L54028 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ That's right.
L54027 +++$+++ u3813 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ PAVEL +++$+++ And you broke into that room?
L54026 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Yes, they had nothing to do with it.
L54025 +++$+++ u3813 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ PAVEL +++$+++ This is your doing?
L53593 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ No way, he even gave me back pay.
L53592 +++$+++ u3806 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HONZA +++$+++ So, he didn't fire you?
L53564 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Come on, that shit can wait.
L53563 +++$+++ u3806 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HONZA +++$+++ But I have to finish this....
L53562 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Great, let's break for lunch and I'll buy you a beer on the way.
L53561 +++$+++ u3806 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HONZA +++$+++ Yeah.
L53560 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ No problem, is it at your place?
L53559 +++$+++ u3806 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HONZA +++$+++ Okay, Okay, but I want it right back. It belongs to my father.
L53558 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?
L53557 +++$+++ u3806 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HONZA +++$+++ Sure!
L53556 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Come on, don't me give a hard time. I'm just trying to make the place look nice for Katka.
L53555 +++$+++ u3806 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HONZA +++$+++ You don't have fifty foot of apartment!

L53553 +++$+++ u3806 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HONZA +++$+++ Yeah.
L53552 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Nothing. I've got to put up some kitchen shelves that's all. You've got one haven't you?
L53551 +++$+++ u3806 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HONZA +++$+++ A drill, what are you up to?
L53550 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ No, just a drill.
L53541 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Working....Under cover.
L53540 +++$+++ u3806 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HONZA +++$+++ Hey Doug, where you been?
L54090 +++$+++ u3809 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ Alright, I'll see to it and things'll be just as they were, okay?
L54089 +++$+++ u3805 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Yes, if you can get him free.
L54088 +++$+++ u3809 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ Will you come home and forget all about him?
L54086 +++$+++ u3809 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ You really are a piece of work, you know that? You walk out on me and my family for some worthless bum and you expect us to help him when he screws up.
L54085 +++$+++ u3805 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Josh, I need your help. Doug's been arrested, he's in big trouble. I thought maybe your father and the Embassy might be able to do something.
L54084 +++$+++ u3809 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ So, what have you got to say for yourself? Was he good in bed?
L54082 +++$+++ u3805 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Can we talk in your office?
L54081 +++$+++ u3809 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ Of course Darling, you'd like to apologise?
L54080 +++$+++ u3805 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Josh, I have to speak you, it's urgent.
L54079 +++$+++ u3809 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ Honey what a pleasant surprise, sorry to keep you waiting.
