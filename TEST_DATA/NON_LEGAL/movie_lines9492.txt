L646830 +++$+++ u3443 +++$+++ m227 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ This is still a script we're talking about, right?
L646829 +++$+++ u3451 +++$+++ m227 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ Killing innocence, one way or the other.
L646828 +++$+++ u3443 +++$+++ m227 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ What's that?
L646827 +++$+++ u3451 +++$+++ m227 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ I can tell you what the nightmares are about.  They're about this...entity. Whatever you want to call it.  It's old, very old, and it's taken different forms in different times.  The only thing that stays the same about it is what it lives for.
L646569 +++$+++ u3445 +++$+++ m227 +++$+++ HOST +++$+++ Maybe we should ask him, hmmm?  We've got a surprised, Heather.  A great big surprise for you and our audience.
L646568 +++$+++ u3443 +++$+++ m227 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Robert?  I...
L646567 +++$+++ u3445 +++$+++ m227 +++$+++ HOST +++$+++ And how about your co-star in NIGHTMARE I.  Would you trust him alone with your child?
L646566 +++$+++ u3443 +++$+++ m227 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Of course he is.  Freddy's dead and gone.
L646564 +++$+++ u3443 +++$+++ m227 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ My child?  No...but...
L646563 +++$+++ u3445 +++$+++ m227 +++$+++ HOST +++$+++ Do you let your child watch your movies?
L646562 +++$+++ u3443 +++$+++ m227 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ No, not really.  I...
L646561 +++$+++ u3445 +++$+++ m227 +++$+++ HOST +++$+++ Now that you have a child, is it possible you've decided horror is bad for children?
L646560 +++$+++ u3443 +++$+++ m227 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ I don't know if it has, really.  With the exception of One and Three, I've pretty much kept out of it.  I'm working in television now.  The hours let me spend more time with my husband and little boy.
L646597 +++$+++ u3450 +++$+++ m227 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Me too.
L646596 +++$+++ u3443 +++$+++ m227 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Black's fine.
L646595 +++$+++ u3450 +++$+++ m227 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Sounds good.  Kim, would you get Heather and me a coffee?  How you like it, Hon?
L646594 +++$+++ u3443 +++$+++ m227 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Coffee'd be nice.
L646593 +++$+++ u3450 +++$+++ m227 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Can I get you something to drink?
L646586 +++$+++ u3450 +++$+++ m227 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Just take a minute.  You'll be glad you did, I bet.
L646585 +++$+++ u3443 +++$+++ m227 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Now?
L646584 +++$+++ u3450 +++$+++ m227 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ No time like the present.  The car will bring you.
L646583 +++$+++ u3443 +++$+++ m227 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Uh...sure...when?
L646582 +++$+++ u3450 +++$+++ m227 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Really!  Listen, Heather, I won't take but a minute of your time.  It's just that we have something to propose to you, and wonder if you'd stop by the offices. Bob'd love to talk to you.
L646581 +++$+++ u3443 +++$+++ m227 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Oh, hi.  I'm fine, Sara.  My God, a voice from the past!
L646580 +++$+++ u3450 +++$+++ m227 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Heather, this is Sara Risher over at New Line.  How are you?
L646579 +++$+++ u3443 +++$+++ m227 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Yes?
L651585 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Claiming their place in the world.
L651584 +++$+++ u3452 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ What are they doing?
L651508 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Well, he better learn to own it. Actions have consequences.  It's not what happens here Alice, it's what they take away with them.
L651507 +++$+++ u3452 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ He has a lot of hurt inside him.
L651506 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Phil, he's not looking inside.  He's just striking out at the world.
L651505 +++$+++ u3452 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I haven't forgotten.
L651504 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Because we believed we could make an impact out here.  Self reliance and community through the disciplines of sailing.
L651503 +++$+++ u3452 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ We were idealists.
L651502 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Why did we begin this?
L651501 +++$+++ u3452 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ They've become what you wanted. They're a crew.  That's why he came.
L651500 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ I can take it.
L651499 +++$+++ u3452 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ You may not like what you hear.
L651413 +++$+++ u3452 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ On the deck of the Yankee, the night you asked me to marry you.  We weren't much older than they are.
L651412 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Guilty.
L651411 +++$+++ u3452 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Do you remember the last time you and I danced under the stars?
L651410 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ He never would have believed a woman like you existed.
L651409 +++$+++ u3452 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ What?
L651408 +++$+++ u3452 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I am about this.
L651407 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ You sound so sure.
L651406 +++$+++ u3452 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ He knows.
L651405 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ I'd have liked to have said goodbye.
L651403 +++$+++ u3452 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ You miss him.
L651402 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ All his years at sea, he never stopped talking about these islands.
L651401 +++$+++ u3452 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Your father?
L651400 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ He would have loved this.
L651093 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Yep.
L651092 +++$+++ u3452 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Looks like weather.
L650980 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ It's time these boys saw some real blue water.
L650979 +++$+++ u3452 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ That low passed through last night. May be a little bumpy out there.
L650977 +++$+++ u3452 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Not yet.
L650976 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Did we lose anybody?
L651256 +++$+++ u3453 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ALL +++$+++ Give me some time to Blow the man down!
L651255 +++$+++ u3465 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ She said "None the better, you all go to hell..."
L651254 +++$+++ u3453 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ALL +++$+++ Weight!  Hey!  Blow the man down...
L651253 +++$+++ u3465 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ So to all you sailors who've fought wind and whale...
L651249 +++$+++ u3453 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ALL +++$+++ Give me some time to blow the man down...
L651248 +++$+++ u3465 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ A pretty young maiden she happened my way...
L651247 +++$+++ u3453 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ ALL +++$+++ Hey!  Weigh!  Blow the man down...
L651246 +++$+++ u3465 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Oh I was walkin' down Lime street one day...
L651645 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ North, north-east.  And Dick, please make a note of our final position.
L651644 +++$+++ u3454 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Yes sir.
L651643 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Carry on.
L651100 +++$+++ u3454 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Everybody down!  ON THE DOUBLE!!
L651099 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Everyone out of the rigging NOW!
L651079 +++$+++ u3454 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ We've got weather moving in from the west.
L651078 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Well, that's all part of it.
L651077 +++$+++ u3454 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side.
L651076 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Come in.
L651016 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ It's your job to know.  If something goes wrong up there, the other eighteen people aboard can't be wondering if he's gonna do his job or not.
L651015 +++$+++ u3454 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ I didn't know sir.
L651014 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Why wasn't I made aware of this Bill?
L650971 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Watch the tell-tales Chuck.  If we jibe now we'll have a lot of people in the water.
L650970 +++$+++ u3454 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Raise the inner jib!  Raise the forestaysail!
L650962 +++$+++ u3454 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Mr. Lawford, stand by to ease the mainsheet.  Rick, get on the jib sheet.  George, John, Philip, Tim and Dick go aloft to unstop the forecourse.  George will show you what to do.  Tod, show your men the forward pinrail and stand ready on the buntlines and clewlines. Forecourse first... work upward.
L650961 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ We'll bear off to port and run down wind.
L650941 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Good.  Let's go sailing.
L650940 +++$+++ u3454 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Yes, Sir.
L650939 +++$+++ u3468 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SKIPPER +++$+++ Everyone aboard young Bill?
L651757 +++$+++ u3467 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SANDERS +++$+++ Thank you.
L651756 +++$+++ u3454 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Fifteen.
L651755 +++$+++ u3467 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SANDERS +++$+++ How old are you, son?
L651754 +++$+++ u3454 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ My instinct was to not get electrocuted.
L651753 +++$+++ u3467 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SANDERS +++$+++ But your instinct was to lose sail?
L651752 +++$+++ u3454 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Skipper called us out of the rigging.
L651751 +++$+++ u3467 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ SANDERS +++$+++ Why didn't you drop any sail?
L651799 +++$+++ u3470 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ It's me, don't you see.  Terry's right, I'm the escape hatch.  I disobeyed order.
L651798 +++$+++ u3454 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ What do you mean?
L651797 +++$+++ u3470 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ There's still a way.
L651718 +++$+++ u3454 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ It was an act of God for Christ's sake.
L651717 +++$+++ u3470 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ It didn't go over 'til I turned her starboard!
L650909 +++$+++ u3454 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ You came back, Tod.  You came back.
L650908 +++$+++ u3470 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ Butler, what'd I ever do to you?
L650907 +++$+++ u3454 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Okay, here's the duty.  Gieg, Weathers, Lapchick, Schucart: scrape and paint.  Corry and Stricklin have the brass.  Robinson, you're the Galley slave.  March you're on chain gang with Barnes. Johnston, solo on bilge detail.
L651689 +++$+++ u3455 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ No, I can't.
L651688 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ When we were growing up I always felt like you would take care of things, that everything would be okay.  But you can't make this okay, can you?
L651683 +++$+++ u3455 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ All right.  I'm gonna wander over and look at some shoes...
L651682 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Fine.
L651680 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Okay.
L651679 +++$+++ u3455 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Why don't you go and try some of that on?
L651677 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Yeah, sure.
L651676 +++$+++ u3455 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ I thought we'd find a store, get you fixed up and then get you some lunch.  That sound good?
L651673 +++$+++ u3455 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ I couldn't bring her down here until I knew you were safe.
L651672 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Where's Mom?
L650799 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Yes sir.
L650798 +++$+++ u3455 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Make us proud.
L650813 +++$+++ u3465 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Well, Romeo here was on harbor watch and managed to sweet talk one of the local girls to have a go in the bowsprit.
L650812 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ What the "Bowsprit Affair"?
L650805 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Whatever.
L650804 +++$+++ u3465 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Look, meet us out front when you're through.  If they try to take anything away from you like Johnny Quest up there, just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat.
L650803 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Gieg, Chuck.
L650802 +++$+++ u3465 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Rick March.  Who the hell are you?
L650801 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Yeah.
L650800 +++$+++ u3465 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Albatross?
L651611 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ I feel like... we can do anything.
L651610 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Me either.
L651609 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ You know, I never had friends like this.
L651608 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I'll tell you who you are.  You're the glue.  You're the thing that holds everybody around you together. You're strong, you listen and you see things in people the rest of us can't.  It's a gift.
L651607 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here.
L651606 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Figured what out?
L651605 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ I've been getting ninety-sixes my whole life.  It's what they expect. After all this, I still haven't figured it out.
L651604 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Anonymous.
L651603 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What was that?
L651602 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ That we're going back.  I don't want it to end.  I don't want to be what I was when I left.
L651601 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What?
L651600 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Feels different doesn't it?
L651598 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Yes you could.  You did.  This is all you.  Nobody else.
L651597 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I couldn't have done it without you.
L651596 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ This is your moment, don't you see? The instant when you know that your life is never going to be the same again.  When you stand up and are counted.
L651595 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I just can't believe it.
L651594 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ You know?  Then why are you up here looking like you're about to jump overboard?!
L651593 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I know.
L651592 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ It's a ninety-one!  It's an 'A'!
L651591 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ What about you?
L651590 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Congratulations.
L651589 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Ninety-six.
L651588 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Yeah.  How'd you do.
L651587 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ You okay?
L651376 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Her name.  Bregitta.  It's poetry.
L651375 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Believe what?
L651374 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Bregitta.  Do you believe it?
L651331 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Listen, you don't cheat, and we'll make sure you get the grades.  We'll start a private study group.  Nobody knows.  You'll ace that test.
L651330 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ They were gonna put me into special- ed this year.  I stole a copy of my transcript, changed all the grades. Shit, who am I kidding.  I'll never pass the boards.
L651325 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Wanna bet?  Takes me half a day to get through one chapter of Lawford and I still don't have any idea what the hell he's talkin' about.  You know why it takes me so long to write papers?  because I can't spell.  While everybody else is sleeping, I'm in the rack with a flashlight and a dictionary.
L651324 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ You're not a moron.
L651323 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I doctored my grades so I'd make the cut.  I'm a moron, okay?  You satisfied?!
L651322 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ What?
L651321 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I cheated to get on the boat!!!  All right?!
L651314 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You've gotta be kidding.  Get the fuck outta my way!
L651313 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ If you're gonna cheat, you might as well copy off somebody who's gonna get the answer right.
L651312 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Yeah, that's right.  You wanna come in and shake it for me?
L651310 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ To take a piss.
L651309 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Where you going?
L651195 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ My old man split along time ago.  It doesn't mean anything.  You just take care of number one that's all that matters.
L651194 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Yeah.
L651182 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ So I'm standing there and you could hear a pin drop.  No breathing or snoring... Suddenly it hits me that somethin' was goin' on that just stopped, really fast, like people are holding their breath.
L651181 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ That's what they get for not locking the door.
L651180 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ I walked in on my parents one time. It was only like eight o'clock and they were in bed and I thought that was kinda weird so I just walked in.
L651171 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I mean she looks pretty damn good in her all-together for being thirty.
L651170 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ What do you mean?
L651169 +++$+++ u3461 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ She isn't that old.
L650778 +++$+++ u3472 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You don't give him enough credit Chas.
L650777 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ He does.
L650776 +++$+++ u3472 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Nobody says you have to be like me.
L650775 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ I'm just not like you.  Ya know? I'm never going to go to Yale.  I'm never going to be "William".
L650774 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ Because it looks good.
L650773 +++$+++ u3472 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Why then.
L650772 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ That's not why he's sending me.
L650771 +++$+++ u3472 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I thought this was your dream come true.
L650770 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ It's not a vacation, it's private school.
L650769 +++$+++ u3472 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ It's no my fault I was born first. Besides, nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation, so ease up on the sad sack stuff.
L650768 +++$+++ u3456 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ CHUCK +++$+++ I was just thinking that I never had a new pair of shoes till I was twelve.
L650767 +++$+++ u3472 +++$+++ m228 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You gonna jump?  Or are you just having a last look?
