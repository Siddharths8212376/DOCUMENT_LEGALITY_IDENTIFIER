L311554 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yes!  But don't hold that against me. I'm a little screwy myself.
L311553 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ I asked you a question. Do you love her?
L311552 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ A normal human being couldn't live under the same roof with her, without going nuts.  She's my idea of nothing!
L311551 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Do you love her?
L311550 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ If you had half the brains you're supposed to have, you'd have done it yourself—long ago.
L311549 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ She grabbed herself a perfect running mate. King Westley! The pill of the century!  What she needs is a guy that'd take a sock at her every day—whether it's coming to her or not.
L311548 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ That's an evasion.
L311547 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ A guy that'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined.
L311546 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Here you are.  Do you mind if I ask you something frankly?  Do you love my daughter?
L311544 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yeah—with all the trimmings. Now, how about the check. Do I get it?
L311543 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ You were taken for a buggy ride?
L311542 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? This is a matter of principle. Something you probably wouldn't understand.  When somebody takes me for a buggy ride I don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege.
L311541 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ The average man would go after the reward. All you seem to—
L311540 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ We'll go into that some other time.
L311539 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ You're a peculiar chap.
L311538 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ All I want is thirty-nine sixty. If you'll give me a check I'll get out of this place. It gives me the jitters.
L311537 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ I'm afraid I'm a little confused. You see, I assumed you were coming here for—
L311536 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Who said anything about a reward!
L311535 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ The reward.
L311534 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What ten thousand?
L311533 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Let me get this straight. You want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars?
L311532 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough? A trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars!
L311531 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Yes, I know—but—
L311530 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Why not? I'm not charging you for the time I wasted.
L311529 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ And this is what you want—thirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
L311528 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I sold some drawers and socks, too; I'm throwing those in.
L311527 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ If I didn't I wouldn't be here!  I've got it all itemized. 
L311526 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ don't know. I'd have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel you're justified in—
L311525 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Oh, she does, huh? Isn't that sweet of her! You don't , I suppose.
L311524 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Please understand me. When I say she didn't tell me anything about it, I mean not until a little while ago. She thinks you're entitled to anything you can get.
L311523 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted.  Why does she think I lugged her all the way from Miami—  for the love of it?
L311522 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ I was surprised to get your note. My daughter hadn't told me anything about you. About your helping her.
L311521 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Come in. Sit down.
L311520 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yeah.
L311519 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Mr. Warne?
L311514 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ No—no. What the deuce do I want to—
L311513 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ You needn't see anybody. You can come directly to my study. I'd appreciate it very much if—
L311512 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yeah, but I don't like the idea of walking in on your jamboree . . . Just between you and me—those things give me a stiff pain.
L311378 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ "I found a million dollar baby—"
L311377 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Can't you get them to go any faster?  This dissolves to a deserted ROAD, Peter at the wheel of his car. His high spirits find expression in his efforts to sing.
L311503 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Well, if it isn't the groom himself! You're just in time, King.
L311502 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ I'll be going.  Ellie swallows her drink and starts pouring herself another, as King enters.
L311498 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Certainly!  Pay him off. He's entitled to it. He did an excellent job. Kept me thoroughly entertained. It's worth every penny he gets.
L311497 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ I suppose so.
L311496 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Are you going to see him?
L311495 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ I'm sorry you read it.
L311494 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Looks like that was his only interest in me. The reward.
L311493 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Oh, please, Dad—
L311492 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Why, no . . . Don't be silly.
L311491 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ You haven't heard from him, have you, Dad?
L311490 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Oh, no—no.
L311489 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Why? Do you know him? 
L311488 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Peter Warne! 
L311487 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Yes. Peter Warne.
L311486 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Is that his name?
L311485 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Yes, I guess I have.  I don't want to hurt anybody any more. I want to get away from all this front page publicity. It suddenly strikes me as being cheap and loathsome. I can't walk out on King now. It'll make us all look so ridiculous.  Besides, what difference does it make?  I'll never see Peter again.
L311482 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ It doesn't matter.  I don't want to stir up any more trouble. I've been doing it all my life. I've been such a burden to you—made your life so miserable—and mine, too. I'm tired, Dad. Tired of running around in circles. He's right, that's what I've been doing ever since I can remember.
L311481 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ But that's silly, child. Seeing how you feel, why—
L311480 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ No, I'll go through with it.
L311479 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Well, under the circumstances, don't you think we ought to call this thing off?
L311478 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him. 
L311477 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ I'd like to have a talk with him.
L311476 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I don't know.
L311475 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Well, what are we going to do about it? Where is he?
L311474 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ He's marvelous!
L311473 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Fine man to fall in love with.
L311472 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ He blames you for everything that's wrong about me. Thinks you raised me stupidly.
L311471 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Well!
L311470 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ He doesn't think so much of you either.
L311469 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Ridiculous!
L311468 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ He despises everything I stand for. He thinks I'm spoiled and pampered, and selfish, and thoroughly insincere.
L311467 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Oh, come now—
L311466 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ It'll do no good.  He despises me.
L311465 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Well, if it's as serious as all that—we'll move heaven and earth to—
L311464 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I don't know very much about him.  Except that I love him.
L311463 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Who is he?
L311462 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ No.
L311461 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Now, don't tell me you fell in love with a bus driver!
L311460 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ On the road.
L311459 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ I haven't seen you cry since you were a baby. This must be serious.  Where'd you meet him?
L311454 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Sorry, Dad. I wouldn't hurt you for the world. You know that.
L311453 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ If you have, it isn't too late. You know how I feel about him. But I want to make you happy. You gave me such a scare—I—when I couldn't find you.  You know, the old pump isn't what it used to be.
L311452 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Oh, no.
L311451 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ You've been acting so strangely since you returned. I'm—I'm worried. I haven't bothered to ask you any questions—I—  Isn't all this what you wanted?  You haven't changed your mind about King, have you?
L311450 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Nothing. 
L311449 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ What's the matter, Ellie? What's wrong?
L311446 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Yes. Personally, I think it's silly, too.
L311445 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Oh, yes. I heard.
L311444 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
L311443 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Stunt?
L311442 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Well, everything's set. Creating quite a furor, too. Great stunt King's going to pull.
L311441 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming. 
L311440 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ I knocked several times.
L311439 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Oh, hello, Dad.
L311438 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Ellie—
L310503 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Ah! Coconut layer cake. Nice and gooey, too. Just the way I like it.
L310502 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I'll shout to my heart's content! I'll scream if I want to.
L310501 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Please don't shout.
L310500 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!
L310499 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ A time will come when you'll thank me for this.
L310494 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ You've been telling me what not to do since I was old enough to remember.  I'm sick of it!
L310493 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ He's no good, Ellie, and you know it. You married him only because I told you not to.
L310492 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Your whole life is devoted to just one thing. To accumulate more money. At least there's romance in what he's doing.
L310491 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Why not?  Look what he's doing for aviation. It takes courage to do what he does. And character! At least he's accomplished something worthwhile. I suppose you'd like to have me marry a business man. Well, I hate business men—particularly if you're a shining example.
L310490 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ You're going to finance him, I suppose.
L310489 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ He's one of the best fliers in the country. Right now he's planning a trip to Japan.
L310488 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Never mind—I'll get it myself.  Gigolo? Why, you took the word right out of my mouth. Thanks.
L310487 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ You talk as if he were a gigolo—or something.
L310486 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ That was enough. Do you mind handing me the ketchup?
L310485 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ You only met him once .
L310484 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Nothing much. I just think he's a fake, that's all.
L310483 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ What've you got against King Westley?
L310482 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ I'll do it if it takes every penny I've got. I'll do it if I have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the Peace! I'll do it—if I have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk. You probably were.  Mmm—mmm. This filet mignon is divine!
L310481 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ You'll never do it! You can't do it!
L310480 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ I'll get it annulled.
L310479 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married!
L310478 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ In that event, we won't need so many supplies.
L310477 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ You'll have a corpse on your hands! That what You'll have. I won't eat a thing while I'm on this boat.
L310476 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ We leave Miami in an hour. Soon's we get some supplies aboard.
L310475 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ South America!
L310474 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ South America.
L310473 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Where are you taking me?
L310471 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I hope you're not comparing yourself to Napoleon. He was a strategist. Your idea of strategy is to use a lead pipe.
L310470 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Please. I can't fight on an empty stomach. Remember what Napoleon said.
L310469 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ You can't tempt me.  Do you hear? I won't eat!
L310468 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ If Gandhi had a chef like Paul, it would change the whole political situation in India.
L310467 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Smart, aren't you! So subtle.
L310460 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Not so far as I'm concerned, you're not.  Yes?
L310459 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ You're wasting your time. I'm already married to him.
L310458 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Because marrying that fool King Westley is—
L310457 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Yes. I know.  Because I'm your daughter and you love me. Because you don't want me to make any mistakes. Because—
L310456 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ You ought to know why. Because—
L310455 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I won't stand for it! I won't stand for your running my life! Why do you insist on it!
L310454 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Come on, Ellie. Stop being silly. You know I'm going to have my way.
L310453 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ All right! Put me in chains! Do anything you want!  But I'm not going to eat a thing until you let me off this boat!
L310452 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ I might.
L310451 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Why don't you put me in chains?
L310450 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Know what my next move is? No more cigarettes.
L310449 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I don't want to eat!  And there's one more thing I don't want! Definitely! That's to see you.
L310448 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ What's this about not eating?
L311229 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Of course I mean it! I don't care whom she's married to—  —as long as I can get her back. 
L311228 +++$+++ u1553 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ WESTLEY +++$+++ If you really mean it, I will.
L311227 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ All right. That's why I sent for you.  There's a room full of reporters out there. I want you to make a statement—that you've had a talk with me—that we've reached an understanding—that if Ellen comes home, I won't interfere with your marriage. Will you do that?
L311226 +++$+++ u1553 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ WESTLEY +++$+++ Why should she? After all—
L311225 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Yes. I know. Well, you can help now. I issued a statement yesterday that I've withdrawn my objections. Begging her to come home. I haven't heard from her. Apparently she doesn't trust me.
L311224 +++$+++ u1553 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ WESTLEY +++$+++ might have been able to help if it weren't for you. I've been watched so closely, I—
L310513 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Holy Smoke! I forgot all about that.  Send a wireless at once, "Lovington Detective Agency. Daughter escaped again. Watch all roads—all transports and railroad stations in Miami. Have your New York office keep tabs on King Westley. Intercept all messages. Want her back at all costs!"
L310512 +++$+++ u1532 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ What about that diamond wrist watch she had on—she can raise some money on that?
L310511 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Terrible! Nothing terrible about her. She's great! Marvelous youngster! Got a mind of her own. Knows just what she wants.  She's not going to get it though. She won't get very far. Has no money.
L310510 +++$+++ u1532 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ What a hell cat. No controlling these modern girls.  They're terrible!
L310506 +++$+++ u1532 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ Lower the boats!
L310505 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ It's my daughter! Go after her.
L310442 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Absurd!  All this fuss over a snip of a girl.  I'm going down to see her myself.
L310441 +++$+++ u1532 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ It's not quite that simple.  I've dealt with prisoners in my time, but this one—
L310440 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Why didn't you jam it down her throat?
L310439 +++$+++ u1532 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ Yessir. She refuses them all.
L310438 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Been sending her meals in regularly?
L310437 +++$+++ u1532 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ She hasn't had a thing yesterday—or today.
L310436 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ On a hunger strike, huh?  When'd she eat last?
L311582 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ I haven't the slightest idea.
L311581 +++$+++ u1541 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ KING +++$+++ What happened?
L311428 +++$+++ u1541 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ KING +++$+++ Yes, of course.
L311427 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ We've done that already.
L311426 +++$+++ u1541 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ KING +++$+++ Oh, no. She'll be crazy about it. Well, see you later. I'm going out on the lawn and arrange for landing space.  Goodbye. 
L311425 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Personally, I think it's stupid!  But go ahead. Have a good time. As long as Ellie doesn't object.
L311424 +++$+++ u1541 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ KING +++$+++ Why, it'll make all the front pages. A spectacular thing like that—
L311423 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ You thought that up all by yourself, huh?
L311421 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Fine. I'll see you at the reception.
L311420 +++$+++ u1541 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ KING +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L311419 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Try. Do me a favor. Try. It's your only chance. And hers, too. Do that for me—and maybe we'll be friends—  Maybe.  Do we understand each other?
L311416 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Sock her!
L311415 +++$+++ u1541 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ KING +++$+++ What would you like to have me do?
L311414 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ No?  Say, listen—I've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat. Toughest job I ever tackled. Ever hear of J.P. Clarkson? Biggest man in the country, isn't he? Well, I tamed him . Got him eating out of the palm of my hand. I've browbeaten financiers, statesmen, foreign ministers—some of the most powerful people in the world—but I've never been able to do a thing with her. She's been too much for me. I'm glad you think it's easy.  Now listen—if you'll do what I tell you, perhaps I might develop a little respect for you. You never can tell.
L311413 +++$+++ u1541 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ KING +++$+++ Ellie? Oh, she's no responsibility.
L311407 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Someday perhaps, you might even take charge.
L311406 +++$+++ u1541 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ KING +++$+++ You talk as if—
L311405 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Naturally.  You're going to become a partner in a big institution. It's one of the largest in the world.
L311404 +++$+++ u1541 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ KING +++$+++ Why; naturally, I—
L311223 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ You've got a good thing and you're hanging on to it, huh?  All right, You win. I'll just have to get used to you. I admit I'm licked. But only because I'm worried. I've had detectives all over the country searching for her. I've seen thousands of photographs. Fortune tellers, nuts, every crank in the country has written me.  Haven't slept one night this week. If I don't find her, I'll go crazy.
L311222 +++$+++ u1541 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ KING +++$+++ You've made that quite evident—with all your threats of annulment.  Well, it hasn't bothered me for a minute. Ellie and I got married because we love each other. And she's proving it; as far as I'm concerned there's going to be no annulment.
L311221 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ I haven't changed my mind, Westley, I want you to understand that! I don't like you! I never have!  I never will! That's clear enough, isn't it?
L311587 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ "What's holding up the annulment, you slow poke? The Walls of Jericho are toppling."  Send him a telegram right away. Just say: "Let 'em topple."
L311586 +++$+++ u1551 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ There's another wire from Peter, sir. They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.
L311585 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Ooooooh.  Hello my would-be ex-son-in-law. I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. Yes. That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment. That's satisfactory, isn't it? Yeah. Well, it ought to be. Oh I'm not complaining. It was dirt cheap.  Don't fall out of any windows.
L311584 +++$+++ u1551 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ But it's King Westley on the phone.
L311583 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Don't want to talk to—don't want to talk to anybody. Don't want to see anybody.
L310787 +++$+++ u1551 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ They're the finest detective agency in the country, sir.
L310786 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Amateurs!
L310785 +++$+++ u1551 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ They're practically all the same, sir. 
L310784 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ What do they say?
L310783 +++$+++ u1551 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ Yessir.  There's a report here from every State along the East coast. Want to hear them?
L310782 +++$+++ u1530 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Any others?
L310781 +++$+++ u1551 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ Here's another wire, sir. This one's from Charleston.  "Checking every northbound train. Also assigned twenty operatives to watch main highways. No success yet. Will continue to do everything possible." Signed: Lovington Detective Agency, Charleston.
L310979 +++$+++ u1531 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Thanks.
L310978 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Me? Forget it, son.  I got millions.
L310972 +++$+++ u1531 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ I was gonna do it, but Ma wouldn't let me. She was ashamed, I guess.
L310971 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Going without food is bad business, son. Why didn't you ask somebody?
L310970 +++$+++ u1531 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Ma spent it all for the tickets. She didn't know it was gonna be so much.  We shouldn'a come, I guess, but Ma said there's a job waitin' for her in New York—and if we didn't go, she might lose it.
L310969 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What happened to your money?
L310968 +++$+++ u1531 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ We ain't ate nothin' since yestidday.
