L501847 +++$+++ u7603 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ POPE +++$+++ Well we'd love to, but we're going to another party.
L501846 +++$+++ u7597 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Oh, say, how would you kids like to stop off for a drink?
L501845 +++$+++ u7603 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ POPE +++$+++ Where to, Les?
L501844 +++$+++ u7597 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Call me Les.
L501827 +++$+++ u7603 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ POPE +++$+++ Terrific. Now all I have to do is find my car keys.
L501826 +++$+++ u7597 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Everything okay, son?
L501817 +++$+++ u7603 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ POPE +++$+++ -- we're going to be here all night.
L501816 +++$+++ u7597 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ No of course not.
L501678 +++$+++ u7603 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ POPE +++$+++ Everybody but us.
L501677 +++$+++ u7597 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Have they sat down?
L501676 +++$+++ u7603 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ POPE +++$+++ I think they're waiting for somebody to start dinner.
L502638 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Good.
L502637 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Yes, Dad.
L502636 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I love you, Danny.  I love you more than anything else in the whole world, and I'd never do anything to hurt you, never... You know that, don't you, huh?
L502635 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Yes, Dad.
L502634 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Are you sure?
L502633 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ No, Dad.
L502632 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Did your mother ever say that to you - that I would hurt you?
L502631 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What do you mean?
L502630 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ You wouldn't ever hurt Mummy and me, would you?
L502629 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What?
L502628 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Dad?
L502627 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Good.  I want you to like it here. I wish we could stay here for ever, and ever... ever.
L502626 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I guess so.
L502625 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yes I do.  I love it.  Don't you?
L502624 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Do you like this hotel?
L502623 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yes?
L502622 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Dad?
L502621 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I can't.  I have too much to do.
L502620 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Then why don't you go to sleep?
L502619 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No.  I'm just a little tired.
L502618 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Do you feel bad?
L502617 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yes.
L502616 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I am, Dad.  Dad?
L502615 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Good.  I want you to have a good time.
L502614 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Yes, Dad.
L502613 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Are you having a good time?
L502612 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Okay.
L502611 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ How's it going, Doc?
L502610 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Come here for a minute, first.
L502609 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
L502332 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ They had to, in order to survive.
L502331 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ You mean they ate each other up?
L502330 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ There were a party of settlers in the covered wagon times.  They got snowbound one winter in the mountains.  They had to resort to cannabilism in order to stay alive.
L502329 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ What was the Donner party?
L502328 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I think that was farther west in the Sierras.
L502324 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Well you should have eaten your breakfast.
L502323 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I'm hungry.
L502322 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yes?
L502321 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Dad?
L502507 +++$+++ u7612 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ HALLORAN +++$+++ Nothing.  There ain't nothing in Room 237, but you ain't got no business going in there anyway, so stay out!  You understand, stay out!
L502506 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?
L502505 +++$+++ u7612 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ HALLORAN +++$+++ No I ain't.
L502504 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ You're scared of Room 237, ain'tcha?
L502503 +++$+++ u7612 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ HALLORAN +++$+++ Room 237?
L502502 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ What about Room 237?
L502501 +++$+++ u7612 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ HALLORAN +++$+++ Not things that anyone can notice, but things that people who shine can see.  Just like they can see things that haven't happened yet. Well, sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago... I think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel - over the years, and not all of them was good.
L502500 +++$+++ u7612 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ HALLORAN +++$+++ Well, maybe things that happened... leave other kinds of traces behind.
L502499 +++$+++ u7612 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ HALLORAN +++$+++ Well, you know Doc, when something happens it can leave a trace of itself behind... say like is someone burns toast.
L502498 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Is there something bad here?
L502497 +++$+++ u7612 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ HALLORAN +++$+++ No, I'm scared of nothing here. It's just that you know some places are like people, some shine and some don't.  I guess you could say the Overlook Hotel here has something about it that's like shining.
L502495 +++$+++ u7612 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ HALLORAN +++$+++ Try to think what it was.
L502494 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Maybe he showed me something.
L502493 +++$+++ u7612 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ HALLORAN +++$+++ Now think real hard, Doc.  Think.
L502492 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I don't know.
L502490 +++$+++ u7612 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ HALLORAN +++$+++ Do they know he tell you things?
L502489 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Yes.
L502488 +++$+++ u7612 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ HALLORAN +++$+++ Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony?
L502487 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ It's like I go to sleep, and he shows me things but when I wake up, I can't remember everything.
L502486 +++$+++ u7612 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ HALLORAN +++$+++ How does he tell you things?
L502485 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Yes.
L502484 +++$+++ u7612 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ HALLORAN +++$+++ Is Tony the one that tells you things?
L502483 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
L502482 +++$+++ u7612 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ HALLORAN +++$+++ Who's Tony?
L502481 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Tony.
L502480 +++$+++ u7612 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ HALLORAN +++$+++ Who says you ain't supposed to?
L502479 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I'm not supposed to.
L502478 +++$+++ u7612 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ HALLORAN +++$+++ Why don't you want to talk about it?
L502466 +++$+++ u7612 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ HALLORAN +++$+++ Chocolate it shall be.  Come on son.
L502465 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Chocolate.
L502455 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Yeah.
L502454 +++$+++ u7612 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ HALLORAN +++$+++ Do you like ice cream, Doc?
L502428 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ French Fries and Ketchup.
L502427 +++$+++ u7612 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ HALLORAN +++$+++ You don't?  Well what's your favorite food then?
L502426 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ No.
L502425 +++$+++ u7612 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ HALLORAN +++$+++ Now this is where we keep all of out meat.  You got fifteen rib roasts - thirty ten pound bags of hamburgers.  You got twelve- turkeys, two dozen pork roasts and twenty legs of lamb.  Do you like lamb, Doc?
L503069 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Oh!
L503068 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Mommy!
L503067 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Danny!
L503066 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Mommy... Mommy...!
L503065 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Danny, come here!
L503064 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Mommy...
L503023 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
L503022 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Danny.  Danny, stop it.  Danny!
L502832 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Are you having a bad dream?
L502831 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Red Rum.
L502830 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Danny... what's the matter, hon?
L502829 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Red Rum.
L502828 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
L502827 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Danny?
L502825 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Red Rum.  Red Rum.
L502824 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ If Jack won't come with us, we'll just have to tell him that we are going by ourselves.  That's all there is to it.
L502608 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Okay, Mom.
L502607 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Make sure you come right back, 'cause I'm going to make lunch soon. Okay?
L502606 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I won't, Mom.
L502605 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Well all right.  But really don't make a sound.
L502604 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I won't make a sound, I promise. I'll tip-toe.
L502603 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Come on, Doc.  He only went to bed a few hours ago.  Can't you wait till later?
L502602 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I won't make any noise.
L502601 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Not right now, Daddy's asleep.
L502600 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
L502599 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Yes?
L502598 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Mom?
L502540 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ No.
L502539 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?
L502538 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Yeah.
L502537 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ It's so pretty.
L502536 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Yeah.
L502535 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Oh what a Maze.  Isn't it beautiful.
L502533 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Yeah.
L502532 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Give me your hand.  Oh, isn't it beautiful.
L502531 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Okay...oh!
L502530 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Okay Danny, you win.  Let's take the rest of this walking, huh?
L502528 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ And you're gonna lose.  And I'm gonna get you - you betta run fast! Look out - I'm coming in close. All right?
L502527 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ All right.
L502526 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ The loser has to keep American clean, how's that?
L502463 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Okay.  You behave yourself.
L502462 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Yeah.
L502407 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Danny, come on over here.
L502406 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Yeah.
L502334 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Don't worry, Mom.  I know all about cannabilism, I saw it on T.V.
L502333 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Jack...
L502327 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Hey, wasn't it around here that the Donner party got snowbound?
L502326 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Okay, Mom.
L502325 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ We'll get something as soon as we get to the hotel, okay?
L502290 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Okay.
L502289 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ We're just going to go into one of the other rooms for a few minutes and talk - then I'll come back and check on you, okay?
L502190 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ What about Tony?  He's looking forward to the hotel, I bet.
L502189 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Yeah, I guess so.
L502188 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Yeah, I know.  It always takes a little time to make new friends.
L502187 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Yeah, I guess so.  Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here.
L502186 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.
L502185 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
L502184 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Yeah.
L502288 +++$+++ u7609 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Yes, I'd like you to.
L502287 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Do I have to?
L502286 +++$+++ u7609 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Now I'm going to ask you to do me a favor, and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day.  Okay?
L502283 +++$+++ u7609 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Does Tony ever tell you to do things?
L502282 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ To my stomach.
L502281 +++$+++ u7609 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Where does he go?
L502280 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Because he hides.
L502279 +++$+++ u7609 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Why not?
L502278 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ No.
L502277 +++$+++ u7609 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ if you were to open your mouth now, could I see Tony?
L502276 +++$+++ u7609 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Oh,
L502274 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ No.  It's the little boy that lives in my mouth.
L502273 +++$+++ u7609 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Is Tony one of your animals?
L502272 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Talking to Tony.
L502271 +++$+++ u7609 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Now Danny, can you remember what you were doing just before you started brushing your teeth?
L502270 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Mommy saying, 'Wake up, wake up, wake up Danny, wake up.'
L502269 +++$+++ u7609 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ What's the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth?
L502268 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Yes.
L502267 +++$+++ u7609 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth?
L502266 +++$+++ u7608 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ No.
L502265 +++$+++ u7609 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Now Danny, when you were brushing your teeth, do you remember if you smelled anything funny, or saw any bright flashing lights, or anything at all strange?
L502316 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Well it's just one of those things. You know... purely an accident, um. My husband had oh... been drinking, and he came home about three hours late, so he wasn't exactly in the greatest mood that night.  And well Danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room... and my husband grabbed his arm, you know, and pulled him away from them. It's...it's just the sort of thing you do a hundred times with a child - you know, in a park or on the streets - but on this particular occasion my husband just... used too much strength and he injured Danny's arm.
L502315 +++$+++ u7609 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ How did he manage to do that?
L502314 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Ah he dislocated his shoulder.
L502313 +++$+++ u7609 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ What sort of injury did he have?
L502310 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ No, um let's see I guess Danny started talkin to Tony about the time we put him into nursery school.
L502309 +++$+++ u7609 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?
L502308 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Tony.
L502307 +++$+++ u7609 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Did the appearance of Danny's imaginary friend...?
L502306 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Only about three months.  Eh we're from Vermont.  My husband was teaching school there.
L502305 +++$+++ u7609 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Have you been in Boulder long, Mrs. Torrance?
L502300 +++$+++ u7609 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Mrs. Torrance, most of the time these episodes with kids are never explained.  They are brought on by emotional factors, and they rarely occur again.
L502299 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ But eh what was the matter with him?
L502297 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, he seems absolutely fine now, but you should have seen him.
L502296 +++$+++ u7609 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Mrs. Torrance, I don't think you have anything to worry about.  I'm quite sure there is nothing physically wrong with Danny.
L502295 +++$+++ u7609 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Thank you.
L502294 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Please...
L502293 +++$+++ u7609 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Yes.
L502292 +++$+++ u7619 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Shall we go into the living room?
L502597 +++$+++ u7610 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Great.  Sit down.  Oh these marvellous doughnuts, help yourself. Coffee will be ready in a few minutes.
L502596 +++$+++ u7613 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ HERMIE +++$+++ Sure.
L502595 +++$+++ u7610 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some?

L502593 +++$+++ u7610 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Well how can I repay you?
L502592 +++$+++ u7613 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ HERMIE +++$+++ Oh I wouldn't think of it.
L503004 +++$+++ u7611 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ You give your word on that do you, Mr. Torrance?
L503003 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ There's nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.
L503002 +++$+++ u7611 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I fear that you will have to deal with this matter in the harshest possible way, Mr. Torrance.  I fear that is the only thing to do.
L503001 +++$+++ u7614 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ For the moment, Mr. Grady.  Only for the moment.
L503000 +++$+++ u7611 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you.

L502989 +++$+++ u7611 +++$+++ m514 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.  Delbert Grady.
