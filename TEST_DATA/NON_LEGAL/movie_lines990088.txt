L359198 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ And what's that mean?
L359197 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Book five, Deuteronomy, chapter seven, verse five.  "But this shall you deal with them.  You shall break down their altars and burn their graven images with fire."
L359192 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ And his message was  "Together, no matter what?"
L359191 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ He was trying to tell me something.
L359190 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Terrific.
L359189 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ That's his, I don't know, his 'grounding' phrase for me, "together, no matter what."
L359188 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What did he say to you in French?
L359187 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism.  I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.
L359186 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ So, what does it mean.  The ark sank and the sun set?
L359185 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ I'll be all right.  Peter, at the very end, I think Father was back.  I saw it in his eyes.
L359153 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ You have to be experienced to do this. Just wait outside. Otherwise, you risk killing him.
L359152 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What can I do?
L359109 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Sure.
L359108 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Maybe I should check Lareaux's book. It's in the car.  Be right back.  Don't go anywhere.
L359107 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I don't know.  Extra apartment keys. What's it matter?
L359106 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ What are these?
L359105 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Plenty of time.
L359101 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Only your body will remain.  I believe your soul will be at peace.  If we kill you, Satan can't stay.
L359100 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What about after?
L359099 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Until it happens, you're still a human being.
L359098 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Why didn't you just go along with Townsend.  Get rid of me.  I would've...
L359097 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Maybe that's my problem.
L359096 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ No oxygen to the brain.
L359095 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ I know it is.  Right after my parents died, I went to the beach...  I was in the water.  Everything was calm.  And then one of those really big waves hit me.  Hard.  Pulled me straight to the bottom.  I struggled and finally ran out of air.  If it hadn't been for my sister who pulled me out, I would've drowned. Legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me.
L359094 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Close call.  For the first time in a long time, it's really hitting me. Life's tenuous.
L359093 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ I was desperate.  I knew you wrote about murders.  I needed a way in.
L359092 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Why did you lie to me about your parents' deaths?
L359087 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ That's true.
L359086 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ You have to say that.
L359085 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ We're going to do this.
L359084 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ I'm scared I'm slipping back.
L359083 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ I see things.  My worst fears.  You need to know something, Peter.  I was possessed once.  Like Birdson.  It took Father Lareaux six days to pull me out of it.
L359082 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What do you mean?
L359081 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Sometimes, when I feel weak, I have these...visions.
L359080 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Are you alright?
L359076 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Comfort.
L359075 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What's the bible for?
L359074 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ There's nothing else here.
L359073 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I don't know.  Probably have a copy of my birth certificate...my apartment.
L359072 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ He couldn't stop us and that's how he was punished.  Peter, what time were you born?
L359070 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ That can't be right.  My birthday's tomorrow.
L359069 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ It'll happen at the exact time of your birth.
L359068 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Your 33rd birthday.  The transformation will be a perversion of Christ's rising from the dead.  Townsend discovered it in one of Lareaux's books.
L359067 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Hang on, get it up, go on, higher.
L359066 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What?
L359065 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ When's your birthday?
L359064 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You okay?
L359061 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What?
L359060 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Peter, let go of the chair!
L359059 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What's the...OH SHIT!
L359058 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Get up!!
L359046 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I'll go outside and take a look in the garage.
L359045 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Nothing yet.
L359041 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I'm going to look around.
L359040 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ We needed to know all we could.
L359037 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ The books themselves or maybe some pages he ripped out.
L359036 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What are you looking for exactly?
L359034 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Townsend, he had some of Father's books.
L359033 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ When Townsend tried to kill me, he said something strange like...  "The time of transformation is near..."
L359032 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ I don't know.  I do know that people who are possessed have to accept evil in some way.  I don't know if it works the same way in this instance.  I don't even know when it's going to happen.
L359031 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ And if what you're saying is true, what would happen to me?
L359030 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Peter, I believe your baptism was perverted.  Look at your certificate. Your mother was the only witness to it. Your blood-type doesn't match who you thought your father was.  Peter...I'm sorry.
L359029 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Then why are you here?
L359028 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ So...then the coroner's report is probably wrong.  I mean...this is ridiculous.  There's been a mistake.  I don't believe any of this.
L359027 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Peter, your blood-type is AB negative. There's no way your birth father can be O positive.  You father is not who you think he is.
L359026 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I looked at the coroner's report.  My father's O positive and my mother...A negative.
L359025 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Do you know your parents' blood types?
L359024 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yes.
L359023 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Seven years.  One baptism?  He's your mother's only brother
L359022 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ So what?
L359021 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ The only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at Bedford.
L359020 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yes, I know.
L359019 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ You were not baptized.  At least I don't believe it was Christian.  Your baptism was performed by your uncle, James McKenzie.
L359018 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ But I was baptized.  And I certainly wasn't born of incest.
L359017 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ There's no reason why you should.  This has been planned from your birth. You fit all the criteria that we know of.  Never baptized, born of incest, devoid of faith...
L359016 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I don't understand what's going on.
L358967 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ If you or any of your lunatic friends ever come near me again...
L358966 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ You're about to become the anti-Christ who is born unholy and becomes the door to eternal suffering in this world.
L358965 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ My parents are dead.  Don't even think of bringing them into this.
L358964 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ I know this sounds crazy.  I understand. Check your parents' blood types.  Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
L358963 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I'm not going to be drawn into this.
L358962 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ You're already contaminated.  It's why you couldn't hear the tape.  There's probably a pentacle near your bed.  To sanctify you.
L358961 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You should think about getting professional help.
L358960 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ The good outwitting the bad.  It's like Birdson had a split personality.
L358959 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Trick him.
L358958 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ If you're possessed, you can't reveal anything Satan wants hidden.  Unless you trick him.
L358957 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Why didn't Birdson just say so?
L358956 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ It's true.  Birdson knew your name, he was writing it in numerical code.  It wasn't easy but I figured it out.  It spelled your name.
L358955 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What?!?!
L358954 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ At the exorcism, Birdson boasted that Satan is about to take over the body of a man.  You are that man, Peter.
L358953 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ And the point is?
L358952 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Townsend believed, just as God became man in Christ.  So Satan will assume human form.  I believe it too.
L358951 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Why did he try to kill me?
L358950 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Please, the children.
L358949 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Last night a guy named John Townsend tried to shoot me and now I find out you knew him.  What the fuck is going on?
L358945 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Peter, please...
L358944 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ We need to talk.
L358859 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Well, why should I?  Alright, what's your name, where do you live, when did you kill your parents?
L358858 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ That's their explanation.  You might not believe me...
L358857 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ And this is evil?  The guy had an aneurysm and now he's in a coma.
L358856 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ I had to.
L358855 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Where do you get off pretending to be my secretary?
L358828 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ You're right.  I must've made a mistake.
L358827 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ So what'd I miss?
L358826 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I cranked it all the way up.  Nothing but hum.
L358825 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ You're sure?  There was nothing?
L358824 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ It was blank.  Nothing on it.  You gave me the wrong one.
L358823 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ What do you mean?
L358822 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I think you gave me the wrong one.
L358821 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ So...what did you think of the tape.
L358769 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Well, I think it's very simple.  Here's a tape of Birdson's exorcism.  I'll be at the Public Library.  Tomorrow at 2... if you want to meet him.
L358768 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ The world would be so much simpler if it were all just about good and evil. Unfortunately I find it much more slippery and elusive place.
L358767 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ On television, you seemed so sure of yourself.  If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong?
L358766 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I'll bet.
L358765 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ An exorcism was just held for Birdson. It failed.  Disastrously.  Which means there's still a demonic spirit present in his body.  I was wondering, perhaps you'd like to go meet Henry.  He's pretty amazing.
L358764 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I do.
L358763 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Last week the Catholic Church certified him as genuinely possessed.  You realize how rarely they make that ruling?
L358762 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What's that got to do with you?
L358761 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Do you remember Henry Birdson?  The math professor who won the Salwen Medal, then went home and killed his family?
L358760 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Well, then it all seems to be working out for you.  Listen, Ms...?
L358759 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ In the end, the jury saw it my way.
L358758 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Ooooooh-kayyyyyy.
L358757 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ I murdered my parents, Mr. Kelson.  And while they deserved it, I still went to confession the following Sunday.
L358756 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power.  Which, to a narcissist, is impossible.
L358755 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ And I also believe in God and the Devil. In fact, I know they exist.
L358754 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ A narcissist doesn't admit it.  It's the extreme of self-denial.
L358753 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ What if I told you I was a malignant narcissist?
L358752 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Not the most popular opinion, but yes.
L358751 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ That there is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."
L358750 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Listen, I'm sorry, but I'm running late.
L358749 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ And also that...
L358748 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Not pure evil.  That's correct.
L358747 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ You said that malignant narcissism was not evil.
L358746 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Thank you.  Do you work in the building? You coming from the party?
L358745 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ I saw you on television yesterday.  You were brilliant.
L358744 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yes... and you are?
L358743 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Peter Kelson?
L358742 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ May I help you?
L358643 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ ...as a narcissist, he couldn't blame himself.  He created the voices after the fact.
L358642 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Oh my God!
L358707 +++$+++ u6402 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ TOWNSEND +++$+++ I'm not waiting until it's too late.
L358706 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Look, John, I'm facing it.
L358705 +++$+++ u6402 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ TOWNSEND +++$+++ You don't want to face it.
L358704 +++$+++ u6402 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ TOWNSEND +++$+++ Sure of what?  Who cares if this guy is devoid of faith or sleeps over a pentacle?  Results are what Lareaux would want.
L358703 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ You can't back out on me now.  We need to be sure.
L358702 +++$+++ u6402 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ TOWNSEND +++$+++ It's useless...look at him.
L358680 +++$+++ u6402 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ TOWNSEND +++$+++ Alright, Maya.  We'll do it your way.
L358679 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ We'll see Father Frank in the morning. There's nothing to be done until then.
L358678 +++$+++ u6402 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ TOWNSEND +++$+++ I've dealt with these people before, Maya.  They're not going to help us.
L358677 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ We need all the help we can get.
L358676 +++$+++ u6402 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ TOWNSEND +++$+++ A lot of good that'll do.
L358675 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ I've filed a report with Father Frank.
L358674 +++$+++ u6402 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ TOWNSEND +++$+++ And what are you thinking we should do now?
L358647 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ I'll explain everything later.  Can you meet me tonight?
L358646 +++$+++ u6402 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ TOWNSEND +++$+++ Maya?  What do you mean?
L358645 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ I know who he is.
L358644 +++$+++ u6402 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ TOWNSEND +++$+++ Hello?
L358545 +++$+++ u6402 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ TOWNSEND +++$+++ Whish the circumstances were different.
L358544 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Good seeing you again.
L359009 +++$+++ u6394 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Goodbye.
L359008 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Get out of here.
L359007 +++$+++ u6394 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ You do know, don't you.  That these are also numbers.  Greek numbers, 600, 60 and 6 - or 666.  The sign of the Devil.
L359006 +++$+++ u6394 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Suit yourself.  But does this mean anything to you?
L359005 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You know what?  You can go.
L359004 +++$+++ u6394 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Viznick will get off and Michael's got a crush on you.
L359003 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Nothing you couldn't find out from reading the papers.  And you're already wrong on one count.
L359002 +++$+++ u6394 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ But she worships you.  Your mother's dead but your father's alive.
L359000 +++$+++ u6394 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ You are the younger of two...
L358999 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I'd appreciate it if you'd put that back.
L358586 +++$+++ u6395 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Nice suit.
L358585 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I'll be at Bedford tonight, if you need me.
L358584 +++$+++ u6395 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ The police used him as a witness in this case.
L358583 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I think it's gonna be a waste of time.
L358582 +++$+++ u6395 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ He can see you Thursday.
L358581 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What about that psychic, what's his name, Szabo?
L358580 +++$+++ u6395 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Mr. Kelson, here's the stuff you wanted on pathological narcissism.
L358997 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ We millionaires yet?
L358996 +++$+++ u6397 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MRS. QUINTANA +++$+++ Good of you to stop by.
L358920 +++$+++ u6397 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MRS. QUINTANA +++$+++ It's Detective Smythe.
L358919 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yeah.
L358739 +++$+++ u6397 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MRS. QUINTANA +++$+++ You watch.  One day, I'll hit the jackpot, get the big house, car, clothes.  I'll have more money than God.
L358738 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You know what they say.  You have the same chance of winning whether you play or not.
L358737 +++$+++ u6397 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MRS. QUINTANA +++$+++ Sometimes I can just feel the numbers.
L358736 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Lemme guess.  The lottery.
L358735 +++$+++ u6397 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MRS. QUINTANA +++$+++ I plan to.  You want a tip?
L358619 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Of course.
L358618 +++$+++ u6400 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Would you sign it for me?
L358611 +++$+++ u6400 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ And what about you?  What about Peter Kelson?  Where is your moral compass?
L358610 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Right.  If you believe in God.  As a narcissist, Viznick couldn't blame himself for the alleged murders.  He created the voices after the fact.  In order to avoid the simple truth that there is no outside force that guides George Viznick and that George Viznick needs to pay.
L358609 +++$+++ u6400 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Meaning, Viznick's a man who answers to no one.  Not even God.
L358608 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Well, George Viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum. Viznick is not psychotic. He's simply unable to submit to any higher authority.
L358607 +++$+++ u6400 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Are you saying he's legally sane?
L358606 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Well, we all have a degree of narcissism, Sally, but a malignant narcissist is dangerously self-obsessed.
L358605 +++$+++ u6400 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ What do you mean by that?
L358604 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ As if there's another cause for little voices?  No, Sally, Viznick's a manipulator, he's clever, he has what I call malignant narcissism.
L358603 +++$+++ u6400 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts?
L358602 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ There weren't any voices.
L358601 +++$+++ u6400 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ You're referring to the defense's efforts to prove that George Viznick is tormented by "demonic voices?"
L358600 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ No, the less mystifying.  Good and evil are only illusions.  There is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."  That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings.
L358599 +++$+++ u6400 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ It's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil, the less evil it becomes.
