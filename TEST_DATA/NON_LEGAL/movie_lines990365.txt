L556270 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ I was on Earth...
L556269 +++$+++ u7980 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ ZALTAR +++$+++ This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?
L556268 +++$+++ u7979 +++$+++ m540 +++$+++ SUPERGIRL +++$+++ What is this place?
L556913 +++$+++ u7982 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ Nope.  Never. 
L556912 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Man, you don't never pass out, do ya?
L556910 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Hey, man, that's a great name for a cocktail!
L556909 +++$+++ u7982 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ No, no, on the football field. They called me...  ...The Smallville Flash.
L556908 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Brad?
L556907 +++$+++ u7982 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?
L556906 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
L556905 +++$+++ u7982 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ Brad.
L556904 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Got vodka in it now. Gotta give it a new name. Hey, listen, you thought it up, we'll name it after you. What's your name?
L556901 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ What? What did you tell me?
L556900 +++$+++ u7982 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ Aha! What'd I tell ya!
L556899 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ There's no vodka in it.
L556898 +++$+++ u7982 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ Not enough vodka in it.
L556897 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Sling. Singapore Sling. What's wrong?
L556896 +++$+++ u7982 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ S'not bad, s'very good, but... y'know what's wrong with this... Singapore...thing?
L556894 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ TUESDAY! I got to get it all set up in his office tonight before all those big shots come here tomorrow for the meeting!!
L556893 +++$+++ u7982 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ Tuesday.
L556892 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Roebush! That's  the guy! Buddy, he's gonna nail our behinds to the wall! this is Special Order! He said he had to have it before...  Omigod!! What's tomorrow?
L556891 +++$+++ u7982 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ Mr. Roebush?
L556890 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
L556889 +++$+++ u7982 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ What are you talkin' about?
L556888 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ First the supplier couldn't find the invoice. Then the order came up short. Then I missed the four o'clock plane from Cleveland and had to rent a car, and then I got a darn flat tire on the highway! Can you beat it? Boy, your boss must've been furious when I didn't show up by the end of the day today, huh?
L556887 +++$+++ u7982 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ What?
L556886 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Buddy, are we in trouble.
L556885 +++$+++ u7982 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ Yeah? What do you want?
L556720 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ The kid will do fine on his own.  Give it your best shot, Ricky!
L556719 +++$+++ u7982 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ The kid needs a man to show him --
L556718 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ I just think Ricky would rather not get a bowling lesson in front of the other kids.
L556717 +++$+++ u7982 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ For a guy who was lucky to be water-boy on the high school team, you sure got a big mouth, Kent.
L556716 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Say, Brad. I think he'll be better off doing it his way.
L556711 +++$+++ u7982 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ A natural athlete can play any sport. Any sport.
L556710 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad.
L556709 +++$+++ u7982 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ All the kid needs is a couple of pointers from the ol' champ here.  Kent, I bet you didn't know I won the all-country bowling trophy two years in a row.
L556708 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ I seem to be.
L556707 +++$+++ u7982 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ Hiya, sweet thing.  Little guy's getting' hassled, huh?  Kent, you still here?
L556636 +++$+++ u7982 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ Hiya, Kent, long time no see. Not that you ever could.  "See" I mean,  Hahaha!
L556635 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Brad Wilson.
L556634 +++$+++ u7982 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ BRAD +++$+++ Here I am, honey, and I'm all yours.  Remember when you were Queen of the Prom? All the guys had to wait in line to get a dance.  But now there's only one name on your dance card, sweet thing, and it's --
L557316 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ Anyday...
L557315 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
L557314 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ I guess he misses a lot of dinners.
L557031 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ Well, he's going to get the best home-cooked meal he's had in... in a long time. You tell Superman we think he's wonderful.
L557030 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ No, well in this case I think I can speak for him.  I mean, I'm pretty close to him, you know.  Superman will be there on Wednesday.
L556932 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ Me too. That's why I put this one up.
L556931 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Gee, I always loved porch swings.
L556883 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Lana, I'm from Metropolis. I see Superman every day.
L556882 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ Well, aren't you excited?
L556881 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L556880 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ He really was!
L556861 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Can I help?
L556860 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ The dog's always doing that.  And the car's always doing that.
L556855 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ Oh, I wouldn't want to -- I mean, I'd want to, but I wouldn't want to...be a nuisance to you.
L556854 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Call me.
L556853 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ No, what you said before, Could I make it in Metropolis? I've dreamed about it, sure, but I never really thought about it.  What would I do when I got there?
L556852 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Ride a thresher? Well, I don't know. Girls are trying just about everything now but --
L556851 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ That's the biggest change in Smallville, you know. They've taken over this town. Everybody who isn't actually working for Wheat King -- like I do -- is out there --  on a Wheat King thresher.  Do you think I could do it? Do you?
L556850 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ No. I mean, yes they are, but I was talking about that.  Wheat King. Bet your bottom dollar that's a Wheat King thresher. 
L556849 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Old ties are hard to cut.
L556848 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ I can never get a way from it.
L556846 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ You know, I was just thinking, Lana --  -- someone like you could do do really well in Metropolis --
L556845 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ So...how much longer do you think you'll be in Smallville --
L556844 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Me neither...
L556843 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ Gee, I haven't laughed like that since -- since --  I really can't remember when.
L556842 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ Pate? What pate?  I didn't make any --  Oh, no, Clark. That's Buster's dog food.
L556841 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Well, this pate is rather...unusual.
L556840 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ No, I mean Ricky. He's not interested in any of this stuff.
L556839 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ No, thanks.
L556838 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ Peanut butter and jelly.
L556835 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ I meant all the choices here. All this --  -- cole slaw, guacamole --  This is some picnic!
L556834 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it.
L556833 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ There's a lot of choices here.
L556832 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ And even nicer when there's a man around, Which isn't all that often.
L556827 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ I'm talking about salt.  Oh, go ahead, pour it on, relax. That's what picnics are for.
L556826 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Me??
L556825 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise.
L556824 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
L556823 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ Some people don't think it's healthy.
L556822 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Gee, I haven't done this in years.
L556706 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ I mean him.
L556705 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ But all he had was chocolate milk.
L556704 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ It isn't only that he's small for his age. how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father?  Look at him, he's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon.
L556703 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.
L556702 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ I just can't stand this.
L556671 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ I thought "Clark Kent has a really nice voice." You didn't even know I was there.
L556670 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ You thought that?
L556669 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ That song. I remember one day I came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano. And I thought -- what am I going to do with all this potato salad?
L556667 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Oh...I came close once.
L556666 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ You...um...you never got married?
L556663 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ Ricky. My little boy. At least here we've got a house. and I've got a job. Okay, I'm only a secretary, oaky, but it pays the bills. Except for last winter when the fuel bills kept going up and up and up.  I even had to pawn my diamond ring then.
L556662 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Who?
L556661 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ That's easy to say. But how? And what about Ricky?
L556660 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ But Lana, you could --
L556659 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ No, the problem is --  Why do I stay in Smallville? Believe me, I've asked myself the same question. Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis?  The Big Apricot.
L556658 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ I didn't --
L556657 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ Mayonnaise? Donald loved mayonnaise. Why would you think that was the problem.?
L556656 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Too much mayonnaise?
L556655 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ You know what's the problem?
L556654 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ There must be a gallon of potato salad left over.
L556653 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ It sure is.
L556652 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ And three years after the Royal Wedding, the King abdicated.  Isn't that terrible?
L556647 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ The streamers? They're no problem, you just pull on them and --
L556646 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ You'd be surprised how many offers I didn't get. Even Brad wouldn't stick around for this.  It really isn't easy.
L556638 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Sure, Lana, I'd love to.
L556637 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ I can't  Clark already asked me.  Didn't you?  He used to love this song.  Didn't you?  So he just said --  "Would you dance with me?"
L556625 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ For reminding me, I mean. Can you follow me?
L556624 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ You're welcome...??
L556623 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you.
L556622 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ You shouldn't say that, you're the chairman --  ...uh, chairperson...
L556619 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ You always did.  Can I give you a hand with that?
L556618 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ You look wonderful.
L556617 +++$+++ u7988 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LANA +++$+++ Clark.
L556616 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Lana Lang. How great to see you.
L557351 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ I'm sorry, Mr. White, but I've got an errand to run.
L557350 +++$+++ u7992 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ Kent!
L557349 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Uh...excuse me, folks...
L556529 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Oh. You're going away.
L556528 +++$+++ u7992 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ -- but you  deserve the vacation, Lois.
L556517 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Let me do it for you, Mr. White.
L556516 +++$+++ u7992 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ I'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this.
L556501 +++$+++ u7992 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ Look, I don't know, Kent. . . CLARK  Personally, I think it could be a terrific story!
L556500 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Mr. White, please, I promised those people I'd get back to them by this morning. What do you think?
L556493 +++$+++ u7992 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ Please, Kent, not now. I'm trying to put out a newspaper here.
L556492 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Hi, Lois. Morning, Jimmy, you've got mustard on your lapel. Excuse me, Mr. White, I don't mean to interrupt but ---
L557313 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Actually, that's why I stopped by. He's realy sorry, he wanted to make it, but then he...ran into a problem.
L557312 +++$+++ u7993 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Hi. Mister Kent.  Guess who Mom's having dinner with tonight? Superman!
L556940 +++$+++ u7993 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Could you get me Superman's autograph?
L556939 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Sure.
L556938 +++$+++ u7993 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Mr. Kent, could I ask you something?
L556937 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ We get together sometimes.
L556936 +++$+++ u7993 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Do you really know Superman?
L556879 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ What!
L556878 +++$+++ u7993 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Mr. Kent! Superman was here!
L556830 +++$+++ u7993 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Mom and I do this all the time.
L556829 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Well...  Not quite like this.
L557336 +++$+++ u7989 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Oh?
L557335 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary.
L557334 +++$+++ u7989 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ I'd better be. Suddenly I've got competition to keep up with.  Your high school reunion article. I though it was terrific. And fascinating.  Especially about the girl back home.  I'll tell you what, Clark, I'll take you to lunch and you can tell me all about it.
L557333 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ You're the best, Lois.
L556519 +++$+++ u7989 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Exactly what I was about to ask about me.
L556518 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ So, Mr. White? Can I go ahead and make my travel arrangements?
L556511 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Take me, for instance. Going back to middle America after having become a Metropolis sophisticate --
L556510 +++$+++ u7989 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Say!
L556509 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Anyway, the reunion's just the hook for the story. What it's really about is how the typical small town's changed in the last fifteen years. how do you like this a title: Can You Go Home Again ?
L556577 +++$+++ u7987 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ You know what Mr. White said. A photographer always goes after a story.
L556576 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ What are you doing?
L556575 +++$+++ u7987 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Keep talking to that state trooper so he doesn't notice where I'm going, okay?
L556564 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ At one o'clock in the morning?
L556563 +++$+++ u7987 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Wow, what a beautiful sunrise!
L556562 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ What's that?
L556561 +++$+++ u7987 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ The thing is though, my cousin Arnold, Aunt Rosey's Arnold this is, he got mad when Uncle Al insulted his mother's stuffing, so now the problem is --
L556560 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Mmmmm . . .
L556559 +++$+++ u7987 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ But my Uncle Al, on my father's side, he won't eat her stuffing, he says it should be cooked on the outside of the turkey and she puts the stuffing inside the turkey. So my mother told my Aunt Ellen . . . Aunt Ellen's my father's half-sister, I told you that, right?
L556506 +++$+++ u7987 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I wouldn't know Mr. Kent. Most of the people I went to high school with are still in high school.
L556505 +++$+++ u7983 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ It's practically an American ritual, Mr. White! Isn't that so, Jimmy?
L556463 +++$+++ u7984 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ 
L556462 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ What about this week's check?
L556461 +++$+++ u7984 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
L556460 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum!
L556459 +++$+++ u7984 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ Thirty-six weeks of chronic unemployment, thirty-six weeks of living off the taxes of hard-working citizens. Do you know what you are?
L556458 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ I know, I'm the fault.
L556457 +++$+++ u7984 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis is generous to a fault, but. . .
L556456 +++$+++ u7986 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Man, them people was crazy! How they 'spect you to learn all that jive on the first day? "Hold the pickle! Hold the lettuce! Extra onions! Special sauce! No special sauce!" Ain't nobody found no meat inside that glop yet.
L556455 +++$+++ u7984 +++$+++ m541 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ The only other employment you found was in a fast-food joint--  -- which lasted. . . 28 minutes! Well! That's some kind of record. Talk about fast!
