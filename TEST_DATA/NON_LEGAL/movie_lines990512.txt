L652762 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I'm not going anywhere, Ted. You're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams.
L652761 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Julie, wow. I was afraid you left. I was afraid I'd never see you again.
L652648 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Keeping your word is something I can actually respect, Ted.
L652647 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ The thing is, I made a commitment. I said I'd do it and I have to keep my word.
L652646 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ You think you're working with chimps here?
L652645 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You're quick. I like that.
L652644 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades?
L652643 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all.
L652642 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ You're telling me you don't get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts.
L652641 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Aw Julie, it's my job. It's like being a doctor.
L652640 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.
L652639 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I know, their small town mentality can be maddening.
L652638 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I have to be honest with you, Ted. I really despise "The Girls of Xenia."
L652634 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ But absolutely true.
L652633 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ That's hard to believe.
L652632 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Julie, I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth. I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. I mean a lot. But none of them make me feel like you do.
L652631 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Maybe someday.
L652630 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I want you to trust me.
L652629 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Trust is something you earn, over time. You don't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire.
L652628 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Come on.
L652627 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Not a chance.
L652626 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Do you trust me, Julie?
L652625 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever.
L652624 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.
L652623 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ You live and learn. I realized the most important thing to me, above all, is trust.
L652622 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ A Portuguese boyfriend. Sounds very "Cosmo."
L652621 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me.
L652620 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I see.
L652619 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch.
L652618 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Tell me more.
L652617 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I'm very aural.
L652616 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ What about you?
L652615 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ That's refreshingly deviant.
L652614 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs.
L652613 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Wearing them?  Or humping them?
L652612 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.
L652611 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.
L652610 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.
L652609 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.
L652608 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ That has more to do with your proximity to me.
L652607 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I'm trembling with excitement.
L652606 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Look at us. It's one o'clock in the morning, on a school night. We're in a smoky nightclub, hoping to catch our principal with some big city tart.
L652605 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Amen to that.
L652604 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ At least it's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue.
L652603 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood?
L652602 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I don't know. This place seems pretty tame.
L652601 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Let's do it.
L652600 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.
L652599 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ He's on the move?
L652598 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Well? Where the hell are you?
L652597 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ That's probably my office.
L652535 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Then you won't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week...
L652534 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ A good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade. I'm honing my craft.
L652533 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ He shut down your paper!  You're stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and PTA brunches!
L652532 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ You forget, I dislike YOU at least as much as him.
L652531 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ There's gotta be something. We have to dig deeper.
L652530 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ That's two words. And I'm out of the "exposed" business, remember? I need to graduate. Besides, Merk's a boy scout.
L652529 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ In a word: MERK. EXPOSED.
L652528 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Cut to the chase, William Randolph. Your audience is way ahead of you.
L652527 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ If we were a team, we could do anything. I mean, anything.
L652526 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ But you never do.
L652525 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Even when you infuriate me, I still want to kiss you.
L652524 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I know.
L652523 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You're amazing.
L652522 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Then you'll see who's really holding on to you.
L652521 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ And then what?
L652520 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Eventually you'll let go.
L652519 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction.
L652518 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ It's incredibly simple.
L652517 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ It's all so complicated.
L652516 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad.
L652515 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I mean my father.
L652514 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Your dad taught you everything.
L652513 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You think my dad would have been like that if I knew him? You think he would have bought me a stadium, instead of teaching me how to play ball?
L652512 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ The ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted.
L652511 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Now it makes sense, the whole neo Bohemian, down with hypocrisy, fight the power crap. You're a poor little rich girl.
L652510 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I doubt it.
L652509 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I see.
L652508 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ He phoned it in.
L652507 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ He cared enough to want you to have it.
L652506 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Not "whatever."  It's two different things.
L652505 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Whatever.
L652504 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ He didn't. He had it built.
L652503 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I can't believe your dad built this for you.
L652502 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ To the best hiding place in the world.
L652501 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Where are we going?
L652458 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Put your eyeballs back in your head, William Randolph. I'm on assignment. A girl has to fit in.
L652457 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Wow...you clean up nice.
L652371 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ You've got enough people kissing your ass.
L652370 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Why can't you be nice to me?
L652369 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
L652368 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Charlie's right. Jealousy is so unattractive.
L652367 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You're implying she's, what, a gold digger?
L652366 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ You're so twitterpated you don't even see the miner's hat and the pickax.
L652365 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Well? What do you think of her?
L652357 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ A little respect would be nice, that's all.
L652356 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ And this is not my first time on a private jet, so quit acting like I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.
L652355 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ See? You're impertinent, rude, sarcastic.
L652354 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on Planet Ted.
L652353 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Considering this is your first time on a private jet, on which you are interviewing the world's most eligible bachelor,  you are extremely cavalier.
L652352 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort.
L652351 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ My adoptive grandfather. Who knows what my biological grandfather did.
L652350 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.
L652349 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Funny you should say "peachy."
L652348 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.
L652347 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me.
L652346 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Is this an gritty exposé or a candy ass press release?
L652345 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Don't write that part.
L652344 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You never know around here.
L652343 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ She said peanuts, you cretin.
L652340 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Interesting.
L652339 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I guess.
L652338 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I see. So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist.
L652337 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I felt limited. I felt confined. I felt like I was suffocating.
L652336 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?
L652335 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I don't get the distinction.
L652334 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps?
L652333 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I have to admit, I always felt... different.
L652304 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Really? You wanna write about me?
L652303 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ "Local boy inherits more money than god." Call me crazy, but I smell human interest.
L652302 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Me?
L652301 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Then I'll write about YOU.
L652300 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ What do you want from me? I'm trying to be fair. But I can't keep you on staff if you turn every PTA meeting into an Agent Orange cover up.
L652298 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ That's not ENTIRELY true.
L652297 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.
L652296 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I'm trying to help.
L652295 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.
L652294 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Come on, Julie. Don't screw up. You have some real talent.
L652293 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you didn't even know it was there.
L652292 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ In the sense that there is no "hidden agenda" behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs.
L652291 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ In what sense?
L652290 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Your article sucked.
L652289 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ What is it, William Randolph? Your balls need scratching?
L652288 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ It's so nice to have FRIENDS like you, Christy.
L652287 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ A few billion bucks and suddenly he's Cro-Magnon Man of the Year.
L651926 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ It was for your own good, in a twisted sort of publicly humiliating way.
L651925 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ But you triple-dog-dared me.
L651924 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I tried to warn you, William Randolph. She's got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds.
L651909 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ --Do it. I triple-dog-dare you.
L651908 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I have absolutely no intention--
L651907 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Go ahead. Ask her to the prom. Get it over with.
L651906 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Me-ow.
L651905 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I didn't know they gave them for Best Lip Gloss Retention During a Blow Job.
L651904 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Christy's a very talented journalist. I see a Pulitzer in her future.
L651903 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Don't even tell me you're hot for Miss Titty Pom Poms over there.
L651902 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Look, I loved "Exposed!" and I hate it that you got busted. I know the school paper sucks in comparison, but it's really not THAT BAD.
L651901 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Is it true? Is ignorance bliss?
L651900 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ The school dumpsters used to overflow to the point where the stench was unbearable. My award winning exposé changed all that. The city added an extra weekday trash pick-up.
L651899 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Let me guess: retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof!
L651898 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ That's just one example. My reporting has made a difference.
L651897 +++$+++ u8899 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ So, William Randolph. Your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of Rice Crispie Treats and chocolate Snickerdoodles at the annual bake sale.
L652730 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Don't say "shit," honey. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
L652729 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I need your help.  I'm really in deep shit.
L652719 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much.
L652718 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Everything I am is because of you. Can you ever forgive me?
L652328 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Forget the store. Think big.
L652327 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ But who would run the store?
L652324 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Like take that trip to Buckingham Palace. Go deep sea fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. Now's your chance.
L652323 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Like what?
L652322 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You're free.  You can do anything you ever wanted to do!
L652321 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Oh. Goodness.
L652320 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Don't you get it? In one day I earn more interest than the store's entire annual revenue.
L652318 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ But how would we pay our bills?
L652317 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You don't have to work another day in your lives.
L652261 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I'll make you very proud.
L652260 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ You promise you'll finish school?
L652259 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Only the best for my mother.
L652258 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Oh, good lord. Are those Neptunes?
L652256 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Mom. Believe me. I could buy all that AND the factories they came from.
L652255 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too expensive.
L652254 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Just a few tokens of my affection. I'll be back soon, don't worry.
L652253 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ What is all this? When are you coming home?
L652252 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Well? Surprised?
L652099 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ It's okay, Mom.  Trust me.
L652098 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Save it, honey.  We want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill.
L652097 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Yeah, I'm doing fine.  I have so much to tell you.  I don't even know where to begin.
L652096 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Did you have a nice flight?  Are they taking good care of you?
L652095 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I'm all right, Mom. I'm not in Siberia, you know.
L651966 +++$+++ u8902 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Charlie, at a will reading? What did I do to deserve this?
L651965 +++$+++ u8900 +++$+++ m605 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ What about Charlie?  You boys could make it a little adventure.
