L444482 +++$+++ u2482 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ POPPY +++$+++ If you loved me like I loved you?
L444481 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ Poppy, please --
L444480 +++$+++ u2482 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ POPPY +++$+++ What I asked you earlier?
L444479 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ Considering what?
L444478 +++$+++ u2482 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ POPPY +++$+++ I was wondering if you'd finished considering?
L444477 +++$+++ u2482 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ POPPY +++$+++ I'm so excited, Icarus.
L444476 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ It will be an ascension.
L444473 +++$+++ u2482 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ POPPY +++$+++ Okay, arms up, lean forward.
L444472 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ This is what my entire life has been directed at, this moment, this threshold.
L444471 +++$+++ u2482 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ POPPY +++$+++ Oh yes, Icky.  I can feel it.
L444470 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ Can you feel it, Poppy?  The presence of the moment?  Can you feel the weight of its significance?
L444425 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ If you honestly trust me, then you'll have to trust me.
L444424 +++$+++ u2482 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ POPPY +++$+++ Consideration?
L444423 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ I promise, my dear, I will give the matter some consideration.
L444422 +++$+++ u2482 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ POPPY +++$+++ Icarus?
L444417 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ Poppy, please, just tell me what you want.
L444416 +++$+++ u2482 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ POPPY +++$+++ Then you still love me?
L444415 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ Yes.  Yes, of course it is.
L444414 +++$+++ u2482 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ POPPY +++$+++ Look at me, Icarus!  Look at my body.  I've done everything, changed anything you asked me to.  'We will always love most that which we create.'  Is that still true?
L444413 +++$+++ u2482 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ POPPY +++$+++ Icarus, please!  This is important!
L444412 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ Why are there two ottomans?
L444411 +++$+++ u2482 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ POPPY +++$+++ You know how I feel about you.  You know how much I need you.  How much I trust you.  I would do anything for you.
L444409 +++$+++ u2482 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ POPPY +++$+++ No, Icky, this is real.
L444408 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ Poppy, are you in one of your moods again?
L444406 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ She must feel something for him. After all, she and I did create him.
L444405 +++$+++ u2482 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ POPPY +++$+++ Do you think she loves him?
L444404 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ Based on what we know of him, that would seem inevitable.
L444403 +++$+++ u2482 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ POPPY +++$+++ And you still believe he's going to come here?
L444402 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ That remains to be seen.
L444401 +++$+++ u2482 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ POPPY +++$+++ And you think O'Brien is that leverage?
L444400 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ Eventually.  These things are always a matter of leverage.
L444399 +++$+++ u2482 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ POPPY +++$+++ Do you think she will give us the designs?
L444332 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ Dr. Nebbleman, I want to know the moment the nanobot arrives.  The instant, understand?
L444331 +++$+++ u2482 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ POPPY +++$+++ Gently, Ott.  Gently.
L444032 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ You're right.  Place a call to our friends at the network and to Mr. Joplin at the E.P.A.
L444031 +++$+++ u2482 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ POPPY +++$+++ A containment crew is going to attract a lot of attention.
L444013 +++$+++ u2482 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ POPPY +++$+++ Nebbleman.
L444012 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ Oh no.  No.  We'll get her assistant.  What's-his-name? Nebbishman?
L444011 +++$+++ u2482 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ POPPY +++$+++ In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
L444010 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ Yes, that's true.  We have to find him, run tests, determine if the polymerization is stable.
L444009 +++$+++ u2482 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ POPPY +++$+++ You don't either.  We won't know anything until we find that guy and find out if he's alive or what.
L444008 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ But, Poppy, you don't know what this means --
L444007 +++$+++ u2482 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ POPPY +++$+++ Now, Icky, I don't need you winding yourself up.  I need you focused and in control.
L444006 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ It works, Poppy.  It works, it works!
L444003 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ Who cares!  We've got to find him! Hurry!
L444002 +++$+++ u2482 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ POPPY +++$+++ Icky!  What's happening?
L443868 +++$+++ u2482 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ POPPY +++$+++ Don't be a child, Icarus.  She is just another scientist and like all scientists, she doesn't care about anything outside the world of the laboratory.
L443867 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ She let it escape because she wants me to die.
L443866 +++$+++ u2482 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ POPPY +++$+++ She did not.  The mouse ran down the drain.
L443865 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ She's lying.  She lost the first one on purpose.
L443864 +++$+++ u2482 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ POPPY +++$+++ She says it's not.
L443863 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ It's ready now, I know it is.
L443862 +++$+++ u2482 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ POPPY +++$+++ She's working as fast as she can, Icarus.  It will be ready soon.
L443859 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ No.  I'm getting used to it.
L443858 +++$+++ u2482 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ POPPY +++$+++ Icarus, please, if you want me to give you a bath just say so.
L443857 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ Oh no?  Smell this.
L443856 +++$+++ u2482 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ POPPY +++$+++ You're not rotting meat.
L443855 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ Like rotting meat.
L444542 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ Donated to science.  Perfect.
L444541 +++$+++ u2480 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ NEBBLEMAN +++$+++ Wait, wait, can I at least have his body?
L444540 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ It'll be better for us if he simply disappears.  The gardener will know what to do.
L444532 +++$+++ u2480 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ NEBBLEMAN +++$+++ Thank you, sir.
L444531 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ Excellent work, Dr. Nebbleman.  You have outdone yourself.
L444498 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ Shut up and do it!
L444497 +++$+++ u2480 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ NEBBLEMAN +++$+++ Of course you understand, Dr. Argon, that once the nanobot is inside of you, there is no going back --
L444367 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ In the meantime, why don't you find something useful for Dr. Bright to do.
L444366 +++$+++ u2480 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ NEBBLEMAN +++$+++ Dr. Makeo is working on it now, sir. I estimate at least another six hours.
L444365 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ Excellent.  How long until the assembler tank is complete?
L444364 +++$+++ u2480 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ NEBBLEMAN +++$+++ They're here!  They're here!  We have the nanobot.
L444311 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ The trunk.
L444310 +++$+++ u2480 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ NEBBLEMAN +++$+++ Where did he go?
L444304 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ Dr. Nebbleman, take care of them.
L444303 +++$+++ u2480 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ NEBBLEMAN +++$+++ She could have given him something to stimulate his kidneys.
L444200 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ Look, John, nobody wants to find out what happens.  That's why you're here.  We need your help on this one and that's why that suitcase is here.
L444199 +++$+++ u2480 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ NEBBLEMAN +++$+++ Well, at this time, I mean that is to say, it is difficult to project --
L444030 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ Poppy, order the trucks from the Gary plant.  And we're going to need a containment crew.
L444029 +++$+++ u2480 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ NEBBLEMAN +++$+++ That might work.
L444028 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ Then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control.
L444027 +++$+++ u2480 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ NEBBLEMAN +++$+++ Well, yes.  The replicators are not as active at low temperatures.
L444026 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ Facts, Dr. Nebbleman.  Facts. You've been using cryogenics to control the waste from the mouse experiment, haven't you?
L444025 +++$+++ u2480 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ NEBBLEMAN +++$+++ Cleaned up?  It can't be cleaned up! Without the nanobot the waste can't be stabilized!  That's what we've been trying to tell you!  The only thing we can do is run!  Run!  Run!
L444024 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ The fact is, that the milk has been spilled and now we need you to tell us how to clean it up.
L444021 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ The nanobot is gone.
L444020 +++$+++ u2480 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ NEBBLEMAN +++$+++ Okay.  Alright.  Okey-dokey.  Now, we need the nanobot.  The nanobot that initiated the reaction.  Once we have that we can stabilize the meltdown.  Simple really.  No problem.
L443991 +++$+++ u2478 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ KID +++$+++ I want Trix!  Mommy!
L443990 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Here, kid, this is great stuff.  Why don't you give it a try?
L443986 +++$+++ u2478 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ KID +++$+++ I like Trix!
L443985 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ You have no idea what this is doing to your body.
L443984 +++$+++ u2478 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ KID +++$+++ Yeah, I do!
L443983 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ You don't want this.
L443982 +++$+++ u2478 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ KID +++$+++ Hey!
L443899 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ I'll do whatever I have to do.
L443898 +++$+++ u2479 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ LITTERBUG +++$+++ What are you going to do?  Make me throw it out?
L443897 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Oh no, no, no.  No can do.  You enjoyed a tasty beverage and thus this receptacle becomes your responsibility and I don't care if it's a Styrofoam cup or the Exxon Valdez!  You've got to learn to take responsibility!
L443896 +++$+++ u2479 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ LITTERBUG +++$+++ Look, asshole, I don't got time for this.  If you got a problem, you better take care of it yourself.
L443895 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ I just want to know what goes on in the mind of a litterbug.  What chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that tells you, 'It's okay, just chuck it'?
L443894 +++$+++ u2479 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ LITTERBUG +++$+++ You better quit pushing me, pal.
L443893 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ What is it with you litterbugs?  Is it a territorial thing, marking your turf with your garbage?
L443892 +++$+++ u2479 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ LITTERBUG +++$+++ Why don't you just shove it up your ass!  Haw-haw!
L443891 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Why don't you just put this in your pocket so when you see a garbage can you can put it where it belongs.
L443890 +++$+++ u2479 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ LITTERBUG +++$+++ Haw-haw!  Why don't you run off and find a cop and I'll wait right here.
L443889 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ So what?  So what?  For starters, how about littering is a crime.
L443888 +++$+++ u2479 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ LITTERBUG +++$+++ Yeah?  So what?
L444396 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Make me?  How?  You think he's going to torture me?
L444395 +++$+++ u2480 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ NEBBLEMAN +++$+++ I think that either you're going to give them to him or he's going to make you give them to him.
L444394 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ You mean the designs for the nanobot?  You think after this I'm going to give them to him?
L444393 +++$+++ u2480 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ NEBBLEMAN +++$+++ I'm a scientist.  I have lived my whole life by the diagnostic application of fact and the fact is, Argon is going to get whatever he wants, so if I were you, I'd give it to him.
L444388 +++$+++ u2480 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ NEBBLEMAN +++$+++ Who isn't?
L444387 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ You're afraid of him.
L444386 +++$+++ u2480 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ NEBBLEMAN +++$+++ Of course he is, but at least there isn't a security guard outside my door.
L444385 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Nigel, can't you see he's using you?
L444384 +++$+++ u2480 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ NEBBLEMAN +++$+++ No!  Well, not those exact words.
L444383 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Is that what Argon told you?
L444382 +++$+++ u2480 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ NEBBLEMAN +++$+++ Because I am a new man, Susan.  I am a man of vision.  Your problem, Susan, is that you're always looking down.  If you'd just look up you'd see the big picture and in the big picture men of vision do not dwell on what might be lost.  They focus on what can be gained.
L444381 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Argon is a lunatic!  I can't believe I was stupid enough to believe I could control him.  You heard what he said, Nigel.  He doesn't care if all of Calumet City is turned to Jell-O.  How can that not affect you?
L444380 +++$+++ u2480 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ NEBBLEMAN +++$+++ Dr. Argon would say we are all prisoners.
L444379 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ There's a guard outside my door! I'm a prisoner, Nigel!  Do you understand that?
L444378 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Opportunity?
L444377 +++$+++ u2480 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ NEBBLEMAN +++$+++ Susan, Dr. Argon is giving you an opportunity here.
L444376 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I don't believe this is happening...
L444334 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Dr. Argon, I know you want to use the nanobot on yourself, but you mustn't.  The situation is critical right now.  The replicators are growing exponentially.  If we wait much longer it will be too late. You have to use the nanobot to stop the meltdown.
L444333 +++$+++ u2480 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ NEBBLEMAN +++$+++ Of course, sir.
L444323 +++$+++ u2480 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ NEBBLEMAN +++$+++ You're looking for a urine sample.
L444322 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ You were never invited to my house.
L443948 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ What I've always done.  As long as I'm the only one who can build the nanobot, I'm the only one who can say when it should be tested.
L443947 +++$+++ u2480 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ NEBBLEMAN +++$+++ What are you going to do?
L443946 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I hope you're right.  I'd feel a lot worse if he had read them and just didn't care.
L443945 +++$+++ u2480 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ NEBBLEMAN +++$+++ I bet he hasn't read a single report we've written on the waste problem.
L443929 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ This day just keeps going from bad to worse.
L443928 +++$+++ u2480 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ NEBBLEMAN +++$+++ Worse.  Mrs. Argon wants to talk to you.  She's waiting in the lab.
L443927 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ The replicators?
L443926 +++$+++ u2480 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ NEBBLEMAN +++$+++ Well, you got another problem.
L443925 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing.
L443924 +++$+++ u2480 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ NEBBLEMAN +++$+++ What did security say?
L443911 +++$+++ u2480 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ NEBBLEMAN +++$+++ That's the guy?
L443910 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Yeah.  But it wasn't a group.  It was one man.
L443909 +++$+++ u2480 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ NEBBLEMAN +++$+++ Yeah, somebody broke in and stole the samples, one of those animal rights groups, right?  I remember now, they freed all the monkeys which caused that huge pileup on the Massachusetts Turnpike, right?
L443908 +++$+++ u2480 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ NEBBLEMAN +++$+++ That's right.  C.D.C. found out and closed them down...
L443907 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
L443906 +++$+++ u2480 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ NEBBLEMAN +++$+++ Oh yeah.  They were working on molecular assemblers, too, weren't they?
L443905 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Do you remember about five years ago, that uh... incident at Purnell Labs?
L443883 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I'm not sure.  That's the funny thing about him.  He's the kind of guy that you never know what he wants or what he might do to get it.
L443882 +++$+++ u2480 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ NEBBLEMAN +++$+++ What did he want?
L443881 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Yeah.  I knew him when I was still in school.
L443880 +++$+++ u2480 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ NEBBLEMAN +++$+++ A man?
L443879 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ This morning.  I saw someone I haven't seen in a long time.
L443878 +++$+++ u2480 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ NEBBLEMAN +++$+++ Aaabout...?
L443877 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ What?  Oh, I'm sorry, Nigel.  I was just thinking...
L444551 +++$+++ u2483 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SIM +++$+++ Wellie well, Dr. Bright.  You're just in time.
L444550 +++$+++ u2480 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ NEBBLEMAN +++$+++ Susan!
L444539 +++$+++ u2483 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SIM +++$+++ And if we evacuate, what do you want to do with O'Brien?
L444538 +++$+++ u2480 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ NEBBLEMAN +++$+++ He's probably right, sir, the building is probably going to collapse under its own weight.
L444516 +++$+++ u2483 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SIM +++$+++ So, I guess it worked.
L444515 +++$+++ u2480 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ NEBBLEMAN +++$+++ Sir, please try to hold still.
L444330 +++$+++ u2480 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ NEBBLEMAN +++$+++ Yes.  That's it.  He's got it.  Oh God, he's got it!
L444329 +++$+++ u2483 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SIM +++$+++ Like Crazy Glue?
L444328 +++$+++ u2480 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ NEBBLEMAN +++$+++ Smell?  Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.
L444327 +++$+++ u2483 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SIM +++$+++ What's it smell like?
L444321 +++$+++ u2483 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SIM +++$+++ Okay.
L444320 +++$+++ u2480 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ NEBBLEMAN +++$+++ I've only been invited to her house once, but I know there is a basement lab that she uses for private research.
L444319 +++$+++ u2483 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SIM +++$+++ You want to tell me what I'm looking for?
L444318 +++$+++ u2480 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ NEBBLEMAN +++$+++ Mr. Sim, watch out!  O'Brien escaped and could be on his way!
L444317 +++$+++ u2483 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SIM +++$+++ It's Sim.  We're almost there.
L444316 +++$+++ u2480 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ NEBBLEMAN +++$+++ Yes?
L444647 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ I guess they do.
L444646 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Things do change.
L444637 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Do you suppose that was our problem? We met before our time?  I think that happens a lot.  People, events, planets all just circling each other waiting for that moment when everything clicks into place.
L444636 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ We were different people then.
L444635 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ God, what a fight that was.
L444634 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ I remember I was trying to help...
L444633 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ God, when we were in that store all I could think about was that one time, when we were in school, and you attacked that little kid who wanted some cereal.  Do you remember that?
L444593 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Do the words 'hero fantasies' mean anything to you?  How about 'infantile dementia'?
L444592 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ I have to!
L444591 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ You're not going after Argon!
L444589 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ We don't have time to argue, Susan.
L444588 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Daniel, just forget Argon.  Let's get out of here.  We'll find another way to stop the waste.
L444581 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ The same thing I suppose.
L444580 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ What would happen if I threw him into the core?
L444579 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Yes.
L444578 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ That means the nanobot is still inside him.
L444577 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ You mean he's polymerized, like me?
L444576 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ It's too late.  Argon injected it.
L444575 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ We've got to get the nanobot.
L444574 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Oh shit, the meltdown.  It's spread to the tower.
L444573 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ What in the...?
L444571 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ You don't have to say anything, Daniel.  I'm a scientist.  I know what's happening.  I recognize the classic symptoms.  Dizziness, shortness of breath, sweating palms... I can feel my adrenals secreting, my parasympathetic nervous system quivering, the estradiol coursing through my entire body...
L444570 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Susie... I...
L444569 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Did you think I could just leave you...?
L444568 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ You saved my life.
L444455 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ I'm not leaving without you, Susan!
L444454 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Run, Daniel!  Get out of here!
L444438 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Let's go.
L444437 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Argon's private lab.
L444436 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Where is it?
L444435 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Oh no!  Argon!  We have to stop him before he uses the nanobot!  We have to get the nanobot!
L444434 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ What could happen?  I'm the plastic man, remember?
L444433 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I didn't know what was going to happen.  I was just so worried something was going to happen to you.
L444432 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ You didn't think I could just leave you?
L444431 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I don't believe it.  You're here! Oh thank God.
L444274 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ You're not going back to jail.  All we need to do is find the nanobot. Once the meltdown is under control, then we deal with Argon --
