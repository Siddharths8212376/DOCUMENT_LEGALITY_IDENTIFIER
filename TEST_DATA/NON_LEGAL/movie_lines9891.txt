L262051 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I gotta see new comedians later, I've gotta--
L262049 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Very good.
L262048 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I got two minutes.
L262047 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Glad you could put in an appearance.
L262046 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I know...I know.
L262045 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Hi!  Hi!
L262581 +++$+++ u5751 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ I'd have been a great dope addict.
L262580 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ True.
L262579 +++$+++ u5751 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ No, Holly's game for anything. Holly takes after me.
L262578 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Now, Holly's not shy.
L262577 +++$+++ u5751 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't have your spark.  She knows it.  She worships you. She wouldn't dare get up there on the stage.
L262576 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ I just had a lot of luck...from my first show, you know?  I've always thought Lee was the one destined for great things.
L262571 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Yeah, I know, Mom. NORMA  But I, I knew that he'd get up there and he'd flounder around with his expensive haircuts and hairdos and clothes.  He's all show!  Now how can you act when there's nothing inside to come out?!
L262570 +++$+++ u5751 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen test.
L262569 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Okay, okay.
L262568 +++$+++ u5751 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ He's the one that's made every ingenue in stock!
L262567 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Okay, stop being so dramatic.
L262566 +++$+++ u5751 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ The sacrifices I've made because of that man.  He's ruined me with his ego, his philandering, his--  his-his-his-his mediocrity!
L262565 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ You promised to stay on the wagon.
L262564 +++$+++ u5751 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ No!  I like to joke around and have fun, and he gets angry because I get the attention.  He's gotten sourer as he's gotten older, and I've tried to stay young...at heart.
L262563 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Here, Mom.  Drink this.  You know, you're awful.  You probably were flirting.
L261944 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ ...from Mavis, also.
L261943 +++$+++ u5751 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Hey!
L263037 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ No, he hasn't.  If I offended you, I'm sorry.
L263036 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you.
L263035 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ That's the point.  I'd like to be bothered.
L263034 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.
L263033 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Well, why don't you share them with us?
L263032 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Yeah, we're having some problems, but problems that are my business...which I don't see how you could know about in such detail. How does Lee know about these things?  How?  They're private!
L263031 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Y-you mentioned to me yourself that you and Elliot were having some problems.
L263030 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Oh, wow!  I don't want to have this conversation.  I didn't do anything wrong.
L263029 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ You're grateful, but you resent me.
L263028 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know.  Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. "You're so giving. It's not a criticism.  We love you. We're grateful."
L263027 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something.  You think I'm too self-sufficient?
L263026 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Wow, I guess I hit a nerve.
L263021 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Can I, can I not accept gestures and feelings from people?  Do I, do I put people off?
L263020 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Well--
L263019 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ No, not "Oh, so loosely"!  Real specifically!  Is that how you see us?
L263018 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Oh, so loosely.
L263017 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ It's obviously based on Elliot and me.
L263016 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ My script?
L263015 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ I'm real upset about what you wrote.
L263014 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Hey, what's the matter?
L262977 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Take...take a year.  Take six months.  Whatever you want.  Who knows?  Maybe you'll, maybe you'll be sitting with a good play.
L262976 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Good.
L262975 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Write!  Let's just not talk about it anymore.
L262974 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ What's the matter?
L262973 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Look.  Listen.  Listen.  You want to write?  Write.
L262972 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ What's the matter with you, Lee? Why are you so sensitive all of a sudden?
L262966 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Hey, Hannah, I know I'm mediocre.
L262965 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ You're crazy!  That's not true.
L262964 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ You know, I could always tell what you thought of me by the type of men you fixed me up with!
L262963 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ You're too demanding.
L262962 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Uh, losers!  All losers!
L262961 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially.  I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men.  There's nothing I would--
L262960 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Hmm!
L262959 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Not so!  No.  I think I've been very supportive.  I've...I try to give you honest, constructive advice.
L262958 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ You never have any faith in my plans.  You always undercut my enthusiasm.
L262957 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ How?
L262956 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ You treat me like a loser.
L262949 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Yeah, you mean not at my age.
L262948 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ I'm not!  I'm not!  I'm trying to be helpful.  A person doesn't just say one day, "Okay, now-now I'm finished as an actress.  Now I'm a writer."  I mean--
L262947 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Boy, I knew you'd be discouraging.
L262946 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ No.  She, didn't she say it was, um...she said it was in the publicity department.  That-that can lead to other things.
L262945 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Yeah, that's clerical.
L262944 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Well, I don't know.  We'd uh, uh, um... Didn't Mom mention there was something...something at the Museum of Broadcasting?
L262943 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Well-well, like what?
L262942 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Well, that-that's good.  It just, uh...it just seems to me that-that six months or a year, if-if you spent it more productively...
L262940 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ But what I decided to do is some writing.  Yeah, I think I've had it with acting.  You know, these meaningless auditions at cattle calls.  And I can't handle another rejection.  Now let's face it here.  I gotta, you know, latch on to something in my life.  You know--something with a future.  I'm not sixteen anymore.  It's just...crazy!  I've got...an idea for a story. More than one.  And I just need a few months, you know, or, uh, a year even.
L262939 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Well, that...th-that's fine.
L262938 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Yeah, although it's put an end to the Stanislavski Catering Company. Which is why I have to speak to you. And...  you're gonna get impatient, but...I have to borrow some more money. 
L262937 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Oh, God...
L262932 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ You got it.
L262931 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Oh, gosh.
L262928 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Oh, what do they know?
L262927 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
L262926 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Boy--
L262925 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ So what's new?
L262924 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Awwww...
L262921 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Well, I just came from an audition...
L262920 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Hey, hi!
L262831 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Look, everything's going your way.
L262830 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Nobody but you can do that to me. I don't know why.
L262828 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Tch, well, I sing!  For Chrissake, Hannah, you heard me sing!
L262827 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?
L262826 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Boy, you really know how to cut me down.
L262825 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ I hope.
L262824 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Yeah.  Well, maybe I'll get it. 
L262823 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ ...every, eh, single rejection as- as-as a...a confirmation that you have no talent, or something?
L262822 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Yeah.
L262821 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ No, I didn't, I, that's no.  No, I- I-I, no, I-I just...  hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know.  You know, you know how you take...
L262820 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ W-why?  You don't think it's realistic?
L262819 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Easily.
L262818 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L262817 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Uh, you know, I think I can fake my way through a song.
L262816 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ No, I'm sorry.  No, I didn't mean that.  No, I didn't mean that.
L262815 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I--
L262814 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ I know, no--  I know.
L262813 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ You know.
L262812 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Ohh!
L262810 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ No!  No, I, eh, it's just that they sing.
L262809 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Well, you think everybody in m- musicals sings so well?
L262808 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Well, no...I-I know, I just, uh... No, I-I, eh, you know, I, I didn't, I didn't know you sung.
L262807 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Well, I mean, why not?  You know, wh-what have I got to lose?  Uh...
L262806 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Really?
L262805 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Yeah, can you believe it?
L262804 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Singing?
L262803 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ I've got a singing audition for a Broadway musical.  Of course, I'll never get it.
L262802 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Well, I think he was dying to open up.  It's so sad.  Now...what should I wear to my audition?
L262801 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ You found all this, all this out on one date?
L262800 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ ...he's really paid his dues, but...then she helped put him through architecture school, you know, so...
L262799 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Oh?
L262798 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ ...and then she just breaks down.  And he has this sweet daughter...and when she goes to college next year, he's going to split permanently.  I mean...
L262797 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Oooo.
L262796 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Sometimes she's terrific...
L262795 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Oh-oh. HOLLY  ...and his wife's, uh, in and out of institutions.  She's schizophrenic.
L262794 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ He's married...
L262791 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Oh, yeah. 
L262790 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Well, I, I really like that.  I think that's a pretty color on you.
L262789 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Well, how about this?
L262788 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ You know, I just want to look so good, but I don't want to seem, you know, like I'm overdressed.  You know what I'm saying? HANNAH  Oh, no, not at all.
L261901 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Oh!
L261900 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Ouch!
L261899 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Maybe at Christmas, New Year's.  If not this New Year's, maybe next New Year's.
L261898 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Here.  Be careful with those.
L261897 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Not this Thanksgiving, you know.
L261875 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Oh, perfect!  He reminds me of Ichabod Crane.  His Adam's apple keeps jumping up and down whenever he gets excited. HANNAH  Listen.  He's a lot better than your ex-husband.  He's got a good job.  Would you light those, please? He's-he's-he's not a dope addict or anything.
L261874 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.
L261873 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Oh, he's such a loser!
L261872 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ He's not a loser at all!
L261871 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ He's such a loser!
L261870 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ It's, uh, you never know--
L261869 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Oh, Hannah!
L261865 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Oh, your kids are so adorable.
L261864 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Watch out, you guys.  Beep-beep!
L261862 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Tch.  He's such an angry...he's such a depressive.  I thought she was moving out!
L261861 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ When does Frederick ever come with her?
L261860 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Frederick didn't come with her.
L261854 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ I should get a garter belt.
L261853 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Maybe when she's eighty, she'll stop straightening her garter belt when there's a guy around.
L261850 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ She really does, though.
L261849 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Don't you think she does?
L261847 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Yeah.
L261846 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Doesn't she look great in that new dress?
L261841 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Uh-oh.
L261840 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Ohh?
L261831 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ I swear.  I swear.  We've already got some requests to do a few dinner parties.
L261830 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Are we talking about cocaine again?
L261829 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Okay.
L261828 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Will you just tell me one thing?
L261827 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Well, in order to get started, there's just a few things I have to buy...  and some old debts I have outstanding.
L261826 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Yeah.
L261825 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ You admit that we're great cooks, right?
L261824 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Hannah, I know it's a lot, but my friend April and I, we have this catering idea I think's going to be great.
L261823 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L261822 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Two thousand dollars.
L261821 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ I know.  H-how much do you need?
L261820 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Someday, I'll pay it all back.
L261819 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Holly, please.  Don't insult me.
L261818 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ This is the last time, I promise. And I'm keeping strict accounts.
L261817 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
L261816 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Hannah, I have to borrow some more money.  Don't get upset.
L261814 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Oh, sure.
L261813 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Get outta here.  Could I speak to you privately?
L261808 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Mmm...I mean, we love to cook for our friends, so  we thought until an acting job comes through, we could just make some extra money, you know, doing a few private parties.
L261807 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ Perfect!
L261806 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ No, no, we decided!
L261805 +++$+++ u5746 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HANNAH +++$+++ What?  You're kidding!
L263263 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ I'm pregnant.
L263262 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Mmm, what?
L263261 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Mickey?
L263260 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I don't know how you're gonna top that.
L263259 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Tch.
L263258 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ You know, I was talking with your father before...and I was telling him that  it's ironic.  I-I used to always have Thanksgiving with Hannah...and I never thought  that I could love anybody else.  And here it is, years later and I'm married to you  and completely in love with you.  The heart is a very, very resilient little muscle.  It really is.  I...  It'd made a great story, I think. A guy marries one sister...  doesn't work out...  many years later...  he winds up  married to the other sister.  It's, you know, it's a...
L263257 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Thanks.

L263250 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Now don't get nervous.  It's just your husband.
L263222 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Yeah.
L263221 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Do you?  I mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening?
L263220 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Sure.  Sure, uh, yes.
L263219 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ So, so you want to go out to dinner again?  I mean, is that, is that... Have, you have any interest in that, or...
L263218 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I was the, I was... You know, it was my fault.  I-- 
L263217 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ It's all right.
L263216 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Oh, don't be silly!  No!  Don't be ridiculous.
L263215 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ That I've always regretted the way I behaved that evening we went out, and, uh...I've, I just thought I'd tell you that because I really made a fool out of myself.
L263214 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Oh, yeah?  What?
L263213 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Um...look, there's something I've, uh, that's been bothering me for a long time, and I just thought I'd just tell you what it was and just sort of clear the deck here, and  that's this.
L263192 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Well...  I'll tell you.  One day about a month ago...
L263191 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Gosh, you really went through a crisis, you know that?  H-how did you get over it?  I mean, when I ran into you, you seemed, you seemed just perfectly fine.  Well, you seem fine now.
L263190 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Y-you used to-- Oh, no!  Yeah, I care.  You used to be so ambitious and...  God, you really liked it?!
L263189 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Oh, who cares?
L263188 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Okay, and listen, I would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life.
L263187 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I-I would love to talk to you about, uh, that script.  I-I, you know, I think maybe that we could do something with it.
L263186 +++$+++ u5747 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Uh, gee.  Would you like to have lunch?  Uh, uh...
L263185 +++$+++ u5750 +++$+++ m380 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ It was just great.  Uh, I was all set...I was set to be bored stiff.
