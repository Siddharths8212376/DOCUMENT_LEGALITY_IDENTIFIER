L273936 +++$+++ u1291 +++$+++ m86 +++$+++ BROOM +++$+++ There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
L273935 +++$+++ u1298 +++$+++ m86 +++$+++ MATLIN +++$+++ Do you believe in hell?
L273932 +++$+++ u1291 +++$+++ m86 +++$+++ BROOM +++$+++ No. It's not.

L274140 +++$+++ u1297 +++$+++ m86 +++$+++ MANNING +++$+++ Your "guest" happens to be six foot five, bright red, and is government funded.
L274139 +++$+++ u1291 +++$+++ m86 +++$+++ BROOM +++$+++ Tom -- he's our guest, not a prisoner.
L274138 +++$+++ u1297 +++$+++ m86 +++$+++ MANNING +++$+++ I do.  How many escapes?  This year alone: five!
L274137 +++$+++ u1291 +++$+++ m86 +++$+++ BROOM +++$+++ I thought you liked being on TV.
L274136 +++$+++ u1297 +++$+++ m86 +++$+++ MANNING +++$+++ Every time the media get a look at him, they come to me. I'm running out of lies, Trevor.

L274234 +++$+++ u1291 +++$+++ m86 +++$+++ BROOM +++$+++ It's her choice --  She's human --
L274233 +++$+++ u1291 +++$+++ m86 +++$+++ BROOM +++$+++ That's not how she feels. She may never feel it.
L274232 +++$+++ u1294 +++$+++ m86 +++$+++ HELLBOY +++$+++ How many buildings does she have to burn? She belongs here!
L274205 +++$+++ u1294 +++$+++ m86 +++$+++ HELLBOY +++$+++ Is it bad?

L274212 +++$+++ u1299 +++$+++ m86 +++$+++ MYERS +++$+++ I'm in way over my head, I know that much.
