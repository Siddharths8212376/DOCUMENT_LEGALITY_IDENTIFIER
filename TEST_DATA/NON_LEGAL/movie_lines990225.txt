L456372 +++$+++ u7216 +++$+++ m486 +++$+++ MIA +++$+++ No.  I didn't.   I'm listening.
L456369 +++$+++ u7216 +++$+++ m486 +++$+++ MIA +++$+++ Like now?
L456368 +++$+++ u7217 +++$+++ m486 +++$+++ PENTCHO +++$+++ That's what it asked me.  "What do you want?"  I didn't answer.  I was in the middle of an experiment.
L456367 +++$+++ u7216 +++$+++ m486 +++$+++ MIA +++$+++ What did it want?
L456362 +++$+++ u7217 +++$+++ m486 +++$+++ PENTCHO +++$+++ God.  I dunno.  The eternal nothingness. Mia.
L456361 +++$+++ u7216 +++$+++ m486 +++$+++ MIA +++$+++ Of what?

L456325 +++$+++ u7217 +++$+++ m486 +++$+++ PENTCHO +++$+++ I've been dreaming about you.
L460182 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I said she isn't here. NOW you go home. Be a nice boy and go home.
L460181 +++$+++ u7218 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Where is she?
L460180 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ She isn't here. And I'm sorry, but Mr. Hillyer doesn't want her to have callers during working hours.
L460179 +++$+++ u7218 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Well, I got to see her.
L460178 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ She must have gone out for a walk with the children.
L460177 +++$+++ u7218 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Is Rose here?
L460176 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Yes?
L460057 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ This isn't punishment, I don't believe in punishment. It's for your health. Obviously you're sick if you can act like that.
L460056 +++$+++ u7219 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BROTHER +++$+++ Oh, Mother, not the castor oil.
L460055 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I don't think you are sufficiently in awe of it. Get the castor oil.
L460054 +++$+++ u7219 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BROTHER +++$+++ I am in awe of it, Mother.
L460053 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it.
L460052 +++$+++ u7219 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BROTHER +++$+++ I know, Mother.
L460051 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Sex isn't ugly, sex is one of the most beautiful things in life, the creative power of the universe is behind it.
L460050 +++$+++ u7219 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BROTHER +++$+++ They're filthy, Mother.
L460597 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Buddy, sex don't mean a thing to me. It ain't nothin' but a mosquito bite.  I'll tell you a secret. Girls don't want sex, Buddy, girls want love.
L460596 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Maybe it was eating all those rabbits that made you sexy, Rose.
L460595 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ A saint just like your own mother. She's up in heaven right now, her and Lunette, there ain't no doubt about it.
L460594 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ What was your mother like?
L460593 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Boy did I get sick of rabbit. But later on after Momma died and Daddy wasn't doin' nothin' but drinkin', I sure would of been glad for a little rabbit stew. You know, I oughtn't to of told you about what Daddy done when I was a child. Until them rabbits ruined him, he was a real good man, Buddy.
L460592 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Well, that doctor said you got protein somewhere and I guess he was right.
L460591 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ He thought he could sell 'em, but nobody but country folks eat rabbits, Buddy, and they ain't got no money. We had to eat them dern rabbits our own selves. Every dern one, and it took about four years to eat 'em all up.
L460590 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ How did the rabbits kill him?
L460589 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yep, we had 'em in orange crates all over. It was Daddy's dream. He was goin' to get rich raisin' rabbits. It was what killed Daddy. He didn't drown hisself till a long time later after Momma and Lunette died of typhoid, but it was them rabbits what killed him.
L460588 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Five hundred rabbits?
L460587 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Did you know when I was a child we had pretty near five hundred rabbits?
L460586 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ They're dumb things. I got tired of them.
L460585 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I guess I'll work as a waitress, Buddy. I done that before and it got me in worse trouble than you could know, but I can't stay here no more. Why did you get rid of your rabbits, Buddy?
L460584 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Take a little walk with me, huh?
L460583 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ What are you going to do, Rose?
L460582 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Makin' homes for purple martins, huh? We had 'em on the farm. They're the prettiest things. That's what I wish I was, a bird. Just fly around catch bugs and have a lot of fun.
L460581 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Okay.
L460580 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Hi, Buddy.  How's my sweetheart who never told on me when I was bad?
L460524 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I don't want to know...
L460523 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ I gotta find out what they're saying. You lie back and rest, Rose, and I'll give you a report on it.
L460509 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Buddy, I'm scared, I'm scared!
L460508 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ You won't die, Rose.
L460507 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Oh, Buddy, they're gonna cut me all up! They're gonna cut my stummick all open, I'll die!
L460361 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I ain't neither. Listen here, Buddy, besides all his vast medical knowledge, he has the most kindest heart beneath the professor way he acts -- he wants justice in the world and he's got some real interestin' ideas.
L460360 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Rose, you are just entirely too uncritical of people.
L460359 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Well, I like him. I used to be afraid of doctors but not any more. Why, he could operate on me any old time and I wouldn't even be scared.
L460358 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Yeah, I'd believe it.
L460357 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ He's got doubts about hisself and that's the saddest thing of all. Would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him?
L460356 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.
L460355 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, "You know, you are beautiful." Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more?
L460354 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ He did?
L460353 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You don't know the bedside manner that man has got. Why, it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin' in his bag like he's gonna cure me, which he did of course. And even more important he loves me, like a patient I mean, the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin' to my heart beat.
L460352 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Rose, you are too uncritical of people.
L460351 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Oh, he's so kind, so gentle inside, and so unhappy with that rich wife who doesn't understand him, her being a Southerner and everything, and what a bedside manner he has got -- so gentle and kind beneath the professor way he acts!
L460210 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ But I don't know who they are.
L460209 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Rose, if you don't keep your boyfriends away from the house, Daddy is going to fire you.
L460208 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I got an awful toothache.
L460172 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Well, he might be that man who followed me home from the store the other day. But I don't know who he is, Buddy, I really don't.
L460171 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Rose, you must know who the fellow is.
L460116 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You're my sweetheart.
L460115 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Yeah.
L460114 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Did your Momma really give you castor oil?
L460079 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I have a knack for designing clothes. But I had to buy the shoes and the pocketbook.
L460078 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Here comes Daddy.
L460046 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Buddy, Mr. Right is out there somewhere and I'm gonna find him!
L460045 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ You're going to get yourself up and go out?
L460044 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Well, Ill tell you this. I have learned a lesson tonight. I wasn't gonna run around, but when I start botherin' your Daddy and worse robbin' a cradle, I gotta face the facts of life.  Tomorrow mornin', I'm gonna get myself up and go out.
L460042 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Oh, Buddy, you do love me! I knew you did, knew it all the time...
L460041 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Rose, they could stick splinters under my fingernails, and I will never say a word! I will never tell them, because... I love you!
L460038 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Buddy, I have to ask you, as bad as I've been please have pity on me and don't ruin me by telling them what I did. I know it was bad, it was bad and dumb. But mostly it was dumb, I didn't mean you no harm, I'd never want to hurt a hair on your head and that's the truth. I love you. But they'd think I did, they'd think I was awful, they'd despise me and hate me...
L460037 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ I said I wouldn't.
L460036 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I hate to turn on this light, you Daddy's awake downstairs, but I have to take the chance.  Buddy, please don't tell on me.
L460022 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Good night, Rose.
L460021 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I sure hope you don't.  I gotta get outta here, good night.
L460020 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a soul.
L460019 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Buddy, you wouldn't tell nobody, would you?
L460018 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ No. No, I'm all right.  Oh, God, what have I done? I have robbed a cradle and fallen into hell!  I must be crazy, a child like you. Oh, God, oh, Lord. This is awful, this is terrible, I gotta get outta here!
L460017 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Rose, are you all right? Are you sick or something?
L460013 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You wouldn't understand.  Oh, God, I must be outta my mind. What would your Momma think?
L460012 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ But why, if I'm not hurting you?
L460011 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ No. No, you're not hurting me.  But I think you better quit it.
L460010 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Am I hurting you?
L460009 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I must be outta my mind. Buddy, quit it.
L460008 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ But Rose...
L460007 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You better quit that.
L460003 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Well, nothin'.
L460002 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ I'm thirteen. And I have a natural curiosity. It's only nature, Rose, that's all. Now what's wrong with nature, huh?
L460001 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Buddy, you're just a child.
L460000 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good sport.
L459999 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me.
L459998 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Please, Rose. I'm curious, that's all, I have a natural curiosity, it's only human. You're my friend, aren't you? Don't you like me?  I like you, Rose, a lot -- in fact, I love you.
L459997 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Of course you can't! I'm... I'm shocked at you, Buddy, real shocked! Now you be quiet or I'm going back to my own bed!
L459996 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Can't I touch it a little, Rose -- not a lot, just a little?
L459995 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ No! You ought to be ashamed of yourself astin' such a nasty things a child your age!
L459994 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Yeah, but satisfaction brought him back. Can I?
L459993 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Well, now that is just too bad! Curiosity killed the cat.
L459992 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ I'm curious to see what it's like. I'm very curious, Rose.
L459991 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Why, Buddy, shut your mouth! What an awful thing to say, and where did you get any such idea as that, anyhow?
L459990 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Rose, since you're here in bed with me and everything and I've already touched your titty...
L459989 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Most men wouldn't do what he done. If they can get a girl they go right ahead and get her -- I guess to hell they do, just like a dern rabbit. 'Course later they'll tell her she's no good when they done the same thing their selves. They're a bunch of monkeys. I like 'em, but they're a bunch of monkeys.
L459988 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Rose, I have a serious favor to ask you.
L459987 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ There ain't none in your Daddy. You know, what happened has just made me love him all the more. I not only love him, I respect him, I admire him.
L459986 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ There's an evil streak in everybody, Rose.
L459985 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You know, Buddy, sometimes I can't figure you out at all. You can be very nice, but like your mother said there's an evil streak in you.
L459984 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Well, some fiend might.
L459983 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Who would want to do such a thing as that?
L459982 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ It was softer'n I thought, that was my main impression. You know, if you hit a girl there it would hurt her a lot.
L459981 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Don't mention it.
L459980 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ That was very interesting. Thank you, Rose.
L459979 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ All right, that's enough.  You're just a child and wouldn't understand it, but that type of thing can stir a girl up. Now lie back and we'll talk.
L459978 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ First I couldn't feel it, but now I feel it easily, it's like a little acorn.
L459977 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ 'Course it does.
L459976 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right.
L459975 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Well, are you satisfied now? Can we just lie and talk, huh?
L459974 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Aw, be a good sport, Rose.  You like me, don't you? I like you a lot.
L459973 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You don' t need to know that. It's none of your business.
L459972 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Aw, come on, Rose, I want to see what the nipple on it is like.
L459971 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice.
L459970 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Just for a second. Please, Rose, what's the harm?
L459968 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ But I'm curious, Rose.
L459967 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Buddy, what's come over you? A child like you, askin' such things.
L459966 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Rose, can't I see what the nipple on it is like?
L459965 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ No, you can't. And I'll tell you this -- he scares me. As kind as he is, he scares me. You can't fool around with him, not with that man. And, boy, I sure better not try nothin' like that with him again, he'll fire me.
L459964 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Can I put my hand inside your nightgown, Rose?
L459963 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You know, that Daddy of yours is the funniest man, the things he says, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth next.
L459962 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Actually, I am, though.
L459961 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Buddy, quit that, you're just a child, you're not supposed to be interested in such things.
L459960 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ There's some kind of gristle in it, though.
L459959 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.
L459958 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.
L459957 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ What did you expect?
L459956 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Hmmm, it's soft. It's awful soft.
L459954 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I fell madly in love with him when he called me Rosebud. You know that first day when I come and he said I looked graceful like a capital letter S and called me Rosebud? I fell madly in love with that man right then.  But it's a lost love, Buddy. He's a good man and won't have nothin' to do with me.
L459953 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ But, Rose, how could such a thing as that happen?
L459952 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Promise not to tell Doll? -- or nobody? Buddy, it's your Daddy! I'm so much in love with him I am out of my mind!
L459951 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ But, Rose, what is the cause of it all?
L459950 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Why, it has just made me ill, Buddy. I'm sick. I don't want to eat nothin', I don't, and me I got a good appetite, that ain't nat'ral for me. I'm ill.
L459949 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ You were pretty bad, huh?
L459948 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Buddy, I was horrible. I can't tell you who it was, but do you know what I did? I sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know, a child like you. Why, I let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and I let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers...  But to get back serious to what I was sayin', it is not only, Buddy, the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so...
L459947 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ What'd you do, Rose?
L459946 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ It's so terrible I can't tell you. Oh, Buddy, you don't know how it hurts to have a broken heart, what a terrible feeling it is, and I've had a broken heart so many times. Men, I don't understand them, I can't figure them out and they break my heart, that's all. I can't find Mr. Right, Buddy, I can't find him no matter how hard I look, all I find is a whole pile of Mr. Wrongs. But this is the worst ever because it wasn't his fault. It was my fault, oh yes, my fault, I was bad -- oh God, I was bad, you wouldn't believe how bad I was.
L459945 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ What is it, Rose?
L459944 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I thought I'd go crazy back there in that room all by myself with nobody to talk to. As a child, I never had no room all to myself, we were awful poor. Buddy... I have got a confession to make.
L459943 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Well, all right.
L459942 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Buddy, I am wandering in a wilderness, lost.  I just feel awful. Do you mind if I get in bed with you for a little while?
L459941 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ No, I'm awake. What's the matter?
L459820 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Buddy, you are in one of your evil moods, I don't want to talk to you. I'm going out and sweep the patio.
L459819 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Well, it's only the truth. There are horrible things in the world, Rose.
L459818 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I don't hear you. I just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away.
L459817 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ He really did, he ate his little niece. He made pork chops out of her.
L459816 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I didn't hear you. I didn't hear that.
L459815 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ There was this old man that ate his niece.
L459814 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ What terrible thing in Cave Springs?
L459813 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Hey, Rose, did you hear about that terrible thing down in Cave Springs?
L459812 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Your Daddy is a wonderful man, I'll say that. He's the best and most kind-hearted man in the world.
L459811 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Was that what they tried to do? Was that why Daddy gave you the job, to save you from those scoundrels?
L459809 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Did they try to induce you to become a prostitute?
L459808 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no sense to it.
L459807 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ In what sense were they bad?
L459806 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ They were just bad men, that's all.
L459805 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ But who were they?
L459804 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Nobody.
L459803 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Rose, who were those scoundrels in Birmingham?
L459775 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Sure. Let me take your suitcase.
L459774 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Buddy. Well, now, that's a nice name, I like it. I am real pleased to meet you.  Hey, look, do you think you got a cold drink of ice water somewhere?
L459773 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Lots of things. Buddy, mostly.
L460321 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
L460320 +++$+++ u7228 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WASKI +++$+++ Of course not!
L460070 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Quiet, you little muddy-eyed brat, or Ill kill you!
L460069 +++$+++ u7228 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WASKI +++$+++ He did lie, and... and... and Mother, yesterday he stole money out of your pocketbook!
L459878 +++$+++ u7228 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WASKI +++$+++ Rose is madly in love with Daddy...
L459877 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ All right, what do you know?
L459876 +++$+++ u7228 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WASKI +++$+++ I do, too!
L459875 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Oh, Waski, you don't know anything.
L459874 +++$+++ u7228 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WASKI +++$+++ Yeah, I know.
