L6512 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ We're all like that.
L6511 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother.  Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church.
L6508 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ Okay.
L6507 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time.  Maybe we can finish tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow...
L6504 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Of course.
L6503 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ People remember me from the news.  Can you drive me back now?
L6502 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ No one knows what it's like.  You can't even imagine how much it hurts.
L6501 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I had to ask.  I apologize.
L6500 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.
L6499 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I didn't mean to...
L6498 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
L6497 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
L6496 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ It got to be too much for him.
L6495 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Why do you think he did it?
L6494 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
L6493 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
L6492 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ Yes.
L6491 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide?
L6490 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ I don't know.
L6489 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ What was she running from?
L6488 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.
L6487 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ She just seemed... depressed... ?
L6486 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ No.
L6485 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ So, she didn't leave a note?  She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?
L6483 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her.
L6482 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV.
L6481 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ That's exactly what I am.
L6480 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?
L6479 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations.  It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts.  All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope.
L6477 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Well, I'm following up on your daughter, Mary, height; five four, weight; hundred ten pounds, brown eyes, blonde hair.  Born April 24, 1976.  Missing June 11th, 1992.  A runaway, that's how she's listed. Is this information correct... ?
L6476 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ No.
L6475 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?
L6474 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ Neil... Neil Cole.
L6473 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...
L6472 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ These volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected, functioning hand in hand with law enforcement. The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review their investigations...  ... fact-check their records, see if there's anything they missed, anything they should be doing different.  I'm here for a few days, before I head back up to Virginia. These reports go to the Justice Department eventually.  I spoke to your F.B.I. contact a few days ago, uh...
L6471 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ Yes, but...
L6470 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?
L6469 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ I don't understand, who are... ?
L6468 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit.  If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter.
L6467 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...
L6466 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ Yes... ?
L6671 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I'll do what I can.
L6670 +++$+++ u111 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ NUN +++$+++ She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I adored her.  I supposed I always hoped she'd be back.  After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate?
L6669 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?
L6668 +++$+++ u111 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ NUN +++$+++ That's her suitcase.  I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.
L6667 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Her belongings?
L6666 +++$+++ u111 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ NUN +++$+++ Those are her belongings.
L6665 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ What is this?
L6662 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I'm trying to find out.  She was a runaway.  I'm looking into it for her parents.
L6661 +++$+++ u111 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ NUN +++$+++ Do you know what happened to her?
L6659 +++$+++ u111 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ NUN +++$+++ Yes.  I remember her.
L6658 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...
L6657 +++$+++ u111 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ NUN +++$+++ Yes... I remember Mary
L6360 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Certainly, Senator.  If I can ever be of further assistance.
L6359 +++$+++ u112 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ POLITICIAN +++$+++ Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
L6358 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...
L6357 +++$+++ u112 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ POLITICIAN +++$+++ He's an imbecile.  I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?
L6356 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ No, sir, he is not.
L6355 +++$+++ u112 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ POLITICIAN +++$+++ None too discreet, is he?
L6354 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Your son-in-law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day, saw that woman every night.  The specifics are in the report, and information about the woman.  It's unpleasant, I know.  I apologize...
L6684 +++$+++ u113 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ SALESPERSON +++$+++ Certainly, sir.
L6683 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you.
L6682 +++$+++ u113 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ SALESPERSON +++$+++ I'm required by state law to inform you that, while it's perfectly legal for you to purchase these items, it is illegal for you to use them for any sort of...
L6681 +++$+++ u113 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ SALESPERSON +++$+++ Okay.  Fine.
L6680 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ No, you may not.
L6679 +++$+++ u113 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ SALESPERSON +++$+++ Alright.  May I have your phone number, area code first?
L6678 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Cash.
L6677 +++$+++ u113 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ SALESPERSON +++$+++ Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
L6676 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Okay, I'll take it all.
L8208 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Then we'll stay up together.
L8207 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
L8206 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ We'll figure it out.
L8204 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I haven't slept much either.  Since Kristen...
L8203 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I can't go back to sleep again.
L8202 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Yeah, or turn you into toast.
L8201 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
L8200 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison?  This looks like Sheila's.
L8199 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I can't find him.
L8198 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
L8197 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ It was bad.
L8196 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I heard you screaming.  Was it a bad one?
L8156 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Kristen...
L8155 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ You alright?
L8097 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ What?
L8096 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Kincaid and Joey died last night.
L8095 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ What's wrong?
L8094 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Alice, you think you can leave?
L8037 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Never say can't.  Just do what I do.
L8036 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Rick...I can't.
L8035 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Look, you gotta stand up for yourself. Learn to fight back.
L8034 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
L8033 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.
L8032 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I don't want to.
L8031 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
L8030 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ What?
L8029 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?
L8101 +++$+++ u119 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ You'll hear all kinds of stories. They'll tell you it was murder, but it wasn't.
L8100 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Kristen, what happened?
L8063 +++$+++ u119 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ When I used to have nightmares.  I brought my friends in to help me.  Until they all started dying.
L8062 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ You what?
L8060 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ When they're all you have, you kinda become an expert.
L8059 +++$+++ u119 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ How'd you learn so much about dreams?
L8058 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I daydream.  you have to dream about some place fun.  Remember you're in control.
L8057 +++$+++ u119 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?
L8056 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
L8055 +++$+++ u119 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ Sounds like a game show host to me.
L8054 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ My mom taught me when I was little.  Did you ever hear of the dream master?
L8053 +++$+++ u119 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ You could do worse.
L8052 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad.
L8051 +++$+++ u119 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ Yeah, I'm not so sure.
L8050 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I'm sure they're around.
L8049 +++$+++ u119 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.
L8048 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Here you are.  Where were you this morning?  Rick's looking all over for you.
L8179 +++$+++ u122 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Saw who? I was up all night cramming for this physics test, and I was putting this little baby together.  Look...
L8178 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Then you saw him, too?
L8177 +++$+++ u122 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ That obvious, huh?
L8176 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ You've been up all night?
L8175 +++$+++ u122 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ What?
L8174 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ We have matching luggage.
L8173 +++$+++ u122 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.
L8087 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I know.
L8086 +++$+++ u122 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
L8085 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
L8084 +++$+++ u122 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.
L8083 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ You in a hurry?
L8324 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Save it for later.  Come on!
L8323 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ You look great!
L8295 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Debbie.  She's gone.  I've...collected her, like the others.
L8294 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ What the hell was that?
L8290 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Something's wrong here.  It feels like...
L8289 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Here we are.
L8288 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ You know, I get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before.
L8287 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ He's going after Debbie.  I gotta stop him.
L8278 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ It's okay, we're just about there.
L8277 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ As long as your driving doesn't kill us.
L8276 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Cut that shit out.  Maybe before, but not now. I want to help you. I'm on your side.
L8275 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ You just feel sorry for me.
L8274 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
L8273 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.
L8255 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Who?
L8254 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
L8253 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Then what else can we do?
L8252 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't.
L8251 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
L8250 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ You don't really get it.  He's not a nightstalker.  It'll take more than bench presses to beat him.
L8248 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I don't think so.  I guess this is my own war.
L8247 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Is there something we can do?
L8246 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Not really.
L8218 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy.  Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me.  Someone to bring them to him.
L8217 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?
L8216 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Three days.
L8215 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ How long have you been awake?
L8214 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
L8213 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.
L8212 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Look, you know why, you just don't believe me.
L8211 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Extra money, huh?
L8210 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I've been working double shifts.
L8190 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Kristen's story really got to her.
L8189 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ No, don't!  I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!
L8166 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ "In her dream"?
L8165 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I was there in the dream.  He took her. It was awful.  It was awful...
L8162 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ It was no suicide.  It was not an accident.  It was Freddy, and he's coming back for seconds, thirds, and fourths.
L8161 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ I thought it was an accident.  Smoking in bed.
L8080 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I know.  Uh...Alice.
L8079 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
L8078 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
L8077 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ You're his sister, right?
L8076 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ No...
L8187 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I saw it. It was my dream.  I brought Sheila in...
L8186 +++$+++ u117 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Enough of that crap.
L8185 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ It was Freddy.
L8184 +++$+++ u117 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor.
L8092 +++$+++ u117 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.
L8091 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.
L7996 +++$+++ u117 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DEBBIE +++$+++ Alright, I think I see salvation...
L7995 +++$+++ u115 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Rick, please.
L8229 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ What else?  You ever look over this town's history?  Not a safe place to be a teenager.  Anyway, if I'm next, watch your back.
L8228 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ About Freddy?
L8227 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
L8226 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ How she doing?  I ran into her last night.
L8225 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Been up with Alice.
L8159 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ She knew she was gonna die.
L8158 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Hey man, we're all sorry...
L8126 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Now it gets weird.  She says he comes back in dreams.  If he kills you there, you're dead for real.
L8125 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ Nice neighborhood.
L8124 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
L8123 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ So?
L8122 +++$+++ u121 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
L8121 +++$+++ u116 +++$+++ m7 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ So what's up?  What'd I miss?
