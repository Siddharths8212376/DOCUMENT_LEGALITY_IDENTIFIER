They'll make you any kind of uniform, any kind of sweatsuit you want.  Judas Iscariot--he's got this black jacket with a skull and crossbones over the heart.

I like his sense of humor, though--you know? He's got a blue-and-gold warm-up jacket he wears.  You know what it says on the back? "Pontius Pilate Athletic Club." Most people don't get it.  Most people think there really is a Pontius Pilate Athletic Club.
L267993 +++$+++ u1247 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ WANDA JUNE +++$+++ Walt Disney, who gave us Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, plays shuffleboard.  Jesus Christ plays shuffleboard.

L269547 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ No.
L269546 +++$+++ u1249 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ BEATRICE +++$+++ Hello. My name is Beatrice. Have you been here before?
L269686 +++$+++ u1250 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ BLACK STUD +++$+++ Shit! You just don't want to hire a nigger, that's all. I knew this was a scam. I shouldn'ta come.
L269685 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I'm sorry, Mr. Brown. I'm sure you're very good, but at the moment, I've got nothing for you. If something comes up, we'll give you a call.

L269683 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ No, just not the type.
L269682 +++$+++ u1250 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ BLACK STUD +++$+++ You mean I'm black?
L269681 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You're not exactly the type we're looking for.
L269402 +++$+++ u1251 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ BURROWS +++$+++ Two officers have been assigned to the case. I can't keep them on indefinitely, but we'll go through every lead.

L269400 +++$+++ u1251 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ BURROWS +++$+++ I said I hope she's a runaway. Better that than she just disappears like so many others do. Sometimes they turn up years later, sometimes not. A lot of crimes go unreported, unknown. These are realities.
L269399 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ There's something wrong here. Kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave.
L269398 +++$+++ u1251 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ BURROWS +++$+++ There's no evidence of any foul play at present. I hope she's just a runaway.
L269397 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ But is she, has...
L269396 +++$+++ u1251 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ BURROWS +++$+++ The boy your daughter was talking to didn't work at the park. We've interviewed everybody there.
L269855 +++$+++ u1251 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ BURROWS +++$+++ Keep me informed of what he's up to. You help me, I'll help you.
L269854 +++$+++ u1261 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ MAST +++$+++ Big threat. TV would ream you.

L269852 +++$+++ u1261 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ MAST +++$+++ If he has anything to say about it, yeah. I've been asking a lot of questions and I don't like the answers I'm getting. He's made a lot of people nervous, including some poor faggot who thought he was going to be a movie star.
L269851 +++$+++ u1251 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ BURROWS +++$+++ I heard you the first time. We had nothing to go on with this kid. Just a runaway.  Do you really think he's in danger?
L269850 +++$+++ u1261 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ MAST +++$+++ You're going to thank me for this. You know what the media's like. They love this kinda shit. If that guy goes off half-cocked and gets himself hurt, you're going to have so much bad publicity, you...
L269849 +++$+++ u1251 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ BURROWS +++$+++ Apparently your friend has gone into Mexico. A Border Guard responded to the APB. How does it feel to have the L.A.P.D. doing your work for you?
L269605 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Where is he? Where's the bastard that runs this shit hole?

L269603 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Who is it? That blond guy? Where is he? I'm going to talk to someone.
L269602 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I'm getting angry. I want some answers.  Where's the guy who runs this place?
L269601 +++$+++ u1252 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ FELICE +++$+++ Wait a minute, that's going to cost you more than forty bucks.
L269600 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I'm getting angry.
L269599 +++$+++ u1252 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ FELICE +++$+++ Look, I don't know anybody. I never seen her before.
L269598 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ ...about this woman.  I'm trying to find her. Do you know her?
L269597 +++$+++ u1252 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ FELICE +++$+++ That's cool.
L269596 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I said I just wanted to talk to you...
L269595 +++$+++ u1252 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ FELICE +++$+++ Now, what do you want?
L269594 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I'll give you a tip. Here's forty dollars.
L269593 +++$+++ u1252 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ FELICE +++$+++ What do you want to tip me for? Look, you got to spell it out. Whatever you want, just say it.
L269592 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ What do you mean?
L269591 +++$+++ u1252 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ FELICE +++$+++ Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.
L269590 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You want a tip?
L269589 +++$+++ u1252 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ FELICE +++$+++ Look, that twenty dollars you just paid, I don't get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. I make all my money on tips.
L269588 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ What do you mean?
L269587 +++$+++ u1252 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ FELICE +++$+++ Are you going to stiff me?
L269586 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ No, Felice, I'm not a cop. In fact, right now I've got as little respect for the police as you do.  I'm looking for a girl. A runaway. I need someone to help me.
L269585 +++$+++ u1252 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ FELICE +++$+++ Cops aren't allowed to do that either. A judge ruled that that was entrapment. Don't ask me why. I guess he figured the sight of a Vice Officer's dong would make a girl unable to stop herself.
L269584 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ What?
L269583 +++$+++ u1252 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ FELICE +++$+++ Pull out your cock.
L269582 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Well, actually I wanted to ask about this girl. I have her picture here.
L269581 +++$+++ u1252 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ FELICE +++$+++ I have to ask you that. If you were Vice you couldn't deny it. You ought to dress less square. You wouldn't get hassled so much. Here, let me help you get that tie off.
L269580 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ No, I don't.
L269579 +++$+++ u1252 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ FELICE +++$+++ You're not Vice, are you?  Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
L269578 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ There's a girl I want to ask you about.
L269577 +++$+++ u1252 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ FELICE +++$+++ Sit down. Make yourself comfortable. My name's Felice.
L269576 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Well, I want to...
L269575 +++$+++ u1252 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ FELICE +++$+++ You're still dressed?
L269573 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You'll be fine.
L269572 +++$+++ u1252 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ FELICE +++$+++ Do you have any particular choice of girl?
L269571 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Okay. I'll take a half hour.
L269570 +++$+++ u1252 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ FELICE +++$+++ You may do that in the privacy of your room.
L269569 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I just want to ask some questions.
L269568 +++$+++ u1252 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ FELICE +++$+++ Do you want to take a session?
L269567 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Yeah.

L269352 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Are you sure it's all right?
L269351 +++$+++ u1260 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Okay, Mr. Van Dorn, I think we could knock that Pavonine blue a bit.
L269350 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Yeah.
L269349 +++$+++ u1260 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Overpowering?
L269348 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Yeah. He's a nice guy. Don't lose him. Maybe we could tone down this stripe a bit. It's a little...
L269347 +++$+++ u1260 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Sam?
L269346 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Are you still going with that fella that teaches at Grand Valley?
L269345 +++$+++ u1260 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Pavonine. It's the same tint as the stripe in the fabric.
L269344 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ What's that shade of blue called?
L269343 +++$+++ u1260 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Mr. Van Dorn, I've worked on the color scheme for weeks. I think it's just right.
L269342 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Yeah, overpowering. That was the word I was looking for.
L269341 +++$+++ u1260 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ No, that would be much too overpowering.
L269340 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ No, no. I wouldn't hire a display designer if I didn't trust her taste. Maybe we should bring in more of that shade. Perhaps a stripe across the back wall.
L269339 +++$+++ u1260 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Not really. But if you want me to tone it down...
L269338 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Don't you think it's a little too... bright?
L269337 +++$+++ u1260 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.
L269336 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ What do you think of this... ah, shade of blue, Mary.
L269335 +++$+++ u1260 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I tried to get more, but this is the limit. The De Vries line has the same area.
L269334 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Is this all the display space we can get?
L269980 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Where is he, Niki?
L269979 +++$+++ u1262 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ NIKI +++$+++ But then you'll forget about me.
L269978 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Listen, Niki. My daughter's been missing five months. I've gone through a lot to find out what's happened to her. I just saw a girl killed. I will not let Tod slip out of my hands. You have to tell me where he is.
L269977 +++$+++ u1262 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ NIKI +++$+++ I can't tell you that.
L269976 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Where is he?
L269975 +++$+++ u1262 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ NIKI +++$+++ What happened?
L269974 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Tod gave me the slip. I have to find him again. Where does he live?
L269973 +++$+++ u1262 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ NIKI +++$+++ Did you find out where she was?
L269914 +++$+++ u1262 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ NIKI +++$+++ So I guess we're both fucked, huh? But at least you get to go to heaven. I don't get shit.
L269913 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Look, Niki, this really isn't my business. I don't know anything about...
L269912 +++$+++ u1262 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ NIKI +++$+++ My man. 'Pimp.' I split 'cause he don't treat me for shit. Thinks he's so cool 'cause he's black. I once tried to take my clothes but he says, 'You can't take 'em 'cause they're my clothes -- I bought 'em.' Yeah, with my fucking money...
L269911 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Granville?
L269910 +++$+++ u1262 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ NIKI +++$+++ Don't get upset. I lied too. I don't make no five hundred dollars a week. Everything I make goes to Granville.
L269909 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I don't blame you, Niki. Really I don't. It's this culture, where everything's based on sex, sold on sex...  ...magazines, music, TV. It's destroying everything. Buy this 'cause of sex, use this 'cause of sex. Kids think it's normal. They think they're supposed to talk dirty, wear scanty clothes...
L269908 +++$+++ u1262 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ NIKI +++$+++ Just a guess. Did you have it good with your wife? You know, sex.
L269907 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Yeah.  She was the one called Joanne. How'd you find that out?
L269906 +++$+++ u1262 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ NIKI +++$+++ She left you right?
L269905 +++$+++ u1262 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ NIKI +++$+++ Just a guess. She ain't dead though is she?
L269904 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Why do you say that?
L269903 +++$+++ u1262 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ NIKI +++$+++ You wife isn't dead is she?
L269902 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ What makes you so sure?
L269901 +++$+++ u1262 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ NIKI +++$+++ I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.
L269900 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ But what?
L269899 +++$+++ u1262 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ NIKI +++$+++ Look, I really don't know your daughter but...
L269897 +++$+++ u1262 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ NIKI +++$+++ On your own land?
L269896 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Grand Rapids? Of course.
L269895 +++$+++ u1262 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ NIKI +++$+++ Do you live in a house back in wherever.
L269894 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ They are the same.
L269893 +++$+++ u1262 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ NIKI +++$+++ I know what you mean. After a while they all look the same.
L269892 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I must have been in more motel rooms this week than in the rest of my life. At least it feels that way.
L269891 +++$+++ u1262 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ NIKI +++$+++ Just a second. It's my ass I'm risking. You better do it my way. These fuckers don't mess around.
L269890 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Where does he live.
L269889 +++$+++ u1262 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ NIKI +++$+++ Rot in hell, honey.  He's busy now.
L269886 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Why can't I meet him now?
L269885 +++$+++ u1262 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ NIKI +++$+++ Tod'll meet you at the bookstore at Eddy and O'Farrell tomorrow noon. I told him you were a 'specialty' customer.
L269884 +++$+++ u1262 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ NIKI +++$+++ It doesn't make any sense to me.
L269883 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ It's not quite the same thing.
L269882 +++$+++ u1262 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ NIKI +++$+++ If you see anything from the inside it makes sense. You ought to hear perverts talk. A guy once almost had me convinced to let his dachshund fuck me.
L269881 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I'll admit it's confusing from the outside. You've got to see it from the inside.
L269880 +++$+++ u1262 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ NIKI +++$+++ I thought I was fucked up.
L269879 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Yeah.  Well, mostly.
L269878 +++$+++ u1262 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ NIKI +++$+++ You really believe all that?
L269877 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Out of gratitude for being chosen. That's where Grace comes in. God first chooses you, then allows you, by Grace, to choose Him of your own free will.
L269876 +++$+++ u1262 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ NIKI +++$+++ Wow. Then why be good? Either you're saved or you ain't.
L269875 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ More or less.
L269874 +++$+++ u1262 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ NIKI +++$+++ So it's already worked out. The fix is in?
L269873 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ He has to. That's Predestination. If God is omniscient, if He knows everything -- and He wouldn't be God if He didn't -- then He must have known, even before the creation of the world, the names of those who would be saved.
L269872 +++$+++ u1262 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ NIKI +++$+++ Wait, wait. I'm trying to figure this out. This is like Rona Barrett. Before you become saved, God already knows who you are?
L269871 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I is for Irresistible Grace. God's grace cannot be resisted or denied. And P is for the Perseverance of the Saints. Once you are in Grace you cannot fall from the number of the elect. And that's the 'TULIP.'
L269870 +++$+++ u1262 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ NIKI +++$+++ No, please go on.
L269869 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I can stop if you want.
L269868 +++$+++ u1262 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ NIKI +++$+++ Fuck.
L269867 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Be that as it may. U is for Unconditional Election. God has chosen a certain number of people to be saved, The Elect, and He has chosen them from the beginning of time. L is for Limited Atonement. Only a limited number will be atoned, will go to Heaven.
L269866 +++$+++ u1262 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ NIKI +++$+++ Shit.
L269865 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ T stands for Total depravity, that is, all men, through original sin, are totally evil and incapable of good. 'All my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the Lord.'
L269864 +++$+++ u1262 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ NIKI +++$+++ Yeah, yeah, go on.
L269863 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ It's an anagram. It comes from the Canons of Dort. Every letter stands for a different belief. T-U-L-I-P. Like -- are you sure you're interested in this?
L269862 +++$+++ u1262 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ NIKI +++$+++ What the crap?
L269861 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ They believe in the 'TULIP.'
L269860 +++$+++ u1262 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ NIKI +++$+++ Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
L269859 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Christian Reformed. It's a Dutch Calvinist denomination.
