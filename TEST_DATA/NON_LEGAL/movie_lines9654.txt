L121407 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Come with me now! Come with me now. Come with me now. I want you out of here.
L121406 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Get off of me! Stop it!
L121405 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ You hate my guts? I want you to come with me now.
L121404 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Yes, I want to kill you! I hate your fuckin' guts!
L121393 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ There's nothin' to figure out. I'm home... we're workin' it out.
L121392 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ I'm just tryin' to figure it out.
L121391 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Would you knock it off, Sam?
L121390 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Plus, at the most, three suits, a thousand apiece. That still leaves what?  Around ten thousand?
L121389 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ At the most, which is impossible for him.
L121388 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Yeah.
L121387 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ But even if you bought him a watch, a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice - and he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is - so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand?
L121386 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Yeah.
L121385 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Yeah.
L121384 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ I bought him a watch too.
L121383 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ First of all, he's not gonna wear f- thousand-dollar suits. But let's say he did, which he won't. How you gonna get fitted for twenty-five suits in three days?  I, um, I mean, how could you get fitted that fast? I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much.
L121382 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ The good part was, I had Amy back. So, we went home, had the housekeeper stay over, put the kid to bed, I calmed myself down and we went to dinner. I tried to keep things nice and civil, you know.  But... hey, twenty-five thousand for three suits? That doesn't make much sense.
L121377 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Mm-hm.
L121376 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Mm-hm.
L121375 +++$+++ u4331 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ ACE +++$+++ Twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch.
L121374 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ He wanted a watch, too.
