L478099 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ You better take one.  Your breath has been a little funky all day.  Let me look at you.
L478098 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ No.
L478097 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ That's what I'm talking about.  A real Hong Kong night club.  You want an Altoid?
L478096 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Carter, would I lie to you?
L478095 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Don't be messing with me, Lee.  I will kick your ass.  I'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.
L478094 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Of course not.  My Superindendent invited us to a club tonight.  Big party.
L478088 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Not Mu-shu.  Mu-shu.  I want to see some women.  Now stop playing dumb and show me the shu!
L478087 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Mu-shu?  You're hungry?
L478086 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've been here three days and we haven't done shit.  We haven't been to a club, haven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on vacation, and I want some mu-shu.
L478085 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys Greatest Hits, Volume Two.
L478084 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I said that?  Which word was "goat?"
L478083 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat.
L478082 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ All I did was invite them for a drink.
L478081 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Those girls drove off because of you.
L478080 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Did you see the way those girls drove off?  I did you a favor.
L478079 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.
L478078 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I warned you about playing that shit when I'm in the car.
L478343 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Fine with me.
L478342 +++$+++ u7346 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ SPECIAL AGENT STERLING +++$+++ Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A.
L478341 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you --
L478340 +++$+++ u7346 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ SPECIAL AGENT STERLING +++$+++ I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case.  I don't ever want to see you again, you got that?
L478339 +++$+++ u7337 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ What "revenge" is he talking about?
L478338 +++$+++ u7346 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ SPECIAL AGENT STERLING +++$+++ Quite a night, Inspector.  Ricky Tan was our only bait, and now he's gone.  You finally got your revenge - at the expense of a U.S. Government investigation.
L478758 +++$+++ u7341 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ Now you know.
L478757 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I didn't know which side you were on.
L478756 +++$+++ u7341 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ I'm fine.
L478755 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Are you okay?
L478667 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ No.  But I'll help you.
L478666 +++$+++ u7341 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service?
L478665 +++$+++ u7341 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ Dip me!
L478664 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ How do I know I can trust you?
L478663 +++$+++ u7341 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ The Secret Service almost busted Reign at his casino in Macao, but the place burned down before we could move in.
L478656 +++$+++ u7341 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ If I'm wrong then my cover is blown.
L478655 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Why don't you go get them?
L478654 +++$+++ u7341 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ Behind me is the soft count room.  We're pretty sure the plates are back there.
L478653 +++$+++ u7341 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ Look over there.  That's the eye in the sky room.
L478652 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Just trying to make it look real.
L478651 +++$+++ u7341 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ You move well.
L478650 +++$+++ u7341 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ I'm undercover.  I had no choice.  You have to trust me.
L478649 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Last time you needed my help I ended up in the back of a truck.
L478648 +++$+++ u7341 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ I need your help.
L478647 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ What's going on?
L478645 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Excuse me?
L478644 +++$+++ u7341 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ Put your arms around me.
L478488 +++$+++ u7341 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ Yes.  They've printed and shipped one hundred million dollars, and there's only one way to spot a fake.
L478487 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ And Hu Li killed him for the plates.
L478486 +++$+++ u7341 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ It wasn't hard to spot the fakes until this past year.  Then Tan got hold of one of a kind Swiss made hundred dollar plates -- and started making superbills.
L478480 +++$+++ u7341 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ No.  It's a sample.  You guys ever heard of the Superbill?
L478479 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Is this a payoff?
L478473 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.
L478472 +++$+++ u7341 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ I know who you are, Inspector Lee.
L478535 +++$+++ u7342 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ I still have my lunch money from third grade.
L478534 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Do you still have the bills?
L478523 +++$+++ u7342 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ That's what we all used to call him when he was a kid -- cause he was always quacking.  Never shut up.
L478522 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Baby Duck?
L478521 +++$+++ u7342 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ What are you doing hanging out with Baby Duck?
L478520 +++$+++ u7342 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ No.  Freddy Ching's, in Crenshaw.
L478519 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?
L478518 +++$+++ u7342 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Master Ching taught me.
L478346 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I'll take him.
L478345 +++$+++ u7348 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ SUPERINDENDENT CHIN +++$+++ Escort Detective Carter to the airport --
L478271 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Thank you.
L478270 +++$+++ u7348 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ SUPERINDENDENT CHIN +++$+++ Let him find out on his own.  I want the Hong Kong police handling this.
L478269 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Did you tell Sterling?
L478268 +++$+++ u7348 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ SUPERINDENDENT CHIN +++$+++ Lee, we just got a call from the harbor patrol.  Ricky Tan is throwing a little party on his boat tonight.  Victoria harbor.  If you don't want to...
L478262 +++$+++ u7348 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ SUPERINDENDENT CHIN +++$+++ Are you okay, Lee?
L478261 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ All he wanted was some mu-shu.
L478235 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ The Secret Service?  Why?
L478234 +++$+++ u7348 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ SUPERINDENDENT CHIN +++$+++ Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from the United States Secret Service.
L478092 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ It's my responsibility.
L478091 +++$+++ u7348 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ SUPERINDENDENT CHIN +++$+++ We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand.
L478090 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Any leads?
L478089 +++$+++ u7348 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ SUPERINDENDENT CHIN +++$+++ Lee, there was a bombing at the American Embassy.  Two American translators were killed.
L478775 +++$+++ u7345 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ RICKY TAN +++$+++ Don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
L478774 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ If you reach for that gun, I'm going to kill you.
L478773 +++$+++ u7345 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ RICKY TAN +++$+++ I don't think it's over.  There are casinos all over this country.  Let me make you a rich man, Lee.  Don't make the same mistake he did.
L478772 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Put the plates down.  It's over.
L478771 +++$+++ u7345 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ RICKY TAN +++$+++ You're just like your father, Lee.  All these years hiding behind his badge.  I wanted to help him, to share with him, but he was too afraid of change.  When you think about it, I didn't really kill him.  I just put him out of his misery.
L478334 +++$+++ u7345 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ RICKY TAN +++$+++ There is a ship, in the Hong Kong Harbor...
L478333 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Tell me why they killed the customs agents.
L478332 +++$+++ u7345 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ RICKY TAN +++$+++ Nobody can protect me.  I'll make a deal with you, Lee.  But only iff you'll get me out of Hong Kong.
L478331 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ The police can protect you.
L478330 +++$+++ u7345 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ RICKY TAN +++$+++ ... if your father were alive, I would be turning to him now.  I didn't blow up the American Embassy, but I believe some of my people did.  My enemies are trying to frame me.  There is a war going on within the Triads -- and I am going to lose.  My name has been written into the book of death.
L478329 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Don't.
L478328 +++$+++ u7345 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ RICKY TAN +++$+++ Despite what people suspect...what you suspect --
L478204 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ You must come with me for questioning.
L478203 +++$+++ u7345 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ RICKY TAN +++$+++ Lee, I've missed you, brother.  I heard about the two Americans, I'm so sorry, you must be under great pressure.
L478164 +++$+++ u7344 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ MASTER FU +++$+++ It's a massage parlor downtown.  "Heaven on Earth."  You will find your answers there.
L478163 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't understand.  A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A mountain, where Earth reaches for the --
L478162 +++$+++ u7344 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ MASTER FU +++$+++ The answers you seek can be found in Heaven on Earth.
L478161 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I know, Master, but...
L478160 +++$+++ u7344 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ MASTER FU +++$+++ A seeding spends its entire life reaching towards Heaven.
L478158 +++$+++ u7344 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ MASTER FU +++$+++ No.  Your father.  Your father and Ricky Tan were my favorite students... and for such awful things to happen as they did --
L478157 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Ricky Tan?
L478156 +++$+++ u7344 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ MASTER FU +++$+++ He was the best I ever trained, you know.
L478155 +++$+++ u7344 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ MASTER FU +++$+++ Animals kill only from hunger or fear. The man you seek is lower than a serpent.  ...he kills for money.
L478154 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I need your help, Master.  I'm seeking a man who used to train with you.  He's become a killer - the worst kind of animal.
L478149 +++$+++ u7343 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Yes, Master.
L478148 +++$+++ u7344 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ MASTER FU +++$+++ Didn't I teach you to always arch your back?
L478221 +++$+++ u7346 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ SPECIAL AGENT STERLING +++$+++ Put a diaper on him, Chin.  I want to talk to the great Inspector Lee.
L478220 +++$+++ u7348 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ SUPERINDENDENT CHIN +++$+++ That is...Chief Inspector Lee.  The detective in charge of our investigation.
L478219 +++$+++ u7346 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ SPECIAL AGENT STERLING +++$+++ Who the hell is that?
L478218 +++$+++ u7346 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ SPECIAL AGENT STERLING +++$+++ No.  He will report to me.  Do we understand each other?
L478217 +++$+++ u7348 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ SUPERINDENDENT CHIN +++$+++ Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people...
L478216 +++$+++ u7346 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ SPECIAL AGENT STERLING +++$+++ Two Americans have been killed on United States Government property -- this is our investigation.
L478215 +++$+++ u7348 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ SUPERINDENDENT CHIN +++$+++ This is still Hong Kong.
L478214 +++$+++ u7346 +++$+++ m496 +++$+++ SPECIAL AGENT STERLING +++$+++ Chin, you have been ordered by the Ministry of Public Security to assist the FBI and Secret Service with our investigation, to provide us with whatever we need.  If you have information, it belongs to us.
L477745 +++$+++ u7355 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ The Ambassador will receive instructions for the drop, half an hour before it is to be made.  If it is successful, there will be more. Thank you, Agent Carter.
L477744 +++$+++ u7349 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ OK. Say what it is.
L477743 +++$+++ u7355 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ Shut up!
L477742 +++$+++ u7349 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
L477741 +++$+++ u7355 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
L477740 +++$+++ u7349 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ That's cool.  We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter.
L477739 +++$+++ u7355 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ What is your name?
L477737 +++$+++ u7349 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ That's some serious poundage in dollars.
L477736 +++$+++ u7355 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ In used currency.  Nothing bigger than a fifty.
L477735 +++$+++ u7349 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Fifty million!  Are we talkin' United States dollars?
L477734 +++$+++ u7355 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ The first drop will be made tomorrow. At twelve o'clock.  The amount will be fifty million.
L477733 +++$+++ u7349 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Lee!  It's him!
L477732 +++$+++ u7355 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ The bomb was meant as a demonstration of our sincerity.  If you want the Ambassador's daughter back alive, listen and do not talk.
L477731 +++$+++ u7349 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ You know what a phone booth is?!
L477381 +++$+++ u7349 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Do I look like I'm movin'?!  What you're seeing here?  This is not movement. This is my "still".
L477380 +++$+++ u7355 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ You don't move, you understand?!  You don't move!
L477459 +++$+++ u7350 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ DIEL +++$+++ Don't push it. You better watch your ass with these Fed types. If there's a screw-up, they won't think twice about burnin' it.
L477458 +++$+++ u7349 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ And that, of course, would be me.
L477457 +++$+++ u7350 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ DIEL +++$+++ They asked for the best street man I had.
L477456 +++$+++ u7349 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Feds asked for me?
L477455 +++$+++ u7350 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ DIEL +++$+++ I got a call from the F.B.I.  The daughter of the Chinese Ambassador has been kidnapped and they asked for help. You're it.
L477454 +++$+++ u7349 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Hey, sir, it was a pleasure to preserve Johnson's ass.  Well...you know what I mean.
L477453 +++$+++ u7350 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ DIEL +++$+++ Good job.
L477452 +++$+++ u7350 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ DIEL +++$+++ That's probably the only reason Johnson's still alive.
L477451 +++$+++ u7349 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I know, but --
L477450 +++$+++ u7350 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ DIEL +++$+++ What you did was dangerous and completely outside policy.
L477449 +++$+++ u7349 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Sir, I can explain.
L477448 +++$+++ u7350 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ DIEL +++$+++ I don't know what went wrong last night, but this department could've lost one detective and our only explosives expert.
L478057 +++$+++ u7349 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ So was I.
L478056 +++$+++ u7359 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ WHITNEY +++$+++ He was just doing his job.
L478055 +++$+++ u7349 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Tell me about it.
L478054 +++$+++ u7359 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ WHITNEY +++$+++ He'll be OK. Russ is a tough son of a bitch.
L477688 +++$+++ u7349 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I'm gonna arrest the sonuvabitch!  Your ass is goin' to jail!
L477687 +++$+++ u7359 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ WHITNEY +++$+++ This is pathetic.
L477686 +++$+++ u7349 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ He stole my wheel!
L477474 +++$+++ u7359 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ WHITNEY +++$+++ Carter.
L477473 +++$+++ u7349 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Ooo, there's a chill.  Love that.
L478074 +++$+++ u7354 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Oh, I think you like this very much.
L478073 +++$+++ u7349 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ No shark fin, no camel hump.  What you listenin' to?
L478072 +++$+++ u7354 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ It's Hong Kong, not Tokyo.  My country asked for the best.  I told them that was you.  Now I will show you around my Œhood.
L478071 +++$+++ u7349 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ FBI calls up my ass, says they need help in Tokyo.  Like I'm supposed to drop everything.
L478070 +++$+++ u7354 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ What a surprise!
L478026 +++$+++ u7349 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ You know him?
L478025 +++$+++ u7354 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Oh my god. Griffin.
L478023 +++$+++ u7349 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Hey, don't worry.  Nothing's gonna happen to it.
L478022 +++$+++ u7354 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ No, it is China, my country, my history.  If any of it gets damaged...
L478019 +++$+++ u7354 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ The art.
L478018 +++$+++ u7349 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ What?
L478017 +++$+++ u7354 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Oh no.
L477973 +++$+++ u7349 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Well, I ain't goin' to China.  And neither are you.
L477972 +++$+++ u7354 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L477959 +++$+++ u7354 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Be sorry for Soon Young. She has no chance now.
L477958 +++$+++ u7349 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I'm sorry, Lee.
L477929 +++$+++ u7354 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L477928 +++$+++ u7349 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ You drop my gun and you lose my i.d.?
L477927 +++$+++ u7354 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Oh no, I dropped it.
L477925 +++$+++ u7354 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Oh yes.
L477924 +++$+++ u7349 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ No, wait.  I don't have it.  You have it.
L477881 +++$+++ u7349 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ It ain't your ass, it's my ass you're backin' up.  Take the damn gun.
L477880 +++$+++ u7354 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ No, please, I don't --
L477873 +++$+++ u7354 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I am sorry, but I have too much respect for women.
L477872 +++$+++ u7349 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Like that.
L477869 +++$+++ u7349 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ No, like a tourist.  You know, things to see, money to burn, interested in stupid shit.
L477868 +++$+++ u7354 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ I am from outa town.
L477867 +++$+++ u7349 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ OK, when you go in, just act like you're from outa town.
L477865 +++$+++ u7354 +++$+++ m497 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ What do you hear?
