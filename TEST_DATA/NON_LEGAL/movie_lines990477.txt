L635563 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ I... I guess not.  I didn't mean I didn't want one 'cause of you bein' cut up. I didn't mean that.
L635562 +++$+++ u8709 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ DELILAH +++$+++ I didn't mean... with me. Alice and Silky, they'll give you one... if you want.
L635561 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ Me? No. No, I guess not.
L635560 +++$+++ u8709 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ DELILAH +++$+++ You want... a free one.

L635553 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ Yeah, I guess.  There's still a payment, ain't there?
L635552 +++$+++ u8709 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ DELILAH +++$+++ Are you really going to kill them?
L635550 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ That big guy lookin' for me?
L635549 +++$+++ u8709 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ DELILAH +++$+++ I brought your hat. You... left it down at Greely's.
L635548 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ I thought I was gone. See them birds? Most times I wouldn't even notice them birds much. But I'm noticin' 'em real good 'cause I thought I was dead.
L635547 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ Three days? I must be.
L635546 +++$+++ u8709 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ DELILAH +++$+++ Three days. Are you hungry?
L635545 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ Oh. How long I been here?

L635542 +++$+++ u8709 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ DELILAH +++$+++ They went out scouting when they saw your fever broke.
L635541 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ I didn't mean no offense.  I guess you're the one them cowboys cut up.  Ned an' The Kid, my partners, are they... ?
L635540 +++$+++ u8709 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ DELILAH +++$+++ You don't look nothin' like me, mister.
L635539 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ Some big guy beat the shit out of me.  I guess I must look a lot like you, huh?
L635538 +++$+++ u8709 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ DELILAH +++$+++ You ain't dead.
L635537 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ I thought... you was an angel.
L635400 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Oh yeah.

L635235 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Enemies, Bob? You been talking about the Queen again? On Independence Day?
L635234 +++$+++ u8710 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ ENGLISH BOB +++$+++ You leave me at the mercy of my enemies.
L635229 +++$+++ u8710 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ ENGLISH BOB +++$+++ Be careful with those, sonny.
L635228 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Charley, see what kind of "books" Mister Beauchamp is packing... but watch you don't get wet.
L635227 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ I guess not, Bob. I don't like guns around.
L635226 +++$+++ u8710 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ ENGLISH BOB +++$+++ Not really...  Maybe a couple of Peacemakers...  I imagine you could overlook those, eh, Bill? If you didn't see them... or hear them?
L635222 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Oh.
L635221 +++$+++ u8710 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ ENGLISH BOB +++$+++ Books. He's my biographer.
L635215 +++$+++ u8710 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ ENGLISH BOB +++$+++ WW Beauchamp... Little Bill Daggett and... "friends."
L635214 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ I heard that one myself, Bob. Hell, I even thought I was dead til I found out it was just I was in Nebraska.  Who's your friend?
L635213 +++$+++ u8710 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ ENGLISH BOB +++$+++ What I heard was that you fell off your horse drunk and broke your neck.
L635212 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Well, I was always tasting the soup two hours after I et it.
L635211 +++$+++ u8710 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ ENGLISH BOB +++$+++ Little Bill, I thought you were dead. I see you shaved off your chin whiskers.
L635210 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Been a long time, Bob. You run out of Chinamen?
L635209 +++$+++ u8710 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ ENGLISH BOB +++$+++ Shit and fried eggs.
L635208 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Hullo, Bob. Boys, this here is English Bob.
L635673 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ You an' Andy get the hell out there. Find out where them other two went.
L635672 +++$+++ u8711 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ FUZZY +++$+++ Uh... a little, maybe.
L635671 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Those cowboys messin' him up?
L635670 +++$+++ u8711 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ FUZZY +++$+++ No... but I guess he will soon enough. Had a Spencer rifle on him an' he was...
L635669 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ He admit it?
L635668 +++$+++ u8711 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ FUZZY +++$+++ Hell, yeah. A bunch of us Bar T boys went out lookin' on account of them killin' one of our own. We come across this fucker on a roan goin' South an'...
L635667 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Alive?
L635666 +++$+++ u8711 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ FUZZY +++$+++ We got one of them fuckers, Sheriff, out by Cow Creek, we...
L635098 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Nope. They'll stay out on the Spade country where they got friends.
L635097 +++$+++ u8716 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ SKINNY +++$+++ Well, I guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two.
L635096 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ I could run off them whores.
L635095 +++$+++ u8716 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ SKINNY +++$+++ You could run off them two cowboys.
L635094 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ That much, huh?
L635093 +++$+++ u8716 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ SKINNY +++$+++ You know how women kin lie... I knock 'em around a little, ask 'em where the money is, they say they don't have none?... but they coulda squirreled away that much, the five of 'em. Maybe. 
L635092 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ They really got all that money, them whores?
L635091 +++$+++ u8716 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ SKINNY +++$+++ Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas.
L635090 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Word must have got all the way to Texas by now.
L635089 +++$+++ u8716 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ SKINNY +++$+++ I didn't hear nothin' till last night.
L635088 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ All week?
L635087 +++$+++ u8716 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ SKINNY +++$+++ Yup.
L635086 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ An' all them cowboys been riding that beef down to Kansas an' Cheyenne?
L635085 +++$+++ u8716 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ SKINNY +++$+++ ...They been fuckin' 'em, 'an tellin' every bow-legged one of 'em how they're payin' a thousand dollars to whatever sonofabitch kills them two boys which cut up Delilah.
L635084 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Shit, Skinny, we got railroad barons an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna be the first of the billiard barons.
L635083 +++$+++ u8716 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ SKINNY +++$+++ Them whores, they been fuckin' an' fuckin' all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks...
L635082 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Yeah?
L635079 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Porch. I'm puttin' a porch on her so's I can puff my pipe of an evening an' drink my coffee an' watch the sun set.
L635078 +++$+++ u8716 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ SKINNY +++$+++ What's all that wood?
L635077 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Roof? Jesus, Skinny, I done practically every damn thing myself. Roberts boy hauled wood, that's all.
L635076 +++$+++ u8716 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ SKINNY +++$+++ Heard you done the roof yourself.
L635075 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Huh? Hullo, Skinny. Snuck up on me.  How do you like her?
L635074 +++$+++ u8716 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ SKINNY +++$+++ Hit your finger, huh?
L634981 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ You boys are off of the Spade Outfit. Got your own string of ponies?
L634980 +++$+++ u8716 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ SKINNY +++$+++ She could maybe clean up around the place or somethin', but nobody's gonna pay good money for a cut-up whore.
L634979 +++$+++ u8716 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ SKINNY +++$+++ Hell no. Leastways, they won't pay to do it.
L634978 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ You figure nobody'll want to fuck her.
L634977 +++$+++ u8716 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ SKINNY +++$+++ Damaged property. Like if I was to hamstring one of their cow ponies.
L634976 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Property.
L634975 +++$+++ u8716 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ SKINNY +++$+++ This here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut-whore. Now I brung her clear from Boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital.
L634974 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ No?
L634973 +++$+++ u8716 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ SKINNY +++$+++ Shut up, Alice. Little Bill, a whippin' ain't gonna settle this.
L635831 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ I'll see you... in hell, you three fingered asshole.
L635830 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ "Deserve" don't mean shit, Little Bill.
L635829 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ I don't... deserve this... to die this way. I was... building a house.
L635808 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ I have done that... killed women and children... I have killed most everything that walks or crawls an' now I have come to kill you, Little Bill, for what you done to Ned.  Now step aside. boys.
L635807 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ I guess you are Three-Fingered Jack out of Missouri, killer of women and children.
L635806 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ He should have armed himself if he was gonna decorate his saloon with the body of my friend.
L635460 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ Well, uh... it ain't loaded.
L635459 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.
L635458 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ Uh... yeah. Yeah.
L635457 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ I guess you just carry it for snakes an' such.
L635456 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ I... I guess I might... but like I said, I ain't armed.
L635455 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Well, Mister Hendershot, if I was to call you a no good sonofabitch an' a liar, an' if I was to say you shit in your pants on account of a cowardly soul... well, I guess then, you would show me your pistol right quick an' shoot me dead, ain't that so?
L635454 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ Uh, William... uh... Hendershot.
L635453 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ What's your name?
L635452 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ Like I said, I...
L635451 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ You're spillin' your whiskey, mister.
L635450 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ I... dunno. I mean, I guess not. No, they ain't carryin' no guns.
L635449 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols?
L635448 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms.
L635447 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to the County office day or night. I guess you didn't read it with the weather an' all.
L635446 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ Uh, no. No, I ain't drunk.
L635430 +++$+++ u8719 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ WW +++$+++ Uh... hang the... uh... carpenter. I...
L635429 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ What?
L635428 +++$+++ u8719 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ WW +++$+++ Maybe you should... hang the carpenter.
L635427 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Huh? Oh.  Another one, huh? Shit, I guess I'm clean out of receptacles.
L635426 +++$+++ u8719 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ WW +++$+++ Uh... Sheriff... Uh...
L635425 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ I do not like assassins an' men of low character like your friend English Bob... but Bob ain't no coward who will cry to your face an' then...
L635424 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ No,... but I can't abide them kind... an' you will find a lot of them in the saloons... tramps an' drunk teamsters an' crazy miners... sportin' pistols like they was bad men, but not having no sand nor character... not even bad character.
L635423 +++$+++ u8719 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ WW +++$+++ Did you... kill him?
L635422 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ "Well, Jim," I says, "it makes me sick to see a man struttin' around and packin' two pistols an' a Henry rifle and cryin' like a baby."
L635379 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Give it to him.
L635378 +++$+++ u8719 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ WW +++$+++ R-r-r-really? You r-r-really w- wwant...?
L635372 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Wouldn't be no good if it wasn't. You got to cock it though.
L635371 +++$+++ u8719 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ WW +++$+++ Is... is it... loaded?
L635370 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Them's the keys. All you gotta do is shoot me an' you an' English Bob can ride out free as birds.
L635368 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Then he will kill you. That is why there are so few dangerous men like old Bob there... an' like me. It ain't so easy to shoot a man anyhow... an' if the sonofabitch is shootin' back at you... well, it'll unnerve most fellas.  Look here, let me show you somethin'.  See this here pistol?
L635367 +++$+++ u8719 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ WW +++$+++ But... if he doesn't miss?
L635366 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ He will be hurryin' and he will miss. That there is as fast as I can pull an' aim an' hit anythin' more'n ten feet away... unless it's a barn.
L635365 +++$+++ u8719 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ WW +++$+++ But if the other fellow is quicker and fires first...
L635341 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Well he wasn't gonna wait for Corky to grow no new hand. He walked over real close, bein' drunk, an' shot him through the liver.
L635340 +++$+++ u8719 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ WW +++$+++ You... you mean...  English Bob killed him while...?
L635339 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Bam! That Walker Colt blew up in his hand... which was a failing common to that model. Now if Corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end.
L635338 +++$+++ u8719 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ WW +++$+++ And?
L635337 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Well, that bullet whizzin' by panicked Corky, an' he done the wrong thing! Pulled his gun in such a damn hurry he shot off his own toe. Meantime, Bob aims good and squeezes off another... but he's so drunk he misses again an' hits the thousand dollar mirror behind the bar. Well, now the Duck of Death is good as dead 'cause this time Corky does right an' aims real good, no hurry...
L635336 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Some folks did call Old Corky "Two Gun" but not because he was sportin' two pistols but because he had a dick so big it was longer than the barrel on that Walker Colt he carried. An' the only insultin' he done was stickin' that big dick of his in some French Lady that Old Bob was sweet on... Well, one day Corky walked into the Blue Bottle and before he knows what's happening Bob takes a shot at him... and misses on account of he's drunker than hell.
L635335 +++$+++ u8719 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ WW +++$+++ But he was called...
L635334 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ First off... Corky didn't carry two pistols, though he should of.
L635333 +++$+++ u8719 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ WW +++$+++ You were there?
L635332 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Well, Mister Beauchamp, I was at the Blue Bottle Saloon in Wichita the night English Bob killed Corky Corcoran... an' I didn't see you there... nor no woman, nor no twogun shooters nor nothin' like that.
L635331 +++$+++ u8719 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ WW +++$+++ I believe that to be an accurate description of the events, sir... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which...
L635330 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Duck, I says.  "You have insulted the honor of this beautiful woman, Corcoran," said the duck. "You must apologize." But Two Gun Corcoran would have none of it and, cursing, he reached for his pistols and would have killed them but The Duck was faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking sixguns." 
L635329 +++$+++ u8719 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ WW +++$+++ Duke.
L635328 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Meaning the duck himself, I guess.
L635327 +++$+++ u8719 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ WW +++$+++ Uh... I can assure you, Mister Daggett... the events described within are based... on the accounts of eye witnesses and...
L635326 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ Well, Mister Beauchamp... from what I read of this here book, I'd have to say the writin' ain't a whole lot different from the pitcher.
L635325 +++$+++ u8719 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ WW +++$+++ Uh... It's... uh... generally considered desirable in the publishing business to... ah... take certain license in depicting the cover scene... for... ah... purposes involving the... ah, market place.
L635323 +++$+++ u8719 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ WW +++$+++ Uh... Duke.
L635322 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ That is you there, ain't it, Bob? The Duck of Death?
L635232 +++$+++ u8719 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ WW +++$+++ D-d-d-duke. The D-d-duke of Death.
L635231 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ The... Duck of Death.
L635225 +++$+++ u8712 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE BILL +++$+++ A book, huh?  I guess that means you can read... An' I guess you boys seen them signs about surrendering your firearms... But then, like you told old Andy there, you ain't armed, are you, Bob?
L635224 +++$+++ u8719 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ WW +++$+++ It's only a b-b-b-book...

L635772 +++$+++ u8713 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE SUE +++$+++ He said how you was really Three Fingered Jack out of Missouri... an' Bill said "Same Three Fingered Jack that dynamited the Rock Island and Pacific in '69 killin' women and children an' all?" An' Ned says you done a lot worse than that, said you was more cold blooded than William Bonney or Clay Alisson or the James Brothers an' how if he hurt Ned again you was gonna come an' kill him like you killed a U.S. Marshall in '73.
L635771 +++$+++ u8713 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE SUE +++$+++ Not on purpose. But he started hurtin' him worse... makin' him tell stuff. First ned wouldn't say nothin'... but Little Bill hurt him so bad he said who you was...

L635758 +++$+++ u8713 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ LITTLE SUE +++$+++ N-no. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died.  Little Bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.
L635757 +++$+++ u8714 +++$+++ m591 +++$+++ MUNNY +++$+++ He hanged him?  Shot him down?
