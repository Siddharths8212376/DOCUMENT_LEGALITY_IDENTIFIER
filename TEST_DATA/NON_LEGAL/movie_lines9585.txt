L72817 +++$+++ u3929 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ Forget the stars.  Look here, at the Earth, our mother, our womb.  She deserves our loyalty and protection. And yet you spoil her lands, poison her oceans, blacken her skies. You're killing her.
L72816 +++$+++ u3929 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ I have here a proposal showing how Wayne Enterprises can immediately cease all actions that toxify our environment.
L72815 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ That lab was consumed by fire last week.  how did you manage to escape?
L72814 +++$+++ u3929 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ I see you knew him.
L72813 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ We cut our support.  A conflict of ideologies.  Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.
L72812 +++$+++ u3929 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ Actually, I already work for you. Or did.  Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
L72811 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ What can I do for you, Doctor?  A research grant?  A hospital wing?
L72810 +++$+++ u3929 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ Dr. Pamela Isley.
L72809 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ They're overly protective.  You're Not going to hurt me are you, Ms...
L73117 +++$+++ u3927 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ You were right.  I get it.  You're not the marrying kind.  You've made your point.  Goodbye Bruce Wayne.
L73116 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Well...um...her.
L73115 +++$+++ u3927 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Make a choice, Bruce.  Her or me.
L73111 +++$+++ u3927 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Bruce?  What are you doing?
L73110 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Dr. Isley.  it was like I could feel you in the room.  You're...enchanting. Gorgeous.  The most beautiful woman I've ever seen.  If you're..um... free...this evening.
L72932 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I wish I knew.
L72931 +++$+++ u3927 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ You just called me Ivy.  Who's Ivy?
L72930 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ What?
L72929 +++$+++ u3927 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Who's Ivy?
L72928 +++$+++ u3927 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I'm betting on you.  You'll make someone a good husband one day. But I can't wait around forever. Don't answer now.  Just think it over.  Here's some food for thought.
L72927 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I wouldn't bet on that.
L72926 +++$+++ u3927 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ But there's nothing you've done under the cover of darkness I couldn't learn to understand.
L72925 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Wild doesn't exactly cover it.
L72924 +++$+++ u3927 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I know you're a dedicated bachelor. That you've had a your wild nights.
L72923 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Julie, I'm not the marrying kind. There are things about me you wouldn't understand.
L72922 +++$+++ u3927 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ We've been going out over a year now and...Okay, here goes.  Bruce, I want to spend my life with you.
L72921 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ What?  I'm sorry.  You were saying...
L72920 +++$+++ u3927 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ You're not even listening to me.
L72803 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Can I get some help over here?
L72802 +++$+++ u3927 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ And?
L72799 +++$+++ u3927 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ But soon...
L72798 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Umm.  What I mean is...no plans at the moment...
L72797 +++$+++ u3927 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ No!?
L73300 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I knew you could handle it.
L73299 +++$+++ u3924 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ One question.  When Batgirl and I rolled off the telescope, how come you didn't try and save us? It was the first time I fell and you weren't there to catch me.
L73159 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ You once said to me that being part of a team means trusting your partner.  That sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.  DO you remember?
L73158 +++$+++ u3924 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ You'd say anything to keep me away from her.  To keep her for yourself.
L73157 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ She wants to kill you.
L73156 +++$+++ u3924 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Is that it, Bruce?  I'm under some magic spell?
L73155 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ She's infected us with some kind of pheromone extract-
L73154 +++$+++ u3924 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ And she did it all for me.  For love.
L73153 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Her name is Pamela Isley.  I saw her talking to Gordon.  She must have stolen his keys, altered the signal-
L73152 +++$+++ u3924 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ That's no batlight, it's a birdcall.
L73094 +++$+++ u3924 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Oh but I am.  For the first time in a long time.  I'm through living in your shadow.  All that ends right now.
L73093 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ She's clouded your mind.  You're not thinking straight.
L73092 +++$+++ u3924 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Hail the all-knowing Bruce Wayne. Here's what I know, she loves me, Not you and it's driving you crazy. It's why you stopped us from kissing. Because if you can't have her, nobody can.
L73091 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Yes!  Yes, I want her so badly I can taste it.  That's the whole point. Look at us.  Orphans.  Isolated. Obsessed to the exclusion of life, love, family.  We're perfect targets. She's done something to us, got us fighting over her somehow.
L73090 +++$+++ u3924 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Or what?  No one can capture Ivy but the big bad Bat.  Crap!  You just want her for yourself.  Don't you?  Answer me, damn it!
L73089 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Dick, don't push me right now.
L73088 +++$+++ u3924 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Like hell you do.
L73087 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I'm late for the dedication.  Then I go after Freeze and Ivy.  Alone.
L73086 +++$+++ u3924 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ I checked the medical database.  No one else is even close.
L73085 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Yes.  But Alfred's condition is less severe.  Freeze's research says he cured a case like Alfred's.  It just doesn't say how.
L73084 +++$+++ u3924 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ McGregor's Syndrome.  That's what Freeze's wife had.
L72970 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I'm scared, Dick.  Maybe for the first time in my life.  I'm really scared.
L72969 +++$+++ u3924 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Talk to him, Bruce.  There's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel.
L72968 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ You know Alfred.  He'd never say Anything.  But I can tell.  Until you came along, Alfred was the only family I ever had.  Without him, I don't know how I would have survived.  He saved my life, Dick.  And I've never told him.
L72967 +++$+++ u3924 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ But he's never said a word-
L72966 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ He's dying.  And I can't deal with it.
L72750 +++$+++ u3924 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Anybody want to tell us kids in the cheap seats who Joanna Clark is?
L72749 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Of course.  Alfred still keeps your mother's picture in his room.
L72733 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ You left your back wide open.  Freeze could have killed you.
L72732 +++$+++ u3924 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ I got the diamond.  Quell problemo, Bruce?
L72691 +++$+++ u3924 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ I'm fine.  See.  Me.  here.  Alive. How are we gonna work together if you're never going to trust me?
L72690 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Dick, you were reckless.  You could have been killed.
L72689 +++$+++ u3924 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Whoa, I made a mistake.  I'm sorry. Don't go all protective on me.  It won't happen again.
L72688 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Absolutely.  Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator.
L72687 +++$+++ u3924 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ We gonna trap ourselves a snowman?
L72686 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I need the Wayne Diamonds.
L72684 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ <		Maybe it's something in the water.
L72683 +++$+++ u3924 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ Let me get this straight. A brilliant citizen, disfigured by a horrible accident, re-emerges as a psychotic super-villain bent on theft, revenge and destruction. You see a pattern here?
L72682 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ He needs extreme cold to survive. His cryo-suit uses diamond enhanced lasers to keep him at zero degrees.
L72681 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Presumed dead.  No one knows.
L72680 +++$+++ u3924 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ What happened to his wife?
L72679 +++$+++ u3923 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Somehow he survived.  But the cryoslution mutated his body.
L72678 +++$+++ u3924 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ DICK +++$+++ That's gotta hurt.
L73296 +++$+++ u3926 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ IVY +++$+++ Not good.
L73295 +++$+++ u3925 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ FREEZE +++$+++ Prepare for a bitter harvest. Winter has come at last.
L73078 +++$+++ u3926 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ IVY +++$+++ I'm hungry.  I think I'll have poultry.
L73077 +++$+++ u3925 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ FREEZE +++$+++ Inspired, Ms. Ivy.
L73076 +++$+++ u3926 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ IVY +++$+++ The way to a boy's heart is through his ego.  What strapping young hero could resist his very own...signal?
L73075 +++$+++ u3925 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ FREEZE +++$+++ One kiss and you could lift the mask from his lifeless face.  Their secret identities would be revealed.  But how best to bait a brid?
L73074 +++$+++ u3926 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ IVY +++$+++ As a team, the duncely duo protect each other.  But the Robin is young. Impetuous.  If I could get him alone-
L73073 +++$+++ u3925 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ FREEZE +++$+++ That is far too merciful.  Batman will watch his beloved Gotham perish, then I will kill him.
L73072 +++$+++ u3926 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ IVY +++$+++ Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
L73071 +++$+++ u3925 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ FREEZE +++$+++ You will distract the bat and bird while I prepare to freeze Gotham.
L73070 +++$+++ u3925 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ FREEZE +++$+++ Adam and Evil.
L73069 +++$+++ u3926 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ IVY +++$+++ I have created a race of plants with the strength of the deadliest animals.  Once you have frozen mankind, my mutants will overrun the globe.  The Earth will become a brave new world of only plants. And we shall rule them.  For we will be the only two people left in the world.
L73068 +++$+++ u3926 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ IVY +++$+++ Just what I had in mind.  Everything dead on Earth except us.  A chance for mother nature to start again.  Plants and flowers are the oldest species on the planet yet they are defenseless against man.  Sorry hon, this is for science.  Behold the dawn of a new age.
L73067 +++$+++ u3925 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ FREEZE +++$+++ Yes.  I shall replay the world for sentencing me to a life without the warmth of human comfort.  I will blanket the city in endless winter. First Gotham and then the world.
L73066 +++$+++ u3926 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ IVY +++$+++ Kill them.  Of course.  But why stop there?  Why should only Batman and Robin die while the society that created them goes unpunished?
L73065 +++$+++ u3925 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ FREEZE +++$+++ Their bones will turn to ice.  Their blood will freeze in my hands.
L73063 +++$+++ u3925 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ FREEZE +++$+++ You lie!
L73062 +++$+++ u3926 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ IVY +++$+++ There was nothing I could do.  Batman deactivated her.  She's dead.
L73061 +++$+++ u3925 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ FREEZE +++$+++ Where is my wife?
L73060 +++$+++ u3926 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ IVY +++$+++ Make yourself right at home.
L73015 +++$+++ u3926 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ IVY +++$+++ OK, OK.  Ms. Ivy to the rescue.  Now where do I find your brittle bride?
L73014 +++$+++ u3925 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ FREEZE +++$+++ You will rescue my wife
L73013 +++$+++ u3926 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ IVY +++$+++ Hold it.  You never said anything about a wife, frozen or otherwise-
L73012 +++$+++ u3925 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ FREEZE +++$+++ Fine.  While I retrieve my diamonds, you and meatloaf will bring my wife to your lair.  She's frozen in -
L73011 +++$+++ u3926 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ IVY +++$+++ Trust me.  Vegetable magnetism.
L73010 +++$+++ u3926 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ IVY +++$+++ You leave Batman and Robin to me.
L73009 +++$+++ u3925 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ FREEZE +++$+++ In my weakened state I am no match for the bat and the bird.
L73008 +++$+++ u3926 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ IVY +++$+++ You are looking unseasonably hot. Let's go inside and grab your rocks.
L73007 +++$+++ u3925 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ FREEZE +++$+++ My reserves are exhausted.  I must have the gems that power my suit.
L72993 +++$+++ u3925 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ FREEZE +++$+++ Dear daisy, don't despair.
L72992 +++$+++ u3926 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ IVY +++$+++ I wonder if I can get a cell with a view of the gardens?
L72991 +++$+++ u3925 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ FREEZE +++$+++ No gun.  How disarming.
L72988 +++$+++ u3925 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ FREEZE +++$+++ I always go a size smaller.  Makes me look slimmer.
L72987 +++$+++ u3926 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ IVY +++$+++ I love that belt.  What are you, about a fifty Big and Tall?
L72985 +++$+++ u3926 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ IVY +++$+++ Let's cool it for now.  There's someone I want you to meet.
L72984 +++$+++ u3925 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ FREEZE +++$+++ An enticing offer.  But what does the lady want in return?
L72983 +++$+++ u3926 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ IVY +++$+++ Well, I, my most unabominable snowman, have been impressed by you. In fact I propose a pairing.  So I'm here to set you free.
L72982 +++$+++ u3925 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ FREEZE +++$+++ Impressive
L72868 +++$+++ u3925 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ FREEZE +++$+++ I'd love to stand here all day and exchange fashion tips but I'm kind of pressed for time.  So hand over the diamond, Garden Gal, or I turn you into mulch.
L72867 +++$+++ u3926 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ IVY +++$+++ Listen, Captain Cold, the suit, maybe, even though silver went out in the 70's.  But those boots are unforgivable. What is it with men?
L72866 +++$+++ u3925 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ FREEZE +++$+++ Let me guess, Plant Girl? Vine Lady? Ms. Moss?
L72718 +++$+++ u3925 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ FREEZE +++$+++ Hop away little bunny.  Before I cool your jets.  Permanently.
L72717 +++$+++ u3928 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ MS. B. HAVEN +++$+++ Forget your frosty femme.  These lips are wet and ready to get frostbite.
L72716 +++$+++ u3925 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ FREEZE +++$+++ You're skating on thin ice.  My passion thaws for my bride alone.
L72715 +++$+++ u3928 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ MS. B. HAVEN +++$+++ What say we turn up the heat?
L72714 +++$+++ u3925 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ FREEZE +++$+++ To be frozen.  To never change.  A life of perpetual ice-olation. There is little perfection in that.
L72713 +++$+++ u3928 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ MS. B. HAVEN +++$+++ Okay, my hair is brittle, my skin is dry and I don't care.  I'd weather blizzards to have you. You're the most perfect man I've ever known.
L72712 +++$+++ u3925 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ FREEZE +++$+++ I find that unlikely.
L72711 +++$+++ u3928 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ MS. B. HAVEN +++$+++ Freezy, I'm feeling...hot.
L73191 +++$+++ u3930 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Sorry to disappoint you.  But rubber lips are immune to your charms.
L73190 +++$+++ u3926 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ IVY +++$+++ You're too late.  Say bye-bye birdie.
L73188 +++$+++ u3926 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ IVY +++$+++ Love you?  I loathe your bipedal arrogance, your animal superiority. My only joy is knowing that even now my poison kiss is sucking the life from your ape-like face.
L73187 +++$+++ u3930 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Then you never loved me?
L73186 +++$+++ u3926 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ IVY +++$+++ You should have heeded your pointy- eared pal.  These lips can be murder.
L73185 +++$+++ u3930 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ What do you mean?
L73184 +++$+++ u3926 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ IVY +++$+++ Bad luck, I'm afraid.  It's time to die, little bird.
L73183 +++$+++ u3926 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ IVY +++$+++ One kiss, my love.  For luck.
L73182 +++$+++ u3930 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I've got to stop him.
L73181 +++$+++ u3926 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ IVY +++$+++ Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun.  He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.
L73180 +++$+++ u3930 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Tell me and I'll kiss you.
L73179 +++$+++ u3926 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ IVY +++$+++ Kiss me and I'll tell you.
L73178 +++$+++ u3930 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Of trust. Tell me your plan.
L73177 +++$+++ u3926 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ IVY +++$+++ How about dangerous curves?
L73176 +++$+++ u3930 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I want us to be together.  But I need to know you're serious about turning over a new leaf.  I need a sign.
L73175 +++$+++ u3926 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ IVY +++$+++ I'm glad you came.  I can't breathe without you.
L73039 +++$+++ u3926 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ IVY +++$+++ At you?  Polly want a kiss?
L73038 +++$+++ u3930 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Give it up.  If you threw yourself-
L72706 +++$+++ u3929 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ Hello, Jason.  I think I've had a change of heart.
L72705 +++$+++ u3931 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ WOODRUE +++$+++ Dr. Isley?  Pamela?  You look great. Especially for a dead woman.
L72671 +++$+++ u3931 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ WOODRUE +++$+++ Well, I can respect your opinion.
L72670 +++$+++ u3929 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ Join you?  I've spent my life trying to protect plants from extinction and now you corrupt my research into some maniacal scheme for world domination. When I get through you won't be able to get a job teaching high school chemistry, do you hear me, you psycho?
L72669 +++$+++ u3931 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ WOODRUE +++$+++ Without your research, I could never have come this far.  Join me.  The two of us, entwined, side by side...
L72668 +++$+++ u3929 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ Our work?
L72667 +++$+++ u3931 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ WOODRUE +++$+++ ...Our original sponsor had no stomach for military applications. he cut the funding for our work -
L72655 +++$+++ u3931 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ WOODRUE +++$+++ You must show me your secrets, blossom, before I show you mine.
L72654 +++$+++ u3929 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ You have to tell me what you're doing with my Venom.
L72651 +++$+++ u3929 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ What exactly are you working on in there?  What are those screams?
L72650 +++$+++ u3931 +++$+++ m260 +++$+++ WOODRUE +++$+++ What do we have here?  A lovely new supply of Venom.  I'll just take this to my laboratory for further study.
L73949 +++$+++ u3934 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Tonight's a good night.
L73948 +++$+++ u3932 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ All except the prototype with the sonar modifications you so disapprove of. But it hasn't yet been tested.
L73947 +++$+++ u3934 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Claw Island. Nygma's headquarters. I'm sure that's where they're keeping Chase.  Are all the Batsuits destroyed?
L73946 +++$+++ u3932 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ What now sir?
L73944 +++$+++ u3934 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Exactly. Mr. E. Mister Edward Nygma.
L73943 +++$+++ u3932 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Enigma.
L73942 +++$+++ u3934 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ And another name for Mystery?
L73941 +++$+++ u3932 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Mystery.
L73940 +++$+++ u3934 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ How about, MR. E.
L73939 +++$+++ u3932 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Of course. 13 is M....MRE.
L73938 +++$+++ u3934 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Letters in the alphabet.
L73937 +++$+++ u3934 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Precisely. So this number is probably some kind of calling card.
L73936 +++$+++ u3932 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Recognition, of course.
L73935 +++$+++ u3934 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ What do maniacs always want?
L73934 +++$+++ u3932 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
L73933 +++$+++ u3934 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ All the answers are numbers.
L73932 +++$+++ u3934 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ ...Batman, Alfred. I'm Batman.
L73931 +++$+++ u3932 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Master, Bruce?
L73922 +++$+++ u3932 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ No demons, son.  Your monsters are here. Until you fact that, I fear you will spend your life fleeing them.
L73921 +++$+++ u3934 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me.  Oh my God, Alfred.
L73920 +++$+++ u3932 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ What?
L73919 +++$+++ u3934 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ ...A bat.
L73918 +++$+++ u3932 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Bruce. Son. Listen to me. You are a kind man. A strong man. But in truth you are not the most sane man.
L73917 +++$+++ u3934 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ ...Afraid.
L73916 +++$+++ u3932 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ What?
L73915 +++$+++ u3934 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ There's one other thing. I feel..
L73914 +++$+++ u3932 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Perhaps the fall...
L73913 +++$+++ u3934 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I'm Batman? I remember my life as Bruce Wayne.  But all this. It's like the life of a stranger.
L73908 +++$+++ u3932 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Dick has run away. They have taken Dr. Meridian. And I'm afraid they found the cave, sir. It's been destroyed.
L73907 +++$+++ u3934 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me the bad news.
L73906 +++$+++ u3932 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
L73905 +++$+++ u3934 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.
L73904 +++$+++ u3932 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ How are you feeling, young man?
L73836 +++$+++ u3934 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ How? As Batman, knowing she wants me? Or as Bruce Wayne and hope...?
L73835 +++$+++ u3932 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Perhaps. Perhaps not. Why not ask the lady?
L73834 +++$+++ u3934 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ She's the first woman in a long time that's... No. She's the first woman ever. And she loves Batman. Not Bruce Wayne. If I let go of Batman I'll lose her.
L73833 +++$+++ u3932 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Dr. Meridian...
L73832 +++$+++ u3934 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Could I let Batman go? For Dick. For me. Could I leave the shadows? Have a life. Friends. Family...
L73831 +++$+++ u3932 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Why, indeed?
L73830 +++$+++ u3934 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Why do I keep doing this?
L73829 +++$+++ u3934 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Jack Napier's dead. My parents are avenged. The Wayne Foundation contributes a small fortune to police and crime prevention programs.
L73828 +++$+++ u3932 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ Which `they' might that be, sir?
L73827 +++$+++ u3934 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Maybe they're right.
L73768 +++$+++ u3932 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ I shall be near at hand. Should you need me. And sir, I know it's difficult but try and have a good time.
L73767 +++$+++ u3934 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Too much wealth. Too fast. Half of Gotham zombied-out. A technology that self destructs. He's protecting more than industrial secrets, Alfred.
L73743 +++$+++ u3932 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ ALFRED +++$+++ _No_, sir. _The_ _other_ _car_!
L73742 +++$+++ u3934 +++$+++ m261 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ The _Rolls_?
