L288286 +++$+++ u5889 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ They've been in there all day.
L288285 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath!  He <u>kills</u> people!
L288284 +++$+++ u5889 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ Not until the man calls.
L288283 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ We've got to get those kids out of there!
L288219 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ What does he have on you?  I know why I'm doing this, but what does he have on you?
L288218 +++$+++ u5889 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ You and I are gonna straighten this out with the Sheriffs, and then we'll wait for the man to call.  When he gives the word, we move.
L288217 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ What are you people going to do?
L288216 +++$+++ u5889 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ Think of me that way and you won't fuck up.  I'll handle the Sheriffs.
L288215 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Special Agent Jones.
L288214 +++$+++ u5889 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ I asked you my name.  You just saw my commission slip.  What's my fucking name?
L288213 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ What?
L288212 +++$+++ u5889 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ What's my name?
L288211 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ How do you people expect this to work? The Sheriffs have a Crisis Response Team here.
L288210 +++$+++ u5889 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ Don't worry about what we used to be.
L288209 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ You used to be a cop.  All of you used to be cops.  I can tell by the way you move.
L288208 +++$+++ u5889 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ In a few minutes the white phone is going to ring.  So let's get our shit straight before that happens.
L288207 +++$+++ u5889 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ Don't be funny, Chief.  You can't afford it.
L288206 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Are all of you named Jones?
L288205 +++$+++ u5889 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ Okay, here's mine.  My name is Special Agent Jones.
L288299 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ No!  They're right here --
L288298 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Are the disks still in your room?
L288132 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ Charles G. Benza.  They're coming!
L288131 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Who is it?
L288130 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ Yeah!  Here's a name.  This is somebody's personal tax --
L288129 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Try Al.  See if you can open Al.
L288128 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ I don't see any people names.  It's all businesses.
L288127 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Look for names.  Does it say whose taxes they are?
L288126 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ I opened Marlon.  I think it's somebody's taxes.
L288125 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Can you open them?
L288079 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L288078 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ If I get Rooney into the back of the house, can you find the disks without being caught?
L288077 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ I can get into the den.  The office is right across the hall.
L288076 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Can you get into the office?
L288075 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ I can get into the crawlspace from my closet and climb all over the house.
L288074 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ I thought they locked you in your room.
L288073 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ But I might be able to sneak into the office if they're not around.  Then I could open the disks here in my room.
L288072 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ Dennis won't let me go to the desk.  He makes me sit on the floor.
L288071 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office.  Could you find them and see who they belong to?
L288070 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ He has lots of disks.
L288069 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Your dad has two computer disks.  They have funny names:  Marlon and Al.
L288068 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ What do you want me to do?
L288067 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ I'm serious, Thomas; I don't want you to get hurt.
L288066 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ Okay.
L288065 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ I need your help with something.  But if you think those guys could catch you, then I don't want you to do it, okay?
L288064 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ I think so.
L288063 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ The doctors are taking care of him right now.  Thomas . . . are you safe?  Can you talk?
L288062 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ Is my daddy okay?
L287930 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ If I try to climb out they'll see me on the security cameras.  They would see you outside, too --
L287929 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ I've got the boy on the phone.  He's using a cell phone.  What was that, son?  I didn't hear you.
L287928 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ They nailed the windows.  I can't get'm open.
L287927 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ That's on the second floor.  Could you climb out your window if we were downstairs to catch you?
L287926 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ In my room.
L287925 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Where are you right now?
L287924 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ We're okay.
L287923 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ How about you and your sister?
L287922 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ Dennis hit him.  His head's all big and he won't wake up.  I'm really scared.
L287921 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Slow down, Thomas.  Take it easy and talk to me.  Was your father shot?
L287920 +++$+++ u5894 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ Thomas Smith.  I'm in the house that's on TV.  Dennis hit my dad and now he won't wake up.  You gotta help him.
L287919 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ This is Chief Talley.  Tell me your name, son.
L288310 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ How do I reach him?
L288309 +++$+++ u5896 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ That would be Glen Howell.  He was on his way for the disks.
L288308 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ A man has my family.  Gold watch here. Dark tan.
L288307 +++$+++ u5896 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Then you have everything.  You can put them away.
L288306 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Yes.
L288305 +++$+++ u5896 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Did you find the disks?
L288154 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ He's going to kill you.  Don't you know that?  He can't take the chance that you'll talk.
L288153 +++$+++ u5896 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about.
L288148 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ They're still in the house.
L288147 +++$+++ u5896 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Where are my children?
L287969 +++$+++ u5892 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THE WATCHMAN +++$+++ Smith will know.
L287968 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ These disks . . . where are they?
L287967 +++$+++ u5892 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THE WATCHMAN +++$+++ I have people in York Estates right under your nose.  If you do <u>anything</u> except what I'm telling you, you'll get Jane and Amanda back in the mail.  We clear on that?
L287966 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ You want . . . Marlon and Al.
L287965 +++$+++ u5892 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THE WATCHMAN +++$+++ When this phone rings, you answer.  It will be me.  I'll tell you what to do. When I have what I want, you get your family.
L287964 +++$+++ u5892 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THE WATCHMAN +++$+++ You will re-assume command.  In two hours, a group of my people will arrive at York Estates.  You will tell the Sheriffs that they are an FBI tactical team.
L287963 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ I can't control what happens.  The Sheriffs are running the scene.
L287962 +++$+++ u5892 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THE WATCHMAN +++$+++ We want them.  You will not let anyone go into that house--or anything come out-- until my people recover these disks.
L287961 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Marlon and Al....
L287959 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ You can let go.
L287958 +++$+++ u5892 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THE WATCHMAN +++$+++ Can we let go?  You past your shock and all that, we can turn you loose and you won't do something stupid?
L287953 +++$+++ u5892 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THE WATCHMAN +++$+++ These guys are going to take hold of you. Don't freak out.  It's for your own good.
L287952 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ What do you want?
L287951 +++$+++ u5892 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THE WATCHMAN +++$+++ Don't just fuckin' sit there, dumbass. Do you understand?
L287949 +++$+++ u5892 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THE WATCHMAN +++$+++ Follow the Mustang.  We won't go far.
L287948 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Who are you?
L287947 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ I'm the Chief.  I don't carry it.
L287946 +++$+++ u5892 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THE WATCHMAN +++$+++ Where's your gun?
L288167 +++$+++ u5893 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE +++$+++ You don't want another dead child on your conscience.
L288166 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ What do you mean by that?
L288165 +++$+++ u5893 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE +++$+++ We're almost home, you and me.  Keep your shit together.  This isn't L.A.
L288164 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Your phony FBI assholes.
L288163 +++$+++ u5893 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE +++$+++ My people are good to go.  You know who I mean?
L288162 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ I guess we do.
L288161 +++$+++ u5893 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE +++$+++ I guess we each have something the other wants.
L288160 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ I'll go in that fuckin' house right now! I'll give those disks to the <u>real</u> FBI, you COCKSUCKINGMOTHERFUCKER!!  And I've got <u>Smith</u>!  <u>I've got Smith</u>!!
L288159 +++$+++ u5893 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE +++$+++ <u>You want a blowtorch on your daughter's</u> <u>pretty face</u>?!
L288158 +++$+++ u5891 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ TALLEY +++$+++ Do you think I'm going to let you <u>murder</u> someone?!
L288157 +++$+++ u5893 +++$+++ m389 +++$+++ THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE +++$+++ You dumb fuckwad cop, you fucked up <u>bad</u>!
L289047 +++$+++ u5897 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ BENEDICT +++$+++ A delegation.
L289046 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ We, who is we?
L289045 +++$+++ u5897 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ BENEDICT +++$+++ Paul, we would like to speak to you in your office.
L288825 +++$+++ u5897 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ BENEDICT +++$+++ They're killing everyone. The Lady Minister! The UN soldiers. They're at the gate.
L288824 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What happened?
L288440 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I'm sorry, it's a private function.
L288439 +++$+++ u5897 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ BENEDICT +++$+++ Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception?
L288438 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Yes, Benedict, what can I do?
L288437 +++$+++ u5897 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ BENEDICT +++$+++ Paul, Paul, a moment please.
L288725 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I'll be back.
L288724 +++$+++ u5898 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ BIK +++$+++ Paul...  ...I have to talk to you.
L288477 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Of course.
L288476 +++$+++ u5898 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ BIK +++$+++ Also, could you remember to use the service entrance at all times?
L288475 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Leave it to me.
L288474 +++$+++ u5898 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ BIK +++$+++ The Hutu-Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish?
L288473 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Excuse me?
L288472 +++$+++ u5898 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ BIK +++$+++ That's what I came to talk to you about.
L288471 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis.
L288469 +++$+++ u5898 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ BIK +++$+++ Cockroaches?
L288468 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Gregoire, there are no cockroaches in this hotel, do you understand?
L288419 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Gregoire will deal with it, excuse me.
L288418 +++$+++ u5898 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ BIK +++$+++ Paul!
L288729 +++$+++ u5899 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ You want to buy anymore cockroaches ask for Captain Naramunju.
L288728 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Don't be foolish. There's more money to be made here.
L288718 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I swear, Captain, one hundred thousand francs, enough for a house. I will get the money, you keep them outside.
L288717 +++$+++ u5899 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ You will run into the hotel and hide behind the U.N.
L288716 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I don't have it here. At the Mille Collines. I can get it for you.
L288715 +++$+++ u5899 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ Give me it.
L288714 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I'll give you a hundred thousand francs for all of them.
L288713 +++$+++ u5899 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ And four children?
L288712 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Ten.
L288701 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Six.
L288700 +++$+++ u5899 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ How many in your family?
L288699 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Here, here, a thousand US dollars - fifty thousand francs for my family. To let us drive off to the Mille Collines.
L288697 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I don't have that much.
L288696 +++$+++ u5899 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ Ten thousand francs for each one.
L288695 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Name a price.
L288694 +++$+++ u5899 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ How much?
L288693 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Why not? These are not rebels, look at them. Soon they will be worthless to you. Why not take some money, for your work?
L288692 +++$+++ u5899 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ You want to pay me?
L288689 +++$+++ u5899 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ There is nothing to it.
L288688 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Please, I don't use guns.
L288686 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Let me explain.
L288685 +++$+++ u5899 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ They are all Tutsi cockroaches.
L288671 +++$+++ u5899 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ Where is your family?
L288670 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Captain, I must take my family. It is not safe here.
L288669 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Of course.
L288668 +++$+++ u5899 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ Do you know how to open the safe there?  Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. You must open it.
L288667 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I used to work at the Diplomat.
L288666 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ No. I work at the Mille Collines.
L288665 +++$+++ u5899 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
L288664 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Yes, it is a calamity for us all.
L288663 +++$+++ u5899 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ You heard the Tutsi cockroaches murdered our president.
L288662 +++$+++ u5899 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ Let me see your identity card.
L288661 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What is this about?
L288660 +++$+++ u5899 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ We are looking for you.
L288659 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of General Bizimungu.
L288658 +++$+++ u5899 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ Who are you?
L288801 +++$+++ u5900 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ COLONEL OLIVER +++$+++ We're awaiting a decision, excuse me.
L288800 +++$+++ u5903 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ What was the response?
L288799 +++$+++ u5900 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ COLONEL OLIVER +++$+++ Yes we have.
L288798 +++$+++ u5903 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Have you requested re-enforcements?
L288797 +++$+++ u5900 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ COLONEL OLIVER +++$+++ Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order.
L288796 +++$+++ u5903 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ If the UN changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed?
L288795 +++$+++ u5900 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ COLONEL OLIVER +++$+++ Unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can't take an aggressive role.
L288794 +++$+++ u5903 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ We've heard reports of reprisal killings. Will the UN intervene to stop the bloodshed.?
L288793 +++$+++ u5900 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ COLONEL OLIVER +++$+++ No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels.
L288792 +++$+++ u5903 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Do we know who fired the missile that killed the president?
L289294 +++$+++ u5900 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ COLONEL OLIVER +++$+++ I wish I could, Paul. Try to hold out.
L289293 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise.
L289292 +++$+++ u5900 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ COLONEL OLIVER +++$+++ No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.
L289291 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I can't. I have nothing left to bribe with. Can your men at the gate hold out for another day?
L289290 +++$+++ u5900 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ COLONEL OLIVER +++$+++ Paul, I need you to buy me a day or two. I don't have the fuel for this convoy. I will have to scrounge it.
L289280 +++$+++ u5900 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ COLONEL OLIVER +++$+++ The rebels have fought their way into the city. They have many Hutu prisoners.
L289279 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What is it?
L289276 +++$+++ u5900 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ COLONEL OLIVER +++$+++ I can't, I don't have the men.
L289275 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Will you protect us.
L289274 +++$+++ u5900 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ COLONEL OLIVER +++$+++ That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you this but we've heard rumors the Militia are getting ready to storm the hotel.
L289273 +++$+++ u5909 +++$+++ m390 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them away.
