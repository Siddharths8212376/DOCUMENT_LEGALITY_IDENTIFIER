L511297 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you?
L511296 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?
L511295 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ Did they tell?  It is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone.  According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day.
L511252 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ I... I am looking for Baltus Van Tassel.
L511251 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ Forgive me, I didn't know.
L511931 +++$+++ u7652 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ LADY VAN TASSEL +++$+++ Yes... yes.  I think I will...
L511930 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Let her go!
L511929 +++$+++ u7652 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ LADY VAN TASSEL +++$+++ You cannot kill what is already dead.
L511742 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ What... ?
L511741 +++$+++ u7652 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ LADY VAN TASSEL +++$+++ I know you saw me.
L511740 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ It is fine.  Now, I must...
L511739 +++$+++ u7652 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ LADY VAN TASSEL +++$+++ Look closer.  Do you have anything to clean it with?
L511738 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ It appears well.  It has already clotted.
L511736 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Very little.  I must be going...
L511735 +++$+++ u7652 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ LADY VAN TASSEL +++$+++ She has taken the last of our grain to be milled.  You do have a background in the medical arts, don't you, Constable?
L511734 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Where?
L511733 +++$+++ u7652 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ LADY VAN TASSEL +++$+++ No.  She has gone out.
L511732 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel... Katrina is not in her room.
L511592 +++$+++ u7652 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ LADY VAN TASSEL +++$+++ As my husband says, a wife should be always like an echo, and at the same time, quite unlike an echo.  Like an echo, she should speak only when spoken to, and unlike an echo, should never try to have the last word, or, at least that is what he believes.
L511591 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here.
L511590 +++$+++ u7652 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ LADY VAN TASSEL +++$+++ Use caution.
L511589 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Yes, actually.
L511588 +++$+++ u7652 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ LADY VAN TASSEL +++$+++ Returning to the Western Woods?
L511330 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ It is a prime tenet of science, Philipse, that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical.
L511329 +++$+++ u7652 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ LADY VAN TASSEL +++$+++ You said yourself.  What mere man could have downed the Belltower?
L511852 +++$+++ u7656 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ VAN RIPPER +++$+++ Yes.  Here...
L511851 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Van Ripper... do you have a gun?
L511831 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Turn around.  Now!
L511830 +++$+++ u7656 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ VAN RIPPER +++$+++ What did you say?
L511829 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Van Ripper, turn the coach about!
L511351 +++$+++ u7656 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ VAN RIPPER +++$+++ I didn't see none.
L511350 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ There was not much blood, was there?
L511349 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall?
L511348 +++$+++ u7656 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ VAN RIPPER +++$+++ Here... in front of this oak, facing north.  Horrible...
L511347 +++$+++ u7656 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ VAN RIPPER +++$+++ I can show exactly.
L511346 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Van Ripper.  Can you show where the body lay?
L511513 +++$+++ u7653 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ OLD CRONE +++$+++ Close your mouth!  Keep silent.
L511512 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ What... what are you doing?
L511511 +++$+++ u7653 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ OLD CRONE +++$+++ You want to see into the nether world... I can show you.  Whatever you see, do not move or speak.  I will hold him.
L511510 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Can you help?
L511509 +++$+++ u7653 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ OLD CRONE +++$+++ Sit.
L511508 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ The Horseman.  Yes.
L511507 +++$+++ u7653 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ OLD CRONE +++$+++ I hear him.  He rides to the Hollow and back.
L511503 +++$+++ u7653 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ OLD CRONE +++$+++ Leave me.  You are not welcome here.
L511502 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ The Lenape who lived in these woods... do you know him?  The Redman?  I should tell you... he has been murdered.
L511501 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ In a way, yes.
L511500 +++$+++ u7653 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ OLD CRONE +++$+++ You are from the Hollow?
L511499 +++$+++ u7649 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ ICHABOD +++$+++ Pardon.  You did not answer when I knocked.  Are we intruding?
L511867 +++$+++ u7652 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ LADY VAN TASSEL +++$+++ This whore will see your mouth shut forever very soon.  But... I am not going to kill you.  Not me...
L511866 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ No one will believe your lies, whore.
L511865 +++$+++ u7652 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ LADY VAN TASSEL +++$+++ Imagine my surprise, finding him on a liason with a common servant.  A girl who had apparently become his secret love.
L511862 +++$+++ u7652 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ LADY VAN TASSEL +++$+++ He saw me thrown... saw the Horseman looming over me as I fled.  Things I wanted him to see.  But, as long as I govern the Horseman, he cannot harm me.  Baltus did not stay enough to see that.  He ran as a coward, unfettered by my fate.
L511861 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ Father saw you die.
L511860 +++$+++ u7652 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ LADY VAN TASSEL +++$+++ He rides tonight.
L511857 +++$+++ u7652 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ LADY VAN TASSEL +++$+++ Am I?  Or, are you and Young Masbath dead along with me?
L511856 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ You... you are alive.
L511657 +++$+++ u7652 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ LADY VAN TASSEL +++$+++ Doctor, he is awake.
L511656 +++$+++ u7650 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ KATRINA +++$+++ Lay still, Ichabod.  Do not move.
L511569 +++$+++ u7655 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ THIRD MAN +++$+++ She has admitted to her evil and signed a written confession.  Do you know what confession is?  All that is left for you now is to pray for her soul.
L511568 +++$+++ u7657 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG ICHABOD +++$+++ No.
L511567 +++$+++ u7655 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ THIRD MAN +++$+++ She has confessed.
L511566 +++$+++ u7657 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG ICHABOD +++$+++ No, sir, please... she is innocent...
L511565 +++$+++ u7655 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ THIRD MAN +++$+++ She is guilty.
L511564 +++$+++ u7657 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG ICHABOD +++$+++ She did not do it... please listen...
L511563 +++$+++ u7655 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ THIRD MAN +++$+++ You do not want to be here.  Go home to your father.
L511562 +++$+++ u7657 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ YOUNG ICHABOD +++$+++ May I see my mother?
L511561 +++$+++ u7655 +++$+++ m517 +++$+++ THIRD MAN +++$+++ Go home.
L513231 +++$+++ u7659 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Goddamnit, Scooter, come on. Pardon my language, ma'am.
L513230 +++$+++ u7671 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ SCOOTER +++$+++ I can go. You don't have to. You don't never go.
L512836 +++$+++ u7659 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Well, yeah it's a classic. You know, Karl, I got to thinkin' about it last night and it's just not Christian of me to not let you have a key. I mean you been in lockup so long, you don't need me keepin' you locked up. You need to come and go as you please. Here, take this key, it'll get you in and out that back door.  Them french fries good?
L512835 +++$+++ u7671 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ SCOOTER +++$+++ Yeah, that's a goodun. I believe you did tell me that one before. I've heard that a bunch. Long time ago.
L512834 +++$+++ u7659 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ There was these two old boys hung their peckers off of a bridge to piss, one old boy from California and one old boy from Arkansas. Old boy from California says, "Boy this water's cold." Old boy from Arkansas says "Yeah, and it's deep too."  Get it? That's a goodun.
L512833 +++$+++ u7671 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ SCOOTER +++$+++ I can't remember.
L512832 +++$+++ u7659 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Scooter, did I tell about the two old boys pissin' off the bridge?
L512829 +++$+++ u7659 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Karl, they's a blanket up in under that cot and soap in the bathroom to clean up with.  Now there's one more thing. The way we lock these doors at night, you can't get out. You didn't want to go anywhere, did you?
L512828 +++$+++ u7671 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ SCOOTER +++$+++ Wait up, I'll leave with you and lock up.
L512827 +++$+++ u7659 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ All right then, I'll see y'all later. Karl you done a good day's work. They right about you. Scooter, he's gonna knock you out of a job if you're not careful. I'll see you tomorrow.
L513229 +++$+++ u7659 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Scooter, let's me and you go over to Dairy Queen and pick up a few things for lunchtime.
L513228 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Thank ye.
L513189 +++$+++ u7659 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ See there. Thinks of the simplest thing first.
L513188 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Hit ain't got no gas in it.
L512922 +++$+++ u7659 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ You done fixed it? I'll be damned. Scooter told me it couldn't be fixed. 'Course Scooter's about as shitless as one poor son-of-a-bitch can be. You done fixed it. I'll just be damned. See you tomorrow.
L512921 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I fixed it. Hit's a workin' pretty good.
L512920 +++$+++ u7659 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ All right then. I'll see you bright and early. How you comin' along on that garden tiller?
L512919 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ That boy wants me to.
L512918 +++$+++ u7659 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Now, Karl, you sure you want to go stay with these folks? You're welcome to keep on stayin here. It's workin' out real good.
L512842 +++$+++ u7659 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ I'll let you off while it's still daylight.
L512841 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ All right then.
L512840 +++$+++ u7659 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Well, I'm gonna pay you today for this comin' week, so you'll have some walkin' around money. When you get off this evenin' you better go buy some toothpaste and cleanin' up supplies to have back there. Some hard candy and some magazines. Somethin' to keep you busy at night.
L512839 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ They give me fifty dollars when they turned me loose. I spent up some of it on ridin' the bus and eatin' french-fried potaters.
L512838 +++$+++ u7659 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ You got any money?
L512837 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Yeah, they's good all right.
L512831 +++$+++ u7659 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ If it works out and all, maybe we'll get you a key so you can get out at night if you need to. See you later.
L512830 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I don't reckon.
L512825 +++$+++ u7659 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Yeah, me too.
L512824 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I like them french-fried potaters.
L512823 +++$+++ u7659 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ We order from Dairy Queen at noontime usually. We can buy your lunch till you get on your feet a little.
L512822 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I've tinkered around on 'em a little bit.
L512821 +++$+++ u7659 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ They say you're a whiz on fixin' lawn mowers and things.
L512819 +++$+++ u7659 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Now it's minimal wage and there ain't nothin' but a army cot and a toilet back there.
L512818 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Thank ye.
L513187 +++$+++ u7659 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Okay, stop back by. Don't worry about your boy here, he's doin' good.
L513186 +++$+++ u7674 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ WOOLRIDGE +++$+++ I'll see you, Bill.
L513174 +++$+++ u7659 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Sure.
L513173 +++$+++ u7674 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ WOOLRIDGE +++$+++ Can I see him?
L513172 +++$+++ u7659 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ He's gone to stayin' over with that Wheatley boy and his mama in their garage. I think that little boy adopted him damn near like a mascot. But he's got a key here to come and go as he pleases. Everything's worked out good.
L513171 +++$+++ u7674 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ WOOLRIDGE +++$+++ Is him stayin' here workin' out?
L513170 +++$+++ u7659 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Well, he's pretty quiet. Except for them rackets and breathin' things he does. Ain't threatened me with a killin' or anything.  But boy you couldn't of been more right about him fixin' things. That son of a bitch is a regular Eli Whitney on a lawnmower. Loves french fries. Eats four larges and don't even so much as belch. I'm proud to have him.
L513169 +++$+++ u7674 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ WOOLRIDGE +++$+++ Just thought I'd check on Karl and see if everything's working out.
L513168 +++$+++ u7659 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Doin' pretty good. Got a sick tiller here. What's got you down this way?
L513167 +++$+++ u7674 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ WOOLRIDGE +++$+++ How are you, Bill?
L513166 +++$+++ u7659 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ How 'bout you, Jerry.
L512817 +++$+++ u7659 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Good to know you, Karl.
L512816 +++$+++ u7674 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ WOOLRIDGE +++$+++ Karl, come over here. I want you to meet your new boss.  This is Bill Cox, runs this place. Says you can work here and stay in the back.
L512815 +++$+++ u7659 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Well, I've got a roomful of work for him to do. Can't get Scooter to do any of it.
L512814 +++$+++ u7674 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ WOOLRIDGE +++$+++ He won't steal. I'm tellin' you he's a pretty good ol' boy. Keeps to himself.
L512813 +++$+++ u7659 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Fine with me. If he steals anything, I'll take it out of your pocket anyway.
L512812 +++$+++ u7674 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ WOOLRIDGE +++$+++ He won't have anything to do with him. Now you say it's all right for him to stay out here in the back?
L512811 +++$+++ u7659 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ That old man of his still livin' over there on Clark Street I believe.
L512808 +++$+++ u7659 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Well, I ain't scared of him workin' here. You know me. I'm a church goin' man. Forgivin' man. When your time's up the Lord's gonna come git you. You seared of him, Scooter?
L512807 +++$+++ u7674 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ WOOLRIDGE +++$+++ He's a regular whiz at it. That's all he did when he was a kid.
L512806 +++$+++ u7659 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Don't look much like he could. You say he can fix a small engine like nobody's bidness.
L512803 +++$+++ u7659 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ I remember it real well. Cut them folks to pieces. His mama one of 'em.
L512802 +++$+++ u7674 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ WOOLRIDGE +++$+++ No, don't guess I do.  Scooter, good to meet you.  This is him, the one I talked to you about on the phone. Now like I said, I'll understand if you get nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young.
L512801 +++$+++ u7659 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that. Wouldn't do any good if I did.  Do you know Scooter, Jerry?
L512800 +++$+++ u7674 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ WOOLRIDGE +++$+++ Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'?
L512799 +++$+++ u7659 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Hey Jerry, how it's goin'. Good to see you. Been a long time.
L512734 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Karl's my name.
L512733 +++$+++ u7660 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ My name is Frank Wheatley. What's your name?
L512732 +++$+++ u7660 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Okay. You don't have to though.
L512731 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I'll help you tote 'em if I don't give out first.
L512730 +++$+++ u7660 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ About a half a mile I think it is.
L512729 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ How fer you going with them sacks full of warsh?
L512728 +++$+++ u7660 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ I got a mama, but she's at work over at Ben's Dollar Store. My daddy's dead.  He got hit by a train.
L512727 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Ain't you got no mama and daddy to tend to it?
L512726 +++$+++ u7660 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Yeah.
L512725 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ What you got in there, warshing?
L512724 +++$+++ u7660 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ These dang things are heavy. Hard to carry, too.
L512723 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Give me the big'uns.
L512722 +++$+++ u7660 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Sixty for small and seventy-five for large.
L512721 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ How much you want fer 'em? I'll get some of them I reckon.
L512720 +++$+++ u7660 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Yeah.
L512719 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ French-fried potaters.
L512718 +++$+++ u7660 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ French fries. I like to eat them pretty good.
L512717 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ What do you like to eat here?
L512716 +++$+++ u7660 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Well, I guess it's all good.
L512715 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ What you got that's good to eat?
L512714 +++$+++ u7660 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Did you decide, sir?
L512713 +++$+++ u7660 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Naw, we don't have biscuits.
L512712 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ You have any biscuits for sale?
L512711 +++$+++ u7660 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Well, what did you want?
L512710 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat.
L512709 +++$+++ u7660 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Can I help you?
L513460 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Don't say nothin' about that boy.
L513459 +++$+++ u7661 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Well, it's not too big in here, is it?  I feel very generous today. I feel like listening. I'm sure you have plenty to tell me. And please bore me with the details.  ) Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was it the boy?
L513458 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ It's too big.
L513457 +++$+++ u7661 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ I bet you did. I was never bent that way. I'm bent the other way. So, you liked it out there in the world.
L513456 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ They was a boy. We made friends.
L513455 +++$+++ u7661 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ ... on the third day I washed her. She wasn't very clean. I got all the right spots. She was the first one I ever kept for any length of time, you see I get bored easily, I have a short attention span. I can't say she enjoyed her stay, although the washcloth in her mouth held in place by good duct tape kept any complaints to a minimum. I don't really like people who talk a lot. I like to do the talking. I guess that's why I'm so fond of you. You're so easygoing, although I do sense a little tension in you sometimes. By the way, how was it out there? Did you have any fun?
