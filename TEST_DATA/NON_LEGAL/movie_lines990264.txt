L484239 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Well, if we're friends, why can't we see each other?
L484238 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ No.  We decided that we're friends.  I mean, I know it's a terrible word...
L484237 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ It sounded like you did.
L484236 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ No, no.
L484235 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ 'Cause I'm worried, did you just break up with me?
L484234 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ We decided...
L484233 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Okay, what did we just decide?
L484232 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Yeah, uh-huh.
L484231 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Okay.  It's good knowing this.
L484230 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ We'll see.
L484229 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Okay, how much time do you need?  I mean, you know, I mean you'll be leaving in a little while, so that's answered some questions. 
L484228 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Yeah.
L484227 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ You need to study?
L484226 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Well, I need to study, and...
L484225 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ What's wrong?
L484224 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ I think that we should spend some time apart.
L484223 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Say what?
L484222 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ How can I look at you and say this?
L484221 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ What?  This is a good level, isn't it?
L484220 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ I know.  Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level.
L484219 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I was just going to tell you that I love you.  I said it.
L484218 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ I don't know what you're going to say, but I think that...
L484217 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ How do you know what I'm going to say?
L484216 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ No, we don't have to say it.
L484215 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I've never sent a letter like that, you know?  I mean, I felt like I wanted to tell you something, but I didn't put it in the letter, and I didn't say it, but I want to say it now, I'm not sure if I should say it, you know, 'cause people always say it and don't mean it, but I think that I mean it, so, um, I just wanted to tell you...
L484214 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ It was wonderful.
L484213 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Why didn't you tell me?
L484212 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Uh-huh.  It was wonderful.
L484211 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ It did?
L484210 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Your letter came yesterday.
L484209 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Check your mail tomorrow.  I sent you a letter, a letter.
L484136 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Here are some blankets.  This is a good song, this is a really good song.
L484135 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I don't know.  I'm happy.
L484134 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Then why are you shaking?
L484133 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I don't think I am.
L484132 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ You're cold.
L484131 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I don't think so.
L484130 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ You're shaking.
L484129 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ No.
L484128 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Yes.  Are you shaking?
L484127 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Are you comfortable?
L484126 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Yeah.
L484125 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Let's get outta here.  You want to?
L484123 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Well no, it's not noble, but it's a good aid to your lesson.
L484122 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ This is so noble.
L484121 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Now, go into second.  Little more gas... Yeah!  You can get  this whole problem.  Now, maybe you downshift to first?
L484120 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Yeah.
L484119 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Little more gas.  Ease it up.  Hold on- minor setback.  Now you feel confident, right?
L484118 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Oh.  I was putting the...
L484117 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Yeah, a little bit.  Listen, this is important.  When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.
L484116 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Am I wrecking my car?
L484115 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Okay, this is important...
L484114 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Right.
L484113 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ If you'll just maybe ease it into second.
L484112 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Yeah?
L484111 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Yeah.  Now, when you feel like you're confident,...
L484110 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ I'm doing alright.
L484109 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ You know how it'll come out and feel... y'know... little more, little more... Yeah, yeah, that's right.  Go round just at first, keep it in first, just feel it.
L484108 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Yeah.
L484107 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Yeah, just keep going first, keep going around.  Get the feel of it, feel the clutch, when you put it in a little?
L484106 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Friends with potential.
L484105 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Yeah.  With potential.
L484104 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Be friends?
L484103 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Don't worry about it.  We're just having coffee.  We'll be anti- social.
L484102 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ I just can't have any social life right now.
L484101 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ No.
L484100 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ I just don't want it to get too heavy.  I feel really overloaded. I have this theory of convergence, that good things always happen with bad things.  But I know you have to deal with them at the same time, but I just, I mean I don't know why they have to happen at the same time, I mean, I don't know why, I just wish I could work out... Am I just babbling?  Do you know what I mean?
L484099 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ It's okay, everybody does that.
L484086 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Well... just meet her.
L484085 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ What did you say?
L484084 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Yes.
L484083 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Wait, wait.  You told her about me?
L484082 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ She's amazing.  She's ninety-three, she's a writer, and I told her about you.
L484081 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Okay.
L484080 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ You have to meet Bess.
L484079 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I'll see you there.  Bye.
L484078 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Okay, bye.
L484077 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Okay, bye, I will.
L484076 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Stop by later.
L484075 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Really?  Um... I... well... you're really turning me around here,
L484074 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ I think that's ageism, and that's, that's being prejudiced against people because they're old.  Maybe their mouths don't work as well as yours.
L484073 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Well, except for one thing.  I used to work at a smorgasbord, and, and the old people would flock there, and, and they loved to eat.  And they just jammed their mouths, you know?  The used to eat with their mouths open, and you know, it's just too much for me.  You get to be thinking about how short life is, and how maybe, maybe has no meaning because you wake up and you're frying burgers
L484072 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Come on.
L484071 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Me?  Sure I do.
L484070 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ I know you think my job is strange.  You don't like old people, do you?
L484069 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Won't you see me later?
L484068 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ I usually have a break after the dinner service, if you want to stop by.
L484067 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ After work?
L484021 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ I had a checklist in mind.  I thought that if babies were on the plane, the plane couldn't crash.  But all the babies were crying, and I thought they knew something I didn't.
L484020 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Oh.
L484005 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Mmmm.
L484004 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ You think so?
L484003 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I think you should wear that.
L484002 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Yeah?
L484001 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Nice one.
L484000 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Yeah, I've had it forever.  I used to have this thing with marking the words that I looked up.
L483999 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Boy, this is a mother dictionary.
L483996 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Or, or I could always wear this one.
L483995 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Yeah.
L483973 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Then call me later.
L483972 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Today is tomorrow.
L483971 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Then call me tomorrow.
L483970 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Sixteen weeks is a long time.
L483969 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ I only have something like sixteen weeks.
L483968 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ So am I. I want to see you again.  I want to see you as much as I can before you leave.  I said it.
L483967 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ No, I'm serious.
L483966 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Job?  Being a great date.
L483965 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ So what's your job this summer?
L483964 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Basic.  Hmmm.
L483963 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ You're a great date.  I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you.
L483962 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ What?
L483961 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ You know what?
L483960 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Twisted?
L483959 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Thanks.  But either way it still feels...
L483958 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Watch out for that glass.
L483957 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them.  So I chose my dad.  It just felt safer that way, you know?
L483956 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Sure I do.
L483955 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Yeah, but that's an old story, you don't want to hear it.
L483954 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ It's just you and your dad, right?
L483953 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Yeah.  I'm so glad we did this.
L483952 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ That's cool then.
L483951 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Yeah, but I feel like I fit in for the first time, you know? Like I just held them far away from me, and they did the same to me.
L483950 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ They knew of you.  Now they know you.
L483949 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Nobody knew me before tonight.
L483948 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Mine say stuff like "Lloyd, see you around maybe"
L483947 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Alright, this is some of the things they wrote me; "Glad I finally met you", "You always seemed nice", "Wish I could have known you more"...
L483944 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Bye.
L483943 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Have a good sleep.
L483929 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I hereby surrender my duties as keymaster, give me a beer.
L483928 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Thank-you.
L483901 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ It's the worst job since keymaster.
L483900 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ He does this every year?
L483898 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Yeah.
L483897 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ So we can finally talk?
L483819 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ No.
L483818 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ So it's an honor?
L483817 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Yeah, I have to judge who can drive home and who can't. I have to keep their keys.
L483816 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Keymaster?
L483805 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ No.
L483804 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Oh.  Um, would it be terrible if I wanted to go home early?
L483803 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ They're Bavarian Death style  pretzels.
L483802 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ What are these?
L483801 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Yeah
L483800 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Would you hold this for me?
L483799 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Whoa.
L483788 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Goodbye.
L483787 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Goodbye.
L483786 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Eight. Eight O' clock.
L483785 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Eight.
L483784 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Alright.  This is really great.  Alright, we're going out. It's a date.  It's a scam.  Whatever, whatever, alright, I'll pick you up at what, eight O' clock?
L483783 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ You will?  Excellent, alright, this is great.  You will, really?
L483782 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ I'll go.
L483781 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Pardon me?
L483780 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ I'll go.
L483779 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.
L483778 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Well...
L483777 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Y'know, you're not in England yet, you know that of course, and by the way, I want to just tell you that I lived in England for a few months,
L483776 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Actually, I think that I...
L483775 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Look Diane, I'm sorry, but I can't allow you to leave the country without going to Valhere's graduation party.  This gentleman, he's twenty-two, and he comes out of hiding once a year for this occasion, and he dresses up as the Lakeside rooster, and he,
L483774 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Hmmm....
L483773 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ What about tonight then, are you going to that party at Valhere's?
L483772 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Well, not monumentally.
L483771 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ So you're monumentally busy?
L483770 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Saturday, I have some things to do around the house.
L483769 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Are you busy on Saturday?
L483768 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Yeah, I have to help my father.
L483767 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Are you busy on Friday?
L483766 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Yes.  Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks.
L483765 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Busy?
L483764 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Oh, thanks, but I'm busy.
L483763 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Okay, um, so it's Lloyd and... uh... uh... let's go out.  Do you wanna go out?
L483762 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ No, I read it on the message.
L483761 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You remember?
L483760 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.
L483759 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Quick question - do you know who I am?
L483758 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Yeah.
L483757 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Yeah.
L483756 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Yeah.  What a day.
L483755 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Whoah, what a day, huh?
L483754 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Thank you very much.
L483753 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Yeah.  I just wanted to congratulate you on your scholarship to England, and I wanted to tell you that I thought your speech was really incredible.
L483752 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Yeah?
L483751 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Yeah.  I read about your fellowship in the paper, and I'm very glad you called me back.
L483750 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Hi.  You called me?
L483749 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ No noise, no sound, no movement, nothing!  Hello, Diane?
L483644 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Look at those eyes.
L483643 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Thank-you.  The real world.
L484294 +++$+++ u7443 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ You've gotta get her out of your head, man.
L484293 +++$+++ u7438 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ GUY 2 +++$+++ You're freaking out here man.
L484286 +++$+++ u7438 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ GUY 2 +++$+++ Man, you're bringing me down!
L484285 +++$+++ u7443 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Hey man, I was in love once.  I got hurt really bad.  I never wanna go through that again.
L484284 +++$+++ u7438 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ GUY 2 +++$+++ Man, you never had a chance with a girl like that.
L484283 +++$+++ u7443 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ It's your castle, man.
L484271 +++$+++ u7443 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Your only mistake is that you didn't dump her first.  Diane Court is a showpony.  You need a stallion, my friend.  Walk with us and you walk tall.
L484270 +++$+++ u7438 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ GUY 2 +++$+++ Man, all you gotta do is find a girl who looks just like her, nail her, and then dump her man, get her off your mind.
L483791 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Work that jab, work that hook, work that jab, okay, take a break, take a break.

L483681 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Hook up the jab, hook up the jab.
L483680 +++$+++ u7439 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ No my brother, you have to go buy your own.
L483679 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ He's back.  Hey my brother, can I borrow a copy of your 'Hey Soul Classics'?
