L644828 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ It's in the bible, see. You better go buy him a present. Please, Natalie. Let me give him the gift; Cuban cigars--Davidoff, his favorite and hard to get.
L644827 +++$+++ u8841 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ First of all, Mr. Fox, you can't just come barging in here. And what makes you think it's his birthday?
L644826 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ ...And you're even lovelier than I pictured. I brought a birthday present for Mr. Gekko.
L644825 +++$+++ u8841 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ NATALIE +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L644824 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Hello, Natalie, you recognize the voice? I'll give you a hint, you're thinking seriously about marrying me...
L645349 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Good. Then call him back. And call me back. Don't worry.
L645348 +++$+++ u8835 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DIXON +++$+++ I don't know anything!
L645347 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yes! Read the Constitution, it's all in there. And remember--you don't know anything, nothing.
L645346 +++$+++ u8835 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DIXON +++$+++ You sure?
L645345 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ They won't. That's not their jurisdiction.
L645344 +++$+++ u8835 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DIXON +++$+++ What if they call him?
L645343 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Tell 'em your father gave it to you.
L645342 +++$+++ u8835 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DIXON +++$+++ What if he asks where I got the money?
L645341 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Look Dixon, calm down! It's not illegal to buy stock or to be right. And it's not all that unusual to be spot checked on a big buy. Tell him you did your homework and you thought the stock was a sound investment.
L645340 +++$+++ u8835 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DIXON +++$+++ I told him I was in the bathroom and I'd call him right back. What the hell was I supposed to say Buddy, you got me into...
L645339 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What'd you tell him?
L645338 +++$+++ u8835 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DIXON +++$+++ ...this guy who said he was from the Security Exchange Commission, whatever the hell that is, calls and wants to ask me about that stock I bought...
L645252 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ No, no Dixon, my client wants to buy a large, large block of stock and needs to spread it around. I'll park some money in your account and if it hits, you get a big cut. I'm telling you, this is the easiest money you ever made...
L645251 +++$+++ u8835 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DIXON +++$+++ Sure, and I'm never gonna die either, is this one of your chain letter schemes or do I gotta buy a door to door cosmetic franchise in Northern Arkansas?
L644959 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ It's ready to take off. I'd jump all over it if I were you.
L644958 +++$+++ u8837 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ So you're hot on this stock?
L644957 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Rising profits...strong balance sheets, good earnings per share.
L644956 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Let's see, it closed at uh, 41 1/8...  Up a quarter...very attractive... about average yield...
L644955 +++$+++ u8837 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ I got this guy who should know tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I been burned on tips. What do you think Bud?
L644954 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Like? Uh...hmmm. Well...
L644953 +++$+++ u8837 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Want some?  Gordon tells me you're a very talented broker. What do you like?
L644952 +++$+++ u8837 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Wherever you like, Lutece, 21, the River Cafe...or maybe we can just drive around for a while.  Work up an appetite.
L644951 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ So, where are we going?
L644950 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ We are?
L644949 +++$+++ u8837 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Didn't he tell you?  That's so like Gordon. Get dressed, we're going out.
L644948 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Lisa. Gordon? Oh, Mr. Gekko. Sure. Would you, uh, like to come in?
L644947 +++$+++ u8837 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Hello Bud, I'm Lisa, a friend of Gordon's.
L645364 +++$+++ u8843 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ You're just the President of the company, what do you know? ... Come on.
L645363 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ He never told me...
L645362 +++$+++ u8843 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ Gekko asked us into the Bluestar deal. We're reviewing the timetables, wanna come?
L645360 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Sure Roger, whatever you want, it's cool.
L645359 +++$+++ u8843 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ Alright... I just wanna slow down Bud... no more calls for awhile, no lunches... we suspend our business, alright...
L645358 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ ....Relax Roget  You're 82M in the account numbers and I'm the Invisible Man... they're always looking for red flags, Gekko's always getting checked by them, they never come up with anything... we're invulnerable on this...
L645357 +++$+++ u8843 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ ...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy...
L645356 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ So what's the problem?
L645254 +++$+++ u8843 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ All right, Bud... let's do it.
L645253 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ ...and you don't have to put up a dime, Roger.
L645164 +++$+++ u8843 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ Too much to do...but I'll walk you out.
L645163 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ More money than you ever dreamed, Roger. And the thing is no one gets hurt...how bout a beer?
L645162 +++$+++ u8843 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ ...and if I did, what's in it for moi?
L645161 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it but you don't know, you don't know.
L645160 +++$+++ u8843 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ Yeah, right...
L645159 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Who's listening? It's just one college buddy talking to another.
L645158 +++$+++ u8843 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you?
L645157 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What about you, I hear you guys are handling the Fairchild Foods merger and it may not be going through. Any surprises I haven't read about in the Wall Street Journal?
L645156 +++$+++ u8843 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ Okay.
L645155 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's still not over.
L645154 +++$+++ u8843 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ So, does "this guy" have a tip for an honest lawyer?
L645153 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ "What are you thinking?"...that was it. The hours are hell, but the money's starting to tumble in. I know this guy who's got an iron- clad way to make money, I can't lose and I can't get hurt.
L645152 +++$+++ u8843 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ What was that?
L645151 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Nah, she asked the wrong question.
L645150 +++$+++ u8843 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ Can't complain. Got a house in Oyster Bay. Market treating you good? Still seeing that sexy French gal?
L645149 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you're moving up in the world. An associate already. Not bad. How's Margie?
L645148 +++$+++ u8843 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ Fox, Bud D. is this deja vu or has it really been a year. You're not hitting me up for NYU are you?
L645532 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ You sandbagged me on Bluestar.  I guess you think you taught the teacher a lesson, that you can make the tail wag the dog, huh?
L645531 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Gordon.
L645530 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Hello Bud.
L645518 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Dump it.
L645517 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Gordon, it's two minutes to close. What do you want to do?! Decide.
L645393 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Are you with me Buddy?
L645392 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ ...I can't make it tonight.
L645391 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Believe me, Buddy, I was gonna discuss this with you at the right time. Look, why don't you calm down and come to the apartment for dinner tonight. Bring Darien...
L645390 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Obviously...
L645389 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ The richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds of it comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do -- stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. Ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth. I create nothing; I own. We make the rules, Buddy, the news, war, peace, famine, upheaval; the cost of a paper clip.  We pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it...  ...you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you, Buddy? It's the free market. You're one of us now...take advantage of it. You got the killer instinct, kid, stick with me. I got things to teach you...
L645388 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ How much is enough Gordon?
L645387 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Buddy, it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game, sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for $600,000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. Capitalism at its finest.
L645386 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough?
L645385 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ It's all about bucks, kid, the rest is conversation...  Bud, you're still going to be president. And when the time comes, you'll parachute out a rich man. With the money you're going to make, your father won't have to work another day in his life.
L645384 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ If these people lose their jobs, nowhere to go. My father worked at Bluestar for twenty-four years. I gave 'em my word.
L645383 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind.
L645382 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Why do you need to wreck this company?
L645381 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ You're walking around blind without a cane, sport. A fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place.
L645380 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Maybe you ought to read him Pinocchio. You told me you were going to turn Bluestar around. Not upside down. You used me.
L645379 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Last night I read Rudy the story of Winnie the Pooh and the Honey pot. Know what happened: he stuck his nose in that honey pot once too often and got stung.
L645378 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I found out about the garage sale down at Bluestar. Why?
L645377 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ What the hell do you want?
L645375 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I'm sorry, this can't wait.
L645374 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ I didn't know we had a meeting schedule for this morning.
L645319 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Sure. What's worth doing is worth doing for money. It's a bad bargain where nobody gains. And if this deal goes through, we all gain.
L645318 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Now, wait a minute, Dad...
L645292 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Fox.
L645291 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ And I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Gekko, and his lawyer, Mr. Salt.
L645283 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Alright... Susan, get Buckingham on the box. I want him to look at it. And tell Jock Taylor at Thwick, Jensen...  So sport, the falcon has heard the falconer...tell me more...
L645282 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I can talk to these people Gordon, they trust me...and my father can be a big help in getting cuts.
L645281 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ What makes you think you can?
L645280 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ The three unions. It's 43% of Bluestar's operating budget, the hourly cost of a flight crew is $850 an hour, that's the real hidden value G.G., if you can negotiate that out, get a crew down to $350-400 an hour a run, this airline is gonna be the hottest thing since Texas Air...
L645279 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ What does that mean?
L645278 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Gordon, I worked at Bluestar, I know my way around, I have friends there...inside.
L645277 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ I'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline. It's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn Teldar Paper around, what do I need this dink airline for? I'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake.
L645276 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Gordon what I want--and I never asked you for anything--is to be your co-pilot on this. I want to take this airline, turn it around, and make it work. It's gonna make us a fortune!
L645273 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yeah aren't you forgetting something Gordon: rule one, capital reserves. This company has $75 million cash in an overfunded pension. That buys us a lot of credibility...  ...and the beauty is you already own close to two percent of this sucker...
L645272 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Mixed emotions, Buddy: like Larry Wildman going off a cliff in my new Maserati. Men as smart as myself have got their asses handed to them on a sling with the airlines, fuel could go up, unions are killers...
L645186 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I think I got some friends that won't mind making some easy money...
L645185 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ The art of which is deception. Spread the buy orders through different accounts and you won't get burned...
L645175 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Close to two million.  But this sucker can go all the way to Devon and the nationals.
L645174 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ How much?
L645173 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Got him at an auction in Kentucky.
L645147 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Yeah, I'm gonna make you rich, Bud Fox. I'm gonna make you rich enough you can afford a girl like Darien. Remember, power is the best aphrodisiac. This is your wake-up call. Go to work.
L645146 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ ...Gordon.
L645145 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ You don't understand. I want to be surprised...astonish me, sport, new info, don't care where or how you get it, just get it... My wife tells me you put a move on Darien. Here's some inside info for you. That Euroflash GQ guy she's going with's got big bucks but he's putting her feet to sleep. Exit visas are imminent. So don't lose your place in line.  Oh, jeez, I wish you could see this. The lights coming up over the water. I've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment.  ...an old Russian proverb - "a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar." I like you sport, I ever tell you that... Gordon, call me Gordon from now on.
L645144 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Mr. Gekko, I'm there for you 110%.
L645143 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Money never sleeps pal. When I came in in '69, they traded six hours a day, now the clock don't stop, London's deregulated, the Orient is hungrier than us. Just let the money circle the world, sport, buying and selling, and if you're smart it comes back paying. I just made $800,000 in Hong Kong gold. It's been wired to you -- play with it. You done good, but you gotta keep doing good. I showed you how the game works, now school's out.
L645141 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ You're learning, sport...
L645140 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ "All warfare is based on deception..." Sun Tzu says, If your enemy is superior, evade him, if angry, irritate him, if equally matched, fight... if not, split and reevaluate.
L645139 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ He's right. I had to sell. The key to the game is your capital reserves. You don't have enough, you can't pee in the tall weeds with the big dogs.
L645133 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ But we don't want to be greedy now, so let's let him have it at $72.
L645132 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ The break up value is higher. It's worth 80.
L645123 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Stick around... Larry, one of my "gang" -- Bud Fox.
L645122 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I guess I'll head back...
L645068 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Allright. Wait here...
L645067 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Sorry, Mr. Gekko.
L645063 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ ...Can't it wait? I'm good for it.  ...Awright. Come out, get the directions from Natalie and hurry up.
L645062 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ My firm needs your signature on these option agreements tonight, sir, otherwise we could take a real bath tomorrow.
L645061 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ You're walking between the raindrops kid. I expect Sir Larry is choking on his royal chamber pot by now.
L645060 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ ...we have 37.2 million invested. At this point, we're up 3.1 million and some change. If it goes to 75 bucks we can clean close to 12 mill.
L645059 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ I'll be right there, fix them a drink.
L645056 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Don't expect to get it all, sport, you'll burn out. First rule of business is never get emotional about stock, clouds the judgment. Where do we stand?
L645055 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I got all I could get which was 750,000 shares plus 5000 March 50 calls. Average price of $47 a share And $4 per contract for the call. I just wish I could've got more.
L644990 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ What about it? You work hard. I'll bet you stayed up all night analyzing that dog you bought. And where'd it get you?... my father worked hard too like an elephant pushing electrical supplies. And he dropped dead at 49 with a heart attack and a tax bill and the bank pissed on his grave and took the house; my mom ended up working in a dish factory... Wake up pal, if you're not inside you're outside. And I'm not talking a $200,000 a year working Wall Street stiff flying first class and being "comfortable", I'm talking rich pal, rich enough to fly in your own jet, rich enough not to waste time, 50-100 million, a player Bud -- or nothing. You had what it takes to let through my door. Next question: You got what it takes to stay...??
L644989 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What about hard work?
L644988 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Inside information. Oh you mean like when a father tells his son about a court ruling on an airline? Or someone overhears me saying I'm gonna buy Teldar Paper? Or the chairman of the board of XYZ suddenly knows it's time to blow out XYZ. You mean that?  I'm afraid sport, unless you got a father on the board of directors of another company, you and I are gonna have a hard time doing any business...
L644987 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Follow him? Mr. Gekko I...  It's not what I do. I could lose my license. If the SEC found out, I could go to jail. It's inside information, isn't it?
L644986 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture...
L644985 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I don't understand.
L644984 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Revenge is a dish best served cold... well, it's payback time, sport.  ... see that building? I bought into it ten years ago. It was my first real estate deal. I sold it a couple of years later and made an $800,000 dollar profit. It was better than sex. At that time I thought that was all tne money in the world...  Now, it's a day's pay ... I had a mole in Wildman's employ. Gave me half the picture, then he got fired...
L644983 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I remember that deal. You were involved?
L644982 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right out from under me. Wildman the white knight.
L644981 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ 'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders.
L644980 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Know the name?
L644976 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yes...
L644975 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ The most valuable commodity I know of is information. Wouldn't you agree on that?
L644974 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What? How do you know about my father?
L644973 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ I guess your father's not a union representative on that company.
L644972 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Uh, Mr. Gekko, we took a little loss today. We got stopped out on Tarafly...  ...about 50 thousand.
L644971 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Yeah... not bad for a City College boy. Bought my way into this club and now every one of these ivy league schmucks is sucking my kneecaps...I just got on the Board of the Zoological Society, cost me a million; that's the thing with WASPS -- they like animals but they can't stand people!
L644970 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Nice club, Mr. Gekko...
L644968 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ ...finish out the game, Bud, push yourself...
L644967 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Mr. Gekko, I don't think I can...go on.
L644966 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ ...come on sport, you gotta try harder, I need some exercise for chrissake...
L644945 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Excuse me sir.
L644944 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ ...put the rest of it in a money market account for now. I want to see what you know before I invest it...and save the cheap salesman talk, it's obvious.
L644943 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Mr. Gekko -- thank you for the chance. You won't regret this, you're with a winner.
L644939 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Sure...relax sport, no one's gonna blow a whistle. Here, is this legal?...you wanna put it in my account?
L644938 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ No sir, that would've been illegal...
L644937 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Teldar's shooting up. Buy any for yourself? Bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office.
L644936 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Bluestar was at 21 and an eighth when I left the office. It might spin up to 25 by the bell...
L644935 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ ...for my kid Rudy -- 3 years old, electronics freak, got a liquid crystal display 'stead of an electronic beam. We're going into a new age pal. So how's business today.
L644934 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ ...I can't even see it...
L644933 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ See this? Can you believe it? Two inch screen...
L644929 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Nice to see you again Mr. Gekko.
L644928 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Hi sport.
L644874 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Bud Fox, I look at a hundred ideas a day. I choose one.
L644873 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ My home number's on the back...
L644868 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I know...the decision'll clear the way for new planes and route contracts. There's only a small float out there, so you should grab it. Good for a five point pop.
L644867 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ How do you know?
L644866 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ There was a crash last year. They just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't know.
L644865 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ ...don't like airlines, lousy unions...
L644864 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ A comer. 80 medium-body jets. 300 pilots, flies northeast, Canada, some Florida and Caribbean routes... great slots in major cities...
L644863 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ ...rings a bell somewhere. So what?
L644855 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ It's a dog, what else you got, sport, besides connections at the airport?
L644854 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Chart break-out on this one here...uh Whitewood-Young Industries...low P.E. Explosive earnings. 30% discount from book. Great cash flow. Coupla 5% holders. Strong management.
L644853 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ So whatta you got for me, sport? Why are you here?
L644852 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko.
L644851 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ ...A cosmetics company by any chance? What are you, the 12th man on the deal team? The last to know?
L644850 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ ...Yeah, and we're working on some other interesting stuff.
L644849 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ ...going places, good junk bond department, you got the financing on that Syndicam deal.
L644848 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Jackson, Steinem...
L644847 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ So what firm you with, pal?
L644846 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you...
L644845 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure. Has an LCD readout, and it's cost effective -- less than one visit to the doctor.
L644844 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh no, no...
L644843 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ So what s on your mind kimosabe? Why am I listening to you? Got to monitor my blood pressure, so whatever you do, don't upset me.
L644841 +++$+++ u8836 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ GEKKO +++$+++ So you say. Nice to meet you; hope you're intelligent. Like these, how'd you get these? 
L644840 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ How do you do Mr. Gekko. I'm Bud Fox.
L645556 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ I figure a guy who's made some mistakes should be able to understand a girl who's made some of her own...
L645555 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Why?
L645554 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ Hi.
L645417 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Get the hell out!
L645416 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ You may not believe this Bud but I really do care for you. I think we could've made a good team...but that's how it goes...
L645413 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I'm looking...and I sure don't like what I see.
L645412 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ You're not exactly pure Bud, you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me. Look in the mirror before...
L645411 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You really mean that?  What'd he promise you? To take you public? I guess without Gordon's money and seal of approval, I'm not such a hot investment anymore. You're just the best money can buy, Darien...
L645409 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What the hell's that supposed to mean?
L645408 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ I'm not looking to just survive. I've been doing that all my life.
L645407 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I can stay with the brokerage firm. And you're doing fine. We can survive without Gordon Gekko.
L645406 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ Are you mad! Why are you doing this! We're so close, the town is going to be ours. Don't throw away your future Bud!
L645405 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ At least I wouldn't be pulling the trigger.
L645404 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you. You've worked hard to get where you are. If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar someone else will; and who's to say they won't do the same thing.
L645403 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I'm not gonna let it happen Darien.
L645402 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ Buddy, it's not your fault, and it's not your decision.
L645401 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. I handed it to him on a silver platter. I told my father and those people...
L645400 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ I'm sorry. I was afraid something like this could happen.
L645270 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Fear. The fear of being poor I guess, just like you, Darien... But that's all gonna change sweetheart. I'm catching the express...  ... and you're going along for the ride.
L645269 +++$+++ u8834 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ DARIEN +++$+++ So did I, till I hit 19 and found I had all the royal habits and no throne. Mom got by but I had to go to work just like you. Only the skills I had were shopping and making friends. So...that's why I do what I do, what makes you tick, Buddy?
L645268 +++$+++ u8830 +++$+++ m599 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ ...that changes all my plans, I thought you were loaded...
