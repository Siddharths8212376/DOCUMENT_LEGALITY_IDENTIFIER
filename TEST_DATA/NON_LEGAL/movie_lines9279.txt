L399944 +++$+++ u2200 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SOFIE +++$+++ You've got a funny idea of funny.
L399943 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Okay then... Are you positive your mother's a bitch?  Just kidding.
L399942 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Negative thinking makes everything more difficult. If you're going to have enough strength to do this, we have to talk only about positive things. All right?
L399941 +++$+++ u2200 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SOFIE +++$+++ What?
L399940 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Please... forgive me.
L399939 +++$+++ u2200 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SOFIE +++$+++ Oh, we've all disappointed her. Me, especially, but Dad, of course. She thinks my brother's all right, but she didn't expect much. It's what happens when you "marry beneath yourself"...
L399938 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Something's bothering her.
L399937 +++$+++ u2200 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SOFIE +++$+++ We don't discuss it.
L399936 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Is she against you getting help?
L399935 +++$+++ u2200 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SOFIE +++$+++ Is that the technical description of what I've got?
L399934 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Maybe... but you're the one whose ass is dragging.
L399933 +++$+++ u2200 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SOFIE +++$+++ She's not in a bad mood. She's like that all the time.  It doesn't bother me anymore. It's my dad and my brother I worry about.
L399932 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ People usually have to get to know me before they hate me.
L399931 +++$+++ u2200 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SOFIE +++$+++ Mom's such a cutie.
L399918 +++$+++ u2200 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SOFIE +++$+++ Oh boy... this should be interesting.
L399917 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ We'll turn back anytime you want.
L399916 +++$+++ u2200 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SOFIE +++$+++ I'm not making any promises.
L399847 +++$+++ u2200 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SOFIE +++$+++ Can I ask you something?  Didn't you tell my dad you didn't think it was a good idea to come to the patient?  So what changed?
L399846 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Maybe you'll catch it.
L399845 +++$+++ u2200 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SOFIE +++$+++ Is it contagious? 'Cause everyone agrees my immune system's way down.
L399844 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ No one ever thought so. You must bring it out.
L399843 +++$+++ u2200 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SOFIE +++$+++ You have the best answer for everything.  You seem so... hopeful. Are you always this sunny?
L399842 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ We'll work it out.
L399841 +++$+++ u2200 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SOFIE +++$+++ I don't think I can afford it. I don't want my dad paying.
L399840 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ We'll take it slow. You'll never feel you can't handle it.
L399839 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ I'll come to you. We'll try a little walking.
L399838 +++$+++ u2200 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SOFIE +++$+++ I don't know. I barely made it today.
L399837 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ We... we would try several things. But I need to see you a lot.
L399836 +++$+++ u2200 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SOFIE +++$+++ What would you do?
L399835 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ I don't know what's real and what isn't. That's never been my strong suit. But if you're tired all the time and you've had to give up the life you were having and come back home when you didn't want to... that's worth trying to fix. Maybe I can help you do that.
L399834 +++$+++ u2200 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SOFIE +++$+++ Even if you don't think it's real?
L399833 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Hmm, as in -- that's interesting. Sometimes, with enough clues, it's possible to figure these things out.
L399832 +++$+++ u2200 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SOFIE +++$+++ Hmm? Is that a professional opinion?
L399831 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Hmm.
L399830 +++$+++ u2200 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SOFIE +++$+++ No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite.
L399829 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?
L399828 +++$+++ u2200 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SOFIE +++$+++ That's okay. Maybe it is. My mother always says -- "Everything that's wrong with you is in your head." I suppose that's true.
L399827 +++$+++ u2200 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SOFIE +++$+++ I saw it. I saw it in your eyes.
L399826 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ No.
L399825 +++$+++ u2200 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SOFIE +++$+++ You think that now! You think it's a bunch of hooey, don't you?
L399824 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ What?
L399823 +++$+++ u2200 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SOFIE +++$+++ About six months ago, I guess it is now. God, it seems like years. What a bore! I'm embarrassed by it. Before this happened -- when I'd hear people talk about this kind of thing -- I thought it was a bunch of bullshit.
L399822 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ When did you start to feel this way?
L399821 +++$+++ u2200 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SOFIE +++$+++ Oh, lord. It's almost too exhausting to tell you...  ...about my exhaustion. I didn't really want to come. I'm not hopeful right now. But I couldn't take the look on my dad's face. He's a truly kind person, which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story. He's the opposite of me, I guess -- all stamina and resolve.
L399820 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ What can you tell me about this?
L399819 +++$+++ u2200 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SOFIE +++$+++ I'd better not, I'll fall right to sleep. I think it's too soon for me to be sleeping with you.
L399818 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Feel free to lie down. Most people do.
L400430 +++$+++ u2197 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ NESSA +++$+++ He's pitiful, Doc, a goddam puppy. I don't know how much longer I can put up with it. I already got two arms and legs, I don't need another appendage.
L400429 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ He agreed?
L400428 +++$+++ u2197 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ NESSA +++$+++ I don't know if I can quit. We're gonna try it together, like, you know, AA or something. And I made him give up his .22. No more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune.
L400427 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Really?
L400426 +++$+++ u2197 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ NESSA +++$+++ I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns me. And the last thing was insane. I don't know what's wrong with him... No magazines.
L400425 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ No again?
L400424 +++$+++ u2197 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ NESSA +++$+++ ...What balls on this guy? What're we...  ...going steady? Jesus.
L400422 +++$+++ u2197 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ NESSA +++$+++ First off, he tells me to stop smoking cigarettes. I told him abso-fuckin'- lutely no. As you can see --
L400421 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ What did he want you to do?
L400420 +++$+++ u2197 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ NESSA +++$+++ He said -- "Which we already knew!"
L400419 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ What'd he say?
L400418 +++$+++ u2197 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ NESSA +++$+++ ...I mean, Doc, the dude is seriously deluded. I said that to him, I said, "If you think I'm gonna do all that shit for you, man, you are seriously deluded."
L400193 +++$+++ u2197 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ NESSA +++$+++ No. I don't know what he wants. But I know I don't like being watched. Nobody's ever paid any attention to what I did, and I liked it just fine. Where does he get off telling me I disrespect myself?  Fuck him. Look in a mirror, bozo.
L400192 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Do you think that's what he wants?
L400191 +++$+++ u2197 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ NESSA +++$+++ There's this kid at school... Martin Brockett. He has some gigantic idea of himself that no one else shares. You wouldn't believe the crap he lays on me... Who appointed him my spiritual leader? If he has everything so figured out how come his best friend is a .22 rifle? And why's he spend all his time chasing after me? Probably thinks I'm gonna give him a hummer...
L400189 +++$+++ u2197 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ NESSA +++$+++ This shrink school you went to... did you hear about it on an infomercial?
L400188 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L400187 +++$+++ u2197 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ NESSA +++$+++ I don't think you know what you're talking about.
L400186 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ True. Should we stop them?
L400185 +++$+++ u2197 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ NESSA +++$+++ These appointments were not my idea, remember.
L400184 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Was it something that happened at school?
L400183 +++$+++ u2197 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ NESSA +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L400182 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ What happened today?
L400181 +++$+++ u2197 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ NESSA +++$+++ I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
L400180 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ If you don't want to have a session today, it's okay.
L400179 +++$+++ u2197 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ NESSA +++$+++ What are you doing? We're not done. I just need to find the thing...
L400178 +++$+++ u2197 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ NESSA +++$+++ Just chill for a second. Look at this guy, it appears he's actually dead... but gorgeous.
L400177 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ What do you want me to see?
L400176 +++$+++ u2197 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ NESSA +++$+++ Isn't she amazing? That is such a wicked look.
L399690 +++$+++ u2197 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ NESSA +++$+++ It's a really weird thing for a shrink to say... and then you said maybe people'd be happier if they'd accept that some things don't change -- that it'd be some kind of a relief or something...
L399689 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ That's not quite what I said --
L399688 +++$+++ u2197 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ NESSA +++$+++ I knew you wouldn't answer. I've been thinking about what you said last time. How me trying to lose weight -- and constantly not -- is like a lot of people with addictions. How maybe I can't lose the weight, ever...  Which we already knew...
L399687 +++$+++ u2197 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ NESSA +++$+++ Have women found you attractive?
L399686 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ You been spying on me in the supermarket, Nessa?
L399685 +++$+++ u2197 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ NESSA +++$+++ Where?... The New York Times. The first one was -- "he handles produce well." Which we already knew!  The point is, you have a lot of the signs.
L399684 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Where was this?
L399683 +++$+++ u2197 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ NESSA +++$+++ Fuck the community.  There was this article my friends and I read. It was "25 Signs He's Great in Bed". It was very fascinating.
L399682 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ It's my bit for the community.
L399681 +++$+++ u2197 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ NESSA +++$+++ Pro boner?  Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly?
L399680 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ It's called pro bono.
L399679 +++$+++ u2197 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ NESSA +++$+++ The school board doesn't pay you? What kind of deal is that?
L399677 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ It's a big part of the show.
L399676 +++$+++ u2197 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ NESSA +++$+++ Don't do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.
L399675 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Why do you think you tell me, Nessa?
L399674 +++$+++ u2197 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ NESSA +++$+++ Monthly! God, how shallow do you think Brad is? Why do I waste my time telling you this stuff?
L399673 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Weekly or monthly?
L399672 +++$+++ u2197 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ NESSA +++$+++ In maybe three or four issues.
L399671 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ What do you mean, "in no time"?
L399670 +++$+++ u2197 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ NESSA +++$+++ ...so he already had the tattoo that said, "Naomi Forever"... and now they're broken up, see, and he has to have it removed. But while the scar is still healing, or whatever you call it when you have a tattoo removed, he meets Chandra. And it's serious, immediate love. So in no time, he's gone from the most gorgeous model in the world to the most gorgeous actress in North America.
L400315 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Yep.
L400314 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ Hmm. I guess that doesn't help... I see where you're going here. It's a mess.
L400311 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ What?
L400310 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ Doc!... It's not me, is it?
L400308 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Yes, yes it does...
L400307 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ I guess that makes sense.
L400306 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Skip, you know that it's improper -- completely unethical -- for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients?
L400305 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ I'm here for you, Doc.
L400304 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Wow.
L400303 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ Sorry...
L400301 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ Oh, she doesn't know about it yet. Right now, of the two of us, I'm the only one in love. But I'm very stoked.
L400300 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Lily...  ...Skip, that's great! You and Lily.
L400299 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ Lily.
L400298 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ What'd I do?
L400297 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.
L400296 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Really?
L400295 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up.
L400294 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
L400293 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ This doesn't seem a little... perverse?
L400292 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden.
L400291 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ Pretty creepy, huh? Are you totally disgusted?
L400289 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ You want my advice? Far out!
L400288 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Skip, I've got a problem and I need some advice.
L400286 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ You're completely reliable.
L400285 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ Doc, there's something about what you told me the other night I can't get out of my head. It's driving me batty --  Why me? How did you know you could trust me?
L400284 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ I'm honored.
L400283 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ I've never brought anyone down here before.
L400147 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ See you Thursday... regular time.
L400146 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ Where ya going? I've got a million questions.
L400145 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ I understand what it's like to want to leave a problem behind. That's all most people are looking to do.  Mainly, I listen.
L400144 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ Jeez, man. But you're good at it!
L400143 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ English Lit.
L400142 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ Psych major?
L400141 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ No... no training.
L400140 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ But you studied psychology, right? You did the training and just never got the degree?
L400137 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Everything flows from that, and what doesn't... can be easily purchased.
L400136 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ And a birth certificate is enough?
L400134 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Oh. You got it backwards. I already had the name when I started looking for somewhere to settle. When I saw this town on a map, I thought maybe it was a sign. See...
L400133 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ "Mumford"... I mean, why pick the name of the town you were going to?
L400132 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ What about it?
L400129 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ All new people start with that...
L400128 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ I know it starts with a birth certificate...
L400127 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ You know how easy it is. A kid can manage it if he wants a fake I.D. You can do practically the whole deal at your local Kinko's. The only variable is how much pride you take in the product.
L400126 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ How'd you do it?  The new you.
L400125 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Who'd you go with?  That's not good.
L400124 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ I wish I could live in the shower. I'd take five a day if I had the time. I went to this spa in Germany, a sanitarium practically, up on this mountain. And the great thing -- they just kept you wet all day.
L400123 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ That'd be Lily.
L400122 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ Somebody's taking a shower down there.
L400119 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Harder than I thought. Took me three tries. But I was highly motivated -- figured there was no point in leaving me and taking that along. After two bomb-outs, I found a place in the desert...
L400118 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ And the drugs?
L400103 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ You and Candy...?
L400102 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Things got a lot worse.
L400101 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ At least you pulled yourself out...
L400100 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ Hey, you've done good. Look at yourself... you've cleaned up, you've got a career --
L400099 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ But look at me now...
L400098 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ You were messed up, man.
L400097 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ "Get to know your therapist."
L400096 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ Holy shit!
L400095 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Of course, him being insane didn't make it all right that I fell in love with his wife.
L400091 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Didn't need one. We didn't even need a warrant for most of the shit we did. Man, the IRS... we could go in your bank account, your credit cards... hell, we used to go into doctors' files and get all the juicy details. Nobody wants to argue with the IRS.
L400090 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ Did you carry a gun?
L400089 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ It wasn't the best situation.
L400088 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
L400087 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.
L400086 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ Sounds like you have several.
L400085 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Everybody has a story, Skip.
L400084 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ -- an investigator for the Internal Revenue Service?
L400083 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ Are you telling me your last job before becoming a psychologist was --
L400082 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ But there was one job that looked like it might be fun -- Investigator.
L400057 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ What about everything? How did this happen?
L400056 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ I can tell you anything else.
L400055 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ I've told you a lot of private stuff.
L400054 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ It matters to me.
L400053 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
L400052 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ Damn! What is your name?
L400051 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ It's time you did some talkin', Dr. Mum -- Wait a minute. That is your name, isn't it?
L400050 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Just you.
L400049 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ Who else knows?
L400045 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Oh, it's okay. It's just not something to be ashamed of. Maybe you don't want people knowing -- and believe me, it's safe with me -- but on the scale of dirty little secrets, I'd give it, say... a two.
L400044 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ It's not?
L400043 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Skip, that's not much of a secret.
L400042 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Definitely.
L400041 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ Really?
L400040 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Sounds like kind of a good idea.
L400039 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?
L400038 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ And that's your secret?  You meant -- like a trade secret?
L400037 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ You don't think I'm insane?
L400036 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ How's it coming?
L400035 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ No, Doc, not a doll. I am Panda. I'm talking about much, much more than a doll. The world has never seen what I'm talking about... except maybe in the movies.
L400034 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ A doll?
L400033 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ Sexual surrogate... slash... companion.
L400032 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Slash what?
L400031 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ No!... Although that's a good guess. No, what I've been working on, what the world really needs and no one has been able to create --  -- a virtually life-like, humanoid, gender-specific, anatomically functional... sexual surrogate slash companion.
L400030 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Jerking off?
L400029 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ Guess.  Go ahead, guess!
L400028 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ It's true, believe me. So... do you know what I've been doing, all alone, in my workshop, for almost two years?... Mr. Find-the-Need-and-Fill- It. How I spend my every solitary hour?
L400027 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Okay... let's say that, for now.
L400026 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ That's right. And you also know that even though I make 23% of the modems in the world... I cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me.
L400025 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ You are Panda, monarch of modems.
L400024 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ All right, I'm just gonna tell you, as simple and direct as I can.  And you understand that this is a big secret? Just between us?  Okay. You know I've got this gift for certain kinds of... machines.
L400022 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ Doc, I trust you! You've listened to me better than anybody... maybe ever.  And this secret I've got, I can't stand it anymore. I don't know if I'm some kind of --
L400021 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ -- Skip. Knowing what you do about me --
L400020 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ Yeah, well... what I was gonna tell you --
L400018 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ I trust you. Definitely. No question. But, yeah, I'm a little concerned. I mean, you're not supposed to tell anyone about your patients' problems... are you?
