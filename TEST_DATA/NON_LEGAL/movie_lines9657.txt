L119958 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Carmine? He was here before. I saw him. He had a suitcase and everything, and then he left.
L119954 +++$+++ u4343 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ Oh.
L119953 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yeah, I'm over here with him.

L119949 +++$+++ u4343 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ EDDY +++$+++ Hey, Nicky, how are you? What are you doin' here?
L121945 +++$+++ u4344 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ FBI AGENT #10 +++$+++ We can't help him if -
L121944 +++$+++ u4363 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ PISCANO'S WIFE +++$+++ Artie! Artie!
L121943 +++$+++ u4344 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ FBI AGENT #10 +++$+++ Stay out of the way!
L121942 +++$+++ u4363 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ PISCANO'S WIFE +++$+++ No, I won't calm down! He's my husband!
L121941 +++$+++ u4344 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ FBI AGENT #10 +++$+++ Calm down! Calm down!
L121940 +++$+++ u4363 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ PISCANO'S WIFE +++$+++ Artie!
L121891 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ But I'm just trying to leave.

L121888 +++$+++ u4345 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ FBI AGENT #2 +++$+++ We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting -
L121887 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ For what?
L121886 +++$+++ u4345 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ FBI AGENT #2 +++$+++ We're - we're placing you under arrest for -
L121567 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ Okay.  Frankie, you're a good boy.
L121566 +++$+++ u4358 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ MARINO +++$+++ I understand.
L121565 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ You see... I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything for people who are our friends. You understand?
L121564 +++$+++ u4358 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ MARINO +++$+++ No problem.
L121563 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ I'm askin' you, Frankie, to keep an eye on Nicky. Do it for me.
L121562 +++$+++ u4358 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ MARINO +++$+++ He's good. He's fine.
L121561 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ I want to know... if he's doin' all right. If he's okay.
L121560 +++$+++ u4358 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ MARINO +++$+++ Hm.
L121559 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky.
L121558 +++$+++ u4358 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ MARINO +++$+++ I'm positive.  Remo... things are very fucked up down there, you know?
L121557 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ Are you sure?
L121556 +++$+++ u4358 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ MARINO +++$+++ No. I ain't see anything like that.
L121555 +++$+++ u4358 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ MARINO +++$+++ So, I lied... even though I knew that by lyin' to Gaggi, I could wind up gettin' killed too.
L121554 +++$+++ u4358 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ MARINO +++$+++ Because there's one thing about these old timers: They don't like any fuckin' around with the other guy's wives. It's bad for business.
L121553 +++$+++ u4358 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ MARINO +++$+++ What could I say? I knew if I gave the wrong answer, I mean, Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of 'em could've would up gettin' killed.
L121552 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ Frankie... the little guy, he wouldn't be fuckin' the Jew's wife, would he? Because if he is... it's a problem.
L121551 +++$+++ u4358 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ MARINO +++$+++ I always tell you the truth, Remo.
L121550 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ I want you to tell me the truth, mind you.
L121549 +++$+++ u4358 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ MARINO +++$+++ Of course, Remo.
L121548 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth.
L121547 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ Frankie, I want to ask you something.
L120914 +++$+++ u4358 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ MARINO +++$+++ I'll tell him, Remo.
L120913 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ You gotta tell him... to take care of things a little better.
L120912 +++$+++ u4358 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ MARINO +++$+++ I know.
L120911 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ And I mean... that's no good.
L120910 +++$+++ u4358 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ MARINO +++$+++ What're you gonna do?
L120909 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ It's in all the papers.
L120908 +++$+++ u4358 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ MARINO +++$+++ I know.
L120907 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ Yeah. Everybody's talkin' about it. They're makin' a big deal out of it.
L120906 +++$+++ u4358 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ MARINO +++$+++ Yeah, I heard, yeah.
L120905 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ Frankie... they found a guy's head in the desert. Do you know about that?
L120488 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ E mo va! [Italian-American slang for 'Now, go!']
L120487 +++$+++ u4358 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ MARINO +++$+++ I'll take care of it, Remo.
L120486 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ ...I want all the names of all the other people he had with him. And I don't care what you have to do to him to get 'em. You understand?
L120475 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ Fine, fine.
L120474 +++$+++ u4358 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ MARINO +++$+++ How are you?
L120473 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ Hey, Frankie.
L120480 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ And how are things going down there?
L120479 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ But I knew how to keep the bosses happy. Whenever they gave me little jobs to do, you know, to send a message, I would carry things out...
L120478 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ Uh-huh. Good.
L119645 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Want me to take this for you? 
L119644 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ Fine.
L119643 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yeah.
L119642 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ Uh-huh. Mi raccomando. [Italian- American slang for 'I'm counting on you']
L119641 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ All right.
L119640 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ Not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains.  Okay?
L119639 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Mm.
L119638 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ Keep a good eye on him. He's makin' a lot of money for us. And he's gonna continue makin' a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him.
L119637 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Mm.
L119636 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ T'aggia parla. [Italian-American slang for 'I've got to talk to you'] Nicky... See that guy? 
L119635 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I'll be right out.
L119634 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ Hey, Nick. Vien acca. [Italian- American slang for 'Come here']
L119624 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Keepin' Remo happy with money was the greatest insurance policy in the world.
L119623 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ Ace.
L119616 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ That's enough now!
L119615 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I mean, unless Ace made his bet.
L119614 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ Ma che cazzo!
L119613 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ But back then the bosses didn't give a fuck about whether he enjoyed himself of not. To them, he was a cash register. All they had to do was ring the bell and take the money. Especially Remo, who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler who always lost.
L119558 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Definitely the most important guy in this room.
L119557 +++$+++ u4348 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GAGGI +++$+++ You got a round figure on it?
L121755 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Okay, yeah.
L121754 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ You fucked with me for the last time!
L121753 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ All right. Be careful.
L121752 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared anymore!
L121751 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ All right, all right.
L121750 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ I don't need you! I have my own fuckin' money!
L121749 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Get the fuck out of here.
L121742 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Get the fuck out of here. Get out! Get the fuck out!
L121741 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Ah, you fuck! You're such a fuckin' asshole!
L121739 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ How the fuck am I gonna get your fuckin' money now? You think he's gonna give you fuckin' money? Are you out of your mind?!  Look what you just did to this fuckin' guy! If you would have just kept your fuckin' mouth shut!  Ah, what the fuck is the use? I should've never got invol-
L121738 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ What about my money?
L121737 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Hey, don't be such a fuckin' smartass, will you?  I mean, I know the fuckin' guy thirty-five years, I'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you?  Fuck... motherfucker! I knew this, I knew it.
L121736 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Oh, well, then, have him killed and get it over with.
L121735 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I'm not gonna kill him. Shut the fuck up. What, do you know what you're talkin' about? I'm not killing anyb-
L121734 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ If it's so fuckin' dangerous, then why don't you kill him?
L121733 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I told you this was fuckin' dangerous. Remember I said, 'Ginger, this is a dangerous situation. Be very careful.' You fuckin' yessed me to death.
L121732 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Me? I said... nothin'. I said, I said, 'No, no, no.' Everything he said, I just kept sayin' no.
L121731 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What did I tell you? Supposing he goes back home and makes a fuckin' beef?  I gotta know exactly what you said. Tell me what you said to him.
L121498 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Yeah. Uh-huh -
L121497 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ It's what you want?

L121494 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Nicky, please...
L121493 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Mm... okay. Don't worry about it. Nobody'll fuck with ya anymore. I'll take care of ya.
L121492 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Yeah.
L121491 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ A sponsor.
L121490 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Yeah.
L121489 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Is that what you want?
L121488 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ I do. I need a new sponsor.
L121487 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ I need some help. I do. I need some help.  You gotta help me. I need a new sponsor, Nicky.
L121486 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Come on. Don't be scared.
L121485 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ I'm not and he scares the shit out of me. I never know what he's gonna do.
L121484 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yes, you are.
L121483 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ I'm not as tough as you think I am.
L121482 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this.  Don't cry.
L121481 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ He hates my fuckin' guts.
L121480 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Exactly.  He hates me.
L121479 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ He really thinks who the fuck he is, I'll tell you that.
L121478 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ No, he's not.
L121475 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Everything went to his head. 
L121474 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Sure did.
L121473 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yeah.  Boy, he really fucked himself up out here -  - didn't he?
L121472 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ 'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do.
L121471 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yes, you did.
L121470 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ I did what you told me to.
L121469 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You did. I like that. I like that. That's what I like about you. You did the right thing.
L121468 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Exactly.
L121467 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You did. You're right.
L121466 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ I didn't.  I didn't. I mean, I did, but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came right back.
L121465 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ No, he wouldn't. I would have.  And he'd've been right, too. I mean, seriously.  Well, there's one thing you don't do. You don't take a guy's kid and then take off.
L121464 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ He's so fuckin' lucky. I could have buried him. I could have gone to Europe and taken the baby. And then he'd've tracked me down and he'd've killed me.
L121463 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yeah, right. That's Sammy. And he's probably got it there too.
L121462 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.
L121461 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Hm.
L121460 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Yeah. 'Cause, you know,  He's never gonna give me my jewelry.
L121459 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You know?
L121458 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Mm-hm.
L121457 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ See who I got in there. Gotta get somebody I can trust.
L121456 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Okay.
L121455 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Let me think about that.
L121454 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank...  could help me get my jewelry out?  There's a lot of money in there. Lot of money in there, and I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
L121453 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yeah.
L121452 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Yeah?
L121451 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead.
L121450 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ I don't - 
L121449 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What were you gonna say? Go ahead.
L121448 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Nothin'.
L121447 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What? What?
L121446 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Oh, you're right, I know.  It's... well, I was just -
L121445 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I mean, listen, two people don't get along, at some point you gotta call it... I mean, it's none of my business, but I ... I think that's what you gotta do. You gotta take it somewhere -
L121317 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Bye.
L121316 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ And listen, don't do anything else crazy, okay? You all right? Okay.
L121315 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I'll be there.
L121314 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ So, I'm gonna call you back in an hour... at this number, and you're gonna be there, right?
L121313 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Yeah, uh-huh... Okay.
L121312 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You just relax, and call me back here in exactly an hour, on this phone, and I'll see what I can do.
L121311 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ No, I really do. I think he's gonna kill me.
L121310 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You just relax. Nobody's killin' anybody, do you hear?
L120642 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ It's all right.
L120641 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Thank you.
L120640 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yeah.
L120639 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Thanks.
L120638 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Come on, now, I don't want to see you unhappy.
L120637 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ You're so nice. 
L120636 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You're a beautiful girl. You don't want to ruin your looks. I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.
L120635 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Oh, come on.
L120634 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ And take it easy with this shit, will you? I mean, this can only make matters worse.
L120632 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Yeah.  Thanks.
L120631 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ All right?
L120630 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Okay.
L120629 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him.
L120628 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ He gives a fuck what I do?
L120627 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. He's jealous and worried.
L120626 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ He didn't have to hit him. It's not exactly like I'm sleepin' with the guy! And he makes me sneak around to see my own friends! What the fuck is that all about?
L120625 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ He could have killed him! Okay? He could have killed him.
L120624 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I understand that. But, you know, I think you should try to make the best of it now. Go slow, you know. See what happens.
L120623 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ I do.
L120622 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Listen, Ginger... you know, this is probably not... I don't have the answers anyway... and this is probably not what you want to hear right now, because you're a little upset with Ace.
L120621 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I know what you mean.
L120620 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ I should have never married him. He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini... duality.  Gemini's the snake. You know you can't trust the snake.  I mean it.
L120619 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Well, there you go. But what does that tell ya? A million dollars in jewelry. Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what?
L120618 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more. 
L120617 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all.
L120616 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Mm, you want to steal it? 
L120615 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? About how much?
L120614 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.
L120613 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I can see that. Sure.
L120612 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Am I right?
L120611 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Sure.
L120610 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Oh, come on. I went into this with my eyes open, you know. I knew the bottom could drop out at any time. I'm a working girl, right?  You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end.
L120609 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I never see - You know, I never seen him act like that with anybody else. I think he's crazy about you. I mean, he really loves you. He does.
L120608 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You know... the first time I ever saw your guys together... I never saw him so happy. I mean, I know he's a crazy Jew fuck and everything, but...
L120607 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so... so what?
L120606 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Oh, you did? I didn't know that.
L120605 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ No! No! I told him all about the guy before we ever got married. This is no fuckin' surprise.
L120604 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Well, you gotta understand it. He doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down or taking advantage of you.
L120603 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Yeah, no shit.
L120602 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I know it wasn't a nice thing to do but -
L120601 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Tell me.
L119895 +++$+++ u4359 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Okay, Sammy.
L119894 +++$+++ u4349 +++$+++ m289 +++$+++ GINGER +++$+++ Hi, how are you?
