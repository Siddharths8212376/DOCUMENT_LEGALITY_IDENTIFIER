L222075 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ No, we're not.
L222074 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ No.
L222073 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Very slow.  But we're not going to stop, are we?
L222072 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I'm not sure.
L222071 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ It's going to be slow from now on. Do you know what I mean, Harry?
L222068 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ I'd ask you to take me home, but I'm a faceless sinner.  ...You smell good, Harry. Familiar, you know? I'd ask you to take me home, but...
L222067 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Why do you say that?
L222066 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry...
L222065 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.
L222064 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ I got a new car. Only it's red. Did you know Mama died?
L222063 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Well... you're looking well.
L222062 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Oh, you...  ...ennh.
L222061 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ How did I look?
L222060 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
L222059 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
L222058 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ How... how ya doin', Farmer?
L222057 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Oh. Why, Harry York. How nice to see you.
L222056 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ C'mere. I want to talk to you.
L221970 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I hope so, Frances.
L221969 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ No, Harry, it's not time, it's us. You and me. And I'm telling you now that I'll come to you, okay? I'll find you. I will.
L221968 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Right. Except... time has a way of --
L221967 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Yes you do. If you love me you can wait, right? A month, six months, whatever it takes.
L221966 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I don't know.
L221965 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Oh please, Harry... don't even think it. You're the only person who ever... It's just... Can't you wait for me?
L221964 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Been a lot of years, you know. A long time waiting. For what? End up feeling like a sap.
L221962 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ I know, but... There were so many people in there, Harry. Every time I turned around someone was pressing against me... watching, looking over my shoulder, touching me, grabbing, sticking things into me. When I feel somebody near me now... anybody... my skin starts to crawl.
L221961 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You don't need to screw around anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother. You need me.
L221960 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Yeah. I don't know.
L221959 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ This is it, kid. This is our chance. When you got a chance, you better take it.
L221958 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Oh Harry...
L221957 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Where to?
L221938 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I love you too, Frances.
L221937 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ I love you, Harry. I love you.
L221917 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ ...Touch me again and I'll kill you, you pig.
L221916 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Frances, it's me, Harry?
L221915 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Who?
L221914 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Frances! Frances!
L221794 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ I got your number, Mister Man.
L221793 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Anyway... if you need me...
L221792 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ I know. Don't tell anyone.
L221791 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Frances, You're crazy.
L221790 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Yeah. It's just... something I gotta do, I guess.
L221789 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You give up on her?
L221788 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Thanks, Harry, really, but... I can't explain it. She's my mother. She's just... I can't give up on her that easy.
L221787 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ It's not too late to keep going, up to Vancouver? Be the smartest thing.
L221786 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Will you marry me?
L221785 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ What's that?
L221784 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ There's just one more thing.
L221783 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Well... I'll act like I do until I do.
L221782 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ I know a thing or two about marriage. You... you understand me more than anyone, Harry... maybe even more than Mama. But... you're too important to me. I'd fail you. I don't know how or why, but I would. And that's a chance I just can't take. Do you understand?
L221781 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask this one time. I mean it. I swear after this, I'll never ask again: Will you marry me?
L221780 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.
L221779 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Huh?
L221778 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Why are you always leaving me, Harry?
L221775 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ No. To thoroughbreds.
L221774 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ To quarter-horses.
L221773 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground.
L221772 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ What a man!
L221771 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Hey! Another shot for the lady and a double for me!
L221770 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Ohhh, that's lousy Scotch!
L221769 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ You can't drink.
L221768 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What's that?
L221767 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you.
L221766 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I guess.
L221765 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ You know something, Harry?
L221764 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's that!
L221763 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
L221762 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Frances, you're fulla drugs. You don't know what you're saying. Who do you think put you into Meadow Wood? Your mother thinks you're crazy and she'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her.
L221761 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Harry, I have to go home. I have to talk to Mama.
L221759 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ A misunderstanding, people taking the wrong meaning from things. I wasn't declaring war, Harry. I was just saying my prayers.
L221758 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Huh?
L221757 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ I don't know. Not a war exactly. It's more a... a misapprehension maybe...
L221756 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Whattaya think you're in now?
L221755 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ I don't think I'd be much good in a war...
L221754 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ ...Take advantage of me.
L221753 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ That's right.
L221752 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone...
L221751 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What?
L221750 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ I should've known...
L221749 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Couple hours from Idaho. We'll cut across to Montana. I've got friends there with a ranch.
L221748 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Where are we, mean man?
L221747 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Have I told you how mean you're turning, York?
L221746 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Forget it, Frances. You're not driving.
L221745 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ That sure looks like fun...  You know how long it's been since I was behind the wheel?
L221744 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Evening, gorgeous.
L221731 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You've looked a whole lot better. C'mon.
L221730 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Oh my God, I look awful.
L221556 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Who said I was a lady?
L221555 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Take a walk, pal.
L221549 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Well... to get a crack at something good, you gotta earn it, you gotta climb the ladder first. So you do, you work hard, and all these people behind you are pushing you up, shouting you on. And then one day you realize you are, you're at the top... and there's nothing there. And you look behind you and there's no one below. You're just left there all alone... swaying in the god-damned breeze.
L221548 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ And?
L221547 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ I just wanted to be part of something... one thing, one play or one movie, something that was really fine... memorable. And I could say: I did that, I made something good.
L221545 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You're coming.
L221544 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ No, Harry, I can't -- 
L221543 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Hey look, I got some business down in San Diego. Whattaya say you come with me, stay a few days?
L221541 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Beats me.
L221540 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what's going on inside their heads. Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really?
L221539 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ So you drink, and you fight with a cop...?
L221538 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt.
L221537 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I'll bet.
L221536 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ I took the early rounds.
L221535 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Six months' probation...? You gotta learn when to do battle, Farmer. You're not going to win many bouts with 200 pound cops.
L221534 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Well, I would have, you know? I just didn't know how to cook it.
L221533 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.
L221532 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What for?
L221531 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry.
L221530 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Nice joint. Can you afford it?
L221528 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Help yourself. Everyone else has.
L221527 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Think I'll have a glass.
L221526 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ What's left of my blood.
L221525 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Animal magnetism!  No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?
L221524 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ How the hell do you find me anyway?
L221463 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Harry, I hate being in love. I don't ever want to be in love again. I just hate it!
L221462 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Frances...
L221461 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Two lines! Two fucking lines! 'My wife returns from Europe tomorrow. I can't see you any more.' Just like that!
L221460 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Don't tell me what to do, just give me his head on a platter!
L221459 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Calm down, Frances.
L221458 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard.
L221457 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?
L221456 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Harry? Harry, where are you?!
L221291 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ I know.
L221290 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I'm serious, Frances. This is important.
L221289 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
L221288 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ The chauffeur. He's watching.
L221287 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.
L221286 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Don't start, Farmer.
L221284 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Come on, Cinderella, your pumpkin awaits.
L221283 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ The hell you will, Harry York.
L221282 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Tell you what. Let's ditch the limo. Let me drive you up to that red carpet in my beat up Chevy.
L221281 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Yeah, if I don't make too big an ass of myself.
L221280 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What're you gonna do, waste your talent? Why not use it to make something worthwhile. You can do that, you know?
L221279 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ But I don't want to be like that. I want to do something... 
L221278 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Some people starve, kid. Until we can do something about it, they might as well see a movie. Makes 'em feel better.
L221277 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ I don't have what they want, Harry.  Harry, will you tell me something? How can I keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?
L221276 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Frances, you're a movie star now. If you give them what they want, you can get anything.
L221275 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ No, they don't, do they?
L221274 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ If they say they love it, they'll probably love it. Not everybody lies, you know?
L221273 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ You know, the funny thing is: it's not a great movie. I mean it could've been, but they screwed it up, gave it a happy ending. And all my friends, I know they're going to smile and say they loved it.
L221272 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Forget it.
L221271 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid.
L221270 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Dick... and my mother! She acts like she's on Mars or something --
L221269 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You're telling me.
L221268 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Who ever thought they'd be right for once? Jesus, Harry... it's a zoo back there --
L221267 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Is that why you did it?
L221266 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Well, the studio told me not to.
L221265 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Shit. I meant the other way around.
L221210 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Hey that's great, Farmer, just great.
L221209 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Yeah.
L221208 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Serious, huh?
L221205 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Yeah? What is he -- muscleman? Lifeguard?
L221204 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Harry... I met someone.
L221203 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other.  For old time's sake.
L221202 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ I know what ability you're interested in.
L221201 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I always told ya, Frances. You got real ability.
L221200 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Not bad. It was slow at first, but I'm doing bits now.
L221199 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ You jackass!  C'mon, let's get out of here.
L221198 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ He wouldn't play ball. What can I tell ya... it's done.  Anyway, I didn't want to be next, so I skipped town; came down here to work for some big-wig. Tail and nail job.  I'm sort of a non-gentleman's non- gentleman.  How d'ya like the camouflage?
L221197 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ But... but why, Harry...? Why'd they do it?
L221196 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too god damn much heart. He just didn't want to die.
L221195 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Jesus.
L221194 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Eight stories.
L221193 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Oh no...
L221192 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ They killed him. They threw him out that window.
L221191 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ What?
L221190 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid.
L221189 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide.
L221188 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Kaminski.
L221187 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Not bad. But come on, Harry; what's the real reason?
L221186 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Came to get a tan.
L221185 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?
L221184 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ How ya doin', Farmer?
L221111 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Come on, Harry. This is America, land of the free.  I thought we might go skinny dipping.  For starters.
L221110 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Well... don't you think it's up to me to...
L221109 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ What?
L221108 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Frances...
L221106 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Yeah.
L221105 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You don't know what you want.
L221104 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
L221103 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.
L221102 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ ...So you think I should go.
L221101 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I kick myself sometimes, but the thing is, I would have been miserable living his life.
L221100 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ He retired to Florida... made a killing in vending machines.
L221099 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ What happened to him?
L221098 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You know, my old man was an inventor. Spent his whole life down in the basement trying to design transcontinental underground railroads, stuff like that. Well, I was supposed to be his partner. When I told him the smell of his workshop made me sick, I thought he was going to die right there.
L221097 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You're not the quiet type, Frances.
L221096 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Quietly.
L221095 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What?
L221094 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it...
L221093 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Yeah, it's a gift. You gotta do something with it.
L221092 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.
L221091 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Honest. When you were up there, you were really... there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid.
L221089 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You looked okay.  Joint's pretty dead. How 'bout I take you home?
L221088 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Don't be a rat, Harry.
L221087 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Enh.
L221086 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ How'd I look?
L221085 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I just wanted to see how you looked.
L221084 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Well? What'd you think?
L221083 +++$+++ u956 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You think I'd miss it?
L221082 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Hi, Harry. Did you see the play?
L221014 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Harry.
