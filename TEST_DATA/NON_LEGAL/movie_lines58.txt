L59239 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I'd love that.
L59238 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
L59237 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience.
L59233 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Can't I just maim it a little?
L59232 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ Rick, hit the ball easier, son. You don't have to kill it.
L59230 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ All right, who serves?
L59229 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Oops!
L59920 +++$+++ u402 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MRS. THOMERSON +++$+++ It's all right...  So have I.
L59919 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ No, Brett, I...
L59918 +++$+++ u402 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MRS. THOMERSON +++$+++ You've been having strange sex...!
L59917 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ The phone made me do it!
L59916 +++$+++ u402 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MRS. THOMERSON +++$+++ Ed... you're kinky!
L59278 +++$+++ u402 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MRS. THOMERSON +++$+++ You can tell a man by his friends.
L59277 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.
L59253 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ In a second...  And you're irresponsible. Show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words.
L59252 +++$+++ u402 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MRS. THOMERSON +++$+++ Girls, why don't we go inside for lunch.  Boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade?
L59235 +++$+++ u401 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MR. THOMERSON +++$+++ No. Let's at least finish the set.
L59234 +++$+++ u402 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ MRS. THOMERSON +++$+++ Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.
L59083 +++$+++ u410 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Of course.
L59082 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ I'm getting one heck of a glare off your dress there. Could you undo a few buttons?
L59078 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ Then there is a God. Why don't we take that baby picture.
L59077 +++$+++ u410 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ I'm separated.
L59076 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ Mrs.?
L59075 +++$+++ u410 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner.
L59074 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...?
L59879 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ You got it.
L59878 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom.
L59877 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ What's with her costume?
L59876 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ My Debbie?
L59875 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ Debbie.
L59874 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Who?
L59873 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ Guess who's here? Another surprise guest.
L59860 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I'm saved. Let's party!
L59859 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ Reach out and snort someone.
L59847 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ I'll stop him... You stall him.
L59846 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing.
L59845 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ What are you going to do about it?
L59826 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ And here's Mike's partner, in more ways than one. A gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. The very lovely, Miss Desiree...
L59825 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ How about this, a Trojan donkey.
L59806 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Who's your friend?
L59805 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ Hey, you guys...
L59784 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ Take care.
L59783 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Now, don't get into any trouble.
L59744 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ C'mon. Get the hookers in a circle. We better put Cochise out of business.
L59743 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ Very.
L59742 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ He look familiar?
L59741 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ Still drawing a blank.
L59740 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ How 'bout this?
L59739 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ Got me.
L59738 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ What's this?
L59737 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ I don't know.
L59736 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Who was that?
L59733 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ I'm proud of you, lad.
L59732 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.
L59731 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ How'd it go?
L59720 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ That's the old Rick!
L59719 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
L59718 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ Right in there, pal.
L59717 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Oooooo.
L59716 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please.
L59715 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.
L59714 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.
L59713 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ About what?
L59712 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ Rick, I'm concerned.
L59656 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I don't know. Maybe it's because I love Debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. I'm not sure.
L59655 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ I don't get it. Why didn't you go for it just now?
L59654 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ So long, Father.
L59653 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I think you'll enjoy this table.
L59638 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ The best table in the house.
L59637 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Under the table!
L59636 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ My gift to you.
L59635 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ What the hell is that?
L59632 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ C'mon. I insist.
L59631 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I'm not really hungry.
L59630 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody.
L59629 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Don't you love it when old friends stop by?
L59439 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ This isn't right.
L59438 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Excuse me, but this is as arousing as a stroll through the Vatican.
L59428 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ Then it's on to the real thing.
L59427 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Olivier's in that, right?
L59426 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos Without Pants"...
L59375 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Nothing... Let's get crazy!
L59374 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ What's the matter?
L59330 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Knowing Larry, he probably missed the flight.
L59329 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ Where the hell is he?
L59087 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce.
L59086 +++$+++ u403 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ O'NEILL +++$+++ Where'd she go?
L59808 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
L59807 +++$+++ u409 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.
L59690 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Thanks, Stan, you've been a lot of help.
L59689 +++$+++ u409 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ Well, the first month it's great. The second month things calm down a little. By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.
L59688 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?
L59687 +++$+++ u409 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ Thanks a lot, that was the best. You're next.
L59665 +++$+++ u409 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ Right. Give me the will to live. Let me go first.
L59664 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Nah, that's okay. My brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. Let's give him a break.
L59222 +++$+++ u409 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ Okay, Rick, all finished. I can't wait for that bachelor party... I need the action.
L59221 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.
L59220 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Stan, you're depressing me... Hey, I didn't know you were going to fill 'er up. Just take a couple of gallons, okay?
L59219 +++$+++ u409 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.
L59218 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
L59217 +++$+++ u409 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.
L59216 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ You always were sneaky, Stan, very sneaky.
L59066 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Right... Think it over.
L59065 +++$+++ u408 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ SISTER MARY FRANCIS +++$+++ Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is.
L59064 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? If you do, why don't you give me a call. I'm in the book.
L59062 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak.
L59061 +++$+++ u408 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ SISTER MARY FRANCIS +++$+++ There can be no excuse for tardiness.
L59060 +++$+++ u406 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
L59059 +++$+++ u408 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ SISTER MARY FRANCIS +++$+++ You're late again, Rick.
L59804 +++$+++ u409 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.
L59803 +++$+++ u407 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RYKO +++$+++ Can you believe how perfect it fits?
L59802 +++$+++ u409 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ I'd love to get you in an operating room. Just once.
L59801 +++$+++ u407 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RYKO +++$+++ Maybe I did... I don't remember.
L59800 +++$+++ u409 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
L59799 +++$+++ u407 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ RYKO +++$+++ I don't know.
L59798 +++$+++ u409 +++$+++ m24 +++$+++ STAN +++$+++ How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?
L60866 +++$+++ u411 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ AXE +++$+++ Stevie... I...
L60865 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ You stupid son of a bitch! What the fuck are you doing!
L60859 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ There's a fire. We've got a job here. Let's get on with it.
L60858 +++$+++ u411 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ AXE +++$+++ ...What do you want me to do, Stephen? Talk to me. What am I supposed to do?
L60851 +++$+++ u411 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ AXE +++$+++ -- You can't let him turn you against your friends, man --
L60850 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ -- Knock it off!
L60844 +++$+++ u411 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ AXE +++$+++ They were killing firemen, man. When Sally showed me what was in Swayzak's files... They were my friends, I had to do it. I had to do it for the department.
L60843 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ -- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.
L60842 +++$+++ u411 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ AXE +++$+++ Aw man, Stephen, listen to me...
L60609 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Goddamn it Adcox! Just do your fucking job!
L60608 +++$+++ u411 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ AXE +++$+++ Let me take the lead, Stephen...
L60607 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ -- What the hell's the matter with you? You always check the other side. I haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay? We got a job here.
L60606 +++$+++ u411 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ AXE +++$+++ It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin' us up. Not with this one.
L60605 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Adcox, go with Pengelly and check the other side.
L60336 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ We're gonna be okay, man...
L60335 +++$+++ u411 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ AXE +++$+++ Biggest in two battalions.
L60334 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Kind of an asshole, wasn't he?
L60333 +++$+++ u411 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ AXE +++$+++ Yeah...
L60332 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ You know Knowlton pretty well?
L60303 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ No.  I need a drink.
L60302 +++$+++ u411 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ AXE +++$+++ Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off!  You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you? You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be stuck a Lt. for life?
L60209 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Tim, fill out the alarm card.  Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and hang some hose.
L60208 +++$+++ u411 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ AXE +++$+++ That's Franny. She likes firemen.
L60134 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Nah, listen to it. It's a pussy. It'll just steam on us. It won't flash. Go high in the ceiling.
L60133 +++$+++ u411 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ AXE +++$+++ It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.
L60132 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.
L60131 +++$+++ u411 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ AXE +++$+++ Wash it to the windows?
L60126 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Be gentle.
L60125 +++$+++ u411 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ AXE +++$+++ Oh these moments do try me...
L60855 +++$+++ u411 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ AXE +++$+++ -- What he would do to your dad's department? You gotta let me finish it --
L60854 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ -- Stephen, this is bullshit --
L60853 +++$+++ u411 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ AXE +++$+++ -- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --
L60852 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ -- He killed people --
L60849 +++$+++ u411 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ AXE +++$+++ -- Shut up! Your dad would fucking puke if he saw how you've shit on his department!
L60848 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Just come down, John. Just --
L60847 +++$+++ u411 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ AXE +++$+++ You gotta let me finish --
L60846 +++$+++ u411 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ AXE +++$+++ That was an accident! Jesus Christ, why did you have to go in there so fucking early? Why didn't you listen to me!
L60845 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Did you do it for Tim?
L60622 +++$+++ u411 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ AXE +++$+++ He's alive.
L60621 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Is he...
L60183 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ John, when you're in there... in the fire... do you ever see...
L60182 +++$+++ u411 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ AXE +++$+++ Ah, everybody screws up some, Brian. You're working for the toughest Lt. on the job. Saw him once pick up a probie he thought was moving too slow and throw him into a burning building. It's just bad luck you're family.
L60181 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ My Lt. might have something to say about that.
L60180 +++$+++ u411 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ AXE +++$+++ Hey, baby McCaffrey. First one's the clincher. You did okay.
L60881 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... I won't.
L60880 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't let 'em...
L60864 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Oh shut up, huh?  I think I broke my goddamn arm...
L60863 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ "You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --"
L60862 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ You crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't you stay behind a desk where you belong?
L60857 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Shut up!
L60856 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ You're his Lt., Stephen...  Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen?
L60836 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ I'm his Lt. He's my responsibility. I'll handle it. Me.
L60835 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.
L60834 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ I'll handle it.
L60833 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ What are we going to do about this?
L60832 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Anything else?
L60827 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ They were for the fucking boat, Brian.
L60826 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ -- What were they doing there?
L60825 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me.
L60824 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ How do you know?
L60823 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ I know.
L60822 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people!
L60821 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ -- What are you doing here?
L60820 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ -- Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta talk to you. It's Adcox, he's --
L60819 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
L60818 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?
L60817 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Sometimes right when you're looking at them.
L60816 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Maybe I do.  ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?  People can change Brian.
L60815 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...
L60814 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ ...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?
L60813 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.
L60812 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Everybody did.
