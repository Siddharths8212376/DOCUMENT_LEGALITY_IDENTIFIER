L220137 +++$+++ u5360 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WALKER +++$+++ I was upset.
L220136 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Not really?
L220135 +++$+++ u5360 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WALKER +++$+++ Not really.
L220134 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ You were going to can me, right?
L220133 +++$+++ u5360 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WALKER +++$+++ Fletch, you want an apology?
L220129 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Forget it.
L220128 +++$+++ u5360 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WALKER +++$+++ Fletch, I got nervous. Please....
L220127 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ I'm out, Frank. You lost faith in me.
L220124 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Their statements, naming Chief Cummings as the numero uno drug pusher from here to Oxnard. I want them to have federal protection under the paper's sponsorship.
L220123 +++$+++ u5360 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WALKER +++$+++ What...
L220122 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy. 
L220121 +++$+++ u5360 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WALKER +++$+++ What?  Who the hell are they?
L220120 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ I'm quitting, Frank. As of midnight tonight.
L219783 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Print this Frank.
L219782 +++$+++ u5360 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WALKER +++$+++ I want something I can print!
L219781 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Thanks for the vote of confidence, Frank.
L219780 +++$+++ u5360 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WALKER +++$+++ But not unsubstantiated charges about dope-dealing cops, and not horse shit paranoid fantasies about homicidal police chiefs.
L219779 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ You'll have it.
L219778 +++$+++ u5360 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WALKER +++$+++ You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.
L219777 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story.
L219776 +++$+++ u5360 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WALKER +++$+++ Get out of here.
L219775 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ It's also called getting me this close to being murdered.
L219774 +++$+++ u5360 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WALKER +++$+++ It's called journalism, Fletch. It's called getting both sides of the story. Something you apparently don't know anything about.
L219773 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ How could you call him?
L219699 +++$+++ u5360 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WALKER +++$+++ Go to transportation, get a ticket.
L219698 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy you a shirt.
L219697 +++$+++ u5360 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WALKER +++$+++ Who? Donnie and Marie?
L219696 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ I have some ideas.
L219695 +++$+++ u5360 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WALKER +++$+++ What about finding the source?
L219694 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.
L219693 +++$+++ u5360 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WALKER +++$+++ Utah?
L219692 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ More cops.  I think I gotta go to Utah, Frank.
L219687 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ All right. Maybe there are some crooked cops involved in all this.
L219686 +++$+++ u5360 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WALKER +++$+++ Just give me a hint, all right?
L219679 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ I really don't want to spoil your surprise, Frank. Why don't you read it tomorrow?
L219678 +++$+++ u5360 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WALKER +++$+++ You're onto something. That's good. What?
L219677 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Cool your tool, Frank, I need a little more time. I think I'm really on to something here.
L219676 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Gummy and two cops...
L219453 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Frank, you animal, I love it. I'll have the story by Thursday night, I swear to God.  I hope.
L219452 +++$+++ u5360 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WALKER +++$+++ I'm going to bite out your eyeballs, you know that?
L219451 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ I'd say charcoal.
L219450 +++$+++ u5360 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WALKER +++$+++ How gray?
L219449 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Well, there we're in a gray area.
L219448 +++$+++ u5360 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WALKER +++$+++ Who?
L219447 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ He's not the story! There's a source behind him.
L219446 +++$+++ u5360 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WALKER +++$+++ So let's go! We run the pictures.
L219445 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ I have pictures of him. Dealing...
L219444 +++$+++ u5360 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WALKER +++$+++ What's 'practically'? Is it Fat Sam? You said you had pictures of him....
L219443 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Practically.
L219442 +++$+++ u5360 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WALKER +++$+++ You broke it? You know the source?
L219441 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Just kidding, Frank. You'll have the story and you'll be damn proud of it.
L219440 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Why not? Oh shit... really?
L219439 +++$+++ u5360 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WALKER +++$+++ Now, Irwin, try to follow me. You can't run the ad and then not run the story.
L219436 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Looks great.
L219435 +++$+++ u5360 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WALKER +++$+++ I don't know.  Look!
L219434 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ What's the spread on the game tonight?
L219433 +++$+++ u5360 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WALKER +++$+++ ...never reads the paper...
L219432 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ I never read the paper.
L219431 +++$+++ u5360 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WALKER +++$+++ No it's not okay. You have to have this in by tomorrow. Did you see the ad we ran Sunday?
L219430 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ I will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay?
L219429 +++$+++ u5360 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WALKER +++$+++ Irwin, professional journalism time, now. Go back to the goddamn beach and finish the goddamn story!
L219428 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Oh, I hate it when he calls me that.
L219427 +++$+++ u5360 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WALKER +++$+++ Irwin...
L219426 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Two...
L219425 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ And a damn fine one, I might add.
L219424 +++$+++ u5360 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WALKER +++$+++ 'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.
L219423 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Uh, almost.
L219422 +++$+++ u5360 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WALKER +++$+++ No, I want an answer, Is the story done?
L219421 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit?
L219420 +++$+++ u5360 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ WALKER +++$+++ Fletch.
L219653 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ My secretary.
L219652 +++$+++ u5351 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Who's Frieda?
L219651 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Frieda's boss.
L219650 +++$+++ u5351 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ And, I'm sorry, who are you again?
L219649 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Yeah.
L219648 +++$+++ u5351 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MARGIE +++$+++ Jim Swarthout?
L219647 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Oh, Margie, sorry, Frieda lost the number of Alan's realtor in Provo. Can you give it to me real quick?
L219886 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ In a minute!
L219885 +++$+++ u5354 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MR. UNDERHILL +++$+++ Mrs. Stanwyk!
L219869 +++$+++ u5354 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MR. UNDERHILL +++$+++ Of course.
L219868 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?
L219867 +++$+++ u5354 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MR. UNDERHILL +++$+++ I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.
L219866 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ You don't know the Underhills?
L219865 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ John!
L219864 +++$+++ u5354 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MR. UNDERHILL +++$+++ Apparently, someone of your acquaintance has charged the most extraordinary lunch to my bill.
L219860 +++$+++ u5354 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MR. UNDERHILL +++$+++ Mrs. Stanwyk, I hate to disturb you. Tom Underhill here... I'm a new member.
L219859 +++$+++ u5355 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MRS. STANWYK +++$+++ Yes?
L220481 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ I ain't -- got -- you.
L220480 +++$+++ u5361 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ BAND +++$+++ I said, I ain't got you...
L220479 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ I said, I ain't got you...
L220478 +++$+++ u5361 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ BAND +++$+++ No, I ain't got you...
L220477 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ No, I ain't got you...
L220476 +++$+++ u5361 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ BAND +++$+++ But I ain't got you...
L220475 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ But I ain't got you...
L220664 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Thanks, I needed that.
L220663 +++$+++ u5362 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ Art Mo-o-o-ney!
L220661 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ What did these Vancouver factories do?
L220660 +++$+++ u5362 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ That was close...
L220658 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Hold that thought.  Are we being shot at?
L220657 +++$+++ u5362 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.
L220656 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ What cheap shit... hey, waiter!
L220655 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ But I am...
L220654 +++$+++ u5362 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ Damnit... you were right last night. Jonathan and I were into more than sex.  Along with Bobby Vomit, right after old Jack Grendel died, we took part in a scheme to rip off Grendel records... I didn't want you involved...
L220652 +++$+++ u5362 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ Drink your cappucino, you're giving me a headache...
L220651 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Lots of things.  Her favorite yogurt.  The ten drummers she would take to a desert island...
L220650 +++$+++ u5362 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ Did she tell you anything?
L220649 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Have what?
L220648 +++$+++ u5362 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ Zuzu Petals!  Did she have it?
L220647 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ I'll buy you a new one.  I found her.
L220646 +++$+++ u5362 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ I ask you to find a girl and instead you steal a C.D. from me. Ford.  You suck.
L220531 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Thanks for the information. Appreciate it.
L220530 +++$+++ u5362 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ Jonathan was such a beautiful man. No one knew him like I did... Excuse me.  I can't do this now. I'll call you tomorrow.
L220529 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Question one:  Can I have some money?  Kidding.  Why didn't you tell me about you and Johnny?  You two were into something even more dangerous than sex, weren't you? Who?  What?  Where?  How?  Now.
L220528 +++$+++ u5362 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ I'll do my best.
L220527 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ They did one of these about my ex- wife.  It's called 'The Nutcracker.'  'The Nut-crack-er'... I don't need money.  I need some questions answered.
L220526 +++$+++ u5362 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ Nonsense.  After what you've been through, it sounds like I owe you.
L220525 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Listen, Queen Collie, I have a code. I never, ever, drop a case.  Besides, I, uh, used all your money to pay my bills, so I kinda owe you.
L220524 +++$+++ u5362 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ So you...
L220523 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Ouch... Of course I want off the case.  Some monster from Woodstock tried and succeeded in killing me tonight.  The fact I'm alive's a technicality.
L220520 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ I'm sorry, that's gotta be a pair of tube socks he has down there.
L220519 +++$+++ u5362 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ So you know about Johnny Crunch and myself.
L220510 +++$+++ u5362 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ Uh, let's go sit down.
L220509 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g...
L220508 +++$+++ u5362 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ My God, Mr. Fairlane, you look like the Fall of Saigon.
L220442 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Nuthin'.
L220441 +++$+++ u5362 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ Who?
L220440 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Ah, the Dorothy Chandler.  I was just there with my good friend Art Mooney the other night...
L220439 +++$+++ u5362 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ I have no answers.  Thanks for the stain.  Find the girl.  In the envelope are tickets to the Dorothy Chandler.  We'll chat again, then.
L220438 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Oh... I have some questions.
L220437 +++$+++ u5362 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ Actually, you may take it all now.
L220436 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Yeah, but of course for now, I only get a twenty.
L220435 +++$+++ u5362 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ Five thousand should be enough to assuage any qualms you have about my family tree.
L220434 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Let's see, you're her worried sister.  Yesterday I met her worried father who incidentally was about five years younger than you. In fact, I capped off the evening by watching him get electrocuted. They talk about cases like this in the private eye handbook... something about a ten-foot pole.
L220433 +++$+++ u5362 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ Excuse me?
L220432 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ No thanks.  I carry my own.
L220431 +++$+++ u5362 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ But how did you know?  Here, take this picture...
L220430 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Zuzu Petals.  You want me to rescue her from the gorgeous hell that is L.A.
L220429 +++$+++ u5362 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...
L220428 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Now that we've broken the ice...
L220427 +++$+++ u5362 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ I don't have a sense of humor, either.  Sorry.
L220426 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Poor taste.  I know.  Listen, I respect homosexuals.  When I was young, my maid was a homosexual.  My maid was a homosexual.
L220425 +++$+++ u5362 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?
L220424 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Some fag.  Charged me up the ass.
L220423 +++$+++ u5362 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ Who's your decorator?
L220422 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Oh, that!  Don't take it personally. He always wakes up before I do. Down boy!  Roseanne Barr naked!
L220421 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ I don't know, I never met your father.
L220420 +++$+++ u5362 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ Mr. Fairlane, I'm very rich.  The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me.  When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you?
L220419 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Sorry about the glass.  And the house.  And the breath.
L220418 +++$+++ u5362 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ Please.
L220417 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Don't say it.  Orange juice?
L220416 +++$+++ u5362 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ Ford Fairlane, I'm Colleen Sutton and I need your help.  I have a problem and it pertains to the music industry.  What is it they call you?  Mr. Rock and...
L220922 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ No prob...
L220921 +++$+++ u5363 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ DON +++$+++ Thanks for the promotion, man.
L220881 +++$+++ u5363 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ DON +++$+++ Could somebody tell me what's going on?  <u>Like slo-owly</u>...
L220880 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Hey, Don, how's the high blood pressure.
L220484 +++$+++ u5363 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ DON +++$+++ Right away!
L220483 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Have a copy of that sent to me, will ya?
L220463 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ I never thought I'd be jealous of your handicap... Sorry to hear about Bobby Vomit.
L220462 +++$+++ u5363 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ DON +++$+++ Julian's happy as long as he doesn't see glass shatter.
L220452 +++$+++ u5363 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ DON +++$+++ Tell me about it. Name's Kyle Troy.  Can't we bring up the bass.
L220451 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ I've heard cars fuck with more harmony.
L220450 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Great pipes.
L220449 +++$+++ u5363 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ DON +++$+++ I haven't seen her around, and as for who would want to kill Johnny Crunch, line forms to the left. You'd find less people on our planet who wanted him alive.
L220270 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ I guess I'm not interested in any club who'll have my member as a member.  Later, Don...
L220269 +++$+++ u5363 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ DON +++$+++ You gotta shave before you leave the house in a dress like that and I don't mean your legs.  Why didn't you jump on her?  What's happening to you?
L220258 +++$+++ u5363 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ DON +++$+++ Man, ever since old Jack Grendel died, Julian has got me into one yummy gig after the other.  Not only am I producing, he's got me in some lovely-bullshit-money-money executive position.  What are you looking at...
L220257 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ I'm not cynical.  Can I help it that life is a disease and everyone's a victim. So you're producing exclusively for Grendel Records now.  Hope you're taking Julian for a bundle.
L220256 +++$+++ u5363 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ DON +++$+++ Damn, Ford, you're the most cynical man in the industry and that's not easy.
L220255 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ So many assholes, so few bullets.
L220955 +++$+++ u5366 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ JAZZ +++$+++ Wha --
L220954 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Let's get hitched.  I guess I, you know, love you.  It's a beautiful thing.
L220953 +++$+++ u5366 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ JAZZ +++$+++ I just can't deal with all this crap between us, I'm sorry.  I'm quitting.
L220875 +++$+++ u5366 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ JAZZ +++$+++ I can't believe I lost an eye for a bunch of phony C.D.s
L220874 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ After their initial investment in the factory, Grendel didn't need them.  Told them to fuck off. They tried to get these C.D.s together in order to have proof of Grendel's involvement, so they could keep him in line.  Now's the fun part...
L220869 +++$+++ u5366 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ JAZZ +++$+++ But the funny thing is, take a look at these Swiss bank account numbers. We got Bobby, Johnny, Colleen... and Julian Grendel.
L220868 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Without Grendel knowing about it. B-I-N-G-O and Bingo was his name-O. Counterfeit C.D.s.  Tape piracy has graduated to disc piracy, the sound quality's better, and so's the money.
L220867 +++$+++ u5366 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ JAZZ +++$+++ C.D.s.  The music kind.  From the Grendel label.
L220866 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Yeah, Colleen mentioned it.  What do they make?
L220865 +++$+++ u5366 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ JAZZ +++$+++ Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
L220864 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ What an interface!
L220855 +++$+++ u5366 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ JAZZ +++$+++ Johnny's C.D.?
L220854 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Your timing swallows the massive one. Grendel just tried to kill us, he's about to frame and kiss Don, and we can't do shit.  Don't even ask about those discs. Goddamn that Art Mooney with a star by his name!  It's tied to Johnny's C.D., I know.
L220757 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Su-ure.  Two people hired me to find Zuzu in order to get hold of one of those discs and Colleen threw a tizz when we took hers.  Obviously, all this binary disc shit is pretty mighty.  But it's not necessary.  People are dead.  One was a friend.  The same people were involved in a scam to rip off Grendel Records. Bottom line's Julian Grendel is doing a little revenge number...
L220756 +++$+++ u5366 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ JAZZ +++$+++ Hmmm, the first disc was putting out an incomprehensible stream of high bits.  This one is putting out low bits.  The data is in some fucked binary system.  The two discs need to interface simultaneously with a third decryptor disc.  Comprendo?
L220751 +++$+++ u5366 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ JAZZ +++$+++ You're not funny.
L220750 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Aha, just what I suspected!
L220748 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ I've always said the one reason I'm the best detective in the industry is that I'm the only one... but hey, I never throw away a clue...
L220747 +++$+++ u5366 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ JAZZ +++$+++ I believe the last time we came across one of these, was at the ballet.  What were your words...  'A fucking C.D.  This case is closed.'
L220743 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Oh, Jazz, those bastards... call an ambulance!  Get that music off!
L220742 +++$+++ u5366 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ JAZZ +++$+++ I came to warn you...
L220721 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ What are you doing at the office? You wouldn't believe what I've gone through tonight... I'm calling from the Mega Beta Pogo Sorority.
L220720 +++$+++ u5366 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ JAZZ +++$+++ Hello, Ford...
L220678 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Let's get her out of here, before she starts a shoot-out.  Drop us at my place.
L220677 +++$+++ u5366 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ JAZZ +++$+++ Ah, an obvious choice.
L220676 +++$+++ u5366 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ JAZZ +++$+++ Who?
L220675 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Lieutenant Anus has discovered the cold-blooded killer behind everything.
L220674 +++$+++ u5366 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ JAZZ +++$+++ You okay?
L220645 +++$+++ u5366 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ JAZZ +++$+++ Hello...  It's Colleen.  With answers.  She wants to meet.  Down.  Way down-town.  Late.
L220644 +++$+++ u5364 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ FORD +++$+++ Yeah, let's bury her.
L220643 +++$+++ u5366 +++$+++ m356 +++$+++ JAZZ +++$+++ She's just a bundle of energy, a real treasure...
