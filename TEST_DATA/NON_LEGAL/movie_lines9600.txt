L82461 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.
L82460 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Well, truth is for suckers, isn't it?.
L82459 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Is that true?
L82458 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
L82457 +++$+++ u4020 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Moving story.
L82604 +++$+++ u4021 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ DON +++$+++ That's right, Wendy, it is against floor policy, but as long as you're here, let me tell you what I know about our cute little door friend. Many years ago, this very office was occupied by a kindly old watchmaker named Mr. White.
L82603 +++$+++ u4035 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Well, Don, I peeked in here, even though I know it's against floor policy. and I discovered that there's a little tiny door in here. Isn't it cute? It's almost like a little dolly's door. I wonder what it’s for.
L82602 +++$+++ u4021 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ DON +++$+++ Hi. Wendy! What're you up to in this vacant office.
L82456 +++$+++ u4035 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Ha ha ha!
L82455 +++$+++ u4021 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ DON +++$+++ So that's the story of 7 1/2. Since the rents are considerably lower this floor has been adopted by businesses which for one reason or another are forced to cut corners After all... the overhead is low! Ha ha ha!
L82443 +++$+++ u4021 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ DON +++$+++ It's an interesting story, Wendy. Many years ago in the late 1800's, James Mertin, an Irish ship captain looking to invest in the future of our great country, came to this town and decided to erect an office building.
L82442 +++$+++ u4035 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?
L82441 +++$+++ u4021 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ DON +++$+++ Hello. Wendy.
L82440 +++$+++ u4035 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ WENDY +++$+++ Hello, Don.
L83216 +++$+++ u4022 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ ELIJAH +++$+++ Wings and a halo, my darling. Wings and a halo.
L83215 +++$+++ u4029 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LOTTE +++$+++ I'll be with you always, my friends. Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll rejoin you with wings and a beak.
L83214 +++$+++ u4029 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LOTTE +++$+++ Hush, sweetheart.
L83213 +++$+++ u4022 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ ELIJAH +++$+++ If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and...
L83212 +++$+++ u4029 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LOTTE +++$+++ Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
L83211 +++$+++ u4022 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ ELIJAH +++$+++ Must you take this terrible demon on yourself, my love?
L83174 +++$+++ u4022 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ ELIJAH +++$+++ It is better to light one candle than curse the darkness. I learned that from you.
L83173 +++$+++ u4029 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LOTTE +++$+++ I'm glad you learned sign language, Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging. I'm tired of this conversation. I'm tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it?
L83172 +++$+++ u4022 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ ELIJAH +++$+++ You've got to tell Craig what's going on. He must never leave Malkovich.
L82766 +++$+++ u4023 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ ERROLL +++$+++ Yes. Yes. A thousand times, yes!
L82765 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Two hundred dollars, please.
L82764 +++$+++ u4023 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ ERROLL +++$+++ Well that's perfect. My second choice. Ah, this is wonderful. Too good to be true! You see, I'm a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh, I've tried all the diets, my friends. Lived for a year on nothing but imitation mayonnaise. Did it work? You be the judge. But Malkovich! King of New York! Man about town! Most eligible bachelor! Bon Vivant! The Schopenhauer of the 20th century! Thin man extraordinaire!
L82763 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ You can be John Malkovich.
L82762 +++$+++ u4023 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ ERROLL +++$+++ Can I be anyone I want?
L82761 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ No. Don't be an ass.
L82760 +++$+++ u4023 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ ERROLL +++$+++ Long term psychic or physiological repercussions?
L82759 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ No.
L83171 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Fine. Your mail's on the kitchen table. Mostly junk. Oh, there's a letter from Alex Trebek.
L83170 +++$+++ u4024 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ FLEMMER +++$+++ Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.
L83169 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.
L83168 +++$+++ u4024 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ FLEMMER +++$+++ Fine. Let's drop it.
L83167 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
L83166 +++$+++ u4024 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ FLEMMER +++$+++ I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it.
L83165 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry?
L83164 +++$+++ u4024 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ FLEMMER +++$+++ Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
L83163 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan.
L83162 +++$+++ u4024 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ FLEMMER +++$+++ Why are you being like this?
L83161 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Do tell. I love a good plan.
L83160 +++$+++ u4024 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ FLEMMER +++$+++ But I think I have another plan.
L83159 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Oh, he's good! Great, actually. I saw him do "Tru" with his sixty foot Robert Morse puppet. Sensational.
L83158 +++$+++ u4024 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ FLEMMER +++$+++ No, the Mediocre Mantini. Of course the Great Mantini!
L83157 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ The Great Mantini?
L83156 +++$+++ u4024 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ FLEMMER +++$+++ Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.
L83155 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ What kind of circumstances?
L83154 +++$+++ u4024 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ FLEMMER +++$+++ No, for God's sake, I just watered it yesterday.  It almost went well. I gave a pretty good dream, but circumstances arose.
L83153 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ How'd it go? Did you say the philodendron gets water or no?
L83110 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ I like that.
L83109 +++$+++ u4024 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ FLEMMER +++$+++ No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary dream.
L83108 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ A scary dream?
L83107 +++$+++ u4024 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ FLEMMER +++$+++ I suppose I could come to him in a dream. I don't know. That's the best I can think of right now.
L83106 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad we can't kill him.
L83105 +++$+++ u4024 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ FLEMMER +++$+++ Impressions? Those are hard.
L83104 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ The kid's got talent. You've never seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz had him up there singing and dancing. Impressions.
L83103 +++$+++ u4024 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ FLEMMER +++$+++ Vegas? What'd you think?
L83102 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
L83101 +++$+++ u4024 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ FLEMMER +++$+++ Have a seat. I wracking my brain over this Malkovich thing.
L83081 +++$+++ u4024 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ FLEMMER +++$+++ Look, I'm going back to my house to ponder this. So stay calm and keep track of Schwartz's comings and goings. Oh, and somebody dispose of Schwartz's wife, will you?  Nice to meet you all.
L83080 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Didn't mean to imply that you were, sir.
L83079 +++$+++ u4024 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ FLEMMER +++$+++ Right, Lester. I heard you the first time. I'm not a dummy.
L83078 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ And as I said, sir, we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich.
L83077 +++$+++ u4024 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ FLEMMER +++$+++ Boy, this is a toughie. To be honest, I didn't anticipate this.
L82843 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Good morning, Lotte!
L82842 +++$+++ u4025 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ FLORIS +++$+++ Think, Jew florist?
L82841 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Thank you, Floris.
L82840 +++$+++ u4025 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ FLORIS +++$+++ Someone names A Lot of Warts on line two.
L82839 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Yes, my dear?
L82430 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Fine woman, Floris. I don't know how she puts up with this damn speech impediment of mine.
L82429 +++$+++ u4025 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ FLORIS +++$+++ Fork ah did?
L82428 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Forget it.
L82427 +++$+++ u4025 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ FLORIS +++$+++ Gehginnis ondah foam?
L82426 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Floris, get Guinness on the phone.
L83181 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ Do you?
L83180 +++$+++ u4026 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET +++$+++ Says me. Do you dream often?
L83179 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ Says who?
L83178 +++$+++ u4026 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET +++$+++ It's my job to ask the questions. Yours to answer them.
L83177 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ Do you?
L83176 +++$+++ u4026 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET +++$+++ Do you dream often?
L82903 +++$+++ u4027 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ KEVIN BACON +++$+++ The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy.
L82902 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
L82901 +++$+++ u4027 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ KEVIN BACON +++$+++ All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.
L82900 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
L82899 +++$+++ u4027 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ KEVIN BACON +++$+++ You're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend.
L82898 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ I'm done with her now. Tonight really creeped me out.
L82897 +++$+++ u4027 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ KEVIN BACON +++$+++ Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you to channel some dead lesbian lover. Let me know when you're done with her. This is my type of chick.
L82896 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ I think it might've been this Lotte woman talking through me. Maxine likes to call me Lotte.
L82895 +++$+++ u4027 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ KEVIN BACON +++$+++ You were stoned. Case closed. End of story. How hot is this babe?
L82894 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
L82893 +++$+++ u4027 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ KEVIN BACON +++$+++ Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
L82892 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ Kevin, I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've...
L82891 +++$+++ u4027 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ KEVIN BACON +++$+++ I'm sure you're not going crazy.
L82890 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ It's like nothing I've ever felt before. I think I'm going crazy.
L83076 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Good. I think its time to beckon Mr. Flemmer. Perhaps He can help us out of this pickle.
L83075 +++$+++ u4036 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ WOMAN #1 +++$+++ Count me in.
L83074 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ But of course.
L83073 +++$+++ u4036 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ WOMAN #1 +++$+++ Do we get to wear a crown?
L83072 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Anybody else?
L83062 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Lots of carrot juice, little lady. That, and a deal with the Devil.
L83061 +++$+++ u4036 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ WOMAN #1 +++$+++ You don't look a day over one hundred and five, Captain. What's your secret?
L83052 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ I'm afraid that no physical harm must come to him as long as he inhabits the vessel.
L83051 +++$+++ u4029 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LOTTE +++$+++ That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
L83050 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.
L83049 +++$+++ u4029 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LOTTE +++$+++ Why not? I need to get in there!
L83048 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Thank you all for your efforts, but I'm afraid we can no longer get into Malkovich through the portal.
L83022 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ I understand, but we must protect the vessel at all costs.  Please, Craig, please step aside and allow us to have what is rightfully ours.
L83021 +++$+++ u4029 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LOTTE +++$+++ It's Craig in there, I can tell.
L83020 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ No! Don't harm the vessel!
L83019 +++$+++ u4029 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LOTTE +++$+++ You bastard!
L83018 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Aaaahhhh, the portal!
L82988 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Oh, sorry. Right this way.
L82987 +++$+++ u4029 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LOTTE +++$+++ No.
L82986 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
L82985 +++$+++ u4029 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LOTTE +++$+++ No, I didn't know that.
L82984 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ What?! That is not allowed. My God, you are supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich by yourself!
L82983 +++$+++ u4029 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LOTTE +++$+++ No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
L82982 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
L82981 +++$+++ u4029 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LOTTE +++$+++ Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.
L82980 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ You know I think it pays to leave juice-making to the trained professionals. You look terrible, my dear.
L82848 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ My child, I don't think its a great mystery what Craig's up to.
L82847 +++$+++ u4029 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LOTTE +++$+++ But now we've lost access to Craig.
L82846 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ You followed your heart, my child, and that is not necessarily a bad thing.
L82845 +++$+++ u4029 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LOTTE +++$+++ I blew it, Dr. Lester.
L82785 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ We need you on the inside, my child. To report on his comings and goings, and if need be, to... destroy him...  ...for lack of a better word.
L82784 +++$+++ u4029 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LOTTE +++$+++ But why, Son of Malkovich?
L82783 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ No you mustn't, my child.
L82782 +++$+++ u4029 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LOTTE +++$+++ I'm getting divorced.
L82678 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ With immense pleasure, my dear. Down that hall, ninth door on the left. Watch the step down. It's sunken, you know.
L82677 +++$+++ u4029 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LOTTE +++$+++ Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
L82676 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Oh, be still my heart.
L82675 +++$+++ u4029 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LOTTE +++$+++ Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.
L82674 +++$+++ u4028 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Tell me, Lotte, can you understand a word I'm saying?
L82967 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ I thought so too, doll. I guess we were mistaken.
L82966 +++$+++ u4029 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LOTTE +++$+++ But Maxine, I thought it was me you loved.
L82965 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Really? Well, you know, he's quite good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. I'll speak with you soon.
L82964 +++$+++ u4029 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LOTTE +++$+++ Maxine! Listen:  It hasn't been me in John the last three times. Craig's had me locked up in the apartment. He made me call you at gunpoint. It's been him! Oh, God, it's been him!
L82957 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ One hour.
L82956 +++$+++ u4029 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LOTTE +++$+++ We have to meet.
L82857 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Sweetie! Oh, but we can't. It's business hours. I need to keep the membranous tunnel open for paying customers.
L82856 +++$+++ u4029 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LOTTE +++$+++ I have to see you.
L82855 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else can be.
L82813 +++$+++ u4029 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LOTTE +++$+++ Maxine...
L82812 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ I love you, Lotte.
L82811 +++$+++ u4029 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LOTTE +++$+++ Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.
L82806 +++$+++ u4029 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LOTTE +++$+++ Give me one hour to get inside him Exactly.
L82805 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ When?
L82804 +++$+++ u4029 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LOTTE +++$+++ I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?
L82803 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Yes?
L82746 +++$+++ u4029 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LOTTE +++$+++ After that I'll introduce you to my favorite monkey, Elijah. He's got an ulcer, due to a suppressed childhood trauma. But we're getting to the bottom of it.  Psychotherapy.
L82745 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Ah.
L82734 +++$+++ u4029 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LOTTE +++$+++ I've never been looked at like this by a woman.
L82733 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich, my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me.
L82703 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Let her go, Craig. I mean “him."
L82702 +++$+++ u4029 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LOTTE +++$+++ Don't stand in the way of my actualization as a man, Craig.
L82696 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Hi, uh.  Hi. I wanted to place an ad. Yes. "Ever want to be someone else?" No, that's the ad, but let's talk about you in a minute. "Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding..."
L82695 +++$+++ u4029 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LOTTE +++$+++ Hi. Have you done Malkovich yet?
L82693 +++$+++ u4029 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ LOTTE +++$+++ Yes, Hi.
L82692 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Yes, hello, I wanted to place an ad.  Hi, are you Craig's wife?
L83152 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ Who needs dancing?
L83151 +++$+++ u4031 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MANTINI +++$+++ No.
L83150 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ Is there dancing?
L83149 +++$+++ u4031 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MANTINI +++$+++ Great then.
L83148 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ I'm not afraid. I toured for a year with the National Puppet Company's production of "Long Day's Journey Into Night."
L83147 +++$+++ u4031 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MANTINI +++$+++ Nothing but acting to hide behind, buddy-boy.
L83146 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ Sounds boring. Are there any songs?
L83145 +++$+++ u4031 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MANTINI +++$+++ Broadway's finest three hours. It's about the suppression of the individual. Conformity as God in modern society.
L83144 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ Never heard of it.
L83143 +++$+++ u4031 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MANTINI +++$+++ Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.
L83142 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ What's the play?
L83141 +++$+++ u4031 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MANTINI +++$+++ A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
L83140 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ How do we do that?
L83137 +++$+++ u4031 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MANTINI +++$+++ We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.
L83136 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ She's not available.
L83133 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ Because if you missed any, I just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now.
L83132 +++$+++ u4031 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MANTINI +++$+++ Yeah, I saw them
L83131 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ Did you see the reviews?
L83130 +++$+++ u4031 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MANTINI +++$+++ Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show.
L83201 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Whatever.
L83200 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ Good-bye, Maxine.
L83129 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ Derek Mantini!
L83128 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Yeah what?!
L83127 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again.
L83126 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ Honey, we can be happy and poor together.
L83123 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ I just had the most horrifying nightmare. The devil was in it.
L83122 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ You've got to be kidding.
L83121 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ I've got to leave Malkovich.
L83120 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Bad dream, darling?
L83114 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Busy day, my little fire chief. Why don't you climb into bed, and I'll meet you there in just...
L83113 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ Sleepy suddenly.
L83112 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top.
L83111 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ They love me, darling! "Craig Schwartz is fantastic!"  The New York Times. "If only Craig Schwartz had always been inside Malkovich!"  Women's Wear Daily. "Craig Schwartz - The world's greatest puppeteer!"  Paul Wunder, WBAI Radio.
L83089 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ He's a selfish bastard.
L83088 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Doesn't he know how important tonight is to us?
L83087 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting me hard today.
L83086 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ This is it, lover. You're stepping onto that stage a nobody and presto-change-o, you're coming back the greatest puppeteer the world has ever seen.
L83040 +++$+++ u4030 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MALKOVICH +++$+++ Vegas. Can you arrange that?
L83039 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Vegas.
L83017 +++$+++ u4032 +++$+++ m267 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ It's okay, my sweet.
