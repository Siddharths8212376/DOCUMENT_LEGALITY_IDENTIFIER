L30797 +++$+++ u267 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON STRACK +++$+++ Oh yes, yes. And that was?
L30796 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.
L30795 +++$+++ u267 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON STRACK +++$+++ I know we banned this play, but frankly I can't remember why. Can you refresh my memory, Herr Director?
L30183 +++$+++ u267 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON STRACK +++$+++ Did we?
L30182 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.
L30159 +++$+++ u267 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON STRACK +++$+++ Well done, Sire!
L30158 +++$+++ u258 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ORSINI-ROSENBERG +++$+++ Bravo, Your Majesty!
L31180 +++$+++ u265 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ UGLY OLD WOMAN +++$+++ Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you.
L31179 +++$+++ u259 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ PAPAGENO +++$+++ Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough?
L31178 +++$+++ u265 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ UGLY OLD WOMAN +++$+++ Of course now. Right away, before I get any older.
L31177 +++$+++ u259 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ PAPAGENO +++$+++ What do you mean - now?
L31176 +++$+++ u265 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ UGLY OLD WOMAN +++$+++ Well, promise then.
L31175 +++$+++ u259 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ PAPAGENO +++$+++ I can't wait.
L31174 +++$+++ u265 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ UGLY OLD WOMAN +++$+++ Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you.
L31173 +++$+++ u259 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ PAPAGENO +++$+++ Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.
L31172 +++$+++ u265 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ UGLY OLD WOMAN +++$+++ I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
L31171 +++$+++ u259 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ PAPAGENO +++$+++ What? Who the devil are you?
L31170 +++$+++ u265 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ UGLY OLD WOMAN +++$+++ Here I am, my angel.
L31050 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Indeed. Just a moment - as a matter of fact I think I do know someone who could commission a work from him. A very appropriate person to do so. Yes.
L31049 +++$+++ u268 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON SWIETEN +++$+++ How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.
L31048 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He never pays his debts. I can't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him.
L31047 +++$+++ u268 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON SWIETEN +++$+++ Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?
L31046 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ I agree, Baron.
L31045 +++$+++ u268 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ VON SWIETEN +++$+++ This is embarrassing, you know. You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and he's begging from practically all of them. It has to stop.
L30526 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Come with me. And stay in the room.
L30525 +++$+++ u264 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SERVANT +++$+++ He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.
L30524 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ What does he want?
L30478 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Show her in. Then go to bed.
L30477 +++$+++ u264 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SERVANT +++$+++ That lady is back, sir.
L30417 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Excuse me, my dear.
L30416 +++$+++ u264 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SERVANT +++$+++ She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
L30415 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Who is she?
L30414 +++$+++ u264 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SERVANT +++$+++ Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.
L31226 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Yes, indeed. Goodnight to you all now. It was perfection - truly!
L31225 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Oh, by the way, give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up, eh?
L31223 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Yes.  And congratulations to all of you. It was superb.
L31222 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ I'll call tomorrow.
L31221 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Bene.
L31220 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times.
L31219 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Of course.
L31218 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
L31217 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.
L31216 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ But he's all right?
L31215 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
L31214 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Can we come in?
L31213 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Yes, I am looking after him.
L31212 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Herr Salieri.
L31667 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Thank you.
L31666 +++$+++ u280 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ORDERLY +++$+++ I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.
L31665 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?
L31664 +++$+++ u280 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ORDERLY +++$+++ What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
L31663 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ How did he look?
L31662 +++$+++ u280 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ORDERLY +++$+++ The American? Yes, duck.
L31661 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet?
L32200 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ I doubt it. But it's something to do.
L32199 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ David?
L32198 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Nurse Hobbs said there's a disturbance in Leicester Square involving some sort of mad dog.
L32135 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Tea would be nice.
L32134 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What shall we do?
L32060 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ I expect you shortly.
L32059 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ No, a cab will be faster.
L32058 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Shall I send a car?
L32057 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ He's fine. We'll come right over.
L32056 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
L32055 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yes, Doctor.
L32054 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Right. Now listen carefully. I want you to bring David here. I want him in my care. I'll notify the police that we've found him. It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital. Do you understand?
L32053 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yes, I should think so.
L32052 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Could you get here without any trouble?
L32051 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ No, not really.
L32050 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Is David acting strangely?
L32049 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ No, why?
L32048 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?
L32047 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.
L32046 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ The zoo? Is he rational?
L32045 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
L32044 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
L32043 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ He's here.
L31993 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy.
L31992 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What shall we do?
L31991 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.
L31990 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Dr. Hirsch?
L31989 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?
L31988 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Surely you're not suggesting...
L31987 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ No. He knows no one in London, besides me. I shouldn't have left him alone.
L31986 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ You've absolutely no idea where David might be?
L31985 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ I think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret. I'm convinced that, like David, they believe in this werewolf.
L31984 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ And what else?
L31983 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.
L31982 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yes.
L31981 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.
L31980 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?
L31979 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Warn him?
L31978 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ David says Jack comes to warn him.
L31977 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ What did he say?
L31976 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yes.
L31975 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Has his friend appeared to him again?
L31974 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
L31973 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?
L31972 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ He's not?
L31969 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...
L31968 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ It's a full moon. Where is he?
L31967 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L31966 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Oh dear girl, your extracurricular activities are of no consequence to me. I don't give a damn who you sleep with. I'm concerned about David.
L31962 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Come to my office, Miss Price.
L31961 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have.
L31591 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yes, I believe he did.
L31590 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Did he say a wolf?
L31557 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ No, sir. Of course, sir. Good day, Doctor.
L31556 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.
L31555 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What happened to them?
L31554 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.
L31553 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ He said 'Jack'.
L31552 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ What exactly did he call out?
L31551 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yes, Doctor?
L31550 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Oh, Miss Price?
L31549 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yes, Doctor.
L31548 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Go about your duties.
L31547 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Dr. Hirsch?
L31546 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Can I be of service, Miss Price?
L31542 +++$+++ u275 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DR. HIRSCH +++$+++ Miss Gallagher, surely you must perform some function here at the hospital.
L31541 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago.
L32119 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Control!?! What control!?! Get away from me!
L32118 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ David, don't lose control.
L32117 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Leave me alone, dammit! You people are crazy! I've got to get away from here! I've got to do something!
L32116 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ David, let's go now.
L32115 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Hopeless. It's hopeless.
L32106 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Will you shut up!?!!
L32105 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Sir, he's very upset. His friend was killed and...
L32093 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I swear, I don't know this girl.
L32092 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ We had an argument. He's being silly.
L32091 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What?
L32090 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ He's playing a stupid joke, sir.
L32087 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Rational!?! I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake!
L32086 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.
L32085 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Jack is dead. Look, six people have been killed. I'm going to the police.
L32084 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Jack is dead!
L32083 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right. I...
L32082 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ David, stop!
L32081 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.
L32080 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ David, what are you doing?
L32077 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Pull over.
L32076 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ But...
L32065 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time.
L32064 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
L32063 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I should be committed.
L32062 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ The next corner we can get a cab.
L32037 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I said goodbye to you. I was locked out of the flat. I climbed the wall and came in through the bathroom window. I started to read and then I was naked at the zoo!  I guess I am out of my fucking mind.
L32036 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Don't you remember?
L32035 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
L32034 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ The zoo?
L32033 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Alex, I've lost my mind. I woke up at the zoo! But you know what? I feel terrific!
L32032 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I'm freezing.
L32031 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ David! Where on earth have you been!?!
L31919 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ See you later.
L31918 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I'm off. There's food in the fridge.
L31917 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ A doper werewolf.
L31916 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I've left those pills for you.
L31915 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Okay.
L31914 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?
L31913 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Yeah, I do, but go to work.
L31912 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
L31911 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Werewolves simply do not exist.
L31910 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
L31909 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
L31908 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Anything.
L31907 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Do me an enormous favor?
L31906 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Let me go now, you'll make me late.
L31852 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ That's good, Alex.  Reassure me.
L31851 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Tomorrow is the full moon.
L31850 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I wasn't hallucinating.
L31849 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ But, David.
L31848 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I was awake and he was in my room.
L31847 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do you really?
L31846 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Good.
L31845 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Of course.
L31844 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
L31843 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Yes?
L31842 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Alex?
L31841 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ It's nice to see you.
L31840 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ It's nice to see you.
L31839 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ David, perhaps you'd like to watch the telly while I take a shower.
L31838 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ There is only one bed.
L31837 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ The bedroom.
L31836 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Lovely.
L31835 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Bathroom.
L31834 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Charming.
L31833 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Closet.
L31832 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Very nice.
L31831 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ The kitchen.
L31829 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Yeah, I would think so, too.
L31828 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ I would think so.
L31827 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I was dreaming again?
L31826 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
L31825 +++$+++ u274 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
L31824 +++$+++ u269 +++$+++ m17 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Your dead friend Jack?
