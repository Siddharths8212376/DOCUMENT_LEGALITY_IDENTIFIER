L400595 +++$+++ u2186 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ CORRECTIONAL OFFICER +++$+++ Better make yourself comfortable. We got a three hour drive here.
L400327 +++$+++ u2198 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SHEELER +++$+++ No, Dr. Delbanco, it is I who am sorry. Sorry to have wasted your time with such...
L400326 +++$+++ u2187 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ DELBANCO +++$+++ Phyllis, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shout...
L400325 +++$+++ u2187 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ DELBANCO +++$+++ Oh, for god's sake, Phyllis -- we have no reason to doubt the man! Are we listening to Lionel now?
L400324 +++$+++ u2198 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SHEELER +++$+++ You do seem much more disposed toward him than I understand, Ernest. Did I miss something?
L400319 +++$+++ u2187 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ DELBANCO +++$+++ It could happen. What about his state certification exams? The records seem to be in order.
L400318 +++$+++ u2198 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SHEELER +++$+++ But they're certainly dead. And yes, personally, I find it a bit odd.
L400236 +++$+++ u2198 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SHEELER +++$+++ So... the University of Kentucky. Who runs the program down there?
L400235 +++$+++ u2187 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ DELBANCO +++$+++ ...And I from Phyllis.
L400234 +++$+++ u2198 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SHEELER +++$+++ What Ernest means, I think, is we're very interested in other methodology... different kinds of training. We're great believers in learning from each other. I've learned so much from Ern -- Dr. Delbanco...
L400225 +++$+++ u2187 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ DELBANCO +++$+++ You never got back to me.  ...I called to say we'd like to take you out for a meal?... Kind of a professional welcome.
L400224 +++$+++ u2198 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SHEELER +++$+++ Thank you.
L399785 +++$+++ u2187 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ DELBANCO +++$+++ I think he's got a point.
L399784 +++$+++ u2198 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SHEELER +++$+++ Ernest, what do you think?
L399783 +++$+++ u2187 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ DELBANCO +++$+++ What an asshole!
L400458 +++$+++ u2187 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ DELBANCO +++$+++ As you can imagine, my own feelings about this are mixed... Unlike, I must say, those of my wife.
L400457 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Dr. Sheeler is leaving Mumford? I'm sorry to hear that.
L400456 +++$+++ u2187 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ DELBANCO +++$+++ Phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city. Which leaves you the only psychologist in town.
L400455 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ What's that?
L400454 +++$+++ u2187 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ DELBANCO +++$+++ And please, for whatever small way I may have encouraged this, accept my apologies.  There is good news, though.
L400453 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ I see.
L400452 +++$+++ u2187 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ DELBANCO +++$+++ About you... your background and your qualifications. I'm afraid Phyllis somehow got you mixed up in her fury with me, and actually took the whole issue to the state board.
L400451 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ What kind of doubts?
L400450 +++$+++ u2187 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ DELBANCO +++$+++ Well... you see, when I broke it off with Phyllis, she was naturally upset and she became more determined than ever to pursue certain -- how to put it -- doubts she's been harboring...
L400449 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ How do you mean?
L400448 +++$+++ u2187 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ DELBANCO +++$+++ ...I won't go into that today. Though, if we should continue these sessions, as I certainly hope we will, there are some aspects of that I would like to look at. God knows, I've listened to enough people giving me the juicy --  ...At any rate, I just wanted to acknowledge the catalyzing effect your comment had on me. I just hope that it doesn't come roiling back upon you like some dreadful undertow.
L400251 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ My approach?
L400250 +++$+++ u2187 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ DELBANCO +++$+++ We're interested in any new therapies. How would you characterize your approach?
L400243 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Dorothy Fowler. Fantastic woman. She passed last year in a train wreck. Damned Amtrak.
L400242 +++$+++ u2187 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ DELBANCO +++$+++ Interesting approach. What was his name?
L400238 +++$+++ u2187 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ DELBANCO +++$+++ I think I've heard of him... a disciple of Rothberg, wasn't he?
L400237 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ My mentor was an amazing teacher named Benton Mandlebaum. Died quite tragically in the collapse of a gazebo.
L400233 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Are we?
L400232 +++$+++ u2187 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ DELBANCO +++$+++ I've run on. Forgive me. We're here to talk about you.
L400230 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Right now?
L400229 +++$+++ u2187 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ DELBANCO +++$+++ What are you doing for lunch?
L400223 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Of course... I've heard great things about you.
L400222 +++$+++ u2187 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ DELBANCO +++$+++ I don't think you know Dr. Sheeler. She's the other therapist here in town.
L400221 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Dr. Delbanco. It's nice to see you again.
L400467 +++$+++ u2188 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ FOLLETT +++$+++ Me too, Doc. And I can't tell you what that package meant to me --
L400466 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ I feel like we're making real progress here.
L400392 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ My pleasure.
L400391 +++$+++ u2188 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ FOLLETT +++$+++ Uh, sorry, I'm going to have to...  ...I really appreciate what you're trying to... uh, I can't thank you enough for...
L400386 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ There's absolutely no reason to think this is going to have any impact on you. I'm embarrassed to have --
L400385 +++$+++ u2188 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ FOLLETT +++$+++ Whoa, whoa, what are you doing? I want to know what's in here.
L400382 +++$+++ u2188 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ FOLLETT +++$+++ And the experiment is in here?
L400381 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ My guess is these images were burned into your brain when you were young. Maybe if we could nail down the exact fantasies that are haunting you -- maybe you could get past them... Anyway, I thought we could try an experiment.
L400380 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ But you did come to me.
L400379 +++$+++ u2188 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ FOLLETT +++$+++ -- Which I don't necessarily agree.
L400378 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ -- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way --
L400377 +++$+++ u2188 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ FOLLETT +++$+++ -- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
L400376 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ You remember when I asked you about pornography --
L400375 +++$+++ u2188 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ FOLLETT +++$+++ What exactly is it supposed to do?
L400374 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Let me just say something here... I have no idea if this is going to help.
L400373 +++$+++ u2188 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ FOLLETT +++$+++ Should I open it now?
L400372 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ It's a thought I had.
L400371 +++$+++ u2188 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ FOLLETT +++$+++ What is it?
L400003 +++$+++ u2188 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ FOLLETT +++$+++ You are so mean.
L400002 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ What's that?
L400001 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Now we're back on track.
L400000 +++$+++ u2188 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ FOLLETT +++$+++ I was... never satisfied.
L399999 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ What?!
L399998 +++$+++ u2188 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ FOLLETT +++$+++ We got divorced.  I had to get rid of her. She couldn't satisfy me.
L399997 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ I didn't hear you.
L399996 +++$+++ u2188 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ FOLLETT +++$+++ Go to hell.
L399995 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Where's your wife, Henry?
L399993 +++$+++ u2188 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ FOLLETT +++$+++ I never said that.
L399992 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ You came because it's taking over. You're in its grip.
L399991 +++$+++ u2188 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ FOLLETT +++$+++ No?
L399990 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ You didn't come to me because you have a rich imagination.
L399989 +++$+++ u2188 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ FOLLETT +++$+++ I enjoy it. Does that make me some kind of pervert? Just because a man has a rich imaginative life --
L399988 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ It doesn't matter how I feel about it. It's how you feel about it that matters.
L399987 +++$+++ u2188 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ FOLLETT +++$+++ You find it distasteful, don't you?
L399986 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Not for this. Not me, you're not.
L399985 +++$+++ u2188 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ FOLLETT +++$+++ Why? I'm paying for this.
L399984 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Stop now.
L399983 +++$+++ u2188 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ FOLLETT +++$+++ What?
L399982 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Henry!
L399981 +++$+++ u2188 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ FOLLETT +++$+++ -- 'cause in that instant I saw the beginning of a vixen's smile and I knew --
L399980 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Mr. Follett.
L399979 +++$+++ u2188 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ FOLLETT +++$+++ Or maybe it wasn't an accident at all --
L399645 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Good, then go.
L399644 +++$+++ u2188 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ FOLLETT +++$+++ Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't want to come --
L399643 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Without trust, there's no point to any of this. You might as well not come.
L399642 +++$+++ u2188 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ FOLLETT +++$+++ Well, I don't know... I only been seeing you --
L399641 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you?
L399640 +++$+++ u2188 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ FOLLETT +++$+++ Why not?
L399639 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ I don't want to hear any more today.
L399638 +++$+++ u2188 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ FOLLETT +++$+++ I have eighteen more minutes!
L400445 +++$+++ u2189 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ GILROY +++$+++ I'm not at liberty to say. Sometimes it's just routine, sometimes there's been a complaint. We'll be in touch.
L400444 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ What brought this on?
L400443 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Mr. Gilroy --
L400442 +++$+++ u2189 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ GILROY +++$+++ No thanks. Plenty of time for that when we're a little further along.
L400441 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Do you want to come in?
L400440 +++$+++ u2189 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ GILROY +++$+++ It's all right, it won't bite you. Under civil code 1294.67b you are entitled to be notified that your status and certification are being reviewed. This is the notice.
L400439 +++$+++ u2189 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ GILROY +++$+++ My name's Gilroy. I'm from the State Certification Board.
L400438 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ I didn't see you there. Can I help you?
L399884 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ She seems very unhappy.
L399883 +++$+++ u2190 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ You're the doctor, what do you think?
L399882 +++$+++ u2190 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ She's gone weird is what's wrong with her. Out of control. Probably from living out here in Mayberry.
L399881 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ What do you think's wrong with her?
L399880 +++$+++ u2190 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ No... I mean about Althea. About her...  ...behavior. Do you think you can fix her up?
L399879 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Tastes good.
L399878 +++$+++ u2190 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ Well, I'm addicted to winning. I say when you're in the red zone, you gotta score.  So what do you think?
L399877 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ A little.
L399876 +++$+++ u2190 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ We've done... very well. You know anything about addiction, Doc?
L399875 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ You've done well.
L399874 +++$+++ u2190 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ Well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture. We've got twenty-three people working there now.
L399873 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ We've been talking about her, mostly.
L399872 +++$+++ u2190 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ Althea hasn't told you?
L399871 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ What do you do?
L399870 +++$+++ u2190 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ Fill in the blank. I don't mind the office. The point is, you only go 'round once. Like the Zens say -- Be here now.
L399869 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
L399868 +++$+++ u2190 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well."
L399867 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ I've had my moments.
L399866 +++$+++ u2190 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ Are you a man who likes to treat himself right?
L399863 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Nope.
L399862 +++$+++ u2190 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ I think you'll like this. Know much about Cuban cigars?
L399860 +++$+++ u2190 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ Sorry I'm late... traffic was a motherfucker. Have another drink, I'll be back in five.
L399859 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Doc. Nice to meet you.
L399858 +++$+++ u2190 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ You must be Dr. Mumford of Mumford. Jeremy Brockett.
L400586 +++$+++ u2191 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ JUDGE OTTO +++$+++ Maybe you can empathize with this -- Maximum fine. Three months in jail, three months house arrest. Sentence to begin immediately at the Orchard Valley Correctional Facility. Case closed. This court is adjourned.
L400585 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.
L400584 +++$+++ u2191 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ JUDGE OTTO +++$+++ Are you disrespecting this court, Mr. White?
L400583 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ I'm sorry you're frustrated.
L400582 +++$+++ u2191 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ JUDGE OTTO +++$+++ What?
L400581 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ I'm sorry, your honor.
L400580 +++$+++ u2191 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ JUDGE OTTO +++$+++ Mr. White, I am frustrated that the criminal code in this state allows a maximum sentence of only six months and a maximum fine of only $2000.
L400579 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Yes.
L400578 +++$+++ u2191 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ JUDGE OTTO +++$+++ It means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills. You understand that?
L400577 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Yes, your honor.
L400576 +++$+++ u2191 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ JUDGE OTTO +++$+++ ...People who have come to you with the faith that you know what you're doing... and that you are who you say you are?
L400575 +++$+++ u2191 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ JUDGE OTTO +++$+++ Do you realize how insidious it is to invade the most private thoughts and secret lives of unsuspecting people?...
L400574 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ I do.
L400573 +++$+++ u2191 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ JUDGE OTTO +++$+++ Clarence Norman White, do you understand how serious are the crimes with which you have been charged?
L400219 +++$+++ u2192 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Well, come on in.
L400218 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ Yeah.
L400217 +++$+++ u2192 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ You do?
L400216 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
L400215 +++$+++ u2192 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise.
L400214 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ What are they?
L400213 +++$+++ u2192 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees.
L400212 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ That's a lot of people all at once.
L400211 +++$+++ u2192 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ I'd better get in there.
L400210 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ So, is this like a Japanese restaurant?
L400206 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ What?
L400205 +++$+++ u2192 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ I've seen you going by on your board, but I didn't realize -- you're so young... to be so...
L400204 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ Upstairs, with Doc... Yeah, it's very nice... I heard your shower.
L400203 +++$+++ u2192 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Oh?
L400202 +++$+++ u2199 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ SKIP +++$+++ Yeah... me you, too... I was at your house...
L400517 +++$+++ u2192 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Too bad. That's tough, I mean it. I'm not unsympathetic. But Skip says you're in love.
L400516 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ What it might take is... doing time.
L400515 +++$+++ u2192 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Clean up the mess. No matter what it takes.
L400514 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ That's it? That's what you're giving me?
L400513 +++$+++ u2192 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
L400512 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Okay.
L400511 +++$+++ u2192 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Yes, you do, you damn well do.
L400510 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.
L400509 +++$+++ u2192 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ I want to give you something. Will you let me?
L400508 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ You would have met in some shower eventually...
L400507 +++$+++ u2192 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Skip and I wouldn't have got together if it weren't for you. That's a big deal.
L400506 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ He told you.
L400505 +++$+++ u2192 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ I don't want you to be mad at Skip...
L400504 +++$+++ u2192 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Doc.
L400503 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Lily.
L400502 +++$+++ u2192 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Doc...
L400208 +++$+++ u2192 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ ...so accomplished.
L400207 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ ...so rich?
L400201 +++$+++ u2192 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ It's a pleasure to meet you.
L400200 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Lily, I want you to meet Skip. Skip, Lily.
L400197 +++$+++ u2192 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ You're on your own today, honey.
L400196 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Where am I supposed to eat?
L400195 +++$+++ u2192 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ They come through a few times each year.  Hello, Mrs. Saito, good to see you again!  It's a tour.
L399914 +++$+++ u2192 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ No gentleman caller, Doc.  Not that I care. I've had it with men. They're so fascinated by their own crap. Took me four years to get the last one out. Almost turned me into a dyke... These days my idea of a hot date is a long shower by myself before bed. Now that feels good. And you don't have to do all that... listening.
L399913 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Why do you watch?
L399912 +++$+++ u2192 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Shocking. Did you know the government is wasteful?  You heard it here first. Oh, and being a supermodel... it's no walk in the park.
L399911 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ ...And?
L399910 +++$+++ u2192 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ It was insane here, man. 'Hadda call in the National Guard.  Then I did my laundry... watched 20/20.
L399909 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Horror show. What'd you do tonight?
L399908 +++$+++ u2192 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ And the Brocketts?
L399907 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ It's a pretty piece of land.
L399906 +++$+++ u2192 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Do we run into the street? No, I didn't think so.  Nice car. How's that place?
L399755 +++$+++ u2192 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Doc.  Ainge...
L399754 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ How ya doin', Ainge? Evenin', Lily.
L399666 +++$+++ u2192 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Not sure. Let me think about it.
L399665 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ You like me. How come?
L399664 +++$+++ u2192 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ So, what makes you so popular? What's your secret?
L399663 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Oh, so that's him? The Panda Man.
L399662 +++$+++ u2192 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ You know who that is, don't you?  You really don't? That's Skip Skipperton, man. He gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down.
L399660 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Lily, I don't think even you could know that --
L399659 +++$+++ u2192 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Four months, two and a half weeks -- that's how long.  And you've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined.
L399658 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Oh, I don't know...
L399657 +++$+++ u2192 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ How long you been in this town?
L399654 +++$+++ u2192 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything.
L399653 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ What do you want to know?
L399652 +++$+++ u2192 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Man, you see him a lot. And it's very wrong to reveal it. Next you'll be saying what his problem is.
L399651 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ It was Henry Follett.
L399650 +++$+++ u2192 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ I think it's like... inquisitive.
L399649 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Does the phrase "nosy" have any meaning to you, Lily?
L399648 +++$+++ u2192 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Who was that?
