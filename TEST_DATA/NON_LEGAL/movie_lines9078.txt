L232359 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Nathanael, someone bred to station, bred to being a gentleman -- unlike these men -- his sense of duty naturally prevails over the baser needs.
L232358 +++$+++ u1061 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ NATHANAEL GREENE +++$+++ Sir, Congress hasn't issued their pay for two months, many have not eaten properly for at least that long.  You're being a little hard on them, don't you think?
L232357 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ The only way to get discipline into these men is to beat it into them! Fifty lashes each!
L232212 +++$+++ u1061 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ NATHANAEL GREENE +++$+++ Yes, but I've spent the last winter studying all the great battles of history.  And I read the lives of Caesar, Alexander, Hannibal...  Sir, I'm volunteering you the wholehearted support of the Rhode Island army.
L232211 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ A horseshoer?
L232210 +++$+++ u1061 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ NATHANAEL GREENE +++$+++ I have commanded the Rhode Island Militia for a year now.  My father is an ironmaster.  As was I.
L232209 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ But, you do come from a military family?
L232208 +++$+++ u1061 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ NATHANAEL GREENE +++$+++ I was born with a limp, sir.  The Militia used to hate it when I marches with them because my pike would always sway...
L232207 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ It isn't my army yet, Colonel Greene.  Looks like you've seen some action -- did you hurt your leg, in a fight?
L232206 +++$+++ u1061 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ NATHANAEL GREENE +++$+++ I... I'm possessed of the idea of a command in your army, sir.
L232205 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Yes, yes, happy to meet you.
L232204 +++$+++ u1061 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ NATHANAEL GREENE +++$+++ Colonel Washington?  Colonel Nathanael Greene, Rhode Island Militia.
L232180 +++$+++ u1061 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ NATHANAEL GREENE +++$+++ Yessir!
L232179 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ They're finished, they can't help us anymore!  They've done their duty, General Greene, now you do yours!
L232178 +++$+++ u1061 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ NATHANAEL GREENE +++$+++ We're leaving them?
L232177 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ We can't take them.  Are you all right?
L232518 +++$+++ u1062 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ "Mankind is born free, but everywhere he is in chains..."
L232517 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Really?  Which precious homily was it?
L232516 +++$+++ u1062 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Well, I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements... but which I now see means us all.
L232515 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ I remember a pair of young philosophers once, who laughed at the world.
L232514 +++$+++ u1062 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ You remember, George, when we were 'studying' the great philosophers?
L232513 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ I'd throw everything away for you.
L232512 +++$+++ u1062 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Now that is a lie!  See how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet!  When you break off your engagement to Martha Curtis, I'll divorce William!  Do you hear?  You get what you want from this world, then throw it all away on love!
L232511 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Perhaps you've been counting my acres, Mrs. Fairfax, and discovered exactly how poor I really am.
L232510 +++$+++ u1062 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Is it?  William says now you have requested a British Commission, why not colonial?  I'll clear it up for you, sir, because as a British officer you can lord over colonial yokels -- more than that, it will even get you into polite society! Your dream come true, George, the only dream that really matters to you.
L232509 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ That's a lie!
L232508 +++$+++ u1062 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ And what is this, then?  Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot?  Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!?
L232507 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ But not more than your comfort.
L232506 +++$+++ u1062 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ George, you know I only love you, but...
L232505 +++$+++ u1062 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Is that the truth?  Well, we can't carry on like animals any longer.
L232504 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ You know very well who it is that I love.
L232503 +++$+++ u1062 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Well, the widow Curtis will bring you riches, position, land, even half-grown children.  You won't have to do anything at all!  You shan't have to do another thing to prove yourself.
L232491 +++$+++ u1065 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Words, words, words!  Sally has been tutoring George in the philosophies, isn't that right?
L232490 +++$+++ u1062 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Think what the play means, William. Perhaps these words have a place in the real world.
L232422 +++$+++ u1065 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Hear that, George?  Sally's actually taken to thinking of this clod of earth as her home.  And it's her first tour.  We're gratified, aren't we George?
L232421 +++$+++ u1062 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Except for that, quite like home; England, that is.
L232420 +++$+++ u1065 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ We can grow three primary crops in a season and, if we have some luck, we get a forth.  The temperature is generally mild.
L232409 +++$+++ u1065 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ That's not what I said!  Now, Sally, you're embarrassing me!  Watch out for her, George; she talks refinement, but she has a barbarous soul!
L232408 +++$+++ u1062 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Oh, but you must not mind my talking about you!  In fact, William says my main job here at Belvoir is to civilize you; to make an honest English gentleman out of you.
L232407 +++$+++ u1065 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ George, I'm sorry.
L232406 +++$+++ u1062 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ So, you are William's wild young neighbor?  Or should I say, 'brother'; William claims you as a member of his family.  I have heard so many unflattering tales about you, and I understand, that except for you, this 'family' is quite cultivated.
L232496 +++$+++ u1062 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Voltaire, of course...
L232495 +++$+++ u1066 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ YOUNG WASHINGTON +++$+++ That's good... who?
L232494 +++$+++ u1062 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Remember, George, "It is dangerous to be right in matters on which the established authorities are wrong."
L232479 +++$+++ u1062 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ And dost thou live to ask it?
L232478 +++$+++ u1066 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ YOUNG WASHINGTON +++$+++ I'm lost in ecstasy!  And dost thou love, Thou charming maid?
L232477 +++$+++ u1062 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I've been surprised in an unguarded hour, But must not now go back; the love that lay, Half smothered in my breast, has broke through all, Its weak restraints, and burns in its full lustre.  I cannot, if I would, conceal it from thee.
L232475 +++$+++ u1062 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Those people?  I doubt they'd think of this.  Ooo, you're wonderful this color!
L232474 +++$+++ u1066 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ YOUNG WASHINGTON +++$+++ They can use their imaginations.
L232473 +++$+++ u1062 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Why?  Juba was an African and you want to look the part -- hold still.
L232472 +++$+++ u1066 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ YOUNG WASHINGTON +++$+++ You're out of your mind!
L232471 +++$+++ u1062 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Let's get you darker!
L232470 +++$+++ u1066 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ YOUNG WASHINGTON +++$+++ What are you doing?
L232467 +++$+++ u1066 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ YOUNG WASHINGTON +++$+++ I think I will disappoint you.
L232466 +++$+++ u1062 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I don't laugh at you, George.  I like you.  I like you because you will never, ever make it as an aristocrat... and that's because you're completely incompetent at hiding your feelings.
L232465 +++$+++ u1066 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ YOUNG WASHINGTON +++$+++ What else should I become?  There's no difference between Virginia and England.  I must be educated if I'm to take my place in society.  My father couldn't afford to send me to England for school -- he made a shambles of our fortunes.  Everyone laughs at me.
L232464 +++$+++ u1062 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ And to think I am teaching you to become one of them...
L232463 +++$+++ u1066 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ YOUNG WASHINGTON +++$+++ Well, we must be who we must be...
L232462 +++$+++ u1062 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Is it?  Well, I'm scared of what we've become in our freedom.
L232461 +++$+++ u1066 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ YOUNG WASHINGTON +++$+++ It's the freest land on earth.
L232460 +++$+++ u1062 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Do you?  When I saw those men yesterday in the field... and the women and children in those hovels? I'm not so sure if America is as far from England as I'd hoped.
L232459 +++$+++ u1066 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ YOUNG WASHINGTON +++$+++ I think America suits you.
L232458 +++$+++ u1062 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ The place to want to be is America. Every English child dreams of it. I dreamt it.
L232457 +++$+++ u1066 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ YOUNG WASHINGTON +++$+++ I always though London was the place to be:  capital of the world, the most spectacular city on earth.
L232452 +++$+++ u1062 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Perhaps you best ask, why you wish it.  You asked William to teach you manners, philosophy, decorum... as I said, it's completely stupid.
L232451 +++$+++ u1066 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ YOUNG WASHINGTON +++$+++ Then why are you teaching me...?
L232450 +++$+++ u1062 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ It's stupid, of course.
L232449 +++$+++ u1066 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ YOUNG WASHINGTON +++$+++ What do you really think of the minuet, anyway?
L232446 +++$+++ u1062 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ That's just my interpretation. Actually it's a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners. You see?  Walk in a gently 'Z'. There are four distinct movements...
L232445 +++$+++ u1066 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ YOUNG WASHINGTON +++$+++ Cranes?  Who needs to walk like a crane?
L232444 +++$+++ u1062 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ In the minuet, George, every movement is significant, like the strut of cranes...
L232443 +++$+++ u1066 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ YOUNG WASHINGTON +++$+++ Or, 'civilized'.
L232442 +++$+++ u1062 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ The word 'minuet' finds its source in minitus, which is Latin meaning 'small' or 'orderly'.
L232439 +++$+++ u1066 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ YOUNG WASHINGTON +++$+++ Sally, our slave system is a British law...
L232438 +++$+++ u1062 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Capture them?  Well, I've never seen anything like it, so... of course I'm curious.
L232437 +++$+++ u1066 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ YOUNG WASHINGTON +++$+++ Slavers capture them and bring them here.
L232436 +++$+++ u1062 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Africa?  That's so far?  How do they get here?
L232435 +++$+++ u1066 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ YOUNG WASHINGTON +++$+++ Africa, of course.
L232434 +++$+++ u1062 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Where... do those men come from, George?
L232870 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ God damn you, Sam Adams!  You wanted a revolutionary army and now that we've really got one it scares you more than it does the British!
L232869 +++$+++ u1063 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SAM ADAMS +++$+++ Is that your test of patriotism, George; if a man will die for you?
L232257 +++$+++ u1063 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SAM ADAMS +++$+++ Well, I hear 'The People'.  Indentured servants, freed slaves... escaped slaves.  The world's castaways.  And, my fear is, in the scramble for power that's coming, you will betray them.
L232256 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ That?  I hear a mob:  unemployed, drunkards, vagabonds... the world's dregs.
L232255 +++$+++ u1063 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SAM ADAMS +++$+++ You hear that?
L232250 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Are these philosopher going to be here to help you fight your war? You know why I don't trust revolutions?  Because each of us is who we are:  we make speeches, print pamphlets, and we never change.  The world is not a philosophical abstraction, Mister Adams, it's us.  And, I don't believe you can ever change human nature.
L232249 +++$+++ u1063 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SAM ADAMS +++$+++ And 'others', say... have you even read Locke, Vattel, Voltaire, Diderot...
L232248 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ I see...
L232247 +++$+++ u1063 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SAM ADAMS +++$+++ I say!
L232246 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Who says so?
L232245 +++$+++ u1063 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SAM ADAMS +++$+++ Yes!
L232244 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Just because they are born?
L232243 +++$+++ u1063 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SAM ADAMS +++$+++ All people have rights!
L232242 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ That land belongs to the strongest.
L232241 +++$+++ u1063 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SAM ADAMS +++$+++ You are a slave owner!  You have been illegally surveying lands beyond the Ohio Valley!  That land belongs to the natives!
L232493 +++$+++ u1065 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Don't be silly, you have whole worlds to fathom.
L232492 +++$+++ u1066 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ YOUNG WASHINGTON +++$+++ William, we've been studying hard, I really know my stuff.
L232487 +++$+++ u1065 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ He was not black!  He was... tan! Weathered!
L232486 +++$+++ u1066 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ YOUNG WASHINGTON +++$+++ Juba was a Numidian.
L232485 +++$+++ u1065 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ For God sake, get that horrid stuff off your face.  You look like a damned slave!  It's damned humiliating.
L232481 +++$+++ u1066 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ YOUNG WASHINGTON +++$+++ This, this is life indeed!  Life worth preserving, Such life as Juba never felt till now.
L232480 +++$+++ u1065 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ My daughter, I ask only...
L232417 +++$+++ u1066 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ YOUNG WASHINGTON +++$+++ Though, sometimes we get frost and that can cut the season.
L232416 +++$+++ u1065 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ The land here is best for grain and corn.
L233088 +++$+++ u1067 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ ATTENDANT +++$+++ Hey, you want La Tierra Rent-A-Car just over there, but I think all they got are Rabbit convertibles.
L233087 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ You're kidding me, right?
L233086 +++$+++ u1067 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ ATTENDANT +++$+++ Yeah, well, this one's the Cadillac of minivans.
L233085 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ I reserved a Cadillac.
L233084 +++$+++ u1067 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ ATTENDANT +++$+++ An Oldsmobile Silhouette.
L233083 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ What is this?
L234095 +++$+++ u1068 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BEAR +++$+++ You're right.
L234094 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ You keep hittin' him like that, he ain't gonna look like he broke in anymore, he gonna look like someone beat him up and then shot him.
L234091 +++$+++ u1068 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BEAR +++$+++ We'll get it later.
L234090 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ Hey, he should have a weapon, a knife or something.
L234089 +++$+++ u1068 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BEAR +++$+++ And that's for the airport.
L234066 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ Don't fade on me now, Bear. Not unless you wanna hold Farrah on your lap in a room fulla felons.
L234065 +++$+++ u1068 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BEAR +++$+++ Hell, why not just shoot her? Why not shoot everybody. Fuckin' shoot me. Shoot the fuckin' president?
L234064 +++$+++ u1068 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BEAR +++$+++ Calm down? We're going away for life and you tell me to calm down?
L234063 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ Calm down, Bear...
L234062 +++$+++ u1068 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BEAR +++$+++ You get life for kidnapping.
L234055 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ The money. Fuck. I gotta think...
L234054 +++$+++ u1068 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BEAR +++$+++ Trade for what?
L234050 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ Plan B. Here ya go, honey...
L234049 +++$+++ u1068 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BEAR +++$+++ No. What's this?
L234048 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ You get the money?
L233969 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ Just do what I told you and meet me back here at midnight.
L233968 +++$+++ u1068 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BEAR +++$+++ And if we don't happen to find it under Palmer's mattress or inside Karen Flores' undie drawer? What then?
L233967 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ I was thinking tonight you could go have a look around Palmer's hotel room while I go check out Karen Flores' place. See if he hasn't stashed it somewhere.
L233966 +++$+++ u1068 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BEAR +++$+++ What about him?
L233965 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ Remember Harry's story about the dry cleaner Palmer was after? Guy who stole the three hundred grand from the airline?
L233964 +++$+++ u1068 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BEAR +++$+++ After this one, I'm out, Cat, you understand? This is the last time we talk to each other.
L233963 +++$+++ u1068 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BEAR +++$+++ Farrah. Come here.
L233962 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ I heard in the Federal joints they let you spend an extra five minutes at the glass with your Daddy on Father's Day.
L233961 +++$+++ u1068 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BEAR +++$+++ Come here, Farrah...
L233960 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ He's gonna plea-deal his way out. Give up this ace stunt man now one of the West Coast dope kings, if they go easy on the Cat.
L233957 +++$+++ u1068 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BEAR +++$+++ That's your problem. You shouldn't've smoked the guy.
L233956 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ Bear. The Colombians are in L.A. Seems they all upset about their money. That ain't enough, as a bonus, it turns out the yoyo was Escobar's nephew.
L233955 +++$+++ u1068 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BEAR +++$+++ Into air bags. There's no cushion under what you're doing. I'm out of it, Cat. I'm done.
L233954 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ Whoa... This is the man used to jump offa high buildings?
L233953 +++$+++ u1068 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BEAR +++$+++ Her mother. Not that it matters because I don't work for you no more. I quit. I just wanted to come by, tell you to your face so there's no misunderstanding.
L233952 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ Who?
L233951 +++$+++ u1068 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BEAR +++$+++ I can't. I got to take Farrah to Satan's place down in Costa Mesa.
L233950 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ Listen, tonight, later on, I got one for you doesn't involve any heavy work. I want you to go have a look around Chili Palmer's hotel room.
L233949 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ Yeah, I'm really gonna miss him.
L233948 +++$+++ u1068 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BEAR +++$+++ His foot. Jeez, poor Ronnie...
L233947 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ I seen it, but I don't believe it. Says Harry shot Ronnie five times. Four to the chest and one through his foot.
L233946 +++$+++ u1068 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BEAR +++$+++ You see the paper?
L233838 +++$+++ u1068 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BEAR +++$+++ I mean I don't care.
L233837 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ You guess? You mean you don't know?
L233836 +++$+++ u1068 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BEAR +++$+++ I guess still in the locker.
L233835 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ So where's the money?
L233834 +++$+++ u1068 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BEAR +++$+++ He knew it was a set up. He was ready for it.
L233572 +++$+++ u1068 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BEAR +++$+++ They all sound big at the talking stage.
L233571 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ Doesn't matter what it's called, Harry's got Martin Weir and it's gonna be big.
L233570 +++$+++ u1068 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BEAR +++$+++ Mr. Lovejoy? That's cute, Bo.
L233569 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ And I mean high up in it.  That's why Harry's gonna make Mr. Lovejoy with me, not Chili Palmer.
L233567 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ Yeah, well, I'm bored, Bear. I wanna make movies.
L233566 +++$+++ u1068 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BEAR +++$+++ Cat, that's the lamest idea I've ever heard.
L233564 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ You see that? The way the man just went right over?
L233563 +++$+++ u1068 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BEAR +++$+++ You didn't have to shoot him, Bo. We coulda just beat him up some.
L233562 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ Shit, now someone's gotta climb down there and get him.
L233826 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ No shit? What're some of 'em?
L233825 +++$+++ u1068 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BEAR +++$+++ About sixty.
L233824 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ So... how many movies you been in?

L233820 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ What're you hanging around with a guy like that for? You were in the movies, right? A stuntman? What's he ever done he can talk about? You feel okay?
L233815 +++$+++ u1068 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BEAR +++$+++ I don't need a gun. Where is it? If it isn't on you, it's around here someplace.

L233807 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ You think I'd be standing here? You set somebody up and you want it to work, it has to be a surprise. Can you remember that?
L233806 +++$+++ u1068 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BEAR +++$+++ So you didn't have the key with you.

L233856 +++$+++ u1076 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ I hear he's around Palm Springs. Dealing our product. Product we sold to you for five hundred thousand dollars.  Why do you keep talking to me bullshit? I think maybe I have Ramon and Ceasar staple your tongue to your chin. What do you think?

L233844 +++$+++ u1076 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ He's my sister's kid. No papa. Not too bright. Personally, I think he's a retard. I only gave him the job as a favor for my sister, you understand?
L233843 +++$+++ u1076 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ Yayo. Where is he?

L234080 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ It was Rio Bravo. Robert Mitchum was the drunk in El Dorado, Dean Martin in Rio Bravo, practically the same part. John Wayne, he also did the same thing in both. He played John Wayne.
L234079 +++$+++ u1069 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ BO CATLETT +++$+++ Only this time, no John Wayne and Dean Martin shooting the bad guys in El Dorado.
