L607933 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ Okay, Ken. We're going.
L607932 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence...  Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
L607931 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ You're sure...
L607930 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ They know each other! Khruschev and Feklisov aka Fomin were war buddies!
L607929 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ I've got to move. What do you have, Kenny?
L607928 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Hello?
L607866 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Zorin must not have gotten instructions. Somebody in their Foreign Ministry's blown it big-time.
L607865 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ Didn't know Adlai had it in him. Too bad he didn't have this stuff in '52.
L607819 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Yeah, a good political solution.
L607818 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ Jesus Christ, O'Donnell, you're the one saying we need to move forward on a political solution.
L607817 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Then somebody'd better deny it publicly.
L607816 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ It's a goddman trial balloon. Trial is the operative word, here.
L607815 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ If we made a trade, we'd be giving in to extortion, and NATO would never trust us again. We'll get clobbered in world opinion.
L607814 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ I don't want to listen to this again.
L607813 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Oh, just a bunch of crap about withdrawing our Jupiter missiles in Turkey if the Soviets'll do the same in Cuba.
L607812 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ What's that?
L607796 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ And we can't purge the Chiefs. Our invasion talk will look like a bluff. Or even that there's been an attempted coup.
L607795 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ He's right, we can't rescind DEFCON 2. The Soviets will think we've gotten sweet on them.
L607768 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Have to hope it's a signal that he'll back down on the real issue too.
L607767 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ We can horsetrade with Khruschev on ships. But it doesn't get us any closer to removing those missiles.
L607630 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ Any problems, you remind them those chains of commands end at one place. Me.
L607629 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ That's going to be tough. You know how these guys are about their chains of command...
L607627 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Maybe it's harder for them to say it than they let on. At the very least, they believe it's in our best interest. And at the end of the day, they may end up being right.
L607626 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ How does a man get to a place where he can say, 'throw those lives away,' so easily?
L607624 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ I'm gonna protect those pilots.
L607623 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ I'm your political advisor, and I'm giving you political analysis here. This is a setup. The Chiefs want to go in. It's the only way they can redeem themselves for the Bay of Pigs. They have to go in, and they have to do it right. It's that simple.
L607622 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Fair enough. But Castro's on alert and we're flying attack planes over their sites, on the deck. There's no way for them to know they're carrying cameras, not bombs. They're going to be shot at, plain and simple.
L607621 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ We need those flights. We have to know when those missiles become operational, because when they do, we need to destroy them.
L607620 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ What about these low-level flights? They're starting in what? An hour? Do you realize what you're letting yourself in for?
L607619 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ I know, I know...
L607618 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ All right. 'Cause you get armed boarders climbing into Soviet ships, shots being fired across bows...
L607617 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ In the morning I'm taking charge of the blockade from the situation room. McNamara'll set up shop in the flag plot at the Pentagon, keep an eye on things there.
L607616 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ I don't like what's happening.
L607582 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ They want this fucking job, they can have it. It's no great joy to me.
L607581 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ You'd worry that something was wrong if Congress offered you unconditional support.
L607564 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ I don't know. I don't know.
L607563 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ We have to try the blockades. It probably won't work. It may just be delaying the inevitable. But we can't just go to war without trying not to.
L607531 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Damn right I'm scared.
L607530 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ You're scared to cancel on Daly.
L607529 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ I'm not calling and canceling on Daly. You call and cancel on Daly.
L607528 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ No way.
L607527 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ I don't care. Cancel it.
L607526 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on.
L607525 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ Have you canceled Chicago and the rest of the weekend yet?
L607480 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Cheer up, you've neutralized the entire White House Press Corps for a day.
L607479 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ Let's get out of here.
L607464 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ There is no expert on this subject, no wise old man.
L607463 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone.
L607462 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Call me Irish, but I don't believe in cooler heads prevailing.
L607416 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Then we need to do a few things right away. No Pierre. He knows, the press knows. You're going to have to keep up your schedule -- your movements are followed too closely. And we need to get these guys out of the White House. George Ball's got a conference room at State.  Reconvene over there this afternoon, come back here tonight.
L607415 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ Okay. Kenny and I only show for the meetings you call us into. Impress us. And do it fast.  You're in charge of keeping this quiet. If word gets out before we know what we're going to do, there'll be panic. And it'll ruin any chance of surprise if we decide to hit them.
L607402 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ There've got to be alternatives to just going out and bombing them.
L607401 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ No choice. This is going to cost lives any way we go. Do nothing, and it could be 80 million of ours. We have to get rid of those missiles.
L607351 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ Good.
L607350 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Should be here any minute.
L607341 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Not as far as the election goes.
L607340 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ Still think Cuba isn't important?
L607308 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Today, for your information, is Pulaski Day. We're going to Buffalo...
L607307 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ So what've we got today?
L607306 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ I was, you bastard.
L607305 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ No you weren't.
L607304 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ I was eating that.
L608062 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ And if this is a move to appease the hard line, then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house.
L608061 +++$+++ u3296 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ MCNAMARA +++$+++ At least it will expose whether Khruschev has been overthrown. We'll know what we're dealing with.
L607779 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ You were in the room. It was your purview. It was your job to make sure Bissel wasn't fucking us over and you didn't do it. You've got the most important job in the world right now. You're the smartest guy the President has.  Besides me.
L607778 +++$+++ u3296 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ MCNAMARA +++$+++ -- you sonofabitch, goddamn it, I didn't drop --
L607777 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Listen to me, goddamn it. We're talking about a possible nuclear war. You dropped the ball on Bay of Pigs --
L607776 +++$+++ u3296 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ MCNAMARA +++$+++ You must think I'm blind and stupid. I've already gotten the birds and bees from Bobby. The President doesn't have to double-barrel me.
L607774 +++$+++ u3296 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ MCNAMARA +++$+++ Of course it is. But the President needs to realize we're going to have to stop a ship eventually.
L607773 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Moving the line. Stroke of genius.
L608060 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Six months from now, I'm not going to care. Are you? We'll deal with it.
L608059 +++$+++ u3295 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ MCCONE +++$+++ It's transparent. The press'll be all over it.
L607966 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Jesus Christ...
L607965 +++$+++ u3295 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ MCCONE +++$+++ My specialists are in agreement: this morning's letter is not Khruschev. Last night's letter was.  The evidence supports only one conclusion: there has been a coup, and Khruschev was replaced overnight.
L607908 +++$+++ u3295 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ MCCONE +++$+++ That may be what they want us to think.
L607907 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ That may be why Khruschev's introducing this guy. We've been burned by his usual players in the formal channels, so he brings in an honest broker.
L607906 +++$+++ u3295 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ MCCONE +++$+++ Why else would they approach us in this way? It's deniable. The Soviets have done nothing but lie to us. This could be more of the same.
L607905 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Dangle a settlement, tie us down in negotiations, we come up short...
L607744 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ Will somebody find out what's going on?!
L607743 +++$+++ u3296 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ MCNAMARA +++$+++ Just a second, Mr. President.
L607742 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ Captain, belay that order!  Bob, where's that coming from!
L607741 +++$+++ u3296 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ MCNAMARA +++$+++ Mr. President! We're receiving reports that the ships are stopping!
L607740 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ Captain, force the sub to the surface for inspection.
L607734 +++$+++ u3296 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ MCNAMARA +++$+++ I'm afraid not, Mr. President. The sub has positioned itself between the Pierce and the Soviet ships. Admiral Anderson insists it's too much of a risk to proceed with stopping the freighters. The Pierce would be a sitting duck for the sub.
L607733 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ Bob, is there any way we can avoid stopping a submarine first?
L607395 +++$+++ u3296 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ MCNAMARA +++$+++ We've worked up several military scenarios. Before I ask General Taylor to lead us through the various options, I'd like for us to adopt a rule. If we are going to strike, we must agree now that we will do it before the missiles become operational. Because once they are, I don't think we can guarantee getting them all before at least some are launched.
L607394 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ Bob?
L607366 +++$+++ u3296 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ MCNAMARA +++$+++ Sleep is for the weak, Mr. President.
L607365 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ Bob. Bet you had a late night.
L611301 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Don't have one, Carl. I have a number, man. Just like the numbers on those treasury checks. You stole from your own country, Carl. Shame on you.
L611300 +++$+++ u3300 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Jesus Christ, Larry, what the fu-- Larry. That's not even your name, is it? What's your real name, you fucking scumbag?
L611288 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ We are one-dimensional, boring peddlers of fine carpet, Carl.
L611287 +++$+++ u3300 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Rug samples.
L611286 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Anyone stops us going in, we're with the Bowen-Hamilton Textile Company. We have rug samples.
L611285 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Breathe, Carl. Four, nice, deep ones.
L611284 +++$+++ u3300 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Heroes ain't supposed to shake. I'm shakin', man, look at me.
L611283 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You're my hero, Carl.
L611282 +++$+++ u3300 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Yeah.
L611280 +++$+++ u3300 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Don't get too attached.
L611279 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Hey. Nice tie.
L611278 +++$+++ u3300 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Hey.
L611591 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ They can lead us to Jimmy. Just let them go. We're tightening the net on him. We know he's on the reservation.
L611590 +++$+++ u3301 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CLEAR MOON +++$+++ They're going to kill me next. That's what I hear. These new Indians are destroying everything. Our people are a quiet people.
L611589 +++$+++ u3301 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CLEAR MOON +++$+++ Our police are afraid of them. Please get them out of here.
L611588 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Mr. Clear Moon.
L611412 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Oh, I'm set, Sir. I'm set.
L611411 +++$+++ u3301 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CLEAR MOON +++$+++ Are you hungry? I have some nice raw kidney in the truck.
L611410 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I see.
L611409 +++$+++ u3301 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CLEAR MOON +++$+++ Yes. Rooms thirteen and fourteen are on Indian land.
L611408 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I thought we were staying on the reservation.
L611435 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ The only good Indian is a dead Indian, does that old adage still hold true out here?
L611434 +++$+++ u3304 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ You know how in your big cities, you got your niggers and you got your Puerto Ricans? Well out here we got Indians. That's just the way it is.
L611430 +++$+++ u3304 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Again. Figures, man.
L611429 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ A murder. On the reservation.
L611428 +++$+++ u3304 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ FBI? What you investigatin'?
L611427 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Brooks, what's a perceptive fellow like you, doing in a joint like this? Let me buy you a glass of some of that Russian shit you like.
L611424 +++$+++ u3304 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ Hey, Brooks, come over here. I want you to meet a coupla fellas from Denver.
L611423 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Now keep that between us, Dennis, cuz I don't know what kinda Johnny Law they got here.
L611527 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ -- don't "man" me, Jimmy. Where's the key?
L611526 +++$+++ u3305 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ LOOKS TWICE +++$+++ You think I killed him? Cuz he was an apple? Well, let me tell you something about Leo, Man --

L611518 +++$+++ u3305 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ LOOKS TWICE +++$+++ That's right. What are you doing here? This is a religious ceremony you're desecrating.

L611516 +++$+++ u3305 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ LOOKS TWICE +++$+++ What are you doing?
L611329 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Different culture. Hard to penetrate. The Indians don't like white cops poking around. And that's why we're in a position where we have to bring in an American Indian agent.
L611328 +++$+++ u3309 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ TULLY +++$+++ The main problem is, Ray, these people are extremely distrustful of outsiders, non-Indians. Relations have not been amicable.
L611327 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ It's not the first. There's been several. And our field office in Rapid City is getting a lot of heat... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit.
L611326 +++$+++ u3309 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ TULLY +++$+++ Ray, there's been a homicide out in an area known as The Badlands. Indian Reservation.

L611967 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ No. We neutralized enemies of the United States. Anti-American radicals who have killed federal officers out here!
L611966 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ We neutralized anybody with a voice. Leo, Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who was standing in the way of the land. Is that it?
L611965 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ We were sworn in on the Constitution to protect federal matters, Ray. I don't know about uranium, I don't know about Red Dog Table -- all I know is we did our job. It's over.
L611964 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ -- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...
L611963 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ This was a Selective Operations Unit, Agent Levoi. There is classified information pertaining to our national security. You don't question that, you don't go digging into that shit -- that's insubordination. Jesus Christ --
L611961 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What is it? It's genocide, that's what it is. It's a Pay Zone for some U.S. corporation and a Dead Zone for the people here. Uranium, Cooch.
L611960 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ -- what the hell is Red Deer Table?
L611959 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You didn't tell me about Red Deer Table --
L611958 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ You ever put your hands on me again and you'll be doing the books for a baitshop in the fucking Everglades, Mister.
L611848 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Cuz I want New York.
L611847 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Why?
L611846 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Listen: when we get back tomorrow, you're gonna find Tully laying a promotion on you. S.A.C. He wants to prove that his yuppie agents are making good. He's offering you New York. Tell him you want Atlanta.
L611825 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ -- never mind Eagle Bear. We've got Jimmy nailed. Let's go!
L611824 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Sorry, Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear --
L611823 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Never turn your radio off! I thought I was gonna find you scalped! Damn it!
L611822 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Yeah. I... I fell asleep. I can't believe it. I --
L611821 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Jesus, you alright?
L611746 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ The Little Walking River. You're right. This is part of it. So whoever sunk this car didn't compensate for drought. Goddamn.
L611745 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ And it was full of water when I drove by here three days ago. Full. I mean... a river.
L611741 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Yes.
L611740 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Tread matches. It's the car.
L611739 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ -- Cooch. Woh. Stop.
L611738 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Well, she's running now, too. These fucking people like to run, don't --
L611737 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Eagle's claws and a bear's balls that's what her profile says.
L611736 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ She's that subtle?
L611735 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ It may have been Maggie's way of saying "get off my ass."
L611734 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ He's out there. He's out there playing Sitting Bull with us. I want the motherfucker so bad I'm getting a bleeding ulcer.
L611733 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ All I could think of was... not here. I don't wanna eat it on an Indian Reservation, three thousand miles from home.
L611732 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Bastards...
L611730 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ And get rid of the dog.
L611729 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Thanks, Cooch.
L611728 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ I'll sleep around a little.
L611726 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Yeah, alright, alright -- fuck you -- give a yuppie a badge and he wants to take over the world. Go get a tail on Eagle Bear, and stay with her. Cuz Jimmy's gonna show. And I want you to make the collar.
L611725 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Alright. Alright...
L611724 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Ray. I never get into bed with somebody unless I know for sure. Just the way I was raised.
L611723 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer.
L611722 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ Your first homicide, that's gonna happen, Ray...
L611721 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I'm not trying to pull against you, Cooch. I've just been having nightmares about the way Leo was killed.
L611720 +++$+++ u3302 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ COOCH +++$+++ You weren't sent here to go off on your own detail, Ray. You were sent here to assist in a Selective Operations Unit. These regional agents are inept -- that's why they were sent out here to The Graveyard, to Indian Country. I need you behind me, Ray. Not pulling against me.
