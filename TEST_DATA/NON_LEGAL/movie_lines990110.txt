L374338 +++$+++ u6543 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Ok...but go to a movie first or something...not good to be driving around right away.  You know you can't do much for him now...it's out of your hands.
L374337 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Hide the gun.  Throw it away. Anything.  Listen, I gotta borrow your car...I think we should take a ride...away from here for the night...you know what I mean?
L374336 +++$+++ u6543 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Get out of here before this really goes up.
L374304 +++$+++ u6543 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Sure she is.  She's always in here with some different guy.  You know the way they are.
L374303 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ She don't look Jewish.
L374302 +++$+++ u6543 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Look at her.

L374054 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I don't know, but God help him if he does it again!
L374053 +++$+++ u6543 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Prophesy to us, oh Christ!  Who is it that struck thee?

L373755 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Look who's talking.  Pretentious bullshit.  Who's the guy with William Blake and the tigers, eh?
L373754 +++$+++ u6543 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ You are with out a doubt the biggest, most pretentious bullshit thrower I know.  Like to see what kind of business you'd do.
L373753 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ And I wouldn't call it TONY'S PLACE or CHARLIE'S PLACE...  I'd call it something like SEASON OF THE WITCH... get it?
L373746 +++$+++ u6543 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ 'Take a little tip from Mack the Knife...'
L373745 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ See what I mean?  A question please...'Is this what you call living?'

L373739 +++$+++ u6543 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Keep quiet about this.  I don't have any license for him yet.  I've only had him a couple of days. Nobody can feed him except me.  I'm the only one he trusts.  Watch.
L374200 +++$+++ u6535 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Johnny, you're a real jerk-off.
L374199 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You got some mouth!
L374165 +++$+++ u6535 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ I bet 235.  Because I dreamt of my grandfather - and when he died, the number of the funeral parlour was 235 - so when I dreamt...
L374164 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you.
L374163 +++$+++ u6535 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ The number was 235 - I bet it combination.
L374162 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Next time, bet with your own kind.
L373761 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Not quite...but keep trying.
L373760 +++$+++ u6535 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ Waddaya think?
L374344 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Good idea.
L374343 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ What are you going to do?  Hide me?
L374342 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Forget it.
L374341 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ This can't be settled any other way now...I'll take full blame.
L374340 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ No.
L374339 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ I think we should see your uncle.
L374324 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ He has about twenty-eight bucks... it's all he has on him.
L374323 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Hello, Michael.  I've got something for you...not much...but...
L374296 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Mind your own business.

L374288 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Don't you move!!!
L374285 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Come on.
L374284 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ No, I just want to help myself, that's all.
L374283 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ NO!!!  What do you think I am, crazy???
L374282 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Charlie, twenty-eight bucks is nothing.  The only way to do it is through your uncle...think about it will you?
L374281 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Oh, cut it out, will ya?
L374280 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ No you're not...
L374279 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Take it.  I'm doing it for you, stupid!
L374274 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ What you're doing for me isn't worth it...believe me!
L374273 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You threaten me with my uncle? After what I'm doing for you?
L374262 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Me?  I wouldn't say a word to my aunt and uncle...or even your uncle, Charlie...
L374261 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Johnny, I swear to God, if you open your mouth about any of this...
L374257 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ I'm not smart...I'm stupid, remember. I'm so stupid that you have to look out for me, remember?
L374256 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Don't be smart.
L374255 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Well kids...have the bans been announced yet?
L374254 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Oh, that's too bad, Teresa...
L374253 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Your cousin here was getting sick, worrying about you.  We've been in here calling...
L374251 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Yeah, Teresa, shut up!  We don't wanna get Charlie here in trouble, do we?...We love Charlie.
L374250 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Shut up!
L374184 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ You tell me that in front of these creeps?
L374183 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Keep your mouth shut.
L374099 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ I understand.
L374098 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ That's what I get for getting involved.  Look, on pay-day at least show up at Tony's Place to meet him, ok?  This way he doesn't think that you're trying to screw him.  If you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and he'll take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something... understand?  I'm not asking I'm telling you!!
L374097 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Yeah, take it easy.  Will you relax.
L374096 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I don't get involved with anything, you understand that?  Nothing!  I'm clean as far as you know...right?
L374095 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ That'll help you out fine.  That's the best way for you, not for me! I swear to God, I'll rip you open if my uncle ever hears a word about this.  You understand?  I don't care what happens, he doesn't find out. 
L374094 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ If you had a little talk with your uncle...if anybody can do it, he can.
L374093 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ How?
L374092 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess.
L374091 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Big deal...in the meantime, it's done...I'll still try to help you out...You know that...but you gotta show some effort...some respect... understand?
L374090 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ I'm sorry Charlie...I didn't mean it.
L374089 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ It's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now...the interest is going up...$3,000...do you realize that, flash?
L374088 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ I'm going to work this week...I mean it.
L374087 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ That's not going to help.
L374086 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ I swear to God Charlie...my arm still hurts from the car accident...that's why I didn't go to work.  I swear it.
L374085 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Did you see them run!
L374084 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Let's get out of here.
L374081 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Stupid bastard...you get your cousin half-sick over this.
L374080 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Hey...don't do that...I'm only scaring them.
L374077 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Cut it out stupid.  It's me.
L374076 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Don't come any closer!!!
L373829 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ We'll get some food from my aunt's. I'll get in through the fire escape. She's always got something.
L373828 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I could have told you that.
L373827 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Hey...you got nothing here.
L373825 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Listen...I'm a guest here.

L373821 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Ok, ok...take it easy.  I'll show. Tuesday I'll give Michael something. I promise.
L373820 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I'll tell you what I don't do... I don't owe anybody 2,000 clams plus interest, stupid.  Show up or I break both your arms, we understand each other?
L373819 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ What about your attitude...Where's your job...eh?  You talk and talk and I go to work...what do you do?
L373818 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You're not supposed to like it. What gets me is your attitude. Listen... tomorrow you show up.
L373817 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ I don't like loading crates.
L373816 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You sick or what?  You forget what we had to do to get you on the trucks, stupid?
L373815 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Didn't show up.
L373814 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What do you mean?
L373813 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ There won't be any this week.

L373811 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Don't worry.  I can handle it.
L373810 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Yeah, big man...get yourself in more trouble.  You make a fool out of him, you're doing the same to me. I signed for you don't forget.
L373809 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Wouldn't bother me.
L373808 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You'd better make a move kid.  He thinks you're trying to screw him.
L373805 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ No, she isn't.
L373804 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ I don't think I should go home looking like this.  You think I could stay at your place tonight? Your mother's not there is she?
L373775 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Should I slap him?
L373774 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Yes, you're gettin' it all over my tie.

L373730 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ It's the truth, I swear.
L373712 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ I swear to God Charlie, it's the truth.
L373711 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I know but let's hear it anyway.
L373710 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Charlie, I swear on my mother, you're not going to believe this.
L373709 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What happened to you Flash?
L373698 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Giovanino!  Where have you been?

L373889 +++$+++ u6540 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ OSCAR +++$+++ What can I say?
L373888 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ My uncle figured that this week was bad...but about next week...I dunno. Maybe you should speak to him yourself.
L373887 +++$+++ u6540 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ OSCAR +++$+++ I should know?  His wife don't even know.  Probably off with one of his little girls...I don't know.  I tell you, if he don't give a damn, then I don't give a damn...Why should I kill myself?
L373886 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I don't understand, where's Groppi?
L373885 +++$+++ u6540 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ OSCAR +++$+++ Your Uncle's a good man...I won't stick him.  Either he gets the money or the place and right now he's getting the place.  And tell me why should I care?  I got a partner who's a bum, who doesn't help out...who disappears and leaves me with all the problems.  I should go back to Florida...I don't need this.
L373884 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ He'd rather have the loan payed, you know that.
L373883 +++$+++ u6540 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ OSCAR +++$+++ Listen, I should wrap up this place in a ribbon and hand it to him, you know that.  I don't need this aggravation.  I'm getting old.
L373882 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Not next week's either...listen...you tell that to Giovanni, not me.
L373881 +++$+++ u6540 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ OSCAR +++$+++ I can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either.
L373880 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ That bad, huh?
L373879 +++$+++ u6540 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ OSCAR +++$+++ Look Charlie, you're a good boy. Will you just tell your uncle that I have nothing.  There is nothing to give him.  No envelopes with cash inside, no checks, nothing.
L373878 +++$+++ u6540 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ OSCAR +++$+++ What pipes...the ones from last year...those pipes.
L373877 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What pipes?
L373876 +++$+++ u6540 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ OSCAR +++$+++ I was in the basement fixing the pipes.  Would you believe that?
L373875 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ No.
L373874 +++$+++ u6540 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ OSCAR +++$+++ Don't ask...do you have any idea what I've been doing all morning...eh?
L373873 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Ok, how's everything going?
L373872 +++$+++ u6540 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ OSCAR +++$+++ Hey...you're here.  They told me you're here...and you're here.  How are you?
L374332 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You're not going to use that gun, Johnny.

L374068 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You said it.
L374067 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ 'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.'
L374066 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ He could at least show some respect and show his face, even if he doesn't have the money...
L374065 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ 'But I say to you not to resist the evildoer; on the contrary, if someone takes thy tunic, let him take thy cloak as well...to him who asks of thee, give; and from him who would borrow of thee do not turn away!
L374064 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I'll tell you who you can pray for... Next payday, I'll be at Tony's Place...Johnny better show or I find him and break his legs...and I mean it.
L374063 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ 'But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute...'
L374062 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Charlie, this is business.
L374061 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ $3,000.  Shit!  Can we hold it at $3,000?
L374060 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ $500.  He borrowed that because he wanted to pay off his other loans... now, counting the interest...it's almost $3,000.
L374059 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ How much was the original loan again?
L374058 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You kiddin.  The way it is now this isn't even interest for two hours.
L374057 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ He'll be here.  Look, take this for now.
