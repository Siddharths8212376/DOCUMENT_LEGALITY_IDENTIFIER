L521674 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Like right after the ceremony.
L521673 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Like when?
L521672 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Oh, I don't expect it to last.  I'll tell him the truth when the time comes.
L521671 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You're out of your mind!  How can you get away with this?
L521670 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ We've been discussing that.  He wants to go to the Riviera - but I sort of lean toward Niagara Falls.
L521669 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Like what are you going to do on your honeymoon?
L521668 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Like what?
L521667 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Jerry - there's another problem.
L521666 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ His mother - we need her approval.  But I'm not worried - because I don't smoke.
L521665 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'll say there is!
L521664 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Look, stop treating me like a child. I'm not stupid.  I know there's a problem.
L521663 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Jerry, you'd better lie down. You're not doing well.
L521662 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Security.
L521661 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ But you're not a girl.  You're a guy! And why would a guy want to marry a guy?
L521660 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Why not?  He keeps marrying girls all the time!
L521659 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Jerry!  You can't be serious!
L521658 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You think he's too old for me?
L521657 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What are you talking about? You can't marry Osgood.
L521656 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Osgood proposed to me.  We're planning a June wedding.
L521655 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ WHAT?
L521654 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I am.
L521653 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Congratulations.  Who's the lucky girl?
L521652 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I'm engaged.
L521651 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What happened?
L521650 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Have I got things to tell you!
L521649 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Hi, Jerry.  Everything under control?
L521502 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'm just borrowing them.  You'll get them back tomorrow.
L521501 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ What are you doing with my flowers?
L521495 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Oh, no.  I'm not getting caught in a miniature sand trap with that guy.
L521494 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Tell him you get seasick on a yacht. Play miniature golf with him.
L521493 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Don't give me the musketeers!  How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
L521492 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Because we're pals - buddies - the two musketeers.
L521491 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Why do I let you talk me into these things? Why?
L521490 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Come on, you can do better than that. Give him teeth - the whole personality.
L521489 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Remember - he's your date for tonight. So smile.
L521488 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You can both go take a flying jump.
L521487 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Daphne - your boy friend is waving at you.
L521486 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Oh, no!  Not tonight, Josephine!
L521485 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ That's right.
L521484 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ With ME?
L521483 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ He's going to be ashore with you.
L521482 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ And where's he going to be?
L521481 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ No.  I'm going to be on that boat with Sugar.
L521480 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You're going to be on the boat with that dirty old man?
L521479 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Of course, you're not.  I'm going.
L521478 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Fat chance!  You call him right back and tell him I'm not going.
L521477 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Just the three of you on that great big boat - you and him and Rudy Vallee.
L521476 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Oh, he does!
L521475 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You got it made, kid.  Fielding wants you to have a little cold pheasant with him on his yacht -
L521474 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ What message?  What motorboat?
L521473 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yes, Mr. Fielding - you'll pick her up after the show in your motorboat - goodbye - what's that you said?  Oh - zowie! I'll give her the message. 
L521472 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I'm a push-over for whom?  What is it? Who's on the phone?
L521458 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ And what are you trying to do to poor Sugar?  Putting on that millionaire act - and that phony accent -  Nobody talks like that!  I've seen you pull some low tricks on dames - but this is the trickiest and the lowest and the meanest -
L521457 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Wise guy, huh?  Trying to louse me up -
L521448 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Daphne, you're bothering us.
L521447 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You know - the old shell game.
L521442 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Daphne -  Go on - tell me all about him.
L521441 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ He's not only got a yacht, he's got a bicycle.
L521405 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Yes - you have to be very careful about picking a roommate.
L521404 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I heard a very sad story about a girl who went to Bryn Mawr.  She squealed on her roommate, and they found her strangled with her own brassiere.
L521395 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ This happens to me all the time in public.
L521394 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You - you -
L521393 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What is it, young lady?  What are you staring at?
L521301 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Don't get burned, Daphne.
L521300 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Yeah - let her soak.  Come on.
L521282 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Yeah?  Well, I'm your fairy godmother - and I'm keeping an eye on you.
L521281 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What are you talking about?  Sugar and me, we're just like sisters.
L521280 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I watched you two on the bus - lovey-dovey - whispering and giggling and borrowing each other's lipstick -
L521279 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Me?  After Sugar?
L521278 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ What are you giving me with the flying fish? I know why you want to stick around - you're after Sugar.
L521277 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What's the beef?  We're sitting pretty. We get room and board - we get paid every week - there's the palm trees and the flying fish -
L521276 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ All right, all right!  But how long can we keep this up?
L521275 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ So you got pinched in the elevator. So what?  Would you rather be picking lead out of your navel?
L521274 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ But this is so humiliating.
L521273 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Listen, stupid - right now Spats Colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country.
L521272 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ We can get a job with another band. A male band.
L521271 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ How can we?  We're broke.
L521270 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.
L521269 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Blow where?
L521268 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I'm tired of being a flag.  I want to be a bull again.  Lets get out of here, Joe. Let's blow.
L521267 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ They don't care - just as long as you wear skirts.  It's like waving a red flat in front of a bull.
L521266 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ And I'm not even pretty.
L521265 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Well, now you know how the other half lives.
L521264 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I got pinched in the elevator.
L521263 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What happened?
L521189 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You wouldn't hit a girl, would you?
L521188 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Male and female - the moth and the flame - I ought to slug you!
L521085 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Break it up, girls!  Daphne! Come on, help me!
L521084 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ It's not my fault.  I didn't invite them.
L521083 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What's going on here?  Daphne - Daphne -
L521003 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Good night, Josephine.
L521002 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Good night, Daphne.
L520997 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Then pull the emergency brake!
L520996 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ But suppose I lose?  Suppose it's an emergency?
L520995 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Fight it.
L520994 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ But suppose I got to go - like for a drink of water?
L520993 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I just want to make sure that honey stays in the hive.  There'll be no buzzing around tonight.
L520992 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ What are you doing?
L520987 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I'm a girl.  I'm a girl.  I'm a girl -
L520986 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Steady, boy.  Just keep telling yourself you're a girl.
L520980 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ We would be caught dead with men.  Those rough, hairy beasts with eight hands -  They all want just one thing from a girl.
L520979 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
L520978 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Men?
L520954 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You tore it again!
L520953 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Look - no butter, no pastry, and no Sugar!
L520952 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Boy, would I like to borrow a cup of that Sugar.
L520951 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Forget it.  One false move, and they'll toss us off the train - there'll be the police, and the papers, and the mob in Chicago...
L520950 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ How about the shape of that liquor cabinet?
L520949 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Down, Daphne!
L520948 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Bye, Sugar.  We been playing with the wrong bands.
L520931 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Polish?
L520930 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I changed it.  It used to be Sugar Kowalczyk.
L520922 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Now you tore the other one.
L520921 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ This way, Daphne.
L520920 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You better come help me.
L520919 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You'd better go fix it.
L520918 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Tore off one of my chests.
L520917 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Done what?
L520916 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Now you've done it!
L520915 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Not there - that's the emergency brake.
L520914 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Listen, stupe - no butter and no pastry. We're on a diet!
L520913 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ When I was a kid, I used to have a dream - I was locked up in this pastry shop overnight - with all kinds of goodies around - jelly rolls and mocha eclairs and sponge cake and Boston cream pie and cherry tarts -
L520912 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Watch it, Daphne!
L520911 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ How about that talent?  This is like falling into a tub of butter.
L520900 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'm Josephine.  Sax.
L520899 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Hello, everybody.  I'm the bass fiddle. Just call me Daphne.
L520898 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I never did like the name Geraldine.
L520897 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ DAPHNE?
L520883 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ And I'm Daphne.
L520882 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ My name is Josephine.
L520871 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ This time I'm not going to let you talk me into something that...
L520870 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What are you afraid of?  Nobody's asking you to have a baby.  This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida, we'll blow this set-up.
L520869 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Who are we kidding?  Look at that - look how she moves - it's like jello on springs - they must have some sort of a built-in motor. I tell you it's a whole different sex.
L520868 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ The name is Josephine.  And it was your idea in the first place.
L520867 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ It's no use.  We'll never get away with it, Joe.
L520866 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ With those legs?  Are you crazy?
L520865 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I feel so naked.  Like everybody's looking at me.
L520864 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Quit stalling.  We'll miss the train.
L520863 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ And it's so drafty.  They must be catching colds all the time.
L520862 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Must be the way their weight is distributed. Come on.
L520861 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ How can they walk on these things? How do they keep their balance?
L520858 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Shave our legs, stupid.
L520857 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Shave?  At a time like this?  Those guys got machine guns - they're going to blast our heads off - and you want to shave?
L520856 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ We are going out of town.  But we're going to shave.
L520855 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ We got to get out of town.  Maybe we ought to grow beards.
L520854 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ The police?  We'd never live to testify. Not against Spats Colombo.  Wabash 1098.
L520853 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You going to call the police?
L520851 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ That's not far enough.  You don't know those guys!  But they know us.  Every hood in Chicago will be looking for us -
L520850 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ As far away as possible.
L520849 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Where are we running, Joe?
L520848 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Not yet.  But if those guys catch us, there'll be blood all over.  Type O.
L520847 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You don't see any blood?
L520846 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ They got the bull-fiddle.
L520845 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I think they got me.
L520833 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ No - nothing.  Besides, it's none of our business if you guys want to knock each other off -
L520832 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ We didn't see anything -  - did we?
L520801 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Knock it off, will you?
L520800 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ We could've had three weeks in Florida - all expenses paid.  Lying around in the sun - palm trees - frying fish...
L520788 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'll think of something.  Don't crowd me.
L520787 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ It's a hundred miles, Joe - it's snowing - how are we going to get there?
L520783 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ It's twelve bucks.  We can get one of the overcoats out of hock.
L520782 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ All the way to Urbana - for a one night stand?
L520778 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Josephine and Geraldine!  Come on!
L520777 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Now you're talking!  We pick up a couple of second-hand wigs - a little padding here and there - call ourselves Josephine and Geraldine -
L520776 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You've flipped your wig!
L520775 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ But, Joe - three weeks in Florida!  We could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus -
L520774 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ No.  And he ain't been eating so good, either. He's got an empty stomach and it's gone to his head.
L520770 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yeah, that's what he means. Good old Nellie!  I ought to wring her neck!
L520769 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You mean it's a girls' band?
L520752 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ We're not too late, are we?
L520751 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Nellie told us about it.
L520717 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ - Type O.
L520716 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Right.  We have the same blood type...
L520715 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ So I had to rush him to the hospital and give him a transfusion...  Right?
L520714 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ It did?  Boy, did it ever!
L520713 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Don't you remember?  He has this bad tooth - it got impacted - the whole jaw swole up -
L520712 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ With me?
L520711 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ With you.
L520710 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Yeah - where were you?
L520697 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Look at the bull fiddle - it's dressed warmer than I am.
L520696 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I thought you weren't talking to me.
L520695 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Greased Lightning!  Why do I listen to you? I ought to have my head examined!
L520694 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Look, stupid, he's ten to one.  Tomorrow, we'll have twenty overcoats!
L520693 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ But we'll freeze - it's below zero - we'll catch pneumonia.
L520692 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I told you - it's a sure thing.
L520691 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Sam the Bookie?  Nothing doing!  You're not putting my overcoat on that dog!
L520690 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Shut up, will you?  I wonder how much Sam the Bookie will give up for our overcoats?
L520689 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Of course, the landlady is going to lock us out - Moe said no more knackwurst on credit - and we can't borrow any more from the girls, because they're on their way to jail -
L520688 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Quiet - I'm thinking.
L520687 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Well, that solves one problem.  We don't have to worry about who to pay first.
L520664 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Don't look now - but the whole town is under water!
L520663 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Suppose Lake Michigan overflows?
L520662 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Hey, Joe!
L520661 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Suppose Mary Pickford divorces Douglas Fairbanks?
L520660 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Jerry-boy - why do you have to paint everything so black? Suppose you get hit by a truck? Suppose the stock market crashes?
L520659 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ But suppose it doesn't?
L520658 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What are you worried about?  This job is going to last a long time.
L520657 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ But suppose he loses?
L520656 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Look at those odds - ten to one. If he wins, we can pay everybody.
L520655 +++$+++ u7712 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ What are you giving me with the rabbit?
