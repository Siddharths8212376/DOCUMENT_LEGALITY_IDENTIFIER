L357208 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ It's always been a source of deep regret, but the mountains surrounding us have made reception almost impossible.
L357207 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Not even a radio?
L357201 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ Thank you.
L357200 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Well, there's certainly nothing wrong with that meal!
L357199 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ She's remaining in her room. She isn't feeling very well.  Now please go on without me. I eat very little.
L357198 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Where's the girl? Miss Stone.
L357661 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Plumbing. Everything modern. I'm going to run pipes all through the village—
L357660 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Oh my, isn't that pretty! What is it?
L357527 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ In a quandary.
L357526 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Why? Why 'come on' all the time? What's the matter?  Are you going to be a fuss budget all your life? Here, drink it up! Aren't you having any fun? Where was I?
L357525 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Come on, Lovey.
L357524 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ They were in a quandary, and—
L357523 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on, Lovey!
L357522 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ —then the bears came right into the bedroom and the little baby bear said, "Oh, somebody's been sleeping in my bed." And then the mama bear said, "Oh dear, somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" And then the big papa bear, he roared, "And somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" Well, you have to admit the poor little bears were in a quandary!
L357520 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ This doesn't obligate me in any way.
L357519 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ There you are!
L357516 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Certainly not!
L357515 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ And be poisoned out here in the open?
L357514 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ You were asked to have a glass of wine. Sit down!
L357513 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ So that's where you are. I might of known it. No wonder you couldn't hear me.
L357512 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Hey Lovey, come here! Lovey, I asked for a glass of wine and look what I got. Come on, sit down.
L357506 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Horns? What kind of horns?
L357505 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Yeah. You know.
L357504 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Horns?
L357503 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ They're very nice people - except that they've got horns.
L357502 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ And this trip to the valley. I can't imagine why I'd allow you to drag me down here. Why, we don't know anything about these people. We're not even armed!
L357501 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Okay, Lovey.
L357500 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Barney? Why should I? Never! We have nothing in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What effrontery!
L357499 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Just call me Barney.
L357498 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ I don't know why I associate with you, Mr. Barnard - or Mr. Chalmers Bryant - or Mr. Embezzler - or whatever your name may be.
L357408 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Sounds like a stall to me.
L357407 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Yes.
L357377 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ You are a thief, sir, and a swindler, and I, for one, will be only too glad to turn you over to the police when we get back.
L357376 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ You know, that's what makes the whole thing so funny. A guy like me starts out in life as a plumber - an ordinary, everyday, slew-footed plumber - and by the use of a little brains, mind you, he builds up a gigantic institution, employs thousands of people, becomes a great civic leader. And then the crash comes - and overnight he's the biggest crook the country ever had.
L357375 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly - you, the swindler of thousands of people—
L357374 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ That's too bad. I got a half million shares. My whole foundation! And now look at me!
L357368 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Uh-huh.  Did you ever hear of Chalmers Bryant?
L357367 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ The police?
L357366 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year.
L357365 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Certainly not.
L357362 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ It's very strange, you know. You've never told us anything about yourself. Who are you, anyway? Why don't you take your mask off for once!
L357361 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Have I?
L357360 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about a mask? What do you mean? You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you.
L357359 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ And say, honey, you look a million per cent better. Wholesome, kind of - and clean. You take a tip from me, and don't you ever put that stuff on your face again. Why, it's like hiding behind a mask.
L357241 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Then I'm your man.  Come on, Toots.
L357240 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Yes.
L357239 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ No kidding?
L357238 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ As a matter of fact, I'm very good at double solitaire.
L357237 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Thinking? What about some double solitaire?
L357236 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ I'm thinking.
L357235 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ How about you Lovey? Come on. Let's you and I play a game of honeymoon bridge.
L357179 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Mr. Conway, I don't like this place. I don't like it. It's too mysterious.
L357178 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Don't mind Lovey. He's got the misery.
L357177 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ All the conveniences for the condemned, if you ask me.
L357176 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Some layout they got here. Did you get a load of the rooms? You couldn't do better at the Ritz.
L357174 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Please don't call me Lovey.
L357173 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey.
L357172 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them.
L357171 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Yeah? If this be execution, lead me to it.
L357170 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ I just feel as though I'm being made ready for the executioner.
L357169 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Something tells me this means food. Come on!
L357168 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ You never looked better in your life. As soon as our clothes are cleaned, they're going to give them back to us, Lovey.
L357167 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Look at me. Look at what they gave me to wear.
L357166 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Will you stop squawking!
L357165 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Mr. Barnard, I do not like this place. I definitely do not like this place.
L357143 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Do you think they're cannibals?
L357142 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Yes!
L357141 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Where are they? Do you see them?
L357124 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ All right, all right. Keep quiet.
L357123 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Left us here to rot. That's what they've done. Heroes of the newspapers!
L357042 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Do you suppose we stopped someplace during the night and changed pilots?
L357041 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Yes. And who is he ? How'd he get there?
L357028 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Of course. That's what I told them last night. You can't expect a man to sail around in the dark.[5] During this George has been looking around - he rises.
L357027 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ He might have lost his way.
L357021 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Now you're irritating and absurd!
L357020 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Uh-huh. All I know is - the sun rises in the east, and we're going away from it.
L357019 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Well, you just reverse it. Your left hand is—  What difference does it make what 'hand' you are? The north is the north!
L357018 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Yes.
L357017 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Oh, really?
L357016 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ I always get it twisted because I'm left-handed.
L357015 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Any child knows how to tell direction. Any child. I don't care where the child is - in the air, on the earth, or in the sea. If you face the rising sun, your right hand is the north, and your left hand is the south—
L357014 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Look here—
L357013 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ It certainly is.
L357012 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Is it?
L357011 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ That's ridiculous.
L357010 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Well, it looks to me as if we're traveling west.
L357009 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Why, of course. Yes.
L357008 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Wait a minute. Is it a good morning? Say, we're supposed to be traveling east, aren't we?
L357007 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ I'm never conversational before I coffee.
L357006 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Well, it's a good morning, anyway.
L357005 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ I see.
L357004 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ I see.
L357003 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ I didn't care for 'sister' last night, and I don't like 'Lovey' this morning. My name is Lovett - Alexander, P.
L357000 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Good morning—
L356999 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ I say, good morning, Lovey.
L356998 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ I beg your pardon.
L356997 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Good morning, Lovey.
L356970 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Okay, sister.  No offense. No offense!
L356969 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Don't call me brother.
L356968 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Okay, brother.
L356967 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Yes, it just shows—  I don't know why I'm talking to you. I don't know you. Who are you?
L356965 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Sir Henry Derwent was knighted, and he never got beyond the mesozoic era.
L356964 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Yeah, I remember. You said that before.
L356963 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.
L356962 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?
L356961 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ You see, from this vertebrae I shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton.
L356960 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L356959 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ This is the only thing I was able to save when those heathens surrounded me.
L356958 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Sorry.
L356957 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Not at all.
L356956 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Knighted! You don't say. Do you mind if I take a look at it?
L356955 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ When I get home I shall probably be knighted for it.
L356954 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L356953 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Found in Asia!
L356952 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Well, what do you know about that!
L356951 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ I have here a discovery that will startle the world. It's the vertebrae from the lumbar of a Megatherium,[4] found in Asia.
L356950 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Oh, I see.
L356949 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ A paleontologist.
L356948 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ A what?
L356947 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ I'm a paleontologist.
L356946 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Fossils, huh?
L356945 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Fossils.
L356944 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ I beg your pardon, brother. What did you say you were hunting?
L357590 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ All right.
L357589 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it.  Say, I've got to get busy. I want to show this whole layout to Chang.  So long. Don't you take any wooden nickels.
L357588 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Gold. You were going to—
L357587 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Huh?
L357586 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Say, what about that gold deal?
L357585 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Think of it! In times like these.
L357584 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ It's unbelievable.
L357583 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ You see? You get the idea? From this reservoir here I can pipe in the whole works. Oh, I'm going to get a great kick out of this. Of course it's just to keep my hand in, but with the equipment we have here, I can put a plumbing system in for the whole village down there. Can rig it up in no time.  Do you realize those poor people are still going to the well for water?
L357404 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Mr. Chang - High Lamas or Low Lamas, do we get the porters?
L357403 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Yeah. I though you ran this joint.
L357370 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Bryant's Utilities - that's me.
L357369 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Chalmers Bryant!
L357364 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ All right, I will! I'll let my hair down! Why not? It can't make any real difference now.  Hey Lovey, were you ever chased by the police?
L357363 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Yes. Unbosom yourself, Mr. Hyde.[11]
L357351 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Please! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little.
L357350 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved!
L357234 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Not for me, thanks. No, I'm too weary.
L357233 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ That's what I say. What do you say to a rubber of bridge? I saw some cards in the other room.
L357181 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ I'll say.
L357180 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ It's better than freezing to death down below, isn't it?
L357115 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Well, there's nothing we can do until the morning.
L357114 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ What are we going to do?
L357040 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Wonder what's happened to Fenner.
L357039 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Well, that's that, I guess.
L357038 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Nice puss to meet in a dark alley.
L357037 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Charming chap.
L357645 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Sure - sure. Don't you worry. I'll take care of you.
L357644 +++$+++ u1895 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ If you want me to!
L357631 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Oh, that's a cinch. I'll show them how to cast pipes out of clay.
L357630 +++$+++ u1895 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
L357629 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Look, honey. We run the pipes through here, and we connect with the main water line here.
L357356 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Why, you look beautiful.
L357355 +++$+++ u1895 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Nothing. Why?
L357354 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Hey, what's happened to you?
L356975 +++$+++ u1895 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ Say, listen - will you go and annoy the rest of your playmates? Let me alone!
L356974 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Say, you're an American, aren't you?
L356973 +++$+++ u1895 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GLORIA +++$+++ No.
L356972 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ I say, will you have a cigarette?
L357643 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Oh, no - you don't want to go yet, honey.  She'll stick around too.  Is that right?
L357642 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you.  How about you?
L357641 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing business—
L357640 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?
L357639 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Well - I'm—
L357638 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You mean you don't want to go?
L357637 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ I think I'll stick around. I'll leave with the porters on their next trip.
L357636 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Right this very minute!  The porters are waiting for us on the plateau. And that Chinaman thought he could stop me. Come along.
L357635 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ When are you going to start?
L357634 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yes. I've just been talking with the porters. They're going to take us. We've got clothing, food, everything. Come on!
L357633 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Leaving?
L357632 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ There you are! Barnard, you'd better get your things together. We're leaving.
L357140 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Look, Bob!
L357139 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Hey - look!
L357138 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Over by that hill.
L357137 +++$+++ u1890 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ BARNARD +++$+++ Cave, eh? Where?
L357619 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ I can't let him go alone. It's suicide!
L357618 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ You must prevail upon him not to attempt the journey. He could never get through that country alive.
L357613 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ Age is a limit we impose upon ourselves. You know, each time you Westerners celebrate your birthday, you build another fence around your minds.
L357612 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ It's weird.  Chang, how old are you?
L357611 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ Oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age.
L357610 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ No, I mean about her appearance. If she should leave the valley - what would happen?
L357609 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.
L357608 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Suppose she should leave it?
L357607 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ Not for years. Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely.
L357606 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Amazing!  She still doesn't look over 20. When is she likely to grow old in appearance?
L357605 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ Young? She arrived here in 1888. She was 20 at the time. She was on her way to join her betrothed - when her carriers lost their way in the mountains. The whole party would have perished but for meeting some of our people.
L357604 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Why not? She's an attractive young woman.
L357603 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ Your brother seems quite fascinated by her.
L357602 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Yes, charming.
L357601 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ Charming, isn't she?
L357598 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ No thanks. Not tonight if you don't mind.
L357597 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ Shall we have another?
L357596 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Yes. I'm afraid it does.
L357413 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Well, then he's the man I want to see.  Will you come along?
L357412 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.
L357411 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
L357410 +++$+++ u1891 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CHANG +++$+++ The only one.
L357409 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ One moment. You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information?
