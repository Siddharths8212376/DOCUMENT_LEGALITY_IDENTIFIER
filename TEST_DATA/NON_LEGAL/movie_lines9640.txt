L114065 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ I'm just bringing him over to give Jane a look at him --
L114061 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Well, this kid couldn't possibly belong to anyone else.  What's your name?
L114060 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Hi.
L113964 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ No, I liked the way it made me sound. Okay.  Be good.  So long.
L113963 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ You know what I...
L113962 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I'm going to miss you -- you're a prick in a great way...
L113961 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ This story they won't cover.  And if the network doesn't cover it -- it must not be important so why worry.
L113960 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ No.  I don't know how much fun it will be when Martin Klein and Ernie have to drop off their credentials with the security guard.
L113959 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Yes.  You're not going to stick around for the farewell party?
L113958 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Can I ask you something?  You only had one crew on the date rape piece, right?
L113957 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Hold it down, okay?
L113956 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ It is.  Yes -- that's where they had Rorish, for God's sake, before they made him anchor.  I can't stand it -- they're grooming you for it all and you don't even know it.
L113955 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I don't think so.
L113954 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ London.  That's a promotion!
L113953 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ London.
L113952 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?
L113951 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ You packing up tonight?
L113946 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Why?  What did they do to you?
L113945 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Impossible.  There's no system that wouldn't value one of us.
L113944 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ They booted me out of Washington.
L113943 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ What did they do with you?
L113865 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ I'll put her on.
L113864 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ No.  Don't worry about it.
L113863 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying up Jane, I didn't realize you two would be going this late.  Sorry.
L113862 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Everybody has one like that.  I thought it was great when you started to laugh at the end.
L113701 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ The pointers were great.  I'll study the tape.
L113700 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ You were smokin' toward the end there.
L113696 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ And the left side of your face is the good one.  Go again.  And try to punch one word or phrase in every sentence -- punch one idea a story.  Punch -- come on --
L113695 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Oh, God, no!
L113694 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Don't let your eyes go from the beginning of the sentence to the end like that.  You don't want to look shifty, do you?
L113693 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ No?
L113692 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ No.  No.
L113688 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I'll find some copy.  Be right back.
L113687 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ It's not loaded.
L113686 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ No.  That's not going to tell us anything.  Let's get this prompter going.
L113685 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Just don't physically...  Fantastic tip -- fantastic.
L113684 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Sit on it!  <u>Now</u> look.
L113683 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ I don't like being handled.
L113681 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Your coat jacket is rising up in back.
L113680 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ What?
L113679 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Wait.
L113678 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ It just might not work for me because of our different approaches.
L113677 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ We sure do.  I don't mean it as a knock either.  Go ahead.  I'll just say what I think and you can disregard it if you want.
L113676 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ This is uncomfortable for me -- because, well, I don't mean it as a knock, but we approach this differently.
L113645 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Nothing.  I think you really blew the lid off nookie.
L113644 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ What's wrong with it?
L113643 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ I'm in a pissy mood.  I'm sorry.
L113599 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Fifty, right?
L113598 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ I'm starting to... We may do the capitols of the states.
L113597 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ You're feeling good, aren't you?
L113596 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ There are only ten.
L113595 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Yes.
L113594 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Okay.
L113593 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Yes, Aaron.  I know the names of the Cabinet.
L113592 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Don't name them.  Just tell me if you know.
L113591 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ We're conversing...Oh my, the names of the entire Cabinet has slipped my mind.  What are they?
L113590 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Okay, let's drop it.  I didn't mean I'd take a test for you -- I mean if that came up in conversation I'd...
L113589 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Can you name all the members of the Cabinet?
L113588 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Never to pretend to know more than I did.
L113587 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ And the rule was...
L113586 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...
L113585 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Okay.  Pretty petty party, isn't it, pal?
L113584 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Shut up a second...
L113583 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ You have the job you have...
L113582 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I'm not buying into any of that.  I have a load to learn.  I'm not going to act as if...
L113581 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ You can't talk about feeling intimidated when you're on top of the world.  It's unseemly.
L113580 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Oh, stop it.
L113579 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ You know the other day I really wanted your reaction to how we did with the Libyan report -- I was going to ask but I guess I feel a little intimidated with you.
L113578 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Keep it to yourself.
L113577 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Great.  Network news, Washington... I love it.  What do you do when your real life exceeds your dreams?
L113576 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ How <u>you</u> doing?
L113574 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ You've made my dreams silly.
L113573 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ What did I do to you?
L113572 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Why don't you lead?  I'll just follow the flurry you cause.
L113571 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ You want to go out there --  get out of this for a second?
L113570 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Same old stuff.  I'm watching a man who won three Overseas Press Awards pitch an hors d'oeuvre idea.
L113569 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Hi, Aaron...What's doing?
L113468 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Nice, Jane.
L113467 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ ...outlaw nation but strangely those who have interviewed Gaddafi find him, in a phrase we like to use in this country, very 'presidential'.
L113335 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ You write this?
L113334 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ One source referred to it as a five billion dollar metal sculpture to ugly to look at and too big to bury.
L113237 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Yeah.
L113236 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Okay if I watch you tape that interview downstairs?
L113164 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ You're almost there, you can do it -- can do -- can do.
L113163 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Shit, shit, shit...
L113261 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Stop the tape, okay.  Forget it, Ellen.  Let's call security and get him out.
L113260 +++$+++ u4272 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Ravenous homosexual.
L113259 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Which would you prefer?
L113258 +++$+++ u4272 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ I don't like the word gay.
L113257 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ You're saying the fact that you're gay had something directly to do with your promotions?
L113254 +++$+++ u4272 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Office Bimbo.  No, I'm sorry.
L113253 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Eventually rising to...
L113252 +++$+++ u4272 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ I was there two years and was promoted on merit nine times.
L113251 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ You worked at one time as Foreign Service Trainee in the State Department.
L113250 +++$+++ u4272 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Yes.
L113249 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ I might as well ask you the questions on tape.  Is that all right?
L113248 +++$+++ u4272 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Yes.
L113247 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ That's your full name?
L113246 +++$+++ u4272 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Yes.
L113245 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ It's Mr. Buddy Felton?
L114098 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Well -- my wife got this new job...
L114097 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I like it!  So, doll, what about you lately?
L114096 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Well, we met about three months ago. He works at the surgeon general office. He loves boating.  So, he's been getting me into water skiing.
L114095 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ So who's the guy?
L114081 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I'm going to take it.
L114080 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Really?
L114079 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I think so...They've been talking to me about being Tom's Managing Editor.
L113993 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ I hope so...  No.  I'm not really mad.  I'll miss you, we'll talk, we'll always be friends...we'll get hot for each other every few years at dinner and never act on it, okay?
L113992 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ You won't be able to stay mad at me, right?
L113991 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ I'll be walking with my wife and two children -- we'll bump into you on the street, my youngest son will say something and I'll tell him...  ...it's not nice to make fun of single, fat ladies.
L113990 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Yes.
L113989 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Okay, that's very easy.  Five, six years from now I'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations.
L113988 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ You are now required to sit here with me.  Come on...be smart for a second -- what do you think will happen to us?
L113987 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Maybe the best part of your life is over and you don't want to get up and start the bad part.
L113986 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?
L113985 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Let's go...
L113984 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ You're just trying to say all great stuff so I'll feel even worse that you're not around.
L113983 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Ernie told this story.  How he used to write obits and when the people in town called him up with death notices, he cried.  He was till that way when they promoted him out of obits.  He says you're lucky if you can get out while you could still cry.  I should have quit this place  three years ago.
L113982 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Tell me the God's honest truth -- are you leaving because of me? Because if you are...
L113981 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Stop.  Ernie thought I was good too -- he couldn't help.  My agent has a hot prospect -- the number two station in Portland.  The general manager says he wants to be every bit as good as the networks.  Personally, I think he should aim higher.
L113980 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Why not try it for a few weeks?
L113979 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I just found out.  You didn't say anything to me?  You just resign? Will you meet me now? -- No, now! I'm going away tomorrow.  Please.
L113978 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Speaking.
L113977 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Bastard, sneak, quitter.
L113861 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Hi.  Will I ever sing again?
L113860 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Don't say anything about anything.
L113849 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Sit down, stop.
L113848 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ I've got to not say that aloud; it takes too much out of me.
L113847 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Yes, yes.  I know.  Right.  And if it had gone well for me tonight, maybe I'd be keeping quiet about all this...I grant you everything but give me this...he does personify everything you've been fighting against...And I'm in love with you.  How do you like that? -- I buried the lead.
L113846 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ You were quick enough to get Tom's help when...
L113845 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Because we have the kind of relationship where if I were the Devil, you'd be the only one I told.
L113844 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ How?
L113843 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ No.  You know that I'm not.
L113842 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I think you're the Devil.
L113841 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ What do you think the Devil is going to look like if he's around?  Nobody is going to be taken in if he has a long, red, pointy tail.  No.  I'm semi-serious here.  He will look attractive and he will be nice and helpful and he will get a job where he influences a great God-fearing nation and he will never do an evil thing...he will just bit by little bit lower standards where they are important. Just coax along flash over substance... Just a tiny bit.  And he will talk about all of us really being salesmen.  And he'll get all the great women.
L113840 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ This isn't friendship.
L113839 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ I know you care about him.  I've never seen you like this about anyone, so please don't take it wrong when I tell you that I believe that Tom, while a very nice guy, is the Devil.
L113838 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Yeah -- being a basket case.
L113837 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ You can't end up with Tom because it goes totally against everything you're about.
L113836 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Yes, I guess.  Yes.
L113835 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Aaach...Jane...  Let's take the part that has nothing to do with me.  Let's let me be your most trusted friend, the one that gets to say awful things to you.  You know?
L113834 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Let me think a second.  It's tough.
L113833 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ What?
L113832 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Yeah.  Well...I think it is important for you too.  Sit down.
L113831 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ This is important to me.
L113830 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Don't go.
L113829 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ No!!!!!
L113828 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I don't know.  I may be in love with him.
L113827 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Call him -- I mean it can wait, right?
L113826 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I told what's his name -- Tom -- that I'd meet him.
L113825 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I have to be somewhere.
L113824 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ I don't know.  At a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny.  My central nervous system was telling me something. Jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so I could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what I like to do anyway.  And I'm chipper because you finally showed up.  I thought I'd cook for us. Tequila and eggs sound good?
L113823 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?
L113822 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack.
L113821 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?
L113820 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ I'm not kidding.
L113819 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened.
L113818 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ People phoned in.
L113817 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ What do you mean, flop sweat? -- you're making too much out of it...I'll bet you were the only one aware of it...
L113816 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ It was great...writing my little first rate copy, sitting on my jacket, punching my one thought. But I had this historic attack of flop sweat so they'll never let me another again.  Oh, I lost one of your shoulder pads -- how was your evening anyway?
L113815 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Aaron, will you tell me?
L113814 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ I lost six pounds...
L113813 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Then what was good about it?
L113812 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ No.
L113811 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Do others feel that you did well?
L113810 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ No.
L113809 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Do you feel good about it?
L113808 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Define your terms.
L113807 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Did it really go well?
L113806 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Then it went well.
L113805 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ No.
L113804 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ You didn't see it or speak to anybody?
L113803 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ How'd it go?
L113724 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ You too.
L113723 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Thanks, Jane.  Have a good time tonight.
L113722 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Okay, great -- good luck.
L113721 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ <u>If</u>...if not, I'll have the tape...I'll wait for you at my apartment.
L113720 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I'm not sure I'll be able to...I...
L113719 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Me too...Hey...if it gets dull a little before 11:00, drop by the studio.
L113718 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Well, the line of the jacket -- No really....just very nice...just right. I wish I could be there.
L113717 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Yes.
L113716 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ As good as humanly possible.
L113715 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Because this is important -- so don't just be polite.  I'd really like to look...what's the word I'm looking for?...
L113711 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ It's not a date.  It's co-workers going to a professional conclave.
L113710 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Could you at least pretend that this is an awkward situation for you -- me showing up while you're getting ready for a date.
L113709 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I read about it -- that's how you can make sure you don't put on too much perfume...
L113707 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Yes...I was thinking that way too... Which tie?
L113706 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Did you bring your grey suit?
L113705 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ I didn't know you were going with him.
L113704 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Tom...why don't I meet you there? I've got some last minute stuff I've got to take care of...Hey, how did you resolve your dilemma -- did you rent the tux or buy it...I knew it. How much?  Wow...Okay...See you there...
L113548 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ They're not that dumb, after all.
L113547 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Aaah --  -- ello.  You sure they said the management meeting?  They want me to be at the management meeting.
L113546 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ A long time.  I was restless. Will you crack my neck?
L113545 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Jesus, Jane.  How long have you been here?
L113514 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Good.
L113513 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Yes.
L113512 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Absolutely...You go have a good time... You have some place to go?
L113511 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ You know you've had a strange day... I'd sleep on all these things you've been thinking.
L113510 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Which means I'm at their mercy and who wants that?...I'm not going to tell you where this thought led me... Anyway, well, why not  tell you? -- it's a happy thing.  In the middle of all this I start to think about something that does nothing but make me feel good and makes immediate sense and that's you ...And I'll stop here but, Jane, I'd give anything if you were two people so I could call up the one who's my friend and tell her about the one I'm in I...I don't think I should go any further.  Come on -- I'll walk you to the corner.
L113509 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Sounds like you may be on to something.
