L43873 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ You're keeping a record, are you?
L43872 +++$+++ u3712 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ At 4:30 today he barked for a solid fifteen minutes.  I have it on tape.
L43871 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Thank you.  This was so unnecessary.  I hope you've noticed that Otis isn't barking as much.  We keep him in at night.
L43868 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Well, so glad you decided to come.
L43867 +++$+++ u3712 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ Yes.
L44736 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Relax.  You've done enough.
L44735 +++$+++ u3714 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SKYE +++$+++ I don't mind...
L44734 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ You don't need to do that.
L44313 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ What are they?
L44312 +++$+++ u3714 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SKYE +++$+++ Happy anniversary.  Thank you for making me a part of it.
L44060 +++$+++ u3714 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SKYE +++$+++ Whatever, do you remember?  I've seen all your movies.  When I was in rehab, the second time, they wouldn't even let us see your drug addict movie.  They said you were too real.  I worship you.  And I couldn't be more flattered, because I know the part I'm playing in Joe's movie is based on you as a young woman.
L44059 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I don't think I ever spent half a day in the Beverly Center.
L44056 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I'll be right out.
L44055 +++$+++ u3714 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SKYE +++$+++ Oh my God, sorry.  I'm interrupting.
L44406 +++$+++ u3715 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SOPHIA +++$+++ No you are not.  You're Sally Nash. Listen to me, you're Sally Nash.  You're my best friend and I love you more than anyone, and you're not going to move to London to have the offspring of a sexually ambivalent man-child.  "Oh now I'm a novelist, oh now I'm a director..." English prick bastard Joe Therrian who's probably going to leave you for Skye Davidson anyway.
L44405 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
L44404 +++$+++ u3715 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SOPHIA +++$+++ His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
L44403 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Why are you doing this?
L44402 +++$+++ u3715 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SOPHIA +++$+++ Ha!  Not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel.
L44401 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Not nice.  Not kind.
L44400 +++$+++ u3715 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SOPHIA +++$+++ Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut.
L44399 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ We're fine.  We're great.  We're having a baby and we're moving to London.
L44398 +++$+++ u3715 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SOPHIA +++$+++ You don't have kids to keep a marriage together, Sally.  It's only five months since Joe came back.
L44397 +++$+++ u3715 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SOPHIA +++$+++ His sister does.  Big time.  And the New York Times says addiction is genetic -- I'll e-mail you the article.
L44396 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Neither does Joe.
L44395 +++$+++ u3715 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SOPHIA +++$+++ I don't have a drug problem.
L44394 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ You weren't exactly horrified.
L44393 +++$+++ u3715 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SOPHIA +++$+++ Cal knows who he is.  Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight?
L44392 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ And Cal's this massive adult?
L44391 +++$+++ u3715 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SOPHIA +++$+++ Don't try and change the subject.  Oh God, it feels great!  He's just a little narcissistic, irresponsible and unreliable.
L44390 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Hey, let's sit down.  I bet the rug feels really nice against your skin.
L44389 +++$+++ u3715 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SOPHIA +++$+++ He wants playmates.  Oh he's a sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him. But he's not going to be a good father. He's just not parenting material.
L44388 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Oh Soph, Joe loves kids.  Joe wants kids. Joe thinks he needs kids.
L44387 +++$+++ u3715 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SOPHIA +++$+++ Honey, I'm not worried about you.  You are going to be a fantastic mom.  Not an issue.  I pressed you, remember?  Joe, on the other hand, is a different story.
L44386 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ No, no, not at all... I mean I've still got plenty of time.  Don't I?  I mean I still have a good six years, whatever. We could have three kids yet, if we wanted.  And I know I've always said I never wanted kids, and I didn't... but this year, I really, truly, feel ready...
L44385 +++$+++ u3715 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SOPHIA +++$+++ Well, are you sure about this baby thing? It's not the ticking clock shit, is it?
L44384 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ What do you mean, thank God?
L44383 +++$+++ u3715 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SOPHIA +++$+++ Oh honey, let's.
L44382 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone.
L44381 +++$+++ u3715 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SOPHIA +++$+++ Well good.  Thank God.
L44380 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Sophia!  I'm not even pregnant!
L44379 +++$+++ u3715 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SOPHIA +++$+++ You are not having your baby in London. You're going to have your baby at Cedars in Beverly Hills, America, delivered by Dr. Milton Cohen.  Period. And you're getting that epidural right away, don't let anyone talk you into any of that Lamase bullshit.  There's no excuse for pain like that.
L44378 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ And the food sucks, I know.
L44377 +++$+++ u3715 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SOPHIA +++$+++ You'll hate it in London.  It's wet and miserable.  A medical hellhole Sally. It's socialized.  Beds in the corridors. Terrible plumbing.
L44376 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Oh Soph...
L44375 +++$+++ u3715 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SOPHIA +++$+++ I trust you.
L44374 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ She took our wedding photos, for chrissakes.  You don't trust anyone.
L44373 +++$+++ u3715 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SOPHIA +++$+++ Well, I don't trust her.  I never have.
L44372 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Big time.
L44371 +++$+++ u3715 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SOPHIA +++$+++ So how much do you hate her?
L44370 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ But she really gets to the heart of Joe, doesn't she?  She's a genius.
L44369 +++$+++ u3715 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SOPHIA +++$+++ The both of you.
L44368 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ We're always in here.  She really gets him, doesn't she?
L44367 +++$+++ u3715 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SOPHIA +++$+++ A notch above the storage room.
L44366 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ It's much more personal in here.
L44365 +++$+++ u3715 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SOPHIA +++$+++ I thought it was okay where it was.
L44364 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ So where should I put it?
L44363 +++$+++ u3715 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SOPHIA +++$+++ Hm.
L44362 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ She's such a great photographer.
L44361 +++$+++ u3715 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SOPHIA +++$+++ Yes.
L44360 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Isn't this a fabulous picture?
L43954 +++$+++ u3715 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SOPHIA +++$+++ Would you like to meet my husband?
L43953 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Nevermind.
L43952 +++$+++ u3715 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SOPHIA +++$+++ I hope they're watercolors!
L43951 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ In the guest room.  I've laid out a paint table for them.
L43950 +++$+++ u3715 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SOPHIA +++$+++ Hmm.  Where are my kids?
L43949 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Like Joe.
L43948 +++$+++ u3715 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SOPHIA +++$+++ Ah.
L43947 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ He's a novelist.
L43939 +++$+++ u3715 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SOPHIA +++$+++ And she was saying how happy you were to finally have them over.  Because you're both, so, what - introspective?  And you should have done it ages ago.  I'm Sophia Gold.  Come meet my husband, Cal.
L43938 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ And here they are!
L43937 +++$+++ u3715 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SOPHIA +++$+++ Oh my God!  America told me your neighbors are coming?
L43828 +++$+++ u3715 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SOPHIA +++$+++ Evie has a little something for you.
L43827 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Enough about me.
L45646 +++$+++ u3716 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ AZTECA +++$+++ Who cares, Z.  All I know is, we gotta dig.  We're not the ones in charge.
L45645 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground.  Why are we even digging this thing?
L45644 +++$+++ u3716 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ AZTECA +++$+++ Break's over.
L45643 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Thank goodness.  Breaktime.
L45642 +++$+++ u3716 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ AZTECA +++$+++ No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u>, alright?  You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  I don't wanna see anything happen to you.  So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.
L45641 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ The squeaky wheel gets the oil.
L45640 +++$+++ u3716 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ AZTECA +++$+++ Z, old pal...  SHUT UP!!!  It's bad enough there's a food shortage without you complaining about it every day.
L45639 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Sorry Azteca.  Here you go, fellas! Fresh dirt!  Alley oop!  Shouldn't we be wearing gloves?  I mean this dirt is very...dirty. Doesn't anyone think of hygiene?  Boy am I hungry.  I'm so hungry I'm seeing double.  It looks like there's <u>two</u> million ants in here.  When's lunch?  Tomorrow, or the day after?
L45972 +++$+++ u3724 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ WEAVER +++$+++ Right...because every ant's important!
L45971 +++$+++ u3716 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ AZTECA +++$+++ Someone who follows his heart!
L45968 +++$+++ u3724 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ WEAVER +++$+++ No -- an <u>individual</u>!
L45967 +++$+++ u3716 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ AZTECA +++$+++ Invisible!
L45966 +++$+++ u3724 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ WEAVER +++$+++ Well, because he's more than a worker...he's a...what did he call it, Azteca...
L45963 +++$+++ u3716 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ AZTECA +++$+++ That's right!  He slaughtered hundreds of termites single-handedly!
L45962 +++$+++ u3724 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ WEAVER +++$+++ You know, you're not just workers -- you can be whatever you want to be! Look at Z!  He started as a worker -- then he became a soldier!
L45875 +++$+++ u3724 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ WEAVER +++$+++ Z?  <u>Our</u> Z?  The little guy made it!
L45874 +++$+++ u3716 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ AZTECA +++$+++ Wait a minute, that's no soldier -- that's Z!
L45862 +++$+++ u3716 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ AZTECA +++$+++ I'll make myself available...Listen, better watch out with the backtalk.  I don't know want you to end up like the guy who used to work next to me.  I'm afraid he got... <u>downsized</u>.
L45861 +++$+++ u3724 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ WEAVER +++$+++ No -- I mean yes -- I mean -- if you don't have other plans.
L45860 +++$+++ u3716 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ AZTECA +++$+++ Are you asking me out to dinner?
L45859 +++$+++ u3724 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ WEAVER +++$+++ Sorry I got you in trouble.  But listen, you can share my rations.
L45858 +++$+++ u3716 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ AZTECA +++$+++ I don't know what came over me, talking back like that.  I must be going crazy...
L45852 +++$+++ u3716 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ AZTECA +++$+++ Mmm, yes, I see what you mean...
L45851 +++$+++ u3724 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ WEAVER +++$+++ Nobody told me digging was so much fun!  You pick up the dirt, you move it, you pick it up again, you move it again -- lots of repetitions, you exercise the forceps, and the pincers --
L45850 +++$+++ u3716 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ AZTECA +++$+++ Tell me about it.
L45849 +++$+++ u3724 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ WEAVER +++$+++ I'm new...I was born yesterday.
L45848 +++$+++ u3716 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ AZTECA +++$+++ Hey, slow it down, big boy.  You're making the rest of us look bad...How come I haven't seen you around here before?
L46149 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ Because...because he's <u>twice</u> the ant that you are.  I could <u>never</u> go through with marrying you.  I'm -- I'm an <u>individual</u>, and when I get married, it'll be to someone <u>I</u> choose.
L46148 +++$+++ u3720 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ FORMICA +++$+++ You miss him?  <u>Why</u>?
L46147 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now.  I miss him already.
L46146 +++$+++ u3720 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ FORMICA +++$+++ It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself.
L46145 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ He's...he's dead.  You don't have to look for him anymore.  He was eaten by a praying mantis.
L45677 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ Oh...and I was afraid we had nothing in common...
L45676 +++$+++ u3720 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ FORMICA +++$+++ Well...  I declared war!
L45675 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ So, um...how was your day?  What did you do?
L45672 +++$+++ u3720 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ FORMICA +++$+++ Very well.  Carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?
L45671 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ General -- we have to talk sometime!
L46263 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ A <u>few</u>?
L46262 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ I mean, I've got the whole package, right?  A great life, a beautiful wife, and a few kids.
L46181 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ I know it's crazy, but -- I can't just leave.  Don't argue with me.  If I've learned anything, it's that the problems of two people don't add up to a hill of ants in this world.  Or beans.  Something like that.  Anyway, I've <u>got to warn the others</u>.
L46180 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ Z!  what are you doing?
L46179 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ Oh no...
L46178 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Bala, that -- that lake we found -- I think the tunnel's right underneath it!  -- Formica's going to <u>flood the</u> <u>colony</u>!!!  That's what he meant when said there were too many ants!
L46176 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ There's something going on, Z --
L46175 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Why do they have you tied up here?
L46115 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Well, I...I know it's a little strange, but...I thought it might come in handy if I...needed a scarf someday.  Well, to be honest, I just liked having it.
L46114 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ You held onto this all that time?
L46113 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Sorry, it's been through a war, not to mention everything else...
L46112 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Well, "trouble" is my middle name. Actually, my  middle name is .985, but I don't tell people.  Hey, Bala, I...I actually have something of yours...you left it at the bar that night.
L46111 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess.
L46110 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ So...you never did tell me...what made you come out to the worker bar that night?
L46094 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Forget it.  You go ahead, I give up. I...I don't know what I was thinking. "Insectopia".
L46093 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ Come on, Z.
L46079 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ <u>This is all your fault</u>!!!
L46078 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Yes?
L46077 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ Z...if we don't make it...I just want you to know....
L46043 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Let's dig in!
L46042 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ You were right...you were right!  Z, it's <u>beautiful</u>!
L46041 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ We've found it!  <u>Insectopia</u>!  Look at all this food'
L46039 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ What difference does it make...we're both going to starve to death, or get squished, or set on fire...
L46038 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Come on...tell me there wasn't just a little...something between us that first night at the bar.  The night we danced.
L46037 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ Face it, Z, we're lost!  We must have walked halfway across the world by now!  How did I get into this mess...
L46004 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ Well...I <u>am</u> the oldest.
L46003 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ So what makes you so special?
L46002 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ Well...no, but --
L46001 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ And only you can become a Queen?
L46000 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ Five thousand three hundred and ninety -- no.  About five thousand four hundred by now.
L45999 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Look.  How many other Princesses are there?
L45998 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ General Formica won't let me die out here.  I'm his fiancee.
L45997 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Princess, has it ever occurred to you that they're <u>not going to rescue you</u>?
L45994 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ Stop fooling around in there.
L45993 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Hlllllllp!
L45992 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ Out here I'm just what?
L45991 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Listen, "Princess", you can't order me around.  Out here, you're not the boss anymore -- out here, you're just --
L45990 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
L45989 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ This lake is huge!  And so close to the colony!  Think of the vacation potential!
L45986 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ Wait, I hear something!
L45985 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Want a list?
L45984 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ Why didn't I listen to my mother ...why'd I have to go looking for trouble? Any ant would have given their left legs to be in my position...what's <u>wrong</u> with me?
L45982 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Come on -- it's gone!  What are the chances of that happening again?
L45981 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ We're going to die!
L45979 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ <u>I</u> ruined <u>your</u> life?  Look, I was perfectly happy until I met you -- alright, I was miserable, but I was <u>happily miserable</u>.
L45978 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life.
L45977 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Water...water -- oh, you already said that.
L45976 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ Water...water...
L45958 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ That's not a name!  That's just a letter!
L45957 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ I've got a <u>name</u>.  It's <u>Z</u>.
L45956 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ Worker!  Come back here now!
L45955 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Yeah, well I have it on a reliable source...  that it exists.  Now you follow the yellow egg...  <u>That</u> direction.
L45954 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ <u>Insectopia</u>?  You stupid worker, that's just a fairy tale!
L45953 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Well, that's an appealing offer, but...considering the options...  You go back.  Me, I'm going to Insectopia.
L45952 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ Now, worker, you shall take me back to the colony, and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole!
L45951 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ I <u>didn't</u> choose him.  What kind  of <u>idiot</u> would...  ...<u>choose</u> who she wanted to marry?
L45950 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica?
L45949 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ I was <u>slumming it</u>!  I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
L45948 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
L45947 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're crazy about me!  That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!
L45946 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Well I guess that makes us even.
L45945 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ I -- <u>hate</u> -- you.
L45944 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Look around, sweetheart.
L45943 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ No!  There's no such thing as "just two ants."  You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants!
L45942 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ But can there be a society composed of just two ants?
L45941 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ Of course!  It defines society!  To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!
L45940 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Theoretically, yes.  But is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it?
L45939 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ How dare you speak to me like that? I'm the Princess!
L45938 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?
L45937 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ I've been kidnapped by the village idiot.
L45936 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ Climb up that tree and get a better view!
L45935 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Excuse me, I --  Pardon me --  And they call them social insects.
L45934 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Alright, alright, I'll try to get directions from one of the locals.
L45933 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ I order you to find out where we are!
L45932 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ How should <u>I know</u>?
L45931 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ What <u>was</u> that thing?
L45918 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ SSHH!!!  SSHH!!!
L45917 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ -- At the <u>worker bar</u>!  You were pretty hot to trot then!
L45916 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ Quiet -- sshhh!!
L45915 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ That's not what you said the <u>other</u> <u>night</u> --
L45914 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!
L45913 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Gee, uh, could you say it a little louder, I think there are some ants in the next colony who didn't hear you.
L45912 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ OH MY GOD, IT'S YOU!  YOU'RE A WORKER!!!  A filthy, stupid, disgusting WORKER!
L45911 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ No...as a matter of fact...
L45910 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ He was a worker.  I danced with him at a <u>worker's bar</u> just the other day. I'm not shocking you, am I?
L45908 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ No weirdly...You remind me of someone...
L45907 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Divinely?
L45906 +++$+++ u3717 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ BALA +++$+++ You dance...
L45905 +++$+++ u3725 +++$+++ m245 +++$+++ Z +++$+++ Uh, sorry, General, I...I've always had this animal magnetism, it --
