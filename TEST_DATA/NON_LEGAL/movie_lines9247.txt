L364449 +++$+++ u1963 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ CHAPLAIN GILL +++$+++ Do you know what a friend you have in Jesus, son?
L364858 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Thank you. Now the Negro in the field caught hell all day long. He was beaten by the master; he lived in a shack, wore castoff clothes and hated his master. If the house caught fire, he'd pray for a wind. If the master got sick, he'd pray that he'd die. And if you said to him, "Let's go, let's separate", he'd yell, "Yeah, man, any place is better than this." You've got a lot of Field Negroes in America today. I'm one.
L364857 +++$+++ u1964 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ DR. PAYSON +++$+++ Let him finish.
L364852 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Well, I have this to say. Do you know what a Negro with a B.A., an M.A. and a Ph.D. is called -- by the white man? I'll tell you. He's called a nigger.
L364851 +++$+++ u1964 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ DR. PAYSON +++$+++ Entirely.
L364850 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ You left one phrase out. Another educated Kneegrew said to me and I quote: "Brother Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the Negro subculture." Would you agree?
L364849 +++$+++ u1964 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ DR. PAYSON +++$+++ You put it very well.
L364848 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Stop me if I'm wrong. I "polarize the community." I "erroneously appraise the racial picture."
L364845 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ For the white man to ask the black man if he hates him is just like the rapist asking the raped, or the wolf asking the sheep, "Do you hate me!" The white man is in no moral position to accuse anyone of hate.
L364844 +++$+++ u1964 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ DR. PAYSON +++$+++ Mr. Malcolm X, why do you teach black supremacy? Why do you teach hate?
L364843 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Please, go ahead.
L364842 +++$+++ u1964 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ DR. PAYSON +++$+++ Mr. X is a demagogue. He has no place to go, so he exaggerates. He's a disservice to every good law-abiding Negro in the country. Can I ask you a question?
L364957 +++$+++ u1965 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ ELIJAH +++$+++ That was a very bad statement. The country loved this man, and you have made it hard in general for Muslims.
L364956 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Yes, sir, I did.
L364955 +++$+++ u1965 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ ELIJAH +++$+++ Did you see the papers today?
L364802 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Allah Akbar.
L364801 +++$+++ u1965 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ ELIJAH +++$+++ No, each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing. Allah has given you a great gift. Use it wisely, never forgetting that we are nothing, while He is all.
L364800 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Let me do it then.
L364799 +++$+++ u1965 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ ELIJAH +++$+++ If I surprise you, let me explain. Menial work teaches us humility.
L364695 +++$+++ u1965 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ ELIJAH +++$+++ Women are deceitful. They are untrustworthy flesh. I've seen too many men ruined or tied down or messed up by women.
L364694 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ If you want to tell me.
L364899 +++$+++ u1966 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ If you don't know, man, then I feel sorriest for you.
L364898 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Say what you're saying.
L364897 +++$+++ u1966 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ "His greatest greatness."
L364896 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ What?
L364895 +++$+++ u1966 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ Are you Elijah's pimp?
L364894 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Sure, man.
L364893 +++$+++ u1966 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ Can I ask you something?
L364298 +++$+++ u1967 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ HONEY +++$+++ Not yet. But the way things going, that boy gonna turn her out any day.
L364297 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Is she hooking?
L364296 +++$+++ u1967 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ HONEY +++$+++ If she got eyes, she do.

L364291 +++$+++ u1967 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ HONEY +++$+++ You know that gal?
L364286 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Do your job, Get me a bourbon on the rocks and a pack of Lucky's.
L364285 +++$+++ u1967 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ HONEY +++$+++ And like a fool I believe it.
L364284 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I say a lot of things.
L364283 +++$+++ u1967 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ HONEY +++$+++ I thought you said we were going to the movies last night.
L364419 +++$+++ u1982 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ VOICE OF MALCOLM X +++$+++ Shorty thought he hit us with 114 years till I explained what concurrently meant. It meant a minimum sentence of 10 years hard labor at the Charlestown State Prison. The date was February 1946. I wasn't quite 21. I had not yet begun to shave.
L364418 +++$+++ u1968 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ The sentences to run concurrently.
L364417 +++$+++ u1982 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ VOICE OF MALCOLM X +++$+++ Fourteen counts of 8 to 10 years.
L364416 +++$+++ u1968 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Burglary, count one -- 8 to 10 years; count two, 8 to 10 years; count three, 8 to 10 years...
L364415 +++$+++ u1982 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ VOICE OF MALCOLM X +++$+++ But our crime wasn't burglary. It was balling white girls. They gave us the book.
L364414 +++$+++ u1968 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Two years in the Women's Reformatory at Framingham.
L364413 +++$+++ u1982 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ VOICE OF MALCOLM X +++$+++ The average first offender gets two years for burglary. We were all first offenders. That's what Sophia and Peg drew --
L364134 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Save it, baby. Save it for Mr. Right, 'cause your grandma's smarter than ya think.
L364133 +++$+++ u1969 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks say you're running around town with her.
