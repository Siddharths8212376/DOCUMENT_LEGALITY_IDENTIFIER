L617941 +++$+++ u8505 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ FIRST OFFICER +++$+++ Check it again. What about the global positioning satellite? Could there be something wrong with the signal?
L617940 +++$+++ u8507 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HELMSMAN +++$+++ The back-up does the same thing.
L617935 +++$+++ u8507 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HELMSMAN +++$+++ About every ninety seconds, the auto- pilot jogs us to the west.
L617934 +++$+++ u8505 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ FIRST OFFICER +++$+++ What's wrong?
L617933 +++$+++ u8507 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HELMSMAN +++$+++ Damn. It's doing it again.
L618518 +++$+++ u8516 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ My timing always was lousy.
L618517 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ How sweet.
L618345 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ No matter what the British government says, I won't kill this story.  Miss Oxford will show both of you to the elevator... And one of my people will definitely be in touch sooner than later.
L618344 +++$+++ u8516 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Thank you, Uncle Elliot.
L618343 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ ...Well! I do believe this requires further investigation!
L618337 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ ...I see.
L618336 +++$+++ u8516 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ He brought that up from the wreck.
L618332 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ - But as I've explained to Sidney, without proof, there's just no story. Don't you agree Mr. Bond?
L618331 +++$+++ u8516 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ - I told you! He was there! -
L618330 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ Obviously, the British government denies all of this -
L618325 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ I see you two have met.
L618324 +++$+++ u8516 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ What is HE doing here?
L618524 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ You come with me -  You stay here.
L618523 +++$+++ u8520 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ YUNG +++$+++ Take the men. I can finish alone.
L618502 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ A hundred and fifty years ago, my ancestors took this island - a barren, lifeless rock - and turned it into the greatest city known to modern civilization.  And now that I'm being forced to give it back, I intend to return it in exactly the same condition: A barren, lifeless rock.  The gold is merely reparations - payment from the spineless British government who wouldn't listen.
L618501 +++$+++ u8520 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ YUNG +++$+++ You have to leave -
L618500 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ Hong Kong, Mr. Bond!
L618498 +++$+++ u8520 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ YUNG +++$+++ Entering the main tunnel - ten minutes to target -
L618497 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ Bore through.  ...They used to say living well was the best revenge, Mr. Bond.  They're wrong.  Revenge is the best revenge.
L618490 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ Start the grinders.
L618489 +++$+++ u8520 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ YUNG +++$+++ Approaching the first gate.
L618488 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember you fondly.
L618484 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ Excellent.
L618483 +++$+++ u8520 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ YUNG +++$+++ The drill is in the water; approaching the intake tunnel.
L617878 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ Don't worry. Mr. Bond will get the message. So will his boss.
L617877 +++$+++ u8520 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ YUNG +++$+++ That was too close.
L618548 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ Kill him! Finish it!
L618547 +++$+++ u8517 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ STAMPER +++$+++ It's Bond!
L618546 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ What the hell is going on?
L618466 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ No. I have a better idea. In fact, Mr. Bond may have actually improved my original plan.  Bring them both to Hong Kong. And Make sure he has nothing else up his sleeve.
L618465 +++$+++ u8517 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ STAMPER +++$+++ Yes. Shall we kill them?
L618464 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ - Built to withstand a nuclear blast.  Are they alive?
L618425 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ I should have hired this man.  Get somebody up there!
L618424 +++$+++ u8517 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ STAMPER +++$+++ They're on the bridge. Seal off the 50th floor!
L618403 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ Get more men up there!
L618402 +++$+++ u8517 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ STAMPER +++$+++ It's a trick! After him.  They're in the south stairwell!
L618028 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ Good. We have an appointment in Hong Kong.
L618027 +++$+++ u8517 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ STAMPER +++$+++ Fueled and waiting.
L618026 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ Is the helicopter ready?
L617919 +++$+++ u8512 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ NUMBER THREE +++$+++ Thank you sir! Thank you!
L617918 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ Mr. Stamper will escort you to the plane.
L617917 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ ...But because I am a just man, I've decided to give Mr. Hussein what he deserves.
L617916 +++$+++ u8512 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ NUMBER THREE +++$+++ Please sir. Please -
L617915 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ You disappoint me, Number Three.
L617914 +++$+++ u8512 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ NUMBER THREE +++$+++ No sir! I swear! This is not true!!
L617913 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ ... And there's no truth that 10% of that money will go into your Swiss bank account?
L617912 +++$+++ u8512 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ NUMBER THREE +++$+++ Yes, sir. But he still feels his people should share in the increased profits of our news division. He has proposed an additional 500 million dollar payment.
L617911 +++$+++ u8506 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ HARMSWAY +++$+++ ...Haven't we already paid him for his services?
L617910 +++$+++ u8512 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ NUMBER THREE +++$+++ I regret to inform you, sir, that Saddam Hussein is still demanding a bonus for his role in the Gulf War.
L617635 +++$+++ u8518 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ Yes.
L617634 +++$+++ u8509 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Will the cruise set it off?
L617633 +++$+++ u8518 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ Soviet SB-9 nuclear torpedo. Yield, one kiloton.
L617628 +++$+++ u8509 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Abort the cruise.
L617627 +++$+++ u8518 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ Maybe. Maybe not.
L617626 +++$+++ u8509 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Will it go off?
L617624 +++$+++ u8509 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ M +++$+++ What's in the box, General?  What's in the box???
L617623 +++$+++ u8518 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ I don't know. He's not in the database -
L617622 +++$+++ u8509 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Who is that?!? What's in the box??
L617620 +++$+++ u8509 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Meaning there may be nuclear material down there?
L617619 +++$+++ u8518 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.
L617618 +++$+++ u8509 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ M +++$+++ Who is it?
L617617 +++$+++ u8518 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ Oh, no.
L617601 +++$+++ u8518 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ TANNER +++$+++ One to seven: Deal the face cards.
L617600 +++$+++ u8509 +++$+++ m577 +++$+++ M +++$+++ What about ID's?
L620226 +++$+++ u8523 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ Here I am thinking about myself when poor Harry is resting on the floor of the kitchen.
L620225 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ Soon as I rest a bit.  I meant as soon as we are back to normal again, anytime.
L620224 +++$+++ u8523 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ When are you boys going to fix that roof?
L620201 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ They're too big.
L620200 +++$+++ u8523 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ How come you're not wearing my shoes?
L620199 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ Yes.
L620198 +++$+++ u8523 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ Babe Brother, is that my shirt that you're wearing?
L619915 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ Oh here we go with that.
L619914 +++$+++ u8523 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ Junior spends time with his child.
L619913 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ Well, you are his grandfather. He is supposed to spend some time with you. You're supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that.
L619912 +++$+++ u8523 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ No, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him? You guys don't pick him up until nine, ten at night. You are into yourselves, as the saying goes. Spend some time trying to be parents. Take him to the mountains, fishing. You ought to let him get to know nature.
L619911 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ Why, you don't want us to bring him over?
L619682 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ We got the same thing.
L619681 +++$+++ u8523 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ What did your wife get her?
L619680 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ I hadn't forgotten. I ordered some cloth but it didn't come in and I felt so bad if I would have come to her birthday without that, I just stayed at home.
L619679 +++$+++ u8523 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ Your mother asked me not to mention it but your mother's birthday was last week.
L619625 +++$+++ u8523 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ Since when?
L619624 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ I pay my own way.
L619621 +++$+++ u8523 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ That's a lie.
L619620 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ I tried to call to let you know I was going to be late.
L619619 +++$+++ u8523 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ What time is it? Do you think you can just treat us like your slave? It's after one.
L620239 +++$+++ u8526 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ What is it, noontime?
L620238 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ I'm cold. I need to get out into the sunlight.
L620137 +++$+++ u8526 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ We will take her. You all stay here and watch Dad.
L620136 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ I'll drive her to the hospital.
L620131 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ My name is Sam. Samuel.
L620130 +++$+++ u8526 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ You dumb ass, it's Babe Brother.
L620129 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ I'm leaving and don't even call me when the shoe falls 'cause all he did for me was to try and run my life. I'm tired of people saying Babe Brother this, Babe Brother that. What's my name?
L620128 +++$+++ u8526 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ I ought to break your damn neck.
L620127 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ I told you about calling me boy. I ain't no boy. See, you and Dad got a bad habit of calling me boy. You call me boy in front of my wife. You think I'm going to fix the roof? I hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain.
L620126 +++$+++ u8526 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ That is a damn lie and you know it. Every time father asks you to do something, you either half-ass do it or run off and hide. Mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her, with your smart ass self, that you weren't a farmer; get Junior to do it. Every time someone asks you to do something, you always say, tell Junior to do it. Boy, you ought to grow up.
L620125 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ You always got the best of it around here and when Dad always talks about my son, it is always you, so you fix the roof.
L620124 +++$+++ u8526 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ I bet you if your master would have told you to fix the hole in the roof, you would have rebuilt the whole damn house.
L620123 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ I told her I would if she would give me time.
L620122 +++$+++ u8526 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ Why in the hell didn't you help mama?
L619790 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ Maybe I can get down there next week.
L619789 +++$+++ u8526 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ Robert asks about you. When are you going to do something to help him?
L619788 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ This is what it is all about, trying to keep from being out on the street.
L619787 +++$+++ u8526 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal.
L619786 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ Why are you always afraid to get somewhere?
L619785 +++$+++ u8526 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ You want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours? You know the last time we went into something together Daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street.
L619678 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ You always got something to say.
L619677 +++$+++ u8526 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ You used that excuse to get out of the army.
L619676 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights.
L619675 +++$+++ u8526 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ JUNIOR +++$+++ When are you going to find time to help me fix the roof?
L620223 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ I guess it proves you really care about me. You hung in there.
L620222 +++$+++ u8527 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ And what lesson have we learned from all of this, Babe Br... Sam... I mean Samuel?
L620221 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ It was nip and tuck.
L620220 +++$+++ u8527 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Do you think you won?
L620219 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ I couldn't believe the things I was doing. It was like an internal struggle going on inside my body.
L620218 +++$+++ u8527 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ You were in hell?
L620217 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like.
L620216 +++$+++ u8527 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Like muddy waters?
L620215 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ It's like I've been swimming in muddy waters.
L620214 +++$+++ u8527 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Like a veil has been lifted?
L620213 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ I have more sense than to give up everything, my family, you and Sunny. It wasn't me, I mean the real me inside my body. I'm glad it's over. It's like a veil has been lifted.
L619998 +++$+++ u8527 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I'm okay. Go back to your friends.
L619997 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ You okay?
L619994 +++$+++ u8527 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Why in the h...
L619993 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ Linda, how come you don't see that Sunny puts his shoes on right?
L619928 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ I don't need that kind of love. And I don't want to be reminded all the time that Big Mama's grandmother was born in slavery. If you really care about me, just tell me how I can make money.
L619927 +++$+++ u8527 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ He is just being like all parents, concerned about the ones they love.
L619926 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ Why does he always pick on me?
L619784 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ I preached to Mom and Dad about it but they are stuck in their ways, it's like talking to a brick. But if there is a way...
L619783 +++$+++ u8527 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ We could borrow on that land and put the money to work.
L619782 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ Pops put Big Daddy's farm in Rhonda's and Sunny's name and fixed it so no one can borrow on it.
L619781 +++$+++ u8527 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I told him we might not need it, if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property.
L619780 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ Will you still get the money from your father?
L619779 +++$+++ u8527 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ You would think people never lived in a house if they have to ask what does 1 1/2 baths mean.
L619685 +++$+++ u8527 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I would like to finish reading this. What would I talk about? I haven't read this month's almanac. I don't care to hear about how the corn was this fall or how to get rid of gophers by putting garlic in their holes. They pride themselves in making life hard and that's not my cup of tea.
L619684 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ Why don't you come in for a while?
L619650 +++$+++ u8527 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ How old are you?
L619649 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ I don't see you crying about my drinking it.
L619648 +++$+++ u8527 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Coffee is bad for anybody, especially for a child.
L619647 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ What is a sip of coffee going to do?
L619646 +++$+++ u8527 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I want Sunny to have an advantage that you and I never had, but he needs discipline, and you are not helping when I tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it.
L619645 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ My daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it. Every summer, the way they kept me and Junior out of trouble was to send us to Big Daddy's farm. We would get up with the chickens. Every summer the fence had to be repaired. The barn needed a coat of paint. We had to pip all of Big Mama's hundred laying hens and go to church all day on Sunday. For Big Daddy, calluses and sweat were the mark of a man. Sunny will never have to bust his knuckles like we did.
L619644 +++$+++ u8527 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Because you were spoiled, don't try to spoil Sunny.
L620116 +++$+++ u8533 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ I do have a right to ask you to be a little bit better than me and your father because we gave you a better head start. You have no right to complain to us about your not having enough.  You sit right there with your no manners self.
L620115 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ Can't I be myself without you jumping in with your right and wrong? The world is not black and white. Show me one perfect person. If you can't, don't ask me to be.
L620114 +++$+++ u8533 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Don't make me raise my hand to you. You have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong direction.
L620113 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ I'm busy.
L620112 +++$+++ u8533 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Have you lost your mind? Have you thought about your wife and child, not to mention your sick father? And I need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling.
L620111 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ Harry is coming to pick me up.
L620110 +++$+++ u8533 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ I've heard some foolish things in my life.
L620109 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ I'm going back home with Harry.
L620108 +++$+++ u8533 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ What for?
L620107 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ I need to get my suitcase out of the garage.
L619969 +++$+++ u8533 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Well, you look better than you did yesterday.
L619968 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ Doesn't he look a whole of lot better?
L619617 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ He will be alright.
L619616 +++$+++ u8533 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air.
L619615 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ I was hoping you came to the door instead of him. It gets cold at night.
L619614 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ Babe Brother.
L619613 +++$+++ u8533 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Who is it?
L620090 +++$+++ u8524 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ We are going where the action is. Ain't that right, Okra?  Let's play for a couple of bucks unless you want to start off with two bits and work our way up.  What would you give to be rich?
L620089 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ This would be a bad time for me to leave.
L620088 +++$+++ u8524 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I don't want to wear out welcome, but you can stay in someone's heart longer than you can stay in their house. Come with us, boy. We are going to have a good time.
L620025 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ I heard his voice as clear as day. I better get back. Maybe something is wrong.
L620024 +++$+++ u8524 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves over there.
L620023 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ I could swear I heard my son call me.
L619974 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ Anytime you need someone to do something for you, just let me know.
L619973 +++$+++ u8524 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Son, would you do me a favor and see if you could turn off that tap in the bathroom. My hand is too weak. And would you do me another favor? I don't like asking this but would you clean the tub for me? I have trouble bending over.
L619967 +++$+++ u8524 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Son, I can take everything you got with that deck. It is marked. Now I'm going to show you how to make some money in case you get stuck somewhere.
L619966 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ It is just a regular card.
L619965 +++$+++ u8524 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Never play with someone's else's cards. You always get a new deck. Look at this card. See anything?
L619887 +++$+++ u8524 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Boy, that is the real South. That is real corn liquor.
L619886 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ What is that?
L619764 +++$+++ u8524 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I don't know what happened to him. He just ran out into the streets.  I got some old records I want you to hear. I like the blues sung simply, man and a guitar. Or sung by a woman who had bad luck all her life. Don't ever let anyone tell you his life's story if it is of a weary life full of sadness. When I was a boy, a man told me a story of how he lost all of his sons and I'll be damned if the same thing didn't happen to me.
L619763 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ Don't pick up the cards if you are not in the game. Did he die?
L619762 +++$+++ u8524 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ That is called a crab apple switch. It's for those bad acting monkeys and just the thing for a mean dog. Now I don't know if I actually did what I did or got my life and story mixed in with other folk's stories but I seem to recall that I had to use my crab apple on a boy from back home. I was up in Memphis working on the railroad, like your daddy who had an easy job. He would sing a song that had a cadence and we would lay track. Anyway I was coming down Beale Street and I heard this music coming from a saloon. Sure enough it was Emory. My daddy taught both of us to play but Emory was natural at it. Got in a blues band and what not. He and another boy had killed a boy named Hocker sometime back and they balled the Jack leaving town. Emory had lost one eye and had a scar running down his face. Bad luck I would say. He got to drinking that corn liquor. We went to his girl's room and he wouldn't stop drinking. He started talking about the old days and he went mad. He pulled his knife and I got to mine first. The lights went out.
L619761 +++$+++ u8521 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ BABE BROTHER +++$+++ Did you ever have to use this thing?
L619607 +++$+++ u8522 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ DAVIS +++$+++ I'm not here to argue, sir.
L619606 +++$+++ u8523 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ Now how far would further out be?
L619605 +++$+++ u8522 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ DAVIS +++$+++ Well, you just have to move further out.
L619604 +++$+++ u8523 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ We grow most of our own food. The money I get from social security, my pension and my wife's work, keeps us living on the edge. What choice do people like us have.
L619603 +++$+++ u8522 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ DAVIS +++$+++ Not anymore, not in the city.
L619602 +++$+++ u8523 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots.
L619601 +++$+++ u8522 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ DAVIS +++$+++ You know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live stock.
L620235 +++$+++ u8523 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ It's only a tale.
L620234 +++$+++ u8533 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ I don't care to hear any jokes about people being in hell. This cut on my hand reminds me that it is nothing to laugh at.
L620233 +++$+++ u8523 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ But these are white people, anybody. The punch...
L620232 +++$+++ u8533 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ I don't want to hear any tales about colored people...
L620231 +++$+++ u8523 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ I'm almost finished. I'm about to come to the punch line.
L620230 +++$+++ u8533 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ I don't want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell. You're being irreverent.
L620229 +++$+++ u8523 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ He's going to check out heaven first. He gets a round trip ticket to heaven. He gets in heaven and finds it just like back home. People dripping with sweat, working in the fields, hardly surviving. He asked a man who was getting a drink of water, "I thought the streets were paved with gold." "They are but you won't see them," he said. "Boy, you got to work day and night cause idleness is sinfulness." So he takes the other half of his ticket and takes the express to hell. He sees people stretched out on their backs kicking back, picking their teeth. "Man, this is a dream." He asked, "What's you'll doing?" They all hollered back, "Sinning." The devil was shaking hands with everyone and came up to him and said, "Please to meet you." He asked, "I thought you'll was supposed to be burning in fire." Someone said, "Man, ain't no fire down here except under that pot of chitlins." The man was going go ask the preacher back on earth...
L620196 +++$+++ u8533 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ It's healing now.
L620195 +++$+++ u8523 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ What did you put on it?
L620194 +++$+++ u8533 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ I cut it on an old rusty knife.
L620193 +++$+++ u8523 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ What happened to your hand?
L620192 +++$+++ u8533 +++$+++ m578 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Since this morning.
