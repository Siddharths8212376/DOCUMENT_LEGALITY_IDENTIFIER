L458560 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Who asked you?
L458559 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ Well, he's popular. A lotta people like Janiro. You beat him and it only figures they'll wanna see you get a title shot. But, what do I know? I should keep my mouth shut, I should...
L458558 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ What do you mean, "good looking?"
L458557 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ Joey's right. Janiro's up-and coming, he's good looking...
L458538 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ Oh, Jake.
L458537 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Now, touch me...  ...here.
L458536 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Now take your panties off.
L458535 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ I like the gym smell.
L458534 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Go 'head. Do it.
L458533 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ Jake, you made me promise not to get you excited.
L458532 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Now take the rest off.
L458531 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Do what I say.
L458530 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ Jake...
L458529 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Take off my pants.
L458528 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Come here.
L458527 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ You said I couldn't. You've been good for two weeks...
L458526 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.
L458525 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ You said never to touch you before a fight.
L458524 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Come over here.
L458523 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ Are you sure we should be doing this?
L458505 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ It's OK.
L458504 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ Jake...
L458503 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ That's all right. He don't mind.
L458502 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ Jake, this is your father's bedroom.
L458492 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ What does that mean?
L458491 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ No.
L458490 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ Can you see it?
L458488 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Can you see it?
L458487 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ I can't find my ball.
L458486 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Just give it a nice little tap.
L458485 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ Should I hit it?
L458484 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Just keep your eye on the ball.
L458483 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ It feels real good.
L458482 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ That's it. Just grip up a little tighter. That's it. You're gonna be real good at this. How does that feel?
L458481 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You don't get nothin' done by watchin'. You just gotta do it. Here, I'll help you.
L458480 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ You go first. Let me watch how to do this.
L458477 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Oh no? I thought you was a movie star.
L458476 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
L458475 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I ain't ever talked to a movie star before.
L458474 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ You don't talk very much.
L458471 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Ya hear, Joey? She thinks this face is cute? Hey, whatcha doin' now? You wanna go for a ride?
L458470 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ I don't know. 'Cause you're cute.
L458469 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You wanted to say hello, eh? I can't believe it. When did you fall outa heaven? Anyone ever tell you you're the most beautiful one here, princess of the pool. You got a baby face. Look at mine. Whatcha wanna meet me for?
L458468 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ I just wanted to say hello.
L458467 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Joey said you wanted to meet me. Is that right? You wanted to meet me?
L458602 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I'd tell you to bet a bundle.
L458601 +++$+++ u2567 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ All right, lemme ask you something. Let's say I was a good friend of yours. And I was telling you I was gonna bet a lot of money on you in this Janiro fight. What would you tell me?
L458600 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Yeah, the weight's Ok.
L458599 +++$+++ u2567 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ How's the weight? Ok?
L458597 +++$+++ u2567 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ This Janiro's a good fighter, pretty good-lookin' kid.
L458596 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ He should.
L458595 +++$+++ u2567 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
L458594 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Never felt better.
L458593 +++$+++ u2567 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?
L458592 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ C'mon, Tommy --
L458591 +++$+++ u2567 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Fuckin' kid! You're the best fuckin' fighter around. Loved what you did to Satterfield. Them "moulan yans" -- forget about it. They're all afraid to fight you.
L458590 +++$+++ u2567 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Jake, sit down for a minute.
L458589 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Hi, Tommy. How are you?
L458667 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ I'll suck your eyes out! I'll fuckin' take the two of you.
L458666 +++$+++ u2566 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ SALVY +++$+++ Hey Joey, whadda ya lookin' to die young?
L458662 +++$+++ u2566 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ SALVY +++$+++ Hey Joey, I'm here with Patsy and Vera and Sandy. And Vickie just happened to come along. We're just trying to have a good time. What do you want from me? So, why don't you just take it easy before this gets out of hand.
L458661 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ What do you think, I'm blind? My brother's breaking his ass in a ring, and you're here with his wife.
L458660 +++$+++ u2566 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ SALVY +++$+++ Excuse me for living.
L458659 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Excuse me, I'm talking to my sister in-law.
L458658 +++$+++ u2566 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ SALVY +++$+++ Joey, relax. You're taking this the wrong way. Why don't you sit down and have a drink?
L458657 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ I said, let's go.
L458368 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Right, the gym.
L458367 +++$+++ u2566 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ SALVY +++$+++ Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.
L458366 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ All right, I'll try. See you later.
L458365 +++$+++ u2566 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ SALVY +++$+++ Talk some sense into him, will ya? You're still his brother. If he ain't gonna listen to you, he ain't gonna listen to nobody!
L458364 +++$+++ u2566 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ SALVY +++$+++ Look, I'm just tellin' you how Tommy feels. Jake is makin' it hard on himself. Tommy wants him with us. It's as simple as that.
L458363 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ I can't convince him. He's got such a thick head, I'd like to crack it open myself. Believe me, my own brother. It's very hard. You don't have to convince me -- I know we should be with Tommy. You talk to him. He don't listen to nobody.
L458350 +++$+++ u2566 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ SALVY +++$+++ Get lost.  Hey kids, "A cop is a rat." Remember that, "A rat."
L458349 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Hey, leave the kids alone.
L458348 +++$+++ u2566 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ SALVY +++$+++ He ain't doin' the right thing. He's makin' beans compared to what he should be makin'. Can't you make him understand that?
L458347 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ What do you want from my life, Salvy? He's my brother.
L458346 +++$+++ u2566 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ SALVY +++$+++ Hey but Joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes. The money's with your brother.
L458345 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Salvy, would I steer you wrong? Let's say that's the truck; it's full of cigarettes, right? Now, two o'clock this morning we move the truck from here to there,  take the cigarettes out, sell 'em, make some cash.
L458655 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ And I'm gonna finish my drink. And, I'm gonna have a good time, because I ain't doing nothing wrong.
L458654 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ And you're drinking with them right now.
L458653 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ That's right, take his part. You're his brother. He's never gonna be champ. Too many people are against him.
L458652 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Try to understand, Vickie. Jake's got a lotta aggravation. He's been a top contender too long.
L458651 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared.
L458650 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want.
L458649 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's gonna kill me anyway. It's a matter of time.
L458648 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ It don't look right.
L458647 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all the time?
L458646 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ No, you're his wife.
L458645 +++$+++ u2569 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ VICKIE +++$+++ What the hell am I doing wrong? Just because Jake is training, I can't go out? What am I, a goddamn prisoner?
L458644 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ What're you doin' with Salvy? You shouldn't be here with him. Jake's away killin' himself. Suppose he found out.
L461809 +++$+++ u2570 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ BABY SITTER +++$+++ Goodnight.
L461808 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ He has it. Thank you.
L461807 +++$+++ u2570 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ BABY SITTER +++$+++ Does he have your number, Mr. Jefferies?
L461806 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Well, if he calls in, tell him to get in touch with L. B. Jefferies right away. I might have quite a surprise for him.
L461805 +++$+++ u2570 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ BABY SITTER +++$+++ I'm hired 'til one. They went to dinner and maybe night-clubbing.
L461804 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Oh. When are they expected home?
L461803 +++$+++ u2570 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ BABY SITTER +++$+++ This is the baby sitter.
L461802 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ This is L. B. Jefferies, a friend of Tom's. Who am I talking with?
L461801 +++$+++ u2570 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ BABY SITTER +++$+++ This is Doyle's house.
L461063 +++$+++ u2573 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ GUNNISON +++$+++ Don't worry -- it comes off today.
L461062 +++$+++ u2571 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ BRYCE +++$+++ But his leg!
L461061 +++$+++ u2573 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ GUNNISON +++$+++ Name me a better photographer.
L461060 +++$+++ u2571 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ BRYCE +++$+++ Jefferies?
L461059 +++$+++ u2573 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ GUNNISON +++$+++ Bryce, the only man for this job is sitting right here in town.  Get me L. B. Jefferies.
L461058 +++$+++ u2571 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ BRYCE +++$+++ I'll pull somebody out of Japan.
L461057 +++$+++ u2573 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ GUNNISON +++$+++ This could go off in a month -- or an hour.
L461056 +++$+++ u2571 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ BRYCE +++$+++ From the looks of Davidson's cable, it might even go higher than that. And we haven't even got a camera over there.
L461055 +++$+++ u2573 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ GUNNISON +++$+++ Indo-China -- Jeff predicted it would go sky-high.
L461656 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ That's what they call a family problem.
L461655 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ I would say that is looked as if she wasn't coming back.
L461651 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Didn't you take it to the crime lab?
L461650 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Mrs. -- Thorwald's -- clothes. -- Clean -- carefully packed -- not too stylish -- but presentable.
L461648 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ When the lock is broken -- yes.
L461647 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Of course, it's normal for a man to tie his trunk up with a heavy rope.
L461634 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Get that idea out of your mind. It will only lead you in the wrong direction.
L461633 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Like disposing of their wives?
L461623 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Namely?
L461622 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ It was in her favorite handbag -- And, Mr. Doyle, that can lead to only one conclusion.
L461872 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ If that ring checks out, we'll give him an escort. So long.
L461871 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Just don't dally. Thorwald knows he's being watched. He won't hang around long.
L461870 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Maybe you won't need it. I'll run it down, Jeff.
L461869 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Precinct Six. I sent a friend over with bail money.
L461868 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Where'd they take Lisa?
L461867 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ In sections! And one other thing, doubting Tom -- it just occurred to me that all the calls Thorwald made were long distance! If he called his wife the day she left -- after she arrived in Merritsville -- why did she need to send him a postcard saying she'd arrived?
L461866 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ You think perhaps it was "old hambone?"
L461865 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I don't know what pet name Thorwald had for his wife. And that night he went out half a dozen times with the metal suitcase. He wasn't taking his possessions, because they're up in his apartment now!
L461864 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Like an old hambone?
L461863 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ A fact! Last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden. Why? Because he had something buried in there. Something a dog could scent.
L461862 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ A possibility.
L461861 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Like Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring. If that woman were still alive, she'd be wearing it.
L461860 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Like what?
L461859 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I know what you told me! She went in to get evidence, and she came out with it.
L461858 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ I told you that --
L461857 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police.
L461856 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Your Lisa?
L461855 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Listen to me! Lisa's been arrested.
L461854 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Look Jeff, don't louse up my night with another man killer stuffing a grisly trunk that turns out to be --
L461853 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Tom, I've got something real big for you.
L461852 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ This is Doyle, Jeff.
L461851 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Jefferies.
L461674 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ The police Department at Merritsville. They called to report. The trunk was just picked up -- by Mrs. Anna Thorwald.
L461673 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ That depends on who "they" were.
L461672 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Oh -- that phone call!  I gave them your number -- hope you don't mind.
L461661 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ All the things I hate.
L461660 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ If I'd been careful piloting that reconnaissance plane, you wouldn't have taken the kind of pictures that got you a medal, a big job, fame, money --
L461640 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Your logic is backward.
L461639 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ But I'm not a killer!
L461638 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ And how many people did you cut up with the couple of with it? Or hundred knives you've probably owned in your lifetime?
L461637 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Well, in the garage, back home, we --
L461636 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Did you ever own a saw?
L461625 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ You figured that out, huh?
L461624 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ That wasn't Mrs. Thorwald who left with him yesterday morning?
L461621 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ You sure it belongs to his wife?
L461620 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ He has his wife's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there.
L461619 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Jewelry?
L461608 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Everything he owns is laid out on the bedroom, ready for packing.
L461607 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ You think he's getting out of here?
L461606 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Enough to scare me that you wouldn't get here in time, and we'd lose him.
L461517 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Mrs. Thorwald.
L461516 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Is -- is Anna -- who I think it is?
L461514 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Oh -- I almost forgot!
L461513 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Forget the story -- find the trunk. Mrs. Thorwald's in it!
L461511 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Yeah -- frequently -- it ran something like this: "Your request for transfer turned down --"
L461510 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Ever get an answer?
L461509 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ You know, every day for three years I asked myself that same question?
L461508 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ How did we ever stand each other in that same plane for three years?
L461507 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ One thing I don't need is heckling! You called and asked me for help -- and now you're acting like a taxpayer!
L461506 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ What do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
L461505 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ A detective's nightmare.
L461504 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ By morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment.
L461503 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ I can hear myself starting out. "Your Honor -- I have a friend who's an amateur sleuth, an one night, after a heavy supper --"  He'd throw the New York State Penal Code right in my face. -- And it's six volumes.
L461502 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Give him evidence.
L461501 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ At the risk of sounding stuffy, Jeff -- I'll remind you of the Constitution, and the phrase "search warrant" issued by a judge who knows the Bill of Rights verbatim. He must ask for evidence.
L461500 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Just make sure you're not caught. If you find something, you've got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules. If you find nothing -- he's clear.
L461499 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Now don't get me mad! Even a detective can't walk in anybody's apartment and search it. If I were ever caught in there, I'd lose my badge inside of ten minutes!
L461498 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ What's the matter? Does he have a courtesy card from the police department?
L461497 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ I can't do it even if he's gone.
L461496 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I mean when he goes out for a paper, or a drink, or something. What he doesn't know won't hurt him.
L461495 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ I can't do that.
L461494 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Well then do a good job of it! Get over there, and search Thorwald's apartment! It must be knee-deep in evidence.
L461493 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ If possible -- both.
L461492 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Doyle -- are you interested in solving a case, or making me look foolish?
L461491 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ I hate to remind you -- but this all started because you said she was murdered. Now did anyone, including you, actually see her murdered?
L461490 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Well -- what good is his information?!! It's a second-hand version of an unsupported statement by the murderer himself -- Thorwald! Anybody actually see the wife get on the train?
L461489 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Jeff -- huh?
L461488 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ A very convenient guy -- this superintendent. Have you checked his bank deposits lately?
L461487 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ The superintendent met Thorwald coming back. He said Thorwald told him he had just put his wife on the train for the country.
L461486 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Now how could anybody guess that? They had, perhaps, signs on their luggage, "Grand Central Or Bust!"?
L461485 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ The building superintendent, and two tenants. Flat statements -- no hesitation. And they all jibed to the letter. The Thorwalds were leaving for the railroad station.
L461484 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ The Thorwalds -- at six in the morning?
L461483 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Who left -- where?
L461482 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Who said they left then?
L461479 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Not yet.
L461478 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Feel a little foolish?
L461477 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Too bad. The Thorwalds were just leaving the apartment house at that time.
L461476 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I think that's about the time I fell asleep.
L461475 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Six ayem.
L461474 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ What time?
L461473 +++$+++ u2572 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ -- until yesterday morning.
L461472 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Then where is she -- in the ice box?
