L609430 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ Those soldiers have got loafers on.  What kind of army gives their soldiers loafers?
L609429 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ That's it.  It's over.  Eighteen hours into the war and it's over.
L609390 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ It's a container.  Break the seal.
L609389 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ It's...it's...I don't know what it is.
L609382 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ You know what, Wes?  If you get a note from your mommy they might excuse you from the war.
L609381 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ The longer the air force hits the Iraqis, the safer it'II be for us when we have to engage.
L609376 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ At-at-at-at-at.
L609375 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ This is so weird.  It's happening, but it's not.  It's like a TV show, and we're part of it.
L609374 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ At-at-at-at-at.
L609371 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ The only thing I worry about is how much Iraqi ass I'm going to be able to kick before this whole thing is over.  The only people who I've got anything to worry about are the poor, dumb camel jockeys who don't know enough to get out of the way when I come rolling at them; an M-16 in each hand, and a grenade between my teeth.  Now if you'll excuse me, soldier, I'd like to get back to my box.  I've got a treasure to find.
L609370 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ You ever think about it?  You ever worry?
L609369 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Come on, man.  I almost had this thing open.
L609368 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ You ever think about dying?
L609367 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ What!?
L609366 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ Jaeger?
L609364 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ Why would they do all that if we weren't?
L609363 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ It doesn't mean anything.
L609362 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ We're going to war, aren't we.  If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.
L609361 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ What's your point, Wes?  You have a point?
L609360 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ They're cancelling all leaves, all passes.  No more drills.  We stand at full ready starting--
L609359 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Like I said; so?
L609358 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ That's in two days.
L609357 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Yeah.  So?
L609356 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ You know the fifteenth is the deadline for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait.
L609355 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ What?
L609354 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ Jaeger?
L609353 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ I don't care if there's a lump of coal in here.  I just want to be able to rub Epps' face in it when I crack this thing.
L609352 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ You really think there's a treasure inside?
L609351 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ I'll show Epps.  He'll be sorry when I get this thing open.
L609350 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ You will.  You'll get it.
L609349 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Naw, nothing.
L609348 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ You get it yet?
L609345 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ I could.
L609344 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ And you're the guy who's going to open it.
L609339 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ For real?  A treasure?
L609338 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.
L609337 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Yeah, you're funny.
L609336 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ He says it's a box.
L609332 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ What is it?  You know so much about Arabland tell me what it is.
L609331 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ Now you need me.
L609330 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ What is this?
L609325 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ Don't even try it.  You offend a woman out here you're in serious trouble.
L609324 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ How do you say "Come here, baby.  I'm horny."  I can use that now.
L609323 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ Don't shoot me, I'm friendly.  You can use that when you surrender.
L609322 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ What does that mean?
L609319 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ I thought it would be good to know.
L609318 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Spanish wasn't hard enough?
L609315 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ I'm just trying to help you guys out.  It doesn't hurt to know something about Saudi Arabia.
L609314 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ It was an accident.  You saw it was an accident.
L609313 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ Come on.  You're going to get us in trouble.
L609311 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Oh yeah.  Accidently.
L609310 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ I'm saying don't do it accidently.
L609309 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ When do you ever point the soles of your feet at people?
L609304 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ People were suffering in Afganistan, and we didn't do anything.
L609303 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ People are suffering.
L609302 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ I don't think we'll go to war.  We shouldn't even be here.  This isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict.  It should be decided regionally.
L609301 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ We ought to kick their asses anyway. Even if they do get out of Kuwait we ought to kick their asses.
L609288 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ Okay.
L609287 +++$+++ u8410 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ Yes.  Yes.  That's exactly it.  Yes.

Baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that doesn't bother you.  But me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull.

L609284 +++$+++ u8409 +++$+++ m570 +++$+++ JAEGER +++$+++ A headache?

L612150 +++$+++ u8414 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ LUH +++$+++ That's not food.  Can't be food.

L612090 +++$+++ u8414 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ LUH +++$+++ No, don't make trouble.  It's nothing.
L612089 +++$+++ u8419 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ THX +++$+++ You don't have to... I don't trust him.  You ought to file a report.

L612086 +++$+++ u8414 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ LUH +++$+++ I don't know.
L612085 +++$+++ u8419 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ THX +++$+++ A shift change should come through the scheduling office.
L612084 +++$+++ u8414 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ LUH +++$+++ He wants me to come to his quarters.

L612037 +++$+++ u8419 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ THX +++$+++ What's the matter with you?
L612036 +++$+++ u8414 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ LUH +++$+++ No, your going to eat it, or it will go to waste.
L612035 +++$+++ u8414 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ LUH +++$+++ Well it's fixed, so you'll have to eat it.

L612415 +++$+++ u8415 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ NIN +++$+++ But we need a creative dissent. Our voices are not joined in any harmonious chorus, but the differences are differences of emphasis, not of fundamentals. Now, the new alignment's greatest need is to communicate with all its elements, rather than march along in parallel line that never converge.

L612319 +++$+++ u8416 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ PTO +++$+++ Then why are they holding us here? Why don't they destroy us right away?  Economically, it's not sound at all.  Very much unlike....
L612469 +++$+++ u8415 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ NIN +++$+++ But you can't.  We must escape.
L612468 +++$+++ u8417 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ SEN +++$+++ THX and me.
L612467 +++$+++ u8415 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ NIN +++$+++ Who?  Who's leaving?
L612466 +++$+++ u8417 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ SEN +++$+++ We're leaving.
L612465 +++$+++ u8415 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ NIN +++$+++ What?
L612464 +++$+++ u8417 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ SEN +++$+++ We're leaving.
L612463 +++$+++ u8415 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ NIN +++$+++ What's going on....what are you doing?
L612411 +++$+++ u8415 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ NIN +++$+++ We cannot stay here and allow ourselves to be destroyed.  You can work with us.  An organized plan of escape must be devised first.  Could you see anything?  You want to leave.  You're not like them.  You must have left something, or someone.
L612410 +++$+++ u8417 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ SEN +++$+++ I thought you were through with it!
L612473 +++$+++ u8420 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ TWA +++$+++ Incredible!
L612472 +++$+++ u8415 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ NIN +++$+++ We must escape.  We have plans. We can leave.  We must wait until...
L612446 +++$+++ u8420 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ TWA +++$+++ It may seem ridiculous to the untrained mind, but if you were able to interpret the calculations you would see that an apparent paradox is actually a perfect and elegant system in concept and design.
L612445 +++$+++ u8415 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ NIN +++$+++ That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
L612401 +++$+++ u8420 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ TWA +++$+++ Ask him about the air.  He looks out of breath.
L612400 +++$+++ u8415 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ NIN +++$+++ Wait!  I'll talk to him.
L612394 +++$+++ u8420 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ TWA +++$+++ I wonder how far he went.  He's gathered invaluable information out there.
L612393 +++$+++ u8415 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ NIN +++$+++ He's coming back for the rest of us.  He can't make it alone.
L612385 +++$+++ u8420 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ TWA +++$+++ Impossible!
L612384 +++$+++ u8415 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ NIN +++$+++ I can just barely see him.  I think he's leaving.
L612444 +++$+++ u8420 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ TWA +++$+++ No one could have imagined anything one-thousandth as fantastic as the sober facts uncovered by patient inquiry.  This world is in a state of static-mobility:  we are at the same time moving and standing still.
L612443 +++$+++ u8416 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ PTO +++$+++ What?
L612442 +++$+++ u8420 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ TWA +++$+++ I've got it!  Astounding!
L612432 +++$+++ u8420 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ TWA +++$+++ On the contrary!  It absolutely proves what I have always felt. We are located in an apparently uniform space with no visible limits.  We are just now beginning to push back the clouds of ignorance and perceive the truth.  We must continue the search.
