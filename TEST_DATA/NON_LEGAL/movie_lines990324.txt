L525393 +++$+++ u7786 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Well, plus the money ain't that bad. DAWN So, tell me, do you think everyone gets their million dollars' worth on this trip of a lifetime?
L525392 +++$+++ u7779 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ DAWN +++$+++ So you were looking for a new challenge.
L525391 +++$+++ u7786 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ This is my second commercial flight.  I used to run satellite freighters but that got old fast.
L525390 +++$+++ u7779 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ DAWN +++$+++ Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
L525389 +++$+++ u7786 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?
L525388 +++$+++ u7779 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ DAWN +++$+++ That's right.
L525387 +++$+++ u7786 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Oh right, right you're on that research grant.
L525626 +++$+++ u7782 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ That is one of my priorities.
L525625 +++$+++ u7779 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ DAWN +++$+++ Yes Mac, but the guests are requesting it.  It will reduce the level of negative feedback.
L525310 +++$+++ u7782 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Well if you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available 24 hours in the earthrise room, and a large selection of vintage wines here in our ship bar.
L525309 +++$+++ u7779 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ DAWN +++$+++ So I've been told.
L525308 +++$+++ u7782 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.
L525307 +++$+++ u7779 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ DAWN +++$+++ No, just enjoying the view.
L525306 +++$+++ u7782 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Is there anything I can help you with?
L525305 +++$+++ u7779 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ DAWN +++$+++ Thank you.
L525304 +++$+++ u7782 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Congratulations on your...recent award.
L525303 +++$+++ u7779 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ DAWN +++$+++ I'm fine.
L525943 +++$+++ u7781 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Are you nuts!  It's too risky!
L525942 +++$+++ u7779 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ DAWN +++$+++ I'm going back for Taylor!
L525927 +++$+++ u7781 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ He's in the bathroom.
L525926 +++$+++ u7779 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ DAWN +++$+++ Carlo!
L525923 +++$+++ u7779 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ DAWN +++$+++ He's up on the bridge!  He's going to be OK.  Now who's missing?
L525922 +++$+++ u7781 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Where's Taylor?
L525921 +++$+++ u7779 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ DAWN +++$+++ There's no time to explain.  Get everyone together!  We found a way to the pods!
L525920 +++$+++ u7781 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What is happening around here!!!
L525868 +++$+++ u7783 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ How can you sit there with your fat stomach and tell me to take it easy!  I want to go home!  I want to be warm!  I want to get out of here!
L525867 +++$+++ u7780 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ DELBERT +++$+++ Baby, take it easy.
L525866 +++$+++ u7783 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ It's getting too cold in here.  I can't stand this anymore!
L525557 +++$+++ u7780 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ DELBERT +++$+++ Talk to him...Jesus...
L525556 +++$+++ u7783 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ You're Delbert Miles!  You have more clout than some whacked out pilot!  Talk to him!
L525555 +++$+++ u7780 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ DELBERT +++$+++ How am I supposed to know?
L525554 +++$+++ u7783 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Well now what are we gonna do!
L525419 +++$+++ u7780 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ DELBERT +++$+++ Send it back if you don't want it.
L525418 +++$+++ u7783 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Oh no...I think there's carrots in here...
L525331 +++$+++ u7780 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ DELBERT +++$+++ Besides I can't wait to tee off on the sea of tranquillity. That should shore up that prick Hank Drexler.
L525330 +++$+++ u7783 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ I guess so.
L525329 +++$+++ u7780 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ DELBERT +++$+++ Look around you baby, we're rubbing elbows with royalty, oil sheiks, this is class.  You'll be envied by everyone.
L525328 +++$+++ u7780 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ DELBERT +++$+++ Look you were the one who wanted to do something different, something to tell all your friends.  Any chump can go to Nassau.
L525327 +++$+++ u7783 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ How is it going to be different from this?  Go see some boring footprint under glass?
L525326 +++$+++ u7780 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ DELBERT +++$+++ Ah hell we can always do that. Listen believe me, once we get to the moon, your tone is going to change.
L525325 +++$+++ u7783 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ We should have gone to Nassau. At least we could go swimming, lie on the beach.
L525324 +++$+++ u7780 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ DELBERT +++$+++ Homesick?  It's only been two days!
L525323 +++$+++ u7783 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ I'm homesick.
L525813 +++$+++ u7781 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ The engines!
L525812 +++$+++ u7780 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ DELBERT +++$+++ What the hell is that?
L525773 +++$+++ u7780 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ DELBERT +++$+++ What makes you so sure?
L525772 +++$+++ u7781 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.
L525771 +++$+++ u7780 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ DELBERT +++$+++ I tell you, something's not right here.  How do we know they're not going to use the pod for themselves?
L525754 +++$+++ u7781 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What are you going to do about it?
L525753 +++$+++ u7780 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ DELBERT +++$+++ Again with the orders from you! You got a Napoleon complex chief, and I'm getting sick of it!
L525752 +++$+++ u7781 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'll tell you what you're gonna do.  You're gonna stay put like Taylor said.
L525751 +++$+++ u7780 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ DELBERT +++$+++ I haven't quite made up my mind yet.
L525568 +++$+++ u7780 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ DELBERT +++$+++ Who are you calling a pig, rummy?
L525567 +++$+++ u7781 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You're gonna give him those bank codes, you know why?  Because I'm telling you to, that's why.  I'm not losing my life over some greedy pig.
L525566 +++$+++ u7780 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ DELBERT +++$+++ Well what would you know about it? You don't have anything to lose.
L525565 +++$+++ u7781 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Look.  We're talking about life and death here.  I don't know why we're even having this conversation.
L525660 +++$+++ u7782 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ That's affirmative.
L525659 +++$+++ u7786 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Is it safe for human transport?
L525658 +++$+++ u7782 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ I would recommend a maintenance crew in this sector.
L525657 +++$+++ u7786 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ How is it looking, Mac?
L525654 +++$+++ u7782 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Certainly.  Anything I can do to be of service.
L525653 +++$+++ u7786 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Ok Mac...  I'll talk to you on this. I want to find a way to get to the bridge, then I want you to come back.
L525642 +++$+++ u7782 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ I'm sorry.  The suit compartments are in a non-oxygenated, zero gravity atmosphere.  I'm afraid that's off limits to all passengers.
L525641 +++$+++ u7786 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Mac, what about the suit compartments on this level?  Can they be accessed?
L525639 +++$+++ u7782 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Yes.  You can enjoy some wonderful views from there.
L525638 +++$+++ u7786 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ But the corridor outside this door is open, correct?
L525634 +++$+++ u7782 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ One moment please...  one moment please...
L525633 +++$+++ u7786 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Now Mac, can you tell me the status of this deck?
L525623 +++$+++ u7786 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ I know but we're in a bind.
L525622 +++$+++ u7782 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer.
L525621 +++$+++ u7786 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't. I need you to tell it something.
L525620 +++$+++ u7782 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ That will not be necessary.  You can simply speak to me.  I understand most languages fluently.
L525619 +++$+++ u7786 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ I need you to actually do something for me.  I need to access your CPU, directly.
L525618 +++$+++ u7786 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Right, I understand that...
L525617 +++$+++ u7782 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Certainly.  I have a full working knowledge of the ships operations.
L525616 +++$+++ u7786 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Yes I know all that.  Mac, I need you to help us out with a little technical problem.
L525615 +++$+++ u7782 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Certainly.  If you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available --
L525614 +++$+++ u7786 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Mac, I have a favor to ask you. Mac looks at Taylor -
L525465 +++$+++ u7786 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Mac.  What's shaking?
L525464 +++$+++ u7782 +++$+++ m526 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Officer Taylor, how are you this evening?
L526606 +++$+++ u7789 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ ALFIE +++$+++ Just like Junior did the last time; lane six. All's I know is it's gonna be a closed coffin. My advice to you is to lay low. He puts on a pair of dark 7-Eleven shades, flips up his collar and skulks away.
L526605 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ The pin machine?
L526604 +++$+++ u7789 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ ALFIE +++$+++ Did you hear about that bowler who got smeared? I saw them pull a body bag out of the alley. I heard he was kacked but good. They had to take apart the pin machine to get him out.
L526121 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Maybe I should have left the ball in the car.
L526120 +++$+++ u7789 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ ALFIE +++$+++ My father used to say to me "Never..." no, hmmm. "Always..." No, no...  Ah! Love and hate are blood relations.
L526119 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Yeah, but it didn't go so good. He wasn't the man I thought he'd be. Theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup, but his hands are trembling, spilling some of the coffee.
L526118 +++$+++ u7789 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ ALFIE +++$+++ Find your bowler?
L526117 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ 99 years, 241 days,  15 hours, and 20 minutes of no bowling. Alfie shuffles up to the self-serve island and begins wiping it down.
L526017 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ A bowler.
L526016 +++$+++ u7789 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ ALFIE +++$+++ What kind of man?
L526015 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I'm looking for a man.
L526013 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I'm from Akron.
L526012 +++$+++ u7789 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ ALFIE +++$+++ You're not from around here, are you?
L526011 +++$+++ u7789 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ ALFIE +++$+++ I'm an addict. I can't go through a day without the stuff. Theo reaches over and pours for him with a steady hand.
L526689 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ No. I'm from Akron.
L526688 +++$+++ u7790 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ ALFREDA +++$+++ Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?
L526687 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You have orange whips?
L526686 +++$+++ u7790 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ ALFREDA +++$+++ Can I get you something for the road?
L526685 +++$+++ u7790 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ ALFREDA +++$+++ Paradise, huh? Might be one of the new putt-putts off route 99. Theo turns to leave.
L526684 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Nope.
L526683 +++$+++ u7790 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ ALFREDA +++$+++ You a mini-golfer?
L526665 +++$+++ u7791 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BREEZE +++$+++ It's splitsville for you.
L526664 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You tried to make it look like Junior trashed his place. Junior's underground in that coffin you dicks put him in.
L526663 +++$+++ u7791 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BREEZE +++$+++ After we ID, we bury the body. Case and casket closed.
L526617 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I should've pegged you guys for bowling dicks from day one.
L526616 +++$+++ u7791 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BREEZE +++$+++ Sorry about your loss.
L526240 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You said it would be unethical to help me. You call dwarf bowling ethical!
L526239 +++$+++ u7791 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BREEZE +++$+++ Heh, heh, heh.
L526184 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ He's my dad.
L526183 +++$+++ u7791 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BREEZE +++$+++ Hey, cut it out Sid, that tickles. I'm serious! You guys are related, right?
L526176 +++$+++ u7791 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BREEZE +++$+++ Look Sid, a Buzz Burger. The Faz's favorite lunch. Sid reaches for the plate. Buzz walks over to the booth  and pulls his burger away from Sid.
L526175 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
L526047 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ It belonged to my dad.
L526046 +++$+++ u7791 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BREEZE +++$+++ Haven't seen a ball like that since '69.
L526045 +++$+++ u7791 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BREEZE +++$+++ Whoa, cool your maples. Over the bridge, past the Peter Pan, last house on the dead end. Theo releases Sid's hand. Sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand.
L526044 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Where can I find Buzz Fazeli?
L526648 +++$+++ u7801 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ See ya 'round Faz.
L526647 +++$+++ u7791 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BREEZE +++$+++ Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz.
L526646 +++$+++ u7801 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ The Faz sure took care a her.  Breeze makes a nasal GRUNT as he tries to suppress a snigger. Sid - trying to keep a straight face - elbows him. Sid and Breeze approach the coffin. Breeze pulls an orange whip out of a paper bag and carefully places it on the coffin lid.
L526626 +++$+++ u7791 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BREEZE +++$+++ I'd buy it!
L526625 +++$+++ u7801 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ Think he bought it?
L526624 +++$+++ u7791 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BREEZE +++$+++ Only problem is, you didn't put his lights out, you just got him mad. Then he took it out on poor Faz, God rest his soul. Theo patches out.
L526623 +++$+++ u7801 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ She told us you went after Junior to save your old man's hide. You got some balls goin' after that psycho.
L526622 +++$+++ u7801 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ Kastle's daughter's been lookin' for you.
L526621 +++$+++ u7791 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BREEZE +++$+++ Did you know you were parked in the handicap space?
L526609 +++$+++ u7801 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ Nothing going on here, everybody stand back. Let him through, ladies. Ladies, please. As they start to move through the female throng, a little girl pops out in front of them, holding her ball.
L526608 +++$+++ u7791 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BREEZE +++$+++ Bowling police, step back, give him room.
L526503 +++$+++ u7791 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BREEZE +++$+++ Is it true they blacked out the whole county giving you electro-shock? Junior looks from one man to the other, breathing heavily, his nostrils flaring.
L526502 +++$+++ u7801 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ Hello Mr. Kastle.  Junior, long time. I thought they locked you up and threw away the warden!
L526419 +++$+++ u7791 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BREEZE +++$+++ Wait! That's an aria!
L526418 +++$+++ u7801 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ How do you turn this thing off?
L526417 +++$+++ u7801 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ Right, eating at the core, eating it's way out. It makes me sick!
L526416 +++$+++ u7791 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BREEZE +++$+++ - canker sore.
L526415 +++$+++ u7801 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ But not no more. Now people take advantage. Bowling ain't what it used to be. There's something evil spreading in this sport - like a big, gigantic, puss- ridden -
L526414 +++$+++ u7791 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BREEZE +++$+++ Sure, Sid.
L526413 +++$+++ u7801 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ gambling. And it was a safe place for kids, a place where the whole community could meet for some wholesome, clean fun.
L526412 +++$+++ u7801 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ Bowling was the most incorruptible sport. No megalomillionaires, no 
L526411 +++$+++ u7791 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BREEZE +++$+++ No kiddin'.
L526410 +++$+++ u7801 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ You know, Elvis bowled.
L526409 +++$+++ u7791 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BREEZE +++$+++ It was a clearance.
L526408 +++$+++ u7801 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ You got an 8-track tape player on purpose, just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin' opera.
L526407 +++$+++ u7791 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BREEZE +++$+++ You listen to the feelings, not the words.
L526406 +++$+++ u7801 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ How do you know, you don't even speak Latin?
L526405 +++$+++ u7791 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BREEZE +++$+++ How could you hate opera, Sid? Opera has all the drama and excitement of real life - to music!
L526404 +++$+++ u7801 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ I hate fuckin' opera.
L526403 +++$+++ u7791 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BREEZE +++$+++ La da da dalala...
L526402 +++$+++ u7801 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ Bowling used to be so pure, so...All- American. Breeze sings along with Caruso and pretends to conduct.
L526192 +++$+++ u7801 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ So Buzz, let's skedaddle. Mr. Kastle is waiting. As Buzz gets up, Theo rises and steps between his father and the two sleazeballs.
L526191 +++$+++ u7791 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BREEZE +++$+++ Your pop said to put these on his tab. Sid gets up and jerks his thumb towards the door.
L526190 +++$+++ u7801 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ Pinhead! Don't just blurt it right out.
L526189 +++$+++ u7791 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BREEZE +++$+++ I remember, Sid! Mr. Kastle says he don't like no sticky fingers in the till.
L526188 +++$+++ u7801 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ Look, Faz, Mr. Kastle was not his usual charismatic self today when he told us to tell you...  What was that he said...?
L526180 +++$+++ u7791 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BREEZE +++$+++ Are you guys bruddas?
L526179 +++$+++ u7801 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ Buzz, Mr. Kastle wants to talk to you.
L526174 +++$+++ u7801 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ We're looking for Buzz Fazeli, seen him?
L526173 +++$+++ u7791 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BREEZE +++$+++ Hey, you still here?
L526172 +++$+++ u7791 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BREEZE +++$+++ When you get a chance.
L526171 +++$+++ u7801 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ Three whips. To go.
L526039 +++$+++ u7801 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ You afraid we're gonna steal it?
L526038 +++$+++ u7791 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BREEZE +++$+++ Ah, come on, lemme see your ball.
L526036 +++$+++ u7791 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BREEZE +++$+++ Lemme see your ball.
L526035 +++$+++ u7801 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ Yeah, basement bingo.
L526026 +++$+++ u7801 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ What do you want with old man Faz?
L526025 +++$+++ u7791 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BREEZE +++$+++ Fazeli...I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
L526023 +++$+++ u7801 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ No, pinhead, he ain't here to bowl.
L526022 +++$+++ u7791 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BREEZE +++$+++ Hey, ain't I seen you on the tour?
L526154 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Oh, a professional man. What'll you have?
L526153 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ Theo's bowled on the tour.
L526152 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ You look like you're something on the lanes.
L526149 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ Sheila, meet...uh...  I forget the name.
L526148 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ Buzz Burger, side of 'cues. You haven't introduced me to your fan.
L526140 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ Some people will do anything for an autograph. Theo enters the diner and walks over to Buzz.
L526139 +++$+++ u7800 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ SHEILA +++$+++ You don't need coffee, Mr. Fazeli; you need a vacation. Sheila catches sight of Theo pulling into the parking lot. She puts a Ken head earring in her right ear. Buzz follows Sheila's gaze.
L526138 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ Yeah, and make it extra muddy, I didn't sleep a zee last night. Sheila fills a cup. Buzz lifts it to his mouth, his hands trembling.
L526217 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ Wish me luck.
L526216 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ I'm sure you have Buzz.
L526215 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ Miles, I've always been on the square with you.
L526214 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ Simple math, Buzz.  Two plus two does not equal three.
L526213 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ And look at that; both partners go down together. Kastle shoves the sculpture onto the floor, stands up, and crushes it under his heel. He goes over and puts his arm around Buzz.
L526209 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ A beautiful thing. And you know why Buzz? You know what we got? Buzz raises an eyebrow as he buttons his shirt.
L526208 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ It's a beautiful thing.
L526207 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ brainstorm, Buzz. I admit, I thought it was a rotten idea, but I put up the scratch.  And now we got a beautiful thing.
L526206 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ This scam we got going here was your 
L526205 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ Seven years.
L526204 +++$+++ u7796 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ KASTLE +++$+++ We've been partners a long time now, haven't we Buzz?
L526203 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ What's on your mind, Miles?
L526727 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ See ya 'round Maynard.
L526726 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ You give Ed Klein of the American Bowling Congress a call.  Tell him your Maynard's boy. He's expecting you, and he owes me. He'll getcha back in like Flynn.  Don't say I never gave you nothing.
L526725 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ I didn't mean that stuff I said. I was trying to keep you out of this muddle. I'm glad I didn't have my tubes tied. Oh, and by the way, I made a call for you before I - uh - retired. Buzz takes his card and scrawl on the back with a gold pen.
L526724 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ Listen, if straight doesn't work out, you come work for me.  Just make sure nobody's following you. Buzz's face is eerily lit by the glow of the sunset, his halo bouncing in the breeze.
L526723 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I'm goin' straight. No more short cuts. Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the open window.
L526722 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ Thanks, kid.  Where are you goin' now?
L526721 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I never saw you.
L526720 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ So, eh, you never saw me. Right?
L526717 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You're a scumbag.
L526716 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.
L526715 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ What about bowling?
L526714 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.
L526713 +++$+++ u7802 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ It could just as easily have been me in that box.
L526712 +++$+++ u7792 +++$+++ m527 +++$+++ BUZZ +++$+++ I am underground.
