L312368 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Well . . .  . . . now, come right in here, Mr. Carter.
L312367 +++$+++ u6038 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Yeah, very funny.
L312366 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Good year? Well, between you and me, Mr. Carter, we're broke.
L312365 +++$+++ u6038 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Well, I guess they do those things. Well, I trust you had a good year.
L312364 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ We're all excited around here.  My brother just got the Congressional Medal of Honor. The President just decorated him.
L312363 +++$+++ u6038 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Merry Christmas.
L312362 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
L312361 +++$+++ u6038 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Carter –– bank examiner.
L312360 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Good morning, sir.
L312708 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Where is she?
L312707 +++$+++ u6039 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ She's . . .
L312704 +++$+++ u6039 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ I'm not supposed to tell.
L312703 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.
L312702 +++$+++ u6039 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ I . . .
L312701 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I don't know how you know these things, but tell me –– where is she?
L312700 +++$+++ u6039 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Oh, well, I can't . . .
L312699 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Where's Mary?
L312698 +++$+++ u6039 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Yes, George?
L312697 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Clarence . . .
L312694 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Oh, I'm not sure of anything anymore. All I know is this should be Bailey Park. But where are the houses?
L312693 +++$+++ u6039 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Are you sure this is Bailey Park?
L312692 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Sure I know where he lives. He lives in Bailey Park.
L312691 +++$+++ u6039 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ You know where he lives?
L312642 +++$+++ u6039 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Zuzu's petals.
L312641 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What?
L312640 +++$+++ u6039 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ There is no George Bailey. You have no papers, no cards, no driver's license, no 4-F card, no insurance policy . . . 
L312639 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What do you mean, no identity? My name's George Bailey.
L312638 +++$+++ u6039 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ You're nobody. You have no identity.
L312637 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Then if I wasn't born, who am I?
L312636 +++$+++ u6039 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
L312635 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?
L312634 +++$+++ u6039 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ No, of course not.
L312633 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that. What else are you? What . . . are you a hypnotist?
L312632 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What do you mean, I wasn't there? I remember distinctly . . .
L312631 +++$+++ u6039 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ You see, George, you were not there to stop Gower from putting that poison into the . . .
L312619 +++$+++ u6039 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Why? Don't they believe in angels?
L312618 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Look, I think maybe you better not mention getting your wings around here.
L312617 +++$+++ u6039 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Every time you hear a bell ring, it means that some angel's just got his wings.
L312616 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Made what?
L312615 +++$+++ u6039 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it.
L312613 +++$+++ u6039 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ I jumped in the river to save you so I could get my wings.
L312612 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ No wonder you jumped in the river.
L312611 +++$+++ u6039 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ No.
L312610 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You don't huh? Well, you got any money?
L312609 +++$+++ u6039 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ No.
L312608 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow –– you worry me. You got someplace to sleep?
L312607 +++$+++ u6039 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
L312606 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What's the matter with him. I never saw Nick act like that before.
L312597 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Well, maybe I left the car up at Martini's. Well, come on, Gabriel.
L312596 +++$+++ u6039 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ It isn't me!
L312595 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Oh, I don't know. Either I'm off my nut, or he is . . .  . . . or you are!
L312587 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Well, I had a car, and it was right here. I guess somebody moved it.
L312586 +++$+++ u6039 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ You have no car.
L312584 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You haven't got your wings. Yeah, that's right.
L312583 +++$+++ u6039 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ I can't fly. I haven't got any wings.
L312581 +++$+++ u6039 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Our clothes are dry.
L312580 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it? What's happened here?  Come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry . . .
L312578 +++$+++ u6039 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Your lip's stopped bleeding, too, George.
L312577 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Well, that's the doggonedest thing . . . I haven't heard anything out of that ear since I was a kid. Must have been that jump in the cold water.
L312575 +++$+++ u6039 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ You've never been born. You don't exist. You haven't a care in the world.
L312574 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What did you say?
L312573 +++$+++ u6039 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Oh, you mustn't say things like that. You . . .  . . . wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's an idea.  What do you think? Yeah, that'll do it. All right.  You've got your wish. You've never been born.
L312572 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I said I wish I'd never been born.
L312571 +++$+++ u6039 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ What'd you say?
L312569 +++$+++ u6039 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Now look, you mustn't talk like that. I won't get my wings with that attitude. You just don't know all that you've done. If it hadn't been for you . . .
L312568 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive.
L312567 +++$+++ u6039 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Oh, tut, tut, tut.
L312566 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting. Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.
L312565 +++$+++ u6039 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Oh, no, no. We don't use money in Heaven.
L312564 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?
L312563 +++$+++ u6039 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ By letting me help you.
L312562 +++$+++ u6039 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Oh, I've got to earn them, and you'll help me, won't you?
L312561 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I don't know whether I like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings.
L312560 +++$+++ u6039 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ I haven't won my wings yet. That's why I'm an angel Second Class.
L312559 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?
L312558 +++$+++ u6039 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ I told you –– I'm your guardian angel. I know everything about you.
L312557 +++$+++ u6039 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Ridiculous of you to think of killing yourself for money. Eight thousand dollars.
L312556 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
L312555 +++$+++ u6039 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ That's what I was sent down for. I'm your guardian angel.
L312553 +++$+++ u6039 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Angel, Second Class.
L312552 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Odbody . . . A-S-2. What's that A-S-2?
L312551 +++$+++ u6039 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.
L312550 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Well, who are you, then?
L312549 +++$+++ u6039 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Oh, no.
L312548 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What are you, a mind reader or something?
L312547 +++$+++ u6039 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Oh, I know all about you. I've watched you grow up from a little boy.
L312540 +++$+++ u6039 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Suicide.
L312539 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Go through with what?
L312538 +++$+++ u6039 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Well, I did, didn't I? You didn't go through with it, did you?
L312537 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You what? To save me?
L312334 +++$+++ u6040 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE'S VOICE +++$+++ Yes, but George . . .
L312333 +++$+++ u6049 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ JOSEPH'S VOICE +++$+++ . . . two of them as they were about to crash into a transport full of soldiers.
L312318 +++$+++ u6040 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE'S VOICE +++$+++ No!
L312317 +++$+++ u6049 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ JOSEPH'S VOICE +++$+++ Now, you've probably already guessed that George never leaves Bedford Falls.
L311983 +++$+++ u6040 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE'S VOICE +++$+++ Yes, but what happened to George?
L311982 +++$+++ u6049 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ JOSEPH'S VOICE +++$+++ That's right. Not only that, but he gave his school money to his brother Harry, and sent him to college. Harry became a football star –– made second team All American.
L311981 +++$+++ u6040 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE'S VOICE +++$+++ I know. I know. He didn't go.
L311744 +++$+++ u6049 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ JOSEPH'S VOICE +++$+++ Well, wait and see.
L311743 +++$+++ u6040 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE'S VOICE +++$+++ Did he ever marry the girl? Did he ever go exploring?
L311742 +++$+++ u6049 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ JOSEPH'S VOICE +++$+++ Not a soul.
L311741 +++$+++ u6040 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE'S VOICE +++$+++ It's a good face. I like it. I like George Bailey. Tell me, did he ever tell anyone about the pills?
L311740 +++$+++ u6049 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ JOSEPH'S VOICE +++$+++ That's the kid.
L311739 +++$+++ u6040 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE'S VOICE +++$+++ Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist.
L311738 +++$+++ u6049 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ JOSEPH'S VOICE +++$+++ George Bailey.
L311737 +++$+++ u6040 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE'S VOICE +++$+++ Who is it?
L311736 +++$+++ u6049 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ JOSEPH'S VOICE +++$+++ I want you to take a good look at that face.
L311735 +++$+++ u6040 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE'S VOICE +++$+++ What did you stop it for?
L311640 +++$+++ u6049 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ JOSEPH'S VOICE +++$+++ That's him when he was twelve, back in 1919. Something happens here you'll have to remember later on.
L311639 +++$+++ u6040 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE'S VOICE +++$+++ A boy?
L311638 +++$+++ u6049 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ JOSEPH'S VOICE +++$+++ That's your problem, George Bailey.
L311637 +++$+++ u6040 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE'S VOICE +++$+++ Hey, who's that?
L311636 +++$+++ u6040 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE'S VOICE +++$+++ Oh, wonderful!
L311635 +++$+++ u6049 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ JOSEPH'S VOICE +++$+++ If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.
L311634 +++$+++ u6040 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE'S VOICE +++$+++ Why, yes. This is amazing.
L311633 +++$+++ u6049 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ JOSEPH'S VOICE +++$+++ Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your wings yet. Now look, I'll help you out. Concentrate. Begin to see something?
L311632 +++$+++ u6040 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE'S VOICE +++$+++ Where? I don't see a thing.
L311631 +++$+++ u6049 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ JOSEPH'S VOICE +++$+++ Well, keep your eyes open. See the town?
L311630 +++$+++ u6040 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE'S VOICE +++$+++ Well, naturally. Of course.
L311629 +++$+++ u6049 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ JOSEPH'S VOICE +++$+++ If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?
L311628 +++$+++ u6040 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE'S VOICE +++$+++ Sit down? What are . . .
L311627 +++$+++ u6049 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ JOSEPH'S VOICE +++$+++ Poor George . . . Sit down.
L311626 +++$+++ u6040 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE'S VOICE +++$+++ Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.
L311625 +++$+++ u6044 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ FRANKLIN'S VOICE +++$+++ Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings.
L311624 +++$+++ u6040 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE'S VOICE +++$+++ The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
L311623 +++$+++ u6044 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ FRANKLIN'S VOICE +++$+++ What's that book you've got there?
L311622 +++$+++ u6040 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE'S VOICE +++$+++ Sir . . . If I should accomplish this mission –– I mean –– might I perhaps win my wings? I've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir –– and people are beginning to talk.
L311621 +++$+++ u6044 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ FRANKLIN'S VOICE +++$+++ You will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey.
L311620 +++$+++ u6040 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE'S VOICE +++$+++ Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've only got an hour to dress. What are they wearing now?
L311619 +++$+++ u6044 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ FRANKLIN'S VOICE +++$+++ No, worse. He's discouraged. At exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift.
L311618 +++$+++ u6040 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE'S VOICE +++$+++ Splendid! Is he sick?
L311617 +++$+++ u6044 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ FRANKLIN'S VOICE +++$+++ Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.
L311616 +++$+++ u6040 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ CLARENCE'S VOICE +++$+++ You sent for me, sir?
L312651 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I know that girl!
L312650 +++$+++ u6041 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ COP +++$+++ I know. I know.
L312649 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Hey, Violet!  Hey, listen –– that's Violet Bick!
L312648 +++$+++ u6041 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ COP +++$+++ They went out of business years ago.
L312647 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ The Bailey Building and Loan. It was up there.
L312646 +++$+++ u6041 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ COP +++$+++ The Building and what?
L312645 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Hey . . . hey. Where did the Building and Loan move to?
L311979 +++$+++ u6042 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ DR. CAMPBELL +++$+++ You can keep him on. That's all right. As secretary you can hire anyone you like.
L311978 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy . . .
L311977 +++$+++ u6042 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ DR. CAMPBELL +++$+++ That's the best part of it. They've appointed George here as executive secretary to take his father's place.
L311976 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What's that?
L311955 +++$+++ u6042 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ DR. CAMPBELL +++$+++ It was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization.
L311954 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Thank you very much.
L311947 +++$+++ u6042 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ DR. CAMPBELL +++$+++ Now we come to the real purpose of this meeting –– to appoint a successor to our dear friend, Peter Bailey.
L311946 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Thanks.
L311945 +++$+++ u6042 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ DR. CAMPBELL +++$+++ I want the Board to know that George gave up his trip to Europe to help straighten things out here these past few months. Good luck to you at school, George.
L312662 +++$+++ u6043 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ ERNIE +++$+++ Well, this house ain't been lived in for twenty years.
L312661 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Of course it's the place.
L312660 +++$+++ u6043 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ ERNIE +++$+++ Is this the place?
L312659 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Okay. Just step on it. Just get me home.
L312658 +++$+++ u6043 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ ERNIE +++$+++ Look, bud, what's the idea? I live in a shack in Potter's Field and my wife ran away three years ago and took the kid . . . And I ain't never seen you before in my life.
L312656 +++$+++ u6043 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ ERNIE +++$+++ All right.
L312655 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yeah –– yeah –– hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
L312654 +++$+++ u6043 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ ERNIE +++$+++ Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore? . . .
L312653 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Aw, now, doggone it, Ernie, don't you start pulling that stuff. You know where I live. Three-twenty Sycamore. Now hurry up.
L312142 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Oh, look at this. Champagne!
L312141 +++$+++ u6043 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ ERNIE +++$+++ Bert, the cop, sent this over. He said to float away to Happy Land on the bubbles.
L312140 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Hey, look! Somebody's driving this cab.
L312139 +++$+++ u6043 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ ERNIE +++$+++ If either of you two see a stranger around here, it's me.
L311765 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Hi, Bert.
L311764 +++$+++ u6043 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ ERNIE +++$+++ Hiya, George!
L311763 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Hey, Ernie!
L312344 +++$+++ u6049 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ JOSEPH'S VOICE +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L312343 +++$+++ u6044 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ FRANKLIN'S VOICE +++$+++ Joseph, now show him what happened today.
L312342 +++$+++ u6049 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ JOSEPH'S VOICE +++$+++ On V-J Day he wept and prayed again.
L311615 +++$+++ u6044 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ FRANKLIN'S VOICE +++$+++ Yes, but he's got the faith of a child –– simple. Joseph, send for Clarence.
L311614 +++$+++ u6049 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ JOSEPH'S VOICE +++$+++ Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit.
L311613 +++$+++ u6044 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ FRANKLIN'S VOICE +++$+++ Oh –– Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along.
L311612 +++$+++ u6049 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ JOSEPH'S VOICE +++$+++ That's why I came to see you, sir. It's that clock-maker's turn again.
L311611 +++$+++ u6044 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ FRANKLIN'S VOICE +++$+++ George Bailey. Yes, tonight's his crucial night. You're right, we'll have to send someone down immediately. Whose turn is it?
