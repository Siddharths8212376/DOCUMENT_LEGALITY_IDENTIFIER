L568645 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ I'm never going back!
L568643 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I'd pay you. If you would go to Italy and persuade my son to come home. I'd pay you $1000.
L568642 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ What?
L568641 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Could you ever conceive of going there, Tom, and bringing him back?
L568634 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Marge! You've got to hear this!
L568633 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I met him in New York.
L568632 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him?
L568631 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Jazz, let's face it, it's just an insolent noise.
L568630 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Stop! It's too much! You're making all the hairs on my neck stand up!
L568629 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I like to sail, believe me, I love to sail! Instead I make boats and other people sail them.
L568628 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ What? What's this?
L568627 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Now? Okay. Wait a minute. Talent --  The only talent my son has is for cashing his allowance.
L568626 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression.
L568625 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Forging signatures. Telling lies. Impersonating practically anybody.
L568622 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Sure.
L568621 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Can you mix a martini?
L568620 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I'm intruding.
L568616 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ No, still here.
L568615 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Who? Oh, Tom, hello, how are you? We thought you'd disappeared. We were going to send out a search party.
L568598 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ That's funny.
L568597 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ You know, a primer.
L568596 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Say again?
L568595 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ It's just an undercoat. 
L568594 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Passing through! You're so white. Did you ever see a guy so white, Marge? Gray, actually.
L568593 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Nothing. Nothing much. Passing through.
L568590 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Ripley. Hullo. How do you do.
L568589 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Princeton is like a fog, America's like a fog.  This is Marge Sherwood. Tom -- sorry, what was it?
L568588 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must have known me.
L568587 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Okay.  And did we know each other?
L568586 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together.
L568585 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Who's this?
L568816 +++$+++ u3118 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ FREDDIE +++$+++ Aye, aye.
L568815 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Marge-maintenance.
L568814 +++$+++ u3118 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ FREDDIE +++$+++ What are you doing?
L568813 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Just point her at Capri and avoid the rocks.
L568812 +++$+++ u3118 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ FREDDIE +++$+++ Sure.
L568811 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Do you think you can steer this thing?
L568810 +++$+++ u3118 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ FREDDIE +++$+++ I don't think so. Come back with me to Rome. There's this great new club. Have some drinks, lotta ladies...
L568809 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Come on, Frederico, do you really have to go back? At least stick around for the Festival of the Madonna.
L568781 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Listen, just take one of mine when we get back. Don't worry about it. I did the Forum with Marge and, frankly, once is enough in anyone's life.
L568780 +++$+++ u3118 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ FREDDIE +++$+++ Dick -- you've got to hear this!
L568771 +++$+++ u3118 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ FREDDIE +++$+++ Hey, if I'm late, think what her husband's saying!
L568770 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ This is Tom Ripley. Freddie Miles.
L568769 +++$+++ u3118 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ FREDDIE +++$+++ Ciao bello.  Don't you want to fuck every woman you see. Just once.
L568768 +++$+++ u3117 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ DICKIE +++$+++ Frederico!
L569050 +++$+++ u3118 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ FREDDIE +++$+++ Is it on "delle Croce, just off the Corso"? You're a quick study, aren't you? Last time you didn't know your ass from your elbow, now you're giving me directions. That's not fair, you probably do know your ass from your elbow. I'll see you.
L569049 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself. Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the Corso.
L569048 +++$+++ u3118 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ FREDDIE +++$+++ What? I think I'm saying it. Something's going on. He's either converted to Christianity -- or to something else.
L569047 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Freddie, do you have something to say?
L569046 +++$+++ u3118 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ FREDDIE +++$+++ Have you done something to your hair?
L569045 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Hardly.
L569044 +++$+++ u3118 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ FREDDIE +++$+++ In fact the only thing which looks like Dickie is you.
L569043 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ You should watch that!
L569042 +++$+++ u3118 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ FREDDIE +++$+++ Did this place come furnished? It doesn't look like Dickie. Horrible isn't it? -- so bourgeois.
L569041 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ No. No, I'm staying here for a few days, in Rome. That's a new piano, so you prob --
L569040 +++$+++ u3118 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ FREDDIE +++$+++ No thanks.  Some kid at the American Express Office.  Are you living here?
L569039 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ How did you find him? It's such an out of the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?
L569038 +++$+++ u3118 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ FREDDIE +++$+++ Which is horseshit. Have you heard him play that thing?  He can't.
L569037 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Of course, he's been very involved in his music, hasn't he? I think his theory is, you know, you have to go into a cocoon before you can become a butterfly.
L569036 +++$+++ u3118 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ FREDDIE +++$+++ He was supposed to come skiing. I didn't get a cable or a call or a note or, frankly, a fart.
L569035 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ What about Christmas?
L569034 +++$+++ u3118 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ FREDDIE +++$+++ Because he's been hiding from me -- what happened at Christmas?
L569033 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I can't think why you would imagine Dickie would hide from you.
L569032 +++$+++ u3118 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ FREDDIE +++$+++ The landlady -- as far as I could tell, the landlady said he was here right now.
L569031 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I guess.
L569030 +++$+++ u3118 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ FREDDIE +++$+++ I don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm. If you said he was still at lunch I'd believe you. Incredible. The guy has disappeared off the face of the earth.
L569029 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?
L569028 +++$+++ u3118 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ FREDDIE +++$+++ Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?
L569027 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley.
L569025 +++$+++ u3118 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ FREDDIE +++$+++ It's Freddie. Let me in.
L569024 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Who is it?
L569023 +++$+++ u3118 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ FREDDIE +++$+++ Dickie?
L569022 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Hello?
L569290 +++$+++ u3119 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ HERBERT GREENLEAF +++$+++ No, he should talk to you alone.
L569289 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ We could go down to the bar -- no need for you to --
L569288 +++$+++ u3119 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ HERBERT GREENLEAF +++$+++ I'm going to take Marge for a little walk, Tom. Mr MacCarron wants to talk with you.
L569287 +++$+++ u3119 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ HERBERT GREENLEAF +++$+++ Perhaps you didn't mention them because there's only one conclusion to be drawn.
L569286 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ You know I feel ridiculous I didn't mention them yesterday -- I clean forgot -- ridiculous.
L569285 +++$+++ u3119 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ HERBERT GREENLEAF +++$+++ Marge has been telling us about the rings.
L569284 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Hello, sir.  Marge, you should have waited, didn't Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you up?
L569283 +++$+++ u3119 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ HERBERT GREENLEAF +++$+++ Tom.
L569232 +++$+++ u3119 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ HERBERT GREENLEAF +++$+++ Well, if we all pushed him away what about him pushing us away? You've been a great friend to my son. Everything is someone else's fault. We all want to sow wild oars. Somebody's got to -- what's the word?  The moment someone confronts him he lashes out. He lashes out. You know, people always say you can't choose your parents, but you can't choose your children.
L569231 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you.
L569230 +++$+++ u3119 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ HERBERT GREENLEAF +++$+++ And his passport photo? Did you hear? To scratch out your own face like that -- can you imagine -- the frame of mind you'd have to be in?  I've thought about going to the police but I can't face it. I can't face anything anymore.
L569229 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I think it might hurt her to know.
L569228 +++$+++ u3119 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ HERBERT GREENLEAF +++$+++ No, Marge doesn't know the half of it.
L569221 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I'll try my best, sir. Obviously I'll do anything to help Dickie.
L569220 +++$+++ u3119 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ HERBERT GREENLEAF +++$+++ He's being thorough, that's all. I'm learning about my son, Tom, now he's missing. I'm learning a great deal about him. I hope you can fill in some more blanks for me. Marge has been good enough to do that, about Mongibello.
L569219 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Yes. What's the detective hoping to find in San Remo?
L569213 +++$+++ u3119 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ HERBERT GREENLEAF +++$+++ Marge, good morning. Unusual weather.
L569212 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Yes it is.
L569211 +++$+++ u3119 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ HERBERT GREENLEAF +++$+++ Far cry from New York.
L569210 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I'm well, thank you.
L569209 +++$+++ u3119 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ HERBERT GREENLEAF +++$+++ Tom. How are you? You look well.
L569208 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Mr Greenleaf.
L568549 +++$+++ u3119 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ HERBERT GREENLEAF +++$+++ Good. Now you can go for a reason.
L568548 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I've always wanted to go to Europe, sir, but...
L568547 +++$+++ u3119 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ HERBERT GREENLEAF +++$+++ Could you ever conceive of going to Italy, Tom, persuade my son to come home?  I'd pay you. I'd pay you 1000 dollars.
L568532 +++$+++ u3119 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ HERBERT GREENLEAF +++$+++ I see you were at Princeton. Then you'll most likely know our son, Dick. Dickie Greenleaf...
L568531 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.
L568530 +++$+++ u3119 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ HERBERT GREENLEAF +++$+++ Most enjoyable. Herbert Greenleaf.
L569282 +++$+++ u3119 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ HERBERT GREENLEAF +++$+++ Marge, there's female intuition, and then there are facts --
L569281 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ I don't know, I don't know, I just know it.
L569226 +++$+++ u3119 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ HERBERT GREENLEAF +++$+++ What a waste of lives and opportunities and --
L569225 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ Such as?
L569224 +++$+++ u3119 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ HERBERT GREENLEAF +++$+++ You don't want to, dear. I'd like to talk to Tom alone -- perhaps this afternoon? Would you mind? Marge, what a man may say to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to another fellow --
L569223 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ I just don't believe that!
L569222 +++$+++ u3119 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ HERBERT GREENLEAF +++$+++ This theory, the letter he left for you, the Police think that's a clear indication he was planning on doing something... to himself.
L569218 +++$+++ u3119 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ HERBERT GREENLEAF +++$+++ San Remo. The police are amateurs. Well, my boy, it's come to a pretty pass, hasn't it?
L569217 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ Where's Mr MacCarron?
L569216 +++$+++ u3119 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ HERBERT GREENLEAF +++$+++ Pretty good. Sticking with hot water.
L568948 +++$+++ u3120 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ JOAN +++$+++ One minute you people are children and the next you're getting tattooed.
L568947 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Thanks, yes, I think we did.
L568946 +++$+++ u3120 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ JOAN +++$+++ I was sure we'd met, weren't you, Ted? This is Herbert Greenleaf's boy.
L568945 +++$+++ u3120 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ JOAN +++$+++ I'm sure we've met.
L568944 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ There's room for a whole libretto on Freddie's chest.
L568943 +++$+++ u3120 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ JOAN +++$+++ Can you bear it? We hear you're a friend of Freddie's -- he has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
L568942 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Thanks so much for inviting me tonight.
L569300 +++$+++ u3121 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MACCARRON +++$+++ Three different people saw Dickie get into Freddie Miles' car. A man who won't identify himself because he was jumping someone else's wife at the time saw Dickie removing license plates from a red sports car. The Police know about this man because he happens to be a Policeman.
L569299 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I hope she never knows.
L569298 +++$+++ u3121 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MACCARRON +++$+++ Mr Greenleaf appreciates your loyalty. He really does. Marge, she's got a hundred theories, but there are a few things she doesn't know. We hope she never knows.
L569294 +++$+++ u3121 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MACCARRON +++$+++ Why do you think Dickie's father sent him to Europe in the first place? Did you know at Princeton Dickie Greenleaf half-killed a boy?
L569293 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Okay.
L569292 +++$+++ u3121 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MACCARRON +++$+++ I don't care for B.S. I don't care to hear it. I don't care to speak it.
L569291 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I could probably see my bedroom from here. I can see my house. When you see where you live from a distance it's like a dream, isn't it?
L569280 +++$+++ u3121 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MACCARRON +++$+++ Mr Ripley? I'm Alvin MacCarron.
L569279 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Is Mr Greenleaf here?
L569310 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Oh Marge.
L569309 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.
L569308 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ What?
L569307 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day?
L569306 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise --
L569305 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ What are you going to do now, Tom?
L569304 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ But I hope that note goes to New York in your purse, for a rainy day.
L569271 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ I don't believe a single word you've said.
L569270 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ It's all true.
L569269 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ I don't believe you.
L569268 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I feel as if you haven't heard anything I've been saying to you.
L569267 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ Why? When?
L569266 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I told you. He gave them to me.
L569265 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ Why do you have Dickie's rings?
L569264 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Today, for the first time, I've even wondered whether he might have killed Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody contradicted him -- well, you know that. Marge. I loved you -- you might as well know -- I loved you, and because he knew I loved you, he let you think I loved him. Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't know, maybe it's grotesque to say this now, so just write it on a piece of paper or something, and keep it in your purse for a rainy day. Tom loves me.
L569263 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ The scent you're wearing. I bought it for you, not Dickie. The thing about Dickie. So many things. The day he was late back from Rome -- I tried to tell you this -- he was with another girl. I'm not talking about Meredith, another girl we met in a bar. He couldn't be faithful for five minutes. So when he makes a promise it doesn't mean what it means when you make a promise. Or I do. He has so many realities, Dickie, and he believes them all. He lies. He lies, that's his... half the time he doesn't even realize.
L569262 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ I was looking for a needle and thread. I wasn't snooping. I was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra.
L569261 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Marge? Where are you going?
L569259 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Shut up! Shut up!
L569258 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ He promised me. I swear I'll never take off this ring until the day --
L569257 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Marge, calm down, you're being hysterical.
L569256 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.
L569255 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this.
L569254 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ Dickie promised me he would never take off this ring.
L569253 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I can explain.
L569252 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ You've got Dickie's rings.
L569251 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ What?
L569250 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ I found Dickie's rings.
L569249 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ Tom, I need to talk to you. It's urgent.
L569248 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.
L569247 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ Tom?
L569237 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ Poor man.  We were knocking on that door for ever.  I think I've broken my strap.
L569236 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ He's having an early night.
L569235 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ Did Dickie's Dad go?
L569215 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ And you, sir? Any better?
L569214 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ Very.
L569207 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ To the manner born.
L569206 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Look at me what?
L569195 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ He's American. He's already discovered Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day before he disappeared.
L569194 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ That's a terrific idea.
L569193 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
L569192 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I was looking forward to seeing him.
L569187 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ Tom.
L569186 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Hello Marge!
L569185 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ Hello Peter, so good to see you.
L569081 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ No, well go if you want to, but don't talk to the Police about my face -- they find out he hit me -- he's got a temper -- he could've hit Freddie.  Good luck, Marge. I'll catch up with you later.
L569080 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ Perhaps I shouldn't go either.
L569079 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ We passed it a few blocks back, where the police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not going to incriminate Dickie --
L569078 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ Where does Dickie live?
L569077 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Get on. I'll take you to him.
L569076 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ What?
L569075 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ My face! There was an argument. I said some things I shouldn't have. About you. About the appalling way he's treating you, all of us. And the next thing I know he's launched himself at me.  Are you getting on?
L569074 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ Dickie?
L569073 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Dickie did it.
L569072 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face?
L569071 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.
L569070 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
L569069 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Marge, when did you get here?
L569068 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ Did he kill Freddie?
L569012 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Really? That's swell. No, I was just -- you're way ahead of me! Great!
L569011 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ He was there with someone. So I suppose she must have dragged him -- that's not fair. I'm going back to Mongi. I think Dickie's coming home.  I'm going to go home.
L569010 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't drag Dickie to --
L569009 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ Dickie was at the Opera last night.
L568959 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ You were going to Venice.
L568958 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Marge, you know Dickie has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
L568957 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ Is he really not here?
L568952 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ No.  Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.
L568951 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
L568950 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Marge, how are you? What are you doing in Rome?
L568949 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ Oh my God. Tom.
L568915 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I think you're right.
L568914 +++$+++ u3122 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ MARGE +++$+++ He hates being confronted.
L568911 +++$+++ u3125 +++$+++ m204 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Search me. I guess we're abandoned.
