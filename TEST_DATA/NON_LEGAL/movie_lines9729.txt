L150853 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ She was very pretty.
L150852 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ It was right there on top. Isn't she pretty?
L150851 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Where'd you get this, darling?
L150847 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I had my breakfast while you were still asleep.
L150846 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Edward will give you your breakfast, Amy.
L150739 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Sh! Then you must keep it true. Goodnight, darling.
L150738 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ But it's already come true.
L150737 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
L150736 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I got my wish anyway.
L150735 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Well — the mother or daughter -- whichever one gave it to you. You ask Edward to go with you.
L150734 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I really don't know, but I do know that you must return the ring. You get Edward to take you up there and bring it back to the old lady.
L150733 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Are they nice?
L150732 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them.
L150731 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Do you know the people?
L150730 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ The Farren house
L150729 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ On the back street — a green house
L150728 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Someone gave it to you? Where was this old house?
L150727 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ At the old house with the voice.
L150726 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ But where did you get it, Amy?
L150725 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ That's what I wished on. Edward says it's a wishing ring -- and it is!
L150724 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Where did you get this ring?
L150723 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I made a wish today, and it came true just like Edward said it would.
L150722 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Sometimes.
L150721 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Did your wishes ever come true?
L150720 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Oh, lots of times.
L150719 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Did you ever make a wish?
L150718 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Yes, darling.
L150717 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Mommy --
L150716 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Oh, you'll remember it some time.
L150715 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me.
L150714 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ What song, dear?
L150712 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I suppose any note, no matter how sour, is a song if you hold on to it long enough.
L150711 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I wasn't saying anything. I was singing.
L150710 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ What are saying, darling?
L150616 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I can make wishes like this come true.  I'll be just like Daddy wants me to be -- play with the other children -- not sit around by myself — tell the truth --
L150615 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ But Edward, in this kind of a wish that doesn't matter.
L150613 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ You know what I wished, Daddy? I wished I could be a good girl.
L150612 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ You get your wish!
L151035 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ We've got to go on.  Amy, here, all this time, you've let your mother and father think you had forgotten that old dream life of yours. Now we find you've only kept it secret.
L151034 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Oliver, please. Let's not go on with this. The child's trembling.
L150896 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ That darn kid. I never in my life expected her to get an A in arithmetic. Math's is a practical science --- if she understands figures, she's well out of her own world of make-believe.
L150895 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ What's funny?
L150864 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ I suppose so.
L150863 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Some day I'm afraid we're going to have to tell her about Irena.
L150862 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Amy picked it off the top of that stack. Perhaps you'd better go through the whole bunch. There may be others of Irena in there.
L150861 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Where did you get it?
L150849 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Well, you know where it is.
L150848 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ I haven't had my breakfast.
L150845 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ I'm sorry. I was somewhere else. He returns to the card game.
L150844 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ It's your play.
L150843 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ What?
L150842 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Ollie.
L150839 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I thought Amy was calling. I guess not.
L150838 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ What is it, Alice?
L150691 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ I'm not shouting at you, but there's no doubt in my mind that you spoil this child!
L150690 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ You're shouting at me.
L150689 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ I'm never unfair.
L150688 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ You mean you didn't. It seems to me the least you could do. You can't just jump at conclusions that way. You're being unfair.
L150687 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Well, it seemed to me --
L150686 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Did you hear the child out?
L150683 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Amy's been lying again.
L150682 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ My, my, what a coil we're in! What's this all about?
L150588 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ But they must have.  Amy and I made them out together.  You mailed them, didn't you, Edward?
L150587 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.
L150586 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ What do you mean?
L150585 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Something's haywire,
L150584 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ That's right.
L150583 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ I think I should.  3000W?
L150582 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ All right, Ollie.  Go ahead. Call the Boyds...3000W...see if their darling Donald has left.
L150581 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ No kids yet.  Something's gone wrong. Maybe I ought to call somebody.
L150580 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Oilie, that's for the children to play with.
L150579 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Times have changed.
L150578 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Gosh, in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them,
L150577 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Yes, darling,
L150576 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ It's nearly a quarter after four. The party was for four, wasn't it?
L150575 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ It's early yet.
L150574 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Where is everybody?
L150573 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I forgot I had it on.
L150572 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile?
L150552 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Darling, no father could be nicer to a child than you are to Amy.
L150551 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ You make me sound like the father in "East Lynne."
L150550 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I know, dear.  I understand. But try to worry a little less about her -- be a little easier in your thinking.  And especially today — let's forget about it. We want a really bang-up birthday party, don't we?
L150549 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ No.  It's not that.  It's because I know what can happen when people begin to lie to themselves -- imagine things. I love Amy too much to let her lose herself in a dream world where butterflies become pals. I saw what happened to Irena with her Cat People.
L150548 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ That's why I can tell you, straight out, you think too much about Irena -- blame yourself for her death.  And its your thinking and brooding about her that makes you so unnaturally concerned about Amy.
L150547 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ I know that.
L150546 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I'm not a jealous woman, Oliver.
L150545 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ All I have to do is look at Amy's eyes, blue and deep like yours.
L150544 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ She's not Irena's child -- there's nothing of Irena in her. She's my child.
L150543 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ I'd hate her to grow up like that.
L150541 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ I'm sure I don't, Alice.  It's something else -- something moody -- something sickly --  She could almost be Irena's child.
L150540 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I wonder if you don't resent that in her?
L150539 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Well, it shows imagination, anyhow.
L150781 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ You do that, Edward.
L150780 +++$+++ u4721 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ She said something about that, Mrs. Reed — but she didn't tell me it was the Farren house. I'll get my other hat and coat and go over there.
L150779 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ But I told her to go with you.
L150778 +++$+++ u4721 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Is that where she got the ring, Mrs. Reed? She shouldn't be up there.
L150777 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ That's the Farren house.
L150776 +++$+++ u4721 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ No, she went runnin' off to some old house she was talkin' about yesterday.
L150775 +++$+++ u4718 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I thought you were with Amy.
L150967 +++$+++ u4724 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MISS CALLAHAN +++$+++ And you should.  Your mommy tells me you've been such a good girl, and your daddy is so pleased with you.
L150966 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I got lots of presents.
L150752 +++$+++ u4724 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MISS CALLAHAN +++$+++ Maybe I'll drop in and see your Mommy.
L150751 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I live right here.
L150750 +++$+++ u4724 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MISS CALLAHAN +++$+++ No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
L150749 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Are you coming to see us. Miss Callahan?
L150748 +++$+++ u4724 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MISS CALLAHAN +++$+++ Hello, Amy.
L150535 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Mommy's having a party for me. I asked Robert, and Donald, and Lois --
L150534 +++$+++ u4724 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ MISS CALLAHAN +++$+++ Your birthday, Amy --  as she goes) -- and I have something for you in my locker. A present.
L150533 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ It's late, Mommy -- you haven't forgotten my birthday party.
L151150 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Tell me tha real truth. You can see my friend, can't you?
L151149 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Yes, darling.
L151148 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Daddy?
L151138 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ She's upstairs.. .the lady who lives up there.
L151137 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ But there's no one here, darling.
L151136 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Yes, she was afraid. She said there was someone who wanted to kill me.
L151049 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ I have eyes too, and I tell you no one's there. If you deny that, if you insist that this woman you call your friend is in the garden, then I'm afraid I shall have to punish you. Do you understand?
L151048 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ But...
L151047 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Listen, darling. I want you to look once more. Take as long as you want. Look very carefully, and then I want you to tell me that no one's there.
L151046 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ But Irena is in the garden. She's right there, under the tree.
L151045 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Amy, there's nothing there. There's no one at all in the garden.
L151044 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Don't you see her?...Right there, under the tree.
L151043 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Where, Amy? Where do you see her?
L151042 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ She's there, just like I said she'd be.
L151038 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ She's there whenever I call her!
L151037 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ In the garden? Would she be there now?
L151036 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ It isn't a secret. She plays with me. She plays with me in the garden all the time. Right out there in the garden, she does!
L151033 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Because she is my friend.
L151032 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Amy, answer me. Why did you call her your friend?
L151030 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Why, daddy, you know my friend too!
L151029 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Yes, Amy?
L151028 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Daddy!
L150920 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ This one hasn't got a name on it. Who's this one for, Amy?
L150919 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ She gave me a ring, so I'm giving her a ring. I paid twenty-five cents for it, too.
L150918 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ And this one's for Mrs. Farren.
L150917 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Just you wait!
L150911 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ This one says, "To Mother from Amy."
L150910 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ These are all from me.
L150693 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ You're upset about me -- I made you fight --I hate for you to fight.
L150692 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ I'm sorry. Daddy and Mommy are a little upset.
L150685 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Voices from an old dark house!
L150684 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ No, I didn't.
L150681 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Let me be the judge of that.
L150680 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Daddy, it's true.
L150679 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Now look, this is the last time you come to me with any such stories — I'm sick of this sort of thing.
L150678 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ It was just a voice.
L150677 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ And who did the voice belong to?
L150676 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ It's true.
L150675 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Now Amy
L150674 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I did.  I came to an old dark house, and a voice called to me -- a lovely, sweet voice ---
L150673 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Why didn't you run after them?
L150672 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ They ran away.
L150671 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Because you didn't ask them?  I don't blame them for being angry. Why didn't you explain what happened?
L150670 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ It was on account of the birthday party.
L150669 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ What do you mean you didn't play with the other children?
L150668 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ But I didn't play with them, Daddy.  They wouldn't play with me.
L150667 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Can't you tell me later?
L150666 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I wanted to talk to you,  I wanted to tell you about the other children.
L150665 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ What do you want. Amy?
L150611 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ But this is different.  Go on blow,
L150610 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ But you told me in the garden-- that the wish about the tree couldn't come true.
L150609 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Certain wishes do.
L150608 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ But wishes don't come true.
L150607 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Amy, make a wish.  Wish real hard, and then blow out the candles, and your wish will come true.
L150602 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ But, Amy, that was just a story; it wasn't real.  That tree's no mailbox.
L150601 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I didn't forget.
L150600 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ But I told you about that so long ago; you couldn't have been more than three when I told you that tree was a magic mailbox.
L150599 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Yes, daddy.
L150598 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Amy, not that old tree!
L150597 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I'll show you.
L150596 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Where did you mail them?
L150595 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Yes, I did.
L150594 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Did you mail then?
L150593 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Yes, daddy.
L150592 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Amy, you remember the party invitations Edward, gave you to mail?
L150567 +++$+++ u4726 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ You'll see it when it's all lit and ready for you.
L150566 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Is that my birthday cake? May I see?
L150940 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Well, I guess we're not a very proper family.
L150939 +++$+++ u4723 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ We open ours on Christmas Eve. That's considered proper.
L150938 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ No.
L150937 +++$+++ u4723 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ My goodness, don't you open your presents until Christmas morning?

L151131 +++$+++ u4722 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ IRENA +++$+++ Death's like life. Death's a part of life. It isn't frightening. It isn't the end of everything. It isn't quiet and nothingness. It's a part of all eternity.
L151130 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ But why?
L151129 +++$+++ u4722 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ IRENA +++$+++ Yes, Amy.

L150981 +++$+++ u4722 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ IRENA +++$+++ It's a warm breath -- warm and strong — warmed by the sunlight that shone on the deer's back in the hot summer; sweet with leaves and mosses.
L150980 +++$+++ u4719 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I can sea its breath in the cold.
L150979 +++$+++ u4722 +++$+++ m313 +++$+++ IRENA +++$+++ Because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind.
