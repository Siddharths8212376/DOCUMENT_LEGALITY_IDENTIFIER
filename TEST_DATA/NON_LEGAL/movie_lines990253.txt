L480343 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ -- who is the most competitive woman in the world --
L480342 +++$+++ u7389 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ And your brother Tom is a psychology professor and is married to...Betsy --
L480341 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ -- because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't --
L480340 +++$+++ u7389 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Harold, who ran away with his secretary but came back --
L480339 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ -- who's married to --
L480338 +++$+++ u7389 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ The short one with black hair is your cousin Irene --
L481052 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I hate it.  I'm so happy, Becky.  Finally I feel happy.  This is right. This is real.  Everything else is what happens when you watch too many movies and completely lose sight of what counts.  Please don't tell anyone about what happened.  "Sleepless in Seattle" is history.
L481051 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ I love the symphony.
L481050 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
L481049 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ What are your plans in New York?
L481048 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ No, I'm not. 
L481047 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ You're going to miss the train.
L481015 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It doesn't mean anything.  It was written before I went out there.  Before the ho.
L481014 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ What about the letter?
L481013 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.
L481012 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ So he can't write.  Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble.
L481010 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Made for each other.
L481009 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ M.F.E.O.?
L481008 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ "Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter.  It was great.  We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle."
L481007 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ So I mailed your letter.
L481006 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Becky?
L481005 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, it's the same woman.  And he was crazy about her.  What is this?  This is from Seattle.
L481004 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ This is a photo of hair.
L481003 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I saw her.  She looked just like this --
L481002 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ You don't know who she was, Annie --
L481001 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It's a sign I've watched this movie too many times.  I'm so stupid.  From the minute I listen to that stupid program on the radio, I've been a complete jerk.
L481000 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ It's a sign --
L480996 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ He said hello.
L480995 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ But he saw you, right?
L480994 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ That was nothing compared to this humiliation, nothing.
L480993 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ I love that dream.
L480992 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
L480991 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ You were standing in the middle of the street?
L480984 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Good night.
L480983 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ I love you, too.
L480982 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Thank you.  I love you.
L480981 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ No.  That's the weirdest part about it.
L480980 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Is this crazy?
L480979 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ What?
L480978 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Becky?
L480977 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ Okay.  Good.  Goodbye.
L480976 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ That's not what I mean.  I'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him.  I am.
L480975 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ You told a lie and got on a plane.
L480974 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I couldn't do it.  How did I get here?
L480973 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ Did you talk to him?
L480921 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Definitely.
L480920 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
L480919 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I thought I would look into doing a story about those radio shows.
L480884 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ The kid is on.  You've got me listening to this garbage. Go on, turn it on.
L480883 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What?
L480882 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ Turn on your radio!
L480881 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Hello.
L480764 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I always wondered about that too.
L480763 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?
L480762 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I know.
L480761 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ Men never get this movie.
L480760 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Listen to this, I love this part --
L480759 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ Plus he fell in love with a temp.
L480758 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ And then you left him? He lost weight there and you left him?
L480757 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ Yes.
L480756 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ No.
L480755 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ Can too.
L480754 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ That's impossible.  A guy can't --
L480753 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ He lost all the weight... there.
L480752 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
L480751 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ You want to hear about destiny? If my husband hadn't gone on a diet, which caused me to leave him, I would never have been on that flight to Miami, and met Rick, and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says "vacant-occupied, vacant- occupied, vacant-occupied" -- 
L480750 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Good.  Perfect.  I'll be in New York with Walter, I can squeeze it in.
L480749 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ "On top of the Empire State Building at sunset on Valentine's Day."
L480748 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ "I want to meet you..."
L480747 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick.
L480746 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I don't know.  I mean, what if I never meet him? What if this man is my destiny and I never meet him?
L480745 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ What?
L480744 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I should say something in this about magic.
L480743 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ Right.
L480742 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I'm going to marry Walter.  I just have to get this out of my system.
L480741 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ You are.  You're losing your mind.  What about Walter?
L480740 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I know that.  You think I don't know that? "I know that's a dumb way to begin, but it's the only way I can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when I heard the two of you on the radio.  On the other hand, maybe I'm just losing my mind."
L480739 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ And this woman is a writer! That's what everyone writes at the beginning of letters to strangers.
L480738 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ "I am not the sort of person who listens to call-in radio shows" --
L480737 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ It sounds like the name of a mattress store --
L480736 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ "Dear Sleepless and Son..."
L480735 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ ... movie.  That's your problem.  You don't want to be in love.  You want to be in love in a movie.  Read it to me.
L480734 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ They knew it.  Time, distance, nothing could separate them. Because they knew.  It was right.  It was real.  It was...
L480733 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ You're a basket case.
L480588 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Not.
L480587 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ Oh? Oh, really? Now we're getting down to it.
L480586 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Actually, he sounded nice.
L480585 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ And now 2,000 women want his number.  The guy could be a crackhead, a psychopath, a flasher, a junkie, a transvestite, a chain-saw murderer, or someone really sick, like Rick.
L480584 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ That's what she called him on the show.  Because he can't sleep.
L480583 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ "Sleepless in Seattle"?
L480582 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Nothing's with me.
L480581 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ What's with you?
L480580 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What was what?
L480579 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ What was that about up there?
L480571 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ There's practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true --
L480570 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ It's not true, but it feels true.
L480565 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ Whatever it is.
L480564 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ About what?
L480563 +++$+++ u7374 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ You should write something about this.
L480798 +++$+++ u7376 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ DET. WHEEDLE +++$+++ You want a tail.  I got a guy in Seattle --
L480797 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ No.  Not remotely.  I just want to find out about him.
L480796 +++$+++ u7376 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ DET. WHEEDLE +++$+++ Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that movie.
L480795 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I'll tell you the truth, I heard this guy on a call-in radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because I've become obsessed with him.
L480794 +++$+++ u7376 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ DET. WHEEDLE +++$+++ A sense of humor.
L480793 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice --
L480792 +++$+++ u7376 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ DET. WHEEDLE +++$+++ So you want a financial, is he a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --
L480791 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ No, I know that part --
L480790 +++$+++ u7376 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ DET. WHEEDLE +++$+++ Do you want a matrimonial, past wives, any kids--
L480789 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ She has a pattern of getting involved with losers... Once she almost ran away with a human cannonball from the circus.
L480788 +++$+++ u7376 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ DET. WHEEDLE +++$+++ Okay.
L480787 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I need to know about him because... he's involved with my sister...
L480320 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go home.  I quit.  Laurie, I quit.  I'm going back to Baltimore.  How does a blonde do a high- five?
L480319 +++$+++ u7382 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Go home for the weekend.
L480318 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I want my money.
L480317 +++$+++ u7382 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Maybe you should see a shrink.
L480316 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I know. 
L480315 +++$+++ u7382 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ He wasn't even wrong for you, like <u>cosmically</u> wrong, so don't beat up on yourself for wasting...however long it was.
L480314 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I know.
L480313 +++$+++ u7382 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Honey, he wasn't right for you.
L481212 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Howard.
L481211 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Howard.
L481210 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Hi, Jonah.  Sam.  And who is this?
L481209 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ I'm Jonah.  That's my dad.  His name is Sam.
L481206 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yes.
L481205 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Are you Annie?
L480898 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Come on, Jonah --
L480897 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Oh God, it's major.  He's kissing her on the lips.  I have to stop this.
L480888 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ How am I going to explain this to Walter?
L480887 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ This is a complete disaster.  I wanted him to find a wife, but he's got the wrong one --
L480477 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ This is a grotesque violation of this man's personal life, but never mind --
L480476 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ Please --
L480453 +++$+++ u7381 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ JONAH +++$+++ And you crazy? He thinks shows like this are dumb.  If you didn't have an 800 number I could never get away with this --
L480452 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Perfect.  Sandbag the father.
L480700 +++$+++ u7387 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Any time.
L480699 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much better just having blown this off.
L480698 +++$+++ u7387 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Yes, I did.
L480697 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I know, I know.  I do not want to move to Seattle.  But what I really don't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something. What do you think?  It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everyone panics before they get married, didn't you?
L480696 +++$+++ u7387 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
L480695 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I don't even know him.  But I'm having all these fantasies about a man I've never met, who lives in Seattle.
L480694 +++$+++ u7387 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Annie, when you meet someone and you're attracted to them, it just means that your subconscious is attracted to their subconscious, subconsciously.  So what we think of as chemistry is just two neuroses knowing that they are a perfect match.
L480693 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ But when you met her, did you believe she was the only person for you? That in some mystical, cosmic way, it was fated?
L480692 +++$+++ u7387 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I got married because Betsy said we had to break up or get married.  So we get married.
L480691 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and --
L480690 +++$+++ u7387 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ What?
L480689 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I think I'm going crazy, Tom. I really do.  Are you happily married?
L480416 +++$+++ u7373 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ You don't believe in signs.
L480415 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It's a sign.
L480414 +++$+++ u7373 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ So you'll get married in a new dress.
L480413 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Like... clockwork.
L480412 +++$+++ u7373 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Well, fine, fine.  Fiddle da dee.  And how's it working?
L480411 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Mom, we already...
L480410 +++$+++ u7373 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --
L480409 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Mom!
L480408 +++$+++ u7373 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ I knew we would be together forever, and that everything would be wonderful, just the way you feel about Walter. Walter.  It's quite a formal name, isn't it?  One of the things I truly knew was that your father and I were going to have a wonderful time ... in the sack I believe you call it --
L480407 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Magic.
L480406 +++$+++ u7373 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Magic.  It was magic.
L480405 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What?
L480404 +++$+++ u7373 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ You know.
L480403 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What?
L480402 +++$+++ u7373 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ I was in Atlantic City with my family.  Cliff was a waiter. He talked me into sneaking out for a midnight walk on the Steel Pier.  I've probably told you this a million times, but I don't care.  And then he held my hand.  I was scared.  All sorts of thing were going through my head.  But after a while I forgot about them.  At one point I looked down, at our hands, and I couldn't tell which fingers were mine and which were his.  And I knew.
L480401 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It wasn't a sign.  It was a coincidence.
L480400 +++$+++ u7373 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?
L480399 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, please.  Destiny's just something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental.
L480398 +++$+++ u7373 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Destiny takes a hand.
L480397 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It is, isn't it? You make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life.
L480396 +++$+++ u7373 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ How amazing.
L480395 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It's silly, really.  I mean, I'd seen him at the office, obviously I'd seen him, he's the associate publisher, and then one day we both ordered sandwiches from the same place, and he got my lettuce and tomato sandwich on whole wheat, which of course he was allergic to, and I got his lettuce and tomato on white.
L480394 +++$+++ u7373 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ How did it happen?
L480393 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You'll love them.  We're going down to D.C.  tonight to be with them Christmas morning.

L480388 +++$+++ u7373 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ The Historical Society wanted this and I never would give it to them --
L480358 +++$+++ u7373 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ We'll move them --
L480357 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It's probably just the flowers --

L481045 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Hi.  So far so good.  So.  What should we talk about? How insecure we were in high school.  Shirley Votypka, the first girl I ever felt up. Health.  What about health? Did you know that eating six macadamia nuts is the equivalent of eating a steak?
L481044 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Hi.
L480989 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Hello.
L480988 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Hello.
L480524 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Magic.
L480523 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Magic.
L480522 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You touch her for the first time, and suddenly... you're home.  It's almost like...
L480487 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Sure you do --
L480486 +++$+++ u7372 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Sure you do.

L480608 +++$+++ u7375 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Sam, if you're not doing anything New Year's -- obviously you're not doing anything New Year's -- we're having some people over, all of them married, not one even remotely interested in playing around.  Does that sound great or what?  I can't think of the last time I was at a party when anything actually happened.
L480599 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Why me? What about Jay?
L480598 +++$+++ u7375 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ The point is, take the client out to dinner and ask her to marry you and then maybe we won't have to redo the kitchen cabinets.
L480597 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Grace the dispatcher.  Great.
L480596 +++$+++ u7375 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Grace heard it.
L480595 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Great.  This is great.  The whole town knows.  Just out of curiosity, how do you two know?
L480592 +++$+++ u7384 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ The cabinets have to be redone --
L480591 +++$+++ u7375 +++$+++ m499 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Which means --
