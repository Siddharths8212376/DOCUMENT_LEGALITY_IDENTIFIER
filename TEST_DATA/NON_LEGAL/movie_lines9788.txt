L190341 +++$+++ u5083 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ You always say that.  Then you go to work and forget you promised.
L190340 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ We'll work out the roller hockey thing, okay?  Whatever you want, we'll work it out. I promise.
L190338 +++$+++ u5083 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ I'm gonna go live with George.
L190337 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ God damn it, Matthew.  What the hell are you doing out here?
L190227 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Well, God damn it, Matthew -- Randy's mom doesn't work eighteen-hour days, and Randy's dad didn't leave her, so figuring out who's gonna take who where is a little easier over at Randy's house.
L190226 +++$+++ u5083 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Randy's mom said yes right away.
L190225 +++$+++ u5083 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ When?
L190224 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ We'll see.
L190223 +++$+++ u5083 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Can I play roller hockey?
L189867 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Thank God we got you away from her, huh?
L189866 +++$+++ u5083 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Yeah.
L189858 +++$+++ u5083 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Well I hate it.
L189857 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ There's no way a son of mine hates Funky Town.  It's impossible.
L190285 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ That's all you got, lady.  Two wrong feet. In fucking ugly shoes.
L190284 +++$+++ u5089 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ THERESA +++$+++ Okay, look -- I think we got off on the wrong foot here --
L190282 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Annabelle Daniels.  714-454-9346.
L190281 +++$+++ u5089 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ THERESA +++$+++ Annabelle Daniels.
L190280 +++$+++ u5089 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ THERESA +++$+++ You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart.
L190279 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?
L190278 +++$+++ u5089 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ THERESA +++$+++ Everyone's.  This is a lawsuit.  We need to be able to contact the plaintiffs.
L190277 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Whose number do you need?
L190276 +++$+++ u5089 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ THERESA +++$+++ Erin.  You don't even have phone numbers for some of them.
L190275 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot, okay?  I may not have a law degree, but I've spent 18 months on this case, and I know more about those plaintiffs than you ever will.
L190274 +++$+++ u5089 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ THERESA +++$+++ No offense.  There are just some things we need that you probably didn't know to ask.
L190273 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Excuse me -- Theresa, was it?  There are no holes in my research.
L190272 +++$+++ u5089 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ THERESA +++$+++ Yeah, we had them couriered over.  And listen, good work.  They're a great start. We're just going to have to spend a little time filling in the holes in your research.
L190271 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Hey -- those are my files --
L190450 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I will.  Bye.
L190449 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Promise you'll turn around if you get tired.
L190435 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ We'll just be a minute.  Get a little more sleep.
L190434 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ No, I need my car --
L190433 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Real early.  We're just gonna take your car to get some breakfast.
L190432 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ What time is it?
L190424 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Yeah, but I'm gonna get better.  A lot of these folks aren't.
L190423 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You shouldn't be driving around, you know. You're sick.
L190422 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ You know me.  I pick things up real fast.
L190421 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Think you could learn?
L190418 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yeah, well -- good help is hard to find.
L190417 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ And I miss you.
L190416 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I don't know.  Few days.  Thanks for helping me.  I appreciate it.
L190415 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ How long's this whole thing gonna take?
L190414 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Hunh-uh.  Not yet.  Look, don't take any of 'em on your bike, okay?  Call a cab if you wanna go somewhere.
L190413 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ They up?
L190411 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ It's not for me; it's for my kids.  You're the only one I trust them with.
L190410 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I don't do favors for you anymore.
L190409 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Hi.  It's me.  I got a favor to ask you.
L190408 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Hello?
L190357 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Mm-hm.
L190356 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Thank you.
L190355 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Fine.  I'll drop 'em off tomorrow afternoon.
L190354 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ They said that'd be tomorrow.  They just wanna keep an eye on me another night.
L190203 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I pretty much knew what your answer was gonna be.
L190202 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ You already packed up your stuff?
L190200 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I need it.
L190199 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ More than you need me.
L190198 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I can't.  Look -- this job -- it's the best thing that ever happened to me.  I mean it. For the first time in my life, I got people respecting me.  Up in Hinkley, I walk into a room and everyone shuts up just to hear what I got to say.  I never had that.  Ever. Don't ask me to give it up.  I need it.
L190197 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yeah, you can.  You could just quit.  People do it all the time.
L190196 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I can't leave my job, George.
L190195 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I know.  But still.  Six months.  I think you oughta either find a different job or a different boyfriend.  Cause there may be men who don't mind being the maid and getting nothing in return, but I'm sure as shit not one of 'em.
L190194 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I'm sorry.  I'm just working so hard --
L190193 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ It's a pair of earrings.  I saw 'em in the mall one day, and I thought, damn, those would look good on those beautiful earlobes. So I bought 'em.  And I said to myself, next time Erin says something nice, does something nice, I'll surprise her with 'em.  Know how long ago that was?  Six months.  In six months, you haven't said one nice thing to me.  That's a long time.
L190192 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ What's that?
L190191 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ About this.
L190190 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ About what?
L190189 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Thinking.
L190188 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ What's going on?  What are you doing?
L190141 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Bull<u>shit</u>, Erin.  Bullshit.
L190140 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ That is not what I'm --
L190139 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Fuck you.  Just cause I don't spend all day trying to prove what hot shit I am --
L190138 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ What do you want to talk about instead? <u>Your</u> day?  That's a fascinating subject.
L190137 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ It wouldn't kill you to talk about something other than yourself and your own fucking job once in a while --
L190132 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ No, I wanna say hi.
L190131 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Lock the door.
L190130 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ That's Ed.
L190122 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Cause it's my office party.  If you had an office, I'd go to your party.
L190121 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'm just saying -- we have one night to ourselves, why do we have to spend it here?
L190069 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Just a few more minutes, then we can go.  Take her, will you?
L190068 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'm bored, and so are the kids.
L190062 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yeah.  We were sitting around at lunch and she pointed at a ball and said, "ball."
L190061 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ What?  Beth?  My Beth?
L190060 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Well, come to think of it, we did have a big event around here.  Beth started talking.
L190059 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ No, no jokes, I gotta pee.  Just tell me about your day.  What went on back there?
L190058 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What do you want, a joke?
L190057 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I'm so tired I'm about to drive off the road.  Keep me awake, willya?
L190052 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I know what they can sleep through, Erin.  I probably know it better than you.
L190051 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Keep your voice down.
L190050 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Cause I can get a job.  I will.  And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again.  Would that make you happy?
L190049 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I didn't say that.
L190048 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ If you got a problem with me taking care of your kids instead of getting some job, just say so.
L190047 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Nothing.
L190046 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You mind telling me what that's supposed to mean?
L190045 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ How would you know?
L190044 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ It doesn't have to be this complicated, Erin.  There's a lot of jobs out there.
L190043 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ No, see -- that's exactly what those arrogant PG&E fucks want me to think -- that because they got all this money and power, we don't stand a chance in hell against them.  But you know what?  They're wrong.
L190042 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Look, don't take this the wrong way, but don't you think you might be out of your league here?
L190041 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I'm not in danger.  I have a dead bolt. Remember?
L190040 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Come on, Erin.  A job's supposed to pay your bills, not put you in danger.
L190039 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I'm not gonna quit cause of one creepy phone call, George.
L190027 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I know what you're saying, and I don't wanna hear it.  I am doing the best I can.
L190026 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'm just saying --
L190025 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh? They're scarred for life.  They're gonna start holding up 7-11's any day now.
L190024 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ One toy per kid is doing something nice. Four is ... something else.
L190023 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ George, I am just trying to do something nice for my kids on my one day off.  Could you please not give me a hard time about it?
L189818 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You're someone to me.  You're someone real special to me.
L189817 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ No I'm not.  Look at me.  I'm not.
L189816 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You are someone.
L189815 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Well, I'm sure as hell not what I thought I was gonna be.  I was supposed to have one of those great lives, with everything all laid- out and perfect.  I mean, hell -- I was Miss Wichita, for God's sakes.  Did I tell you that?  You live next door to a real live beauty queen.  I still got the tiara.  I kept it cause I thought it meant something.  I thought it meant I was gonna do something great with my life.  I thought it proved I was gonna grow up to be someone.
L189814 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You're not nothing, Erin.
L189813 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Doesn't matter.  Doesn't make one bit of difference.  Oh God, George, how'd this happen to me? How'd I end up so ... so <u>nothing</u>?
L189812 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What?  But you been working so hard --
L189811 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I <u>can't</u> call an exterminator.  I can't afford one.  God, I can't even afford my <u>phone</u>.  I got fired.
L189810 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ It's a simple thing.  Everybody gets them. All we gotta do is call an exterminator.
L189809 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ What kind of person lives like this?  Huh? What kind of person lets her kids run around in a house crawling with bugs the size of housecats?
L189799 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'm gonna clean it up.
L189798 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Great.
L189796 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Fixing a leak under your sink.
L189795 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L189720 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What do you mean?
L189719 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ You think it could make you sick, living in a place like this?
L189718 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I guess we get what we pay for, huh?
L189717 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Thanks for reminding me.
L189716 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'm gonna put a dead bolt on your front door, too.  This isn't exactly the safest neighborhood in the world, you know.
L189714 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Better safe than sorry.
L189713 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ What're you doing?
L189654 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yeah, we'll just see about that, won't we?
L189653 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ This isn't gonna get you laid, you know.
L189652 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yup.  Usually working on my bike.  No big deal.  If it doesn't work out, you can send 'em back to the chicken fat lady.
L189651 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ You're around every afternoon?
L189649 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Right.
L189648 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Cause I like kids.  I like hanging out with them.
L189647 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids?
L189646 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Then lemme remind you, the polite thing is to say, thank you, that's a real nice offer, I don't mind taking you up on it.
L189645 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ It's been a while.  Maybe I'm just out of practice.
L189644 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you?
L189643 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I hope that's not supposed to impress me.
L189642 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I do construction, which pays real good. And I make it last by living cheap.
L189641 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Yeah?  And what do you do the rest of the time, live off your trust fund?
L189640 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'm not a deadbeat.  I work when I need to.
L189639 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Great.  Another deadbeat.
L189638 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I was serious before, you know.  If you need someone to keep an eye on them -- after school or something -- I don't have a job now, so I'm around in the afternoons.
L189637 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I'm never here.  I gotta leave 'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat.
L189636 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ How?
L189635 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Yeah.  I'm probably ruining them.
L189627 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yeah, and whose fault is that?
L189626 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Cause I don't even know you.
L189625 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Why not?
L189624 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I'm not gonna leave my kids with you.
L189623 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You need help with your kids?  I could probably do that.
L189622 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I had a good neighbor, George.  She was 60 and Mexican and she watched my kids for free.  Something tells me you're not gonna be able to measure up to that.
L189620 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Return 'em.  Maybe you'll get your money back.
L189619 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ C'mon.  I bought 'em for you, to make up for that night.
L189618 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ No.
L189597 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Yeah.  Sexy, huh?  And here's another: five. That's how old my other daughter is.  Seven is my son's age.  Two is how many times I been married and divorced.  You getting all this?  16 is the number of dollars in my bank account.  454-3943 is my phone number. And with all the other numbers I gave you, I'm guessing zero is the number of times you're gonna call it.
L189596 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You got a little girl?
L189595 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Sure.  That's one of my numbers.  It's how many months old my little girl is.
L189594 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Ten?
L189593 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Shit, yeah.  I got numbers coming out of my ears.  Like, for instance, ten.
L189592 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You got more than one?
L189591 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Which number do you want, George?
L189590 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I do.
L189589 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ You want my number?
L189587 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Now, don't be like that.  Tell you what. How about if I take you out on a date to apologize for my rudeness?
L189586 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Just think of me as the person next door who likes it quiet, and we'll get along fine.
L189585 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Ooh, now, see, if I'da known there was a beautiful woman next door, I'da done this different.  Let's start over.  My name's George.  What's yours?
L189584 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Well, I'm the neighbors.  There, now we're introduced, so you can shut the fuck up.
L189583 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Just introducing myself to the neighbors.
L189582 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ What the hell do you think you're doing, making all that Goddamn noise?
L189581 +++$+++ u5078 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Well, hello to you, darlin'.
L190086 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ A lot.  But you hang in there, maybe you'll get one.
L190085 +++$+++ u5081 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I thought if I could spend that kinda money on a car, it'd mean everything else was fine.  I don't even know how much they cost.
L190084 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Jaguar's a darn pretty car.
L190083 +++$+++ u5081 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Know what I always thought I wanted outta life, Erin?  A Jaguar.
L190082 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I'm real sorry, Laura.
L190081 +++$+++ u5081 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ It's just -- the pain.  It's only getting worse.  I can't be a good wife.  I can't be a good mother.
L190080 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ That's okay.  I understand.
L190079 +++$+++ u5081 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I'm embarrassed.
L190210 +++$+++ u5079 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ You're clever.  I'm sure you'll think of something.
L190209 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Now how'm I supposed to do that when I'm not in here most mornings and nights?
L190208 +++$+++ u5079 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I moved payroll onto the computer.  It only knows to process paychecks for employees who log on in the morning and off at night.
L190207 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ What?
L190206 +++$+++ u5079 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Have you been logging on?
L190205 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Where's my paycheck?
L189788 +++$+++ u5079 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ <u>Excuse me</u>?
L189787 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I am not talking to you, bitch.
L189786 +++$+++ u5079 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Yes.  It's called accountability.
L189785 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ What am I supposed to do, check in every two seconds?
L189779 +++$+++ u5079 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ There may be jobs where you can disappear for days at a time, but this isn't one of them.  Here, if you don't do the work, you don't get to stay.
L189778 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ What's going on?
L189777 +++$+++ u5079 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ -- toothbrush, toothpaste, and a pair of hose.  Here.
L189776 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I had photos of my kids, plus a mug --
L189775 +++$+++ u5079 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Nice to see you, Erin.  We've missed you.
L189774 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Someone stole my stuff.
L189657 +++$+++ u5079 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ What do I look like, Erin?  A library?
L189656 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I mean, it's not a problem or anything, but -- I'm just a little unclear on what those things are.  I thought maybe you'd know.
L189978 +++$+++ u5082 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ MANDY +++$+++ Well, this old neighbor of mine, Bob Linwood -- he ran the dairy on Community -- seemed like someone in his family always had a rash somewhere or other.  I just figured it was something in the genes.  And you know how it is -- you don't like to ask about things like that ...
L189977 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ Uh-huh?
L189976 +++$+++ u5082 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ MANDY +++$+++ You know that thing it says in here about rashes?
L189941 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ I'm surprised Donna didn't say anything.
L189940 +++$+++ u5082 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ MANDY +++$+++ I know.  It's an awful lot.
L189937 +++$+++ u5076 +++$+++ m336 +++$+++ ERIN +++$+++ What?
