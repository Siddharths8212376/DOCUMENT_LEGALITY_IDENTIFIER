L444273 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ I can't go back to jail.  I gotta get out of here.
L444272 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Oh no.  They're trying to blame you for the accident.  That means they must not have been able to control the replicators.
L444267 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ The head shrinker at the prison.
L444266 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Who is he?
L444260 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ On the counter.
L444259 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Did you go?
L444254 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Sort of.  We used a process similar to the vulcanization of rubber and added bulk with a chain of chloroprene elastomers.
L444253 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ You made this out of my hair?
L444252 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Like a glove.
L444251 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ That's going to fit me?
L444250 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ It's a crime fighting costume, what do you think?  It's underwear, so if you lose your clothes you'll still be decent.
L444249 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ What's that?
L444244 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Getting used to it.
L444243 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ That's pretty good.
L444226 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I was hoping you were over that. Remember to keep drinking fluids.
L444225 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ No cheese.
L444224 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I think it would be better for me to go alone.  I'm sure Sim is looking for you.  Just sit tight.  I'll bring you back a pizza.
L444223 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ I could go with you.
L444222 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Something else I want to try.
L444221 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ What did you want my hair for?
L444220 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I'm going to go out for a while.  I want to take the blood samples to a lab that has the equipment I need.
L444213 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ I don't know.
L444212 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ How far can you stretch?
L444210 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ It's still inside me?
L444209 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ The nanobot... it's not here...
L444208 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ What's wrong?
L444207 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Daniel, I didn't hear you come down...
L444206 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Uh oh.  I remember that temper.
L444193 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ No problem.
L444192 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Do you have something to bring me down?
L444191 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Probably the caffeine.
L444190 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ I feel very emotional right now.  A bit out of control.
L444189 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I'm glad you came to me for help.
L444188 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ I want you to know that I really appreciate you helping me.
L444187 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Yeah.  Old times.
L444186 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Just like old times.
L444185 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ And I don't see you sunbathing at Chernobyl!
L444184 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
L444183 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!
L444182 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ And I'm sure you thought Columbus was going to sail off the edge of the world!
L444181 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ I don't consider uncontrollable toxic waste progress!
L444180 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ You're not protecting the world, you're obstructing progress!
L444179 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ This is what I deserve for trying to protect the world from a madman and his mercenary physicists?
L444178 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Victim my ass!  You stole my security key and used it to break into my lab to do who knows what kind of damage!  Maybe this is the end of the story and you finally got what you deserved!
L444177 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Blame the victim.
L444176 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ You have no one to blame but yourself.
L444175 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Just giving credit where credit is due.
L444174 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ What's that supposed to mean?
L444173 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Means?  Oh no.  We won't know what it means until the end of the story and maybe then it won't seem quite as funny to you, Doctor Frankenstein!
L444172 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I'm sorry, Daniel, but you have to admit it's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized.  It's got to mean something.
L444171 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Oh yeah, real funny.  Yuk-yuk. Let's laugh at everything a man believes in.
L444169 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ The polymerization probably synthesized into a kind of methyl- cyanoacrylate.  So what's wrong?
L444168 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Just look at it!
L444167 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ What about it!
L444166 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Look at this!
L444165 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ What?  What's wrong?
L444164 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Susan!
L444159 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ No, no, I just feel wired!
L444158 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Is something wrong?
L444151 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ No, why?
L444150 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Lungs sound fine.  You didn't have any pre-existing physical conditions, did you?  Allergies? Infections?
L444146 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ You're the doctor.
L444145 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I think while we're waiting, we had better run some basic diagnostics on you.
L444141 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Isn't it already too late then?
L444140 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ That's right.
L444139 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ So right now there's little replicators spreading throughout Argon's lab?
L444137 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ With enough exposure, the same thing they do to everything else.
L444136 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ What do these replicators do to people?
L444135 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Three days ago it was.
L444134 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ That was an egg?
L444133 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ What happens?
L444132 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ The replicators start off like assemblers, but the replicators never stabilize.
L444126 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ The waste.
L444125 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ The problem is the by-product created by the process.
L444124 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Got it.
L444123 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ The nanobot combined your molecules with the plastic molecules in the white assembler fluid, so that on a molecular level you now have more in common with a Good Year tire than a human being.
L444122 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ That was 'simple'?
L444121 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ To put is simply, the nanobot inside you is a microscopic machine encoded with information like a strand of messenger R.N.A. that is programmed to synthesize your molecules with the polyisoprenes of the assembler fluid, rebuilding your entire organic system on a molecular level.
L444118 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ What waste?
L444117 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ The nanobot is the only thing that can stabilize the waste.
L444116 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Why do we need it?
L444115 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ If you don't want to do it this way, I can remove it surgically.
L444114 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Pills... you know how I feel about pills.
L444113 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ The nanobot is still inside you. It's programmed to exit through the urinary tract.  We need it as soon as possible, so swallow those.
L444112 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Why?
L444111 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Mostly caffeine diuretics.  Help you go to the bathroom.
L444110 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ What are these?
L444109 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ What has happened to you is nothing compared to what is going to happen to Calumet City if we don't hurry.
L444108 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ We don't?
L444107 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ We don't have time for hysterics.
L444106 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ I'm a plastic man!  A plastic man!
L444105 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Daniel!
L444104 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Oh God, please!  This can't be happening!  I can't be plastic!  A plastic man?!
L444103 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Once the subject was polymerized we were unable to reassemble the original organic structure.
L444102 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Oh no, no, no!  You've got to be able to fix me!  Please, Susan, tell me you can make me normal again!
L444101 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Then you must have at some point tried to reverse the procedure.
L444100 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Yes.
L444099 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ But you've polymerized single-celled bacteria and the fruit flies, I know you have.
L444098 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
L444097 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ You don't know?
L444096 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I don't know.
L444095 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ What happened to it?
L444094 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.
L444093 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Mouse?  What mouse?
L444092 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ ... just like the mouse.
L444090 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ The nanobot.
L444089 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ They did it to me!
L444087 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ No, something is really wrong... look!
L444086 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Sorry, Daniel, I'm a physicist, not a psychiatrist.
L444085 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Please, Susan!  I need help! Something is wrong with me!
L444084 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Daniel, what are you doing here?
L444083 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Susie!  You gotta help me!
L443988 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Susan, this is the future of America here.
L443987 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Daniel, give him the Trix.
L443978 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Am I?  Look!  Right there!  That's exactly what I am talking about.
L443977 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ You're insane.
L443976 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ You think it's a coincidence that they have all these aisles lined up like this, like a little maze! We're all lab rats running through their maze, pulling lever A or lever B, each designed to create some kind of bio-chemical dependency.  All the while they're everywhere, watching us, two-way mirrors, surveillance cameras, nodding to each other, making little notes.
L443974 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ I can't help it, Suze.  It's this place.  You know how I get in these stores.  They freak me out.  All these tiny boxes, little cans filled with eight syllable God knows what.
L443973 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I'm sorry I brought the whole thing up!  If you're gonna flip your wig --
L443972 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ All I'm saying is that the companies that have money for the kind of research you're interested in, have money because that's what they're interested in!  Money!
L443971 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ We've had this conversation already, Daniel.
L443970 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ You think the chemists that invented Agent Orange twenty years ago were in school saying, 'Boy, I really got some good ideas for a highly toxic incendiary defoliant.'  You think Oppenheimer was dreaming about mushroom clouds before the war?
L443969 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ God, Daniel, I'm not going to make Agent Orange.
L443968 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ We'll see how wonderful it is after you spend the next twenty years making Agent Orange.
L443967 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ We'll see?  What does that mean?
L443966 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Yeah, we'll see.
L443965 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ And what I love about molecular science is the way it revolutionizes how we have to think.  It unifies the entire world on a single level. Everything is completely connected. Sometimes I can really feel it, everything around us, just a small part of a whole.  It's really wonderful.
L443847 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ That's what I thought.
L443846 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Nothing really worthwhile.
L443845 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Sure.  Can I ask you one more thing? You haven't published anything in a while.  How come?
L443844 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Well, it was good to see you, Daniel, but I have to be going.
L443843 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Yeah.
L443842 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ It was a long time ago, Daniel.  We were young, different people, heading in different directions. That's all.
L443841 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Do you ever wonder what happened to us, Susie?
L443840 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Right.  You predicted it.
L443839 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ And for cleaning up oil spills.
L443838 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ I've read they're using it to repair cancer cells.
L443837 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ It already is.
L443836 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ I remember you said, nanotechnology was going to change the world.
L443835 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I guess I should be flattered.
L443834 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ I've been thinking about you a lot all these years, locked up in my cell.  I'd tear through every issue of the Midwest Science Journal looking for your latest findings, watching as you slowly worked your polymerization experiments up through single celled organisms to that holiest of holies, the fruit fly.  Exciting stuff.  I got to tell you, it really kept me going.
L443832 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ A cage by any other name would still smell like sweaty ugly men.
L443831 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Jesus, Daniel.  It wasn't Ryker's Island.  It was work camp for white collar criminals.
L443830 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ The big house.
L443829 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ The big house?
L443828 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Oh yeah.  See, Susie, a man doesn't do the hard time and just pick up where he left off.  Oh no.  The big house does things to a man.
L443827 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Is that so?
L443826 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Oh no.  Not by a long shot.  I may look like the old Daniel O'Brien, but on the inside, nothing is the same.
L443825 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Same old Daniel.
L443824 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Somebody has to.
L443822 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ You know, this and that.
L443821 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Really?  What have you been doing?
L443820 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Been out for six months now.
L443819 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ When did you...?
L443818 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ What?  No kiss?  Not even for old times sake?
L443817 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Daniel...
L444559 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ The question is, are you?
L444558 +++$+++ u2483 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SIM +++$+++ Maybe you're ready to find out if that hide of yours is bulletproof?
L444557 +++$+++ u2483 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SIM +++$+++ Oh yeah?
L444556 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ All the different ways that I could kill you.
L444449 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ An ass-beating.  Would you like yours first, Mr. Sim?
L444448 +++$+++ u2483 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SIM +++$+++ Yeah, and what might that be?
L444447 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Yeah, I have something I've been meaning to give you.
L444446 +++$+++ u2483 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SIM +++$+++ You were looking for us?
L444445 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ This is wonderfully accommodating of you all.  Now I won't have to come looking for you.
L444048 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Forget it, pissboy!  You tell Argon he can call my lawyer.
L444047 +++$+++ u2483 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SIM +++$+++ Only this ain't no tranquilizer gun. Now let's go!
L444046 +++$+++ u2483 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SIM +++$+++ That's right.
L444045 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ I get it.  You're the goon fetch boy.  The zookeeper Argon calls in when one of his guinea pigs gets loose.
L444044 +++$+++ u2483 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SIM +++$+++ Oh yes you are!
L444043 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ What?  I'm not going anywhere!
L444042 +++$+++ u2483 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SIM +++$+++ I'm real touched.  Now get your Sunday's on.  We're going for a ride.
L444041 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ You!  I remember you!
L444071 +++$+++ u2483 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SIM +++$+++ We lost him.
L444070 +++$+++ u2482 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ POPPY +++$+++ And you have him?
L444069 +++$+++ u2483 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SIM +++$+++ Oh yeah, he's alive.  Technically.
L444068 +++$+++ u2482 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ POPPY +++$+++ Mr. Sim?  Do you have him?  He's alive?
L444067 +++$+++ u2483 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SIM +++$+++ Mrs. Argon?  It's Sim.
L444000 +++$+++ u2482 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ POPPY +++$+++ It's a miracle.
L443999 +++$+++ u2483 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SIM +++$+++ That's impossible.
L444606 +++$+++ u2482 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ POPPY +++$+++ Don't worry, four eyes.
L444605 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Okay, Barbie, let's get this over with.
L444602 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Get him, Daniel!  Knock his block off!
L444601 +++$+++ u2482 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ POPPY +++$+++ Icky!
L443943 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ You won't.  That's why you're whispering.
L443942 +++$+++ u2482 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ POPPY +++$+++ I could have you fired right now.
L443941 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Just one question.  Since Dr. Argon no longer has feeling below his waist, how is it that you're still able to do your job?
L443940 +++$+++ u2482 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ POPPY +++$+++ If you don't have any questions, I'll let you get back to doing your job.
L443939 +++$+++ u2482 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ POPPY +++$+++ While you remain on the staff at Argon Laboratories, your priorities will always be the same as Dr. Argon's priorities.  I imagine that is a simple enough equation for a bright girl like you to figure out.
L443938 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Look, as I have said and will continue to say, the instability of the assembler waste remains my priority --
L443937 +++$+++ u2482 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ POPPY +++$+++ Is that a threat, Dr. Bright?
L443936 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Under the circumstances, I can't fathom what makes Dr. Argon think we are ready for anything bigger.  If C.N.N., or hell, if the E.P.A. knew what was in my basement --
L443934 +++$+++ u2482 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ POPPY +++$+++ He believes that the second nanobot should be ready for testing by now.
L443933 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I am aware of Dr. Argon's frustrations.
L443932 +++$+++ u2482 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ POPPY +++$+++ I spoke to Dr. Argon this morning and he remains frustrated over the loss of the original nanobot.
L443931 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Can I help you, Mrs. Argon?
L443930 +++$+++ u2482 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ POPPY +++$+++ Vermin...
L444276 +++$+++ u2483 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SIM +++$+++ Pipe down, brain lady!  And you...
L444275 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ What in the hell?
L443922 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Yes, he might be.
