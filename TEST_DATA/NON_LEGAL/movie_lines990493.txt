L641924 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ Yes, it is.
L641923 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Oh, some years ago I heard my mother talking about it. But is it true?
L641922 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ How did you know about that?
L641918 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Nothing. I didn't say anything.
L641917 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ What do you mean?
L641916 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Only because you want it.
L641915 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.
L641914 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ I'm going to make you a nun's cake. It will make your mouth water.
L641885 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ You see, even the voice.
L641884 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.
L641883 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ How like your aunt you are, even in your walk.
L641882 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Come down.
L641881 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ My maid Ramona's daughter. She's a little animal.
L641880 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Who is she?
L641879 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ Come down here, you scamp.
L641877 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ In twenty years the grass has invaded everything. There are spiders all over the house except on the first floor. I hardly ever go out.
L641876 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ You've been neglecting the farm, Uncle.
L641873 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ No.
L641872 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ You have no feelings toward ...
L641871 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ To tell you the truth, not very much. I cannot lie. I respect you and I am grateful to you because I owe you everything materially, but otherwise ...
L641870 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ Did you have so little interest in seeing me?
L641869 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ No. Mother Superior told me to come.
L641868 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ Was that difficult to get?
L641867 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.
L641866 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ How long are you staying?
L641865 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ You'll think you're still at the convent.
L641864 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.
L641863 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ I'm well ... The bus was late, wasn't it? ... What was the journey like?
L641862 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Yes, Uncle. How are you?
L642069 +++$+++ u8795 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ It's only that ... It's all very odd, sir.
L642068 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ Don't lie. You don't believe me either.
L642067 +++$+++ u8795 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L642066 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ You believe me, don't you?
L642057 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ Tell her I lied, that I didn't take advantage of her.
L642056 +++$+++ u8795 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ But what can I say to her, sir?
L642055 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ What for? She'll only look at me that way again ... I couldn't. You go. Perhaps she'll listen to you. Try to convince her.
L642054 +++$+++ u8795 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously.
L642053 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ The way she looked at me, Ramona! She hates me now. I think I've made a great mistake. She's going away, she's going away and nothing will stop her.
L641954 +++$+++ u8795 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ But sir, what can I say to her? And why should she pay any attention to what a servant tells her?
L641953 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ Why don't you speak to her, Ramona? Women are good at that sort of thing. Think of something that will make her stay a few more days.  You are kind, Ramona! Speak to her. I know I don't need to offer you anything, but, if you're successful in this, I'll not forget you or your little girl.
L641952 +++$+++ u8795 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ Just say the word, sir, and I'll do anything.
L641951 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ Yes, yes, but there's no need to bring that up. How far are you prepared to help me?
L641950 +++$+++ u8795 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ I'd be really ungrateful, if I didn't like you, sir; you took me and my little girl in when I didn't know where to turn.
L641949 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ Sit down, woman, sit down.  You like me, don't you?
L641948 +++$+++ u8795 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ What's the matter?
L641947 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ Sit down, I'm going to need your help.
L641944 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ I have asked her but she's ungrateful. Sometimes I feel like hitting her. When I talk to her about the convent, she turns to stone.
L641943 +++$+++ u8795 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ Why don't you ask her to stay on for a few days?
L641889 +++$+++ u8795 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ Yes, sir. Good night.
L641888 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ Leave me now. You can go to bed.
L642548 +++$+++ u8794 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ POCA +++$+++ I didn't want to do it, Don Jorge. They made me ...
L642547 +++$+++ u8783 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ ENEDINA +++$+++ They told us you'd be back tomorrow ...
L642513 +++$+++ u8794 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ POCA +++$+++ Enedina's going to take a picture. So we'll have a souvenir.
L642512 +++$+++ u8783 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ ENEDINA +++$+++ Yes.
L642511 +++$+++ u8794 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ POCA +++$+++ Is it all right?
L642447 +++$+++ u8783 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ ENEDINA +++$+++ If everybody agrees, but to make a roast takes four hours.
L642446 +++$+++ u8794 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ POCA +++$+++ She won't even know.
L642445 +++$+++ u8783 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ ENEDINA +++$+++ What will the lady say?
L642384 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ Tonight, but I'll be back tomorrow afternoon.
L642383 +++$+++ u8784 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ FOREMAN +++$+++ No, sir, it's nearly six o'clock.  Okay, let's get a move on!  When are you leaving?
L642382 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ Hold on, Ramon! Is there time to make another trip?
L642327 +++$+++ u8784 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ FOREMAN +++$+++ That's good land.
L642326 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ And in the vegetable plot?
L642325 +++$+++ u8784 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ FOREMAN +++$+++ It's for wheat. We've always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables.
L642324 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ The fields have been left so long; with a good manuring anything will grow.
L642323 +++$+++ u8784 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ FOREMAN +++$+++ Have you thought of what you want planted yet?
L642306 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ Good.
L642305 +++$+++ u8784 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ FOREMAN +++$+++ That's it.
L642304 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ That's fifteen by seven?
L642303 +++$+++ u8784 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ FOREMAN +++$+++ Fifteen yards.
L642302 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ How much is that?
L642566 +++$+++ u8785 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ HOBBLY +++$+++ Quiet, my dove. Quiet, or I'll ...
L642565 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Ramona! Ramona!
L642557 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ But why? Why?
L642556 +++$+++ u8785 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ HOBBLY +++$+++ He was asking for it.
L642555 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ My God, what have you done to him!
L642301 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ That doesn't matter; I like it.
L642300 +++$+++ u8785 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ HOBBLY +++$+++ Thank you; but it's missing something.
L642299 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ It's very good.
L642279 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Do you have great devotion for the Virgin?
L642278 +++$+++ u8785 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ HOBBLY +++$+++ It won't take but a minute. It's a votive offering for a lady who was cured just when she was dying of fever. Our Lady of the Helpless granted her a favor.
L642277 +++$+++ u8785 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ HOBBLY +++$+++ Come on, miss. Just so the Virgin can be really pretty.
L642276 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Me?
L642379 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ That's life. Some people are brought together, others are separated. What can we do, if that's the way it happens?
L642378 +++$+++ u8788 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ LUCIA +++$+++ You see how much you like her?
L642377 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ Don't be a fool! Why rush away from something which couldn't happen?
L642376 +++$+++ u8788 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ LUCIA +++$+++ I think I'd better go tomorrow.
L642375 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ How in hell does it wind up?
L642372 +++$+++ u8788 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ LUCIA +++$+++ It doesn't make any difference what she is: you like her.
L642371 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ She isn't my cousin.
L642370 +++$+++ u8788 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ LUCIA +++$+++ That your cousin is more to your taste.
L642369 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ What are you thinking about?
L642368 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ You should have enough to do in this house ... Come here and listen to this.
L642367 +++$+++ u8788 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ LUCIA +++$+++ I'm bored. I'm alone all day and I don't know what to do.
L642366 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ Shouldn't I be? You, on the other hand ...
L642365 +++$+++ u8788 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ LUCIA +++$+++ You're happy, aren't you!
L642364 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ What I do every day, but I want to do it earlier.
L642363 +++$+++ u8788 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ LUCIA +++$+++ What are you going to do?
L642362 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ If you wake first, wake me up.
L642195 +++$+++ u8788 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ LUCIA +++$+++ Run and get something to mop it up with, quickly.
L642194 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ So, Ramona!
L642190 +++$+++ u8788 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ LUCIA +++$+++ Let her do what she wants. She doesn't bother us in any way. She minds her business and we ...
L642189 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ No, not mad at all: she's rotten with religion.
L642188 +++$+++ u8788 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ LUCIA +++$+++ She's mad.
L642187 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ It's Viridiana. She's getting on my nerves.
L642186 +++$+++ u8788 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ LUCIA +++$+++ Why the bad temper?
L642185 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ Nothing.
L642184 +++$+++ u8788 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ LUCIA +++$+++ What's the matter with you?
L642130 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ Why do you say that? Perhaps the young girl is a bit jealous.
L642129 +++$+++ u8788 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ LUCIA +++$+++ Not in that way; you're always looking for company.
L642578 +++$+++ u8787 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ LEPER +++$+++ That will teach you not to bother me any more, you son of a bitch.
L642577 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ Kill him.
L642576 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ Kill him and I'll tell you. If I don't keep my word, you can kill me too. There are thousands of pesetas. Kill him, idiot!
L642575 +++$+++ u8787 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ LEPER +++$+++ Where's the dough?
L642574 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ I don't want you to untie me. Kill him and then I'll give you the money.
L642572 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ There's plenty of money in this house. Piles of it.
L642571 +++$+++ u8787 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ LEPER +++$+++ Me, rich? Come on!
L642570 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ If you free me, you'll be a rich man ...
L642569 +++$+++ u8787 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ LEPER +++$+++ Maybe afterwards he'll let me ...
L642426 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ That's stupid! Plaster! It can still be used.
L642425 +++$+++ u8795 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ I don't know -- they've always been there.
L642423 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ These chairs are in good condition. With a little varnish and some new covers this one will be quite presentable.
L642422 +++$+++ u8795 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ You wouldn't be here otherwise.
L642421 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ Why?
L642420 +++$+++ u8795 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ I don't know; I can't remember. But I'm sure he loved you.
L642418 +++$+++ u8795 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ There are some curtains and drapes, but they're all very old.
L642417 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ And this chest?
L642128 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ One shouldn't be alone the whole time.  I'm not like him, am I?
L642127 +++$+++ u8795 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ I don't know, sir.
L642126 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ Why did he kill himself?
L642125 +++$+++ u8795 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ He was very good. Better than some people would think.
L642406 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Why?
L642405 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ No.
L642404 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Is she coming back?
L642403 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ She's left.
L642402 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ And ...your friend?
L642401 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ You can come and live again in the big house if you want. Now that I'm alone, I can settle down anywhere.
L642400 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Yes. Why?
L642399 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ Do you intend to stay here for some time?
L642398 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ I'll be ready.
L642397 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ Don't forget the meeting with the lawyer. The car will pick you up tomorrow morning.
L642396 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ Don't worry. Nobody's going to disturb you.
L642395 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Are they going to work here too?
L642339 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ I'm not sure yet. I've had a shock recently, and I'm only beginning to get over it. Perhaps I'll go back to the convent one day.
L642338 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
L642337 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ I know perfectly well how little I can do. What I want to do is give passing beggars a roof, some food, and a bit of human warmth.
L642336 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ There's no point in helping some of them when there are so many others.
L642335 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ They worry me a great deal, and especially because of you.
L642334 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Do they worry you that much, then?
L642333 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ You won't get much done with those people. Those times are over! You ought to let me kick them out.
L642332 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Leave him alone.
L642331 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ What are you doing here? Get out.
L642263 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ I'm not like you, you have your wife.
L642262 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ I don't understand how you can like being alone so much.
L642261 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ And do you know that my mother and I had to suffer? If my father had bothered himself a little more about us, I'd be an architect now.
L642260 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ I know that you used to work with an architect.
L642259 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ What do you know about me?
L642256 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ I'm not interested. Do what you think's best.
L642255 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ But you have a right to let us know what you think.
L642254 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ I don't know anything about these things, Jorge ...
L642252 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ If I wait until tomorrow, it'll be the same as yesterday and the day before and all the other days. When you're not with your poor people, you're praying or you disappear, I never see you.
L642251 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Well... is it so urgent?
L642250 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
L642249 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?
L642153 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ I've been expecting you; I got a letter from the lawyer.
L642152 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ Jorge, Don Jaime's son, at your service.
L642151 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Are you Jorge?
L642150 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ Miss Viridiana ...
L642321 +++$+++ u8792 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ PEASANT +++$+++ Canelo!
L642320 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ What's he called?
L642319 +++$+++ u8792 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ PEASANT +++$+++ And remember, the less he eats, the better he runs.
L642316 +++$+++ u8792 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ PEASANT +++$+++ I wasn't thinking of selling him, but if you want ... I'll leave it to you.
L642315 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ How much do you want for him?
L642314 +++$+++ u8792 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ PEASANT +++$+++ He's good at rabbiting and he knows it. When we're in the country, if he doesn't hunt he doesn't get fed.
L642312 +++$+++ u8792 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ PEASANT +++$+++ And let him get run over by somebody else?
L642311 +++$+++ u8786 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ JORGE +++$+++ Then let him go and he'll follow you.
L642310 +++$+++ u8792 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ PEASANT +++$+++ It's for people!
L642358 +++$+++ u8787 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ LEPER +++$+++ He's lying through his ass!
