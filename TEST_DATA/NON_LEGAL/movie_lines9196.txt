L329919 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ Well, you are kind of... convex.
L329918 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ God, why is everyone always staring at me?
L329917 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ Hot!
L329916 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Trust me, you don't. I actually have to wear a bra now. And I have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode.
L329915 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ I wish my funbags would get bigger.
L329914 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.
L329913 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ God, you're getting huge. How many months has it been now?
L329879 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ God, Spermy. Must you always feed?
L329878 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I want a huge cookie. And like, a lamb kebob. Simultaneously.
L329876 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Right, seriously.
L329875 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ She's gonna steal that kid for her collection.
L329871 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ I just thought she'd look really old in real life.
L329870 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ You sound shocked or something.
L329869 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ No way! She's pretty.
L329868 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ Of the Penny Saver Lorings?
L329867 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.
L329866 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ What?
L329865 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Hly shht!
L329863 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Share the love, Tits!
L329862 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ Yum. This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut!
L329690 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ Or stage parents!
L329689 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ How do you know I'm so poisonous? Like, what if the adoptive parents turn out to be evil molesters?
L329681 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ No way. No, I definitely don't want to know.
L329680 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ Aw, please Junebug?
L329677 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ It is really weird looking. It's like it's not even real. I can't believe there are saps who actually cry at these things.
L329676 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ Touche.
L329675 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Hey, I'm a sacred vessel. All you've got in your belly is Taco Bell!
L329674 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ Check out Baby Big-Head. That kid is scary!
L329487 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I'm pregnant.
L329486 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ Best to just tell them, man. Rip off the Band-Aid and let it bleed.
L329466 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ Hey, Juno. Juno! Look at this one.
L329465 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Yeesh, they sound like a cult. Besides, they're greedy bitches. They already have three kids!
L329464 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ All right, how about this one? "Healthy, educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five. You will be compensated. Help us complete the circle of love."
L329463 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I was thinking a graphic designer, mid-thirties, and his cool Asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass. But I'm trying to not be too particular.
L329462 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ What did you have in mind, a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest?
L329461 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking for something a little edgier.
L329460 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ You're not listening to me.
L329459 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ There's a guy in here who's giving away a piano. Free for the hauling! We should put it in Bleeker's yard.
L329458 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ Look at this one "Wholesome, spiritually wealthy couple have found true love with each other."  "All that's missing is your bastard."
L329457 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ Yeah, but it sucks for free.
L329456 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ The Penny Saver sucks.
L329455 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Come on, Leah. I can't scope out wannabe parents in the Penny Saver! That's tacky. That's like buying clothes at the Pump n' Munch.
L329454 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ Oh yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn." They're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment. It's totally legit.
L329453 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ There are ads? For parents?
L329452 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ Well, maybe you could look at one of those adoption ads. I see them all the time in the Penny Saver.
L329451 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Bleeker and I were going to go to Gettysburg for spring break.
L329450 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ Maybe they'll totally shit and be super mad at you and not let you graduate or go to Cabo San Lucas for spring break.
L329449 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I know. Maybe they'll canonize me for being so selfless.
L329448 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ But then you'll get huge. Your chest is going to milktate. And you have to tell everyone you're pregnant.
L329447 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ What does that even mean? Anyway, I got to thinking on the way over. I was thinking maybe I could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing. You know, like a woman with a bum ovary or something. Or some nice lesbos.
L329446 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ Keep your voice down dude, my mom's around here somewhere. She doesn't know we're sexually active.
L329445 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I'm staying pregnant, Le.
L329444 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ Oh, gruesome. I wonder if the baby's claws could scratch your vag on the way out?
L329443 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I couldn't do it, Leah! It smelled like a dentist in there. They had these really horrible magazines, with, like, spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains, like someone read them in the tub. And the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers, and she told me about her boyfriend's pie balls, and Su-Chin Kuah was there, and she told me the baby had fingernails. Fingernails!
L329442 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ What are you doing here, dumbass? I thought I was supposed to pick you up at four.
L329347 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ It was magnificent, man!
L329346 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ So, what was it like humping Bleeker's bony bod?
L329345 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ It's extremely complicated, and I'd rather not talk about it in my fragile state.
L329344 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ Aha! You love him.
L329343 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Like, a year ago, in Spanish class.
L329342 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ When did you decide you were going to do Bleeker?
L329341 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.
L329340 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ So, you were bored? Is that how this blessed miracle came to be?
L329339 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ That is sick, man.
L329338 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ Heavy lifting can only help you at this point.
L329337 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Eh, I'll call them myself. But I do need your help with something very urgent.
L329336 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.
L329335 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now.
L329334 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke.
L329333 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take.
L329332 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!
L329331 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Unfortunately, yes.
L329330 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ Is this for real? Like for real, for real?
L329329 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier.
L329328 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ How did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests?
L329327 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ It's not a food baby. I took three pregnancy tests today. I am definitely up the spout.
L329326 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ Maybe it's just a food baby. Did you have a big lunch?
L329325 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Dude, I'm pregnant.
L329324 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ Only the one in my pants.
L329323 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ No it's Morgan Freeman. Got any bones that need collecting?
L329322 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ Is this Juno?
L329321 +++$+++ u1660 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I am a suicide risk.
L329320 +++$+++ u1661 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ LEAH +++$+++ Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.
L329625 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ You don't make anything. It's for exercising.
L329624 +++$+++ u1662 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ What do you make with that?
L329623 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ A Pilates machine?
L329622 +++$+++ u1662 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ So. What's that thing?
L329584 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Well, I was born to be a mother. Some of us are.
L329583 +++$+++ u1662 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Yes. Heating and air conditioning.
L329582 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Well, haven't you ever felt like you were born to do something?
L329581 +++$+++ u1662 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ You don't say.
L329536 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Oh no. Thank you. Come on in.
L329535 +++$+++ u1662 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Hello. Thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home.
L330053 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Aren't you the cool guy?
L330052 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ It's a loft.
L330051 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ A hotel?
L330050 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Yeah, downtown.
L330049 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Have you found a place to stay?
L330048 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Looks like it, yeah.
L330047 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ We're actually, finally doing this?
L330046 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ No, it's fine. Thanks for making the call, I guess.
L330045 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ I called Gerta Rauss. She says she can represent both of us. They call it "collaborative divorce." It's apparently all the rage right now. And it's easy because we don't have children.
L330042 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Don't mock me.
L330041 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Like what? Be a rock star?
L330040 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ I don't know. There's just things I still want to do.
L330039 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ What would be a good time for you?
L330036 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Ever since, it's just been like a ticking clock.
L330035 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ She answered our prayers.
L330034 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ It all just happened so fast. We put that ad in the paper. I thought it would take months if, you know, ever and then -- boom -- Two weeks later, she's in our living room.
L330033 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Why don't we let Juno go home and we can discuss this later on, okay?
L330031 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ I know we're prepared. I just don't know if... I'm ready.
L330030 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --
L330029 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ I've been just wondering if we're, you know, ready.
L330028 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ What are you referring to?
L330027 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.
L330026 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ What?
L330025 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ I didn't do anything... I just... I've just been thinking.
L330024 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ What did you do?
L330023 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ She's hormonal. Right, June? It's just part of the whole process.
L330022 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Juno, what's the matter?
L329861 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Can you see it?
L329860 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Hm.
L329859 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ That wall is going to need something. Maybe we could put our first family picture there.
L329858 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ And I disagree.
L329857 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.
L329856 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ You should read the book. I even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.
L329855 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Nesting, huh? Are you planning to build the crib out of twigs and saliva?
L329854 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ What to Expect says that readying the baby's room is an important process for women. It's called "nesting."
L329853 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Or you could just wait a couple months. It's not like the baby's going to storm in here any second and demand dessert-colored walls.
L329852 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I think I'm leaning toward Custard in this light. I don't know. I should paint a small area...
L329851 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Why do people think yellow is gender- neutral? I don't know one man with a yellow bedroom.
L329850 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Well, I wanted to pick something gender-neutral for now. Once we get the baby, God willing, we can create a more decisive palette.
L329849 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ They're yellow.
L329848 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ What do you think? Custard or Cheesecake?
L329633 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Juno just wanted a closer look at Kimber here.
L329632 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ You guys are playing music?
L329580 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ I want to be a mommy so badly!
L329579 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married.
L329578 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ You're doing an amazing and selfless thing for us.
L329575 +++$+++ u1668 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ VANESSA +++$+++ Are you looking for any other compensation?
L329574 +++$+++ u1663 +++$+++ m109 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Obviously, we'll compensate you for your medical expenses.
L334180 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ There ain't nothing we could do. Once Early sets his mind on somethin', well thats the end of that.
L334179 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Adele for god sake please lis...
L334178 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ ...There ain't nothin' can kill 'em. They can live for two even three hundred years.
L334177 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Adele... we gotta do something before Early kills someone else.
L334176 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ ...You can forget about 'em forever and then look at 'em and they're doin' even better than before.
L333905 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I suppose anything's possible.
L333904 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ You lose!
L333812 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Me neither. How 'bout you Carrie?
L333811 +++$+++ u1672 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ No.
L334152 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Early didn't kill nobody, he wouldn't do that. I don't know why you're saying those things. You ain't my friend.
L334151 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ ...I wouldn't lie to you, Adele. . . I saw him kill that man.
L334148 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ That's not true!
L334147 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ What?
L334146 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ ...That's not true.
L334145 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ The police are after him, he's a murderer!
L333971 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ Jeez... Adele!
L333970 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said.
L333969 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ ...Anything else?
L333968 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Carryin' a gun.
L333967 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ What's Early been in jail for?
L333966 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ My momma's a beautician. Guess that's where I get it from. She wouldn't hear of my moving in with Early... on account of his just getting out of jail and all. Ain't seen her in nearly a year now. I wish she'd call me, just once.
L333945 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L333944 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ You think Early's bad to me, don't you?
L333943 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ Adele... are you serious?
L333942 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Do what?
L333941 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ You shouldn't let him do that to you...
L333940 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Sorry. Boy I'll tell ya, if Early found a picture of me like that I'd be black and blue for a week.
L333939 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ Hold still.
L333938 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ No it is not!
L333937 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ That's me.
L333936 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ Took 'em all.
L333935 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ You took this picture?
L333933 +++$+++ u1674 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ CARRIE +++$+++ Sure.
L333932 +++$+++ u1670 +++$+++ m110 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Your pictures. Can I see 'em?
