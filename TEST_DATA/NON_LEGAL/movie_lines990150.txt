L402509 +++$+++ u6770 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ I did it myself. I read a magazine article about how to maximize small spaces.
L402508 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ It's nice.
L402507 +++$+++ u6770 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ Home sweet home.
L402506 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Okay, sure.
L402505 +++$+++ u6770 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ Would you like to come in and see my house? Just for a minute.
L402504 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.
L402503 +++$+++ u6770 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ I had a good time tonight.
L402492 +++$+++ u6770 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ You can be in a room with 100 men, and not like any of them, or you can be in a room with just one man, and he's exactly the one you want.
L402491 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Oh, how do you mean?
L402490 +++$+++ u6770 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ Kinda like men.
L402489 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Look, it's not always luck, I mean, depending upon the placement of the numbers, a guy with 10 cards could win just as easily as a guy with 100.
L402488 +++$+++ u6770 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ Oh, I'm just not lucky Harry.
L402484 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Why d'you think these seats were empty.
L402483 +++$+++ u6770 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ I'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these people very soon.
L402482 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What's that?
L402481 +++$+++ u6770 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ I just had a terrible thought Harry.
L402471 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ No. Just, more activity.
L402470 +++$+++ u6770 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ Does it make it easier to win?
L402379 +++$+++ u6770 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ Okay.
L402378 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I do enjoy playing bingo, if you'd like to join me for a game tomorrow night at church you're welcome to.
L402377 +++$+++ u6770 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ I love going to movies, especially at the drive in. I don't think there's anything more romantic than going to the drive in.  I'll let you get back to work.
L402376 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I haven't been to the movies in AGES.
L402375 +++$+++ u6770 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ You have to learn how to take a complement.  Movies, movies, ahhhh, &quot;Love Story&quot; at the drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?
L402374 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ It's no big deal.
L402373 +++$+++ u6770 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ In lieu... &quot;instead&quot;.... No contest.
L402372 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I prefer it to &quot;instead&quot;, it has more dignity.
L402371 +++$+++ u6770 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ Oh it's good, &quot;In lieu of&quot; I love that word lieu.
L402370 +++$+++ u6770 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ No kidding?
L402369 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I wrote that.
L402368 +++$+++ u6770 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ Oh right, right, . Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette. Cherished father of Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society.
L402367 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family.
L402366 +++$+++ u6770 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.
L402365 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
L402364 +++$+++ u6770 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ Hi.
L402338 +++$+++ u6770 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ I'm sure she will.
L402337 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to help take care of Vada. They were very close, but lately as her mind's been wandering more and more, Vada's been acting kinda crazy. I'm sure she'll snap out of it though.
L402336 +++$+++ u6770 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business. It's just that I like Vada, very much.
L402335 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh.
L402334 +++$+++ u6770 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered. And the room's all set up.
L402333 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Can not do without, Harry's wild about me.
L402272 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ She's a perfectly happy eleven year old girl, look, don't give me any advice about my daughter, okay?
L402271 +++$+++ u6770 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ Harry, I really think she.....
L402270 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a thing or two about it.
L402269 +++$+++ u6770 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ I don't think so, I think she's confused about death.
L402268 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Oh that, she just likes to play.
L402267 +++$+++ u6770 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ Well the other night at dinner...
L402266 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What do you mean??
L402265 +++$+++ u6770 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ Harry?  I was just wondering, if there is anything wrong with Vada.
L402264 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ That wasn't an image. She WAS an old school Marm.  Fix it.
L402263 +++$+++ u6770 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ I just wanted to get past this &quot;old school Marm&quot; image.
L402262 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ She did. This photo was taken a month ago at the church food drive.
L402261 +++$+++ u6770 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ I think she looks nice! Her lips are very thin so I used the gloss to give them a more sensual quality, and her eyes just needed a little definition, and her hair, I'm sorry, nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972.
L402260 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ This was the Reverend Porter's wife, you have her looking like a two dollar hooker.
L402259 +++$+++ u6770 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ You don't like it?
L402257 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Yeah.
L402256 +++$+++ u6770 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ Could you take a look at Mrs. Porter?
L402255 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Uh huh?
L402147 +++$+++ u6770 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ I promise i'll take good care of these people, they deserve it, they're dead, all they've got left is their looks.
L402146 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, very much, but the....
L402145 +++$+++ u6770 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.
L402144 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You'd be doing hair and makeup and answering the phone.
L402143 +++$+++ u6770 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ Ohh, oh sure it's no big deal, you see all my former clients will eventually die, and all your clients used to be alive, so they have something in common.
L402142 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Oh, You still want it? Even though uhh...
L402141 +++$+++ u6770 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ I need the job.
L402140 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Pardon?
L402139 +++$+++ u6770 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ Excuse me, what about the job?
L402123 +++$+++ u6770 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ The add just said &quot;Makeup Artist&quot;
L402122 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Deceased.
L402121 +++$+++ u6770 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ Stiffs??
L402120 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Yes they are.
L402119 +++$+++ u6770 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ They're dead?
L402118 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a Funeral Parlor.
L402117 +++$+++ u6770 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease.
L402116 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Uhh, Miss devoto...
L402115 +++$+++ u6770 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ I'm a licensed cosmetologist, I worked for two years, at the &quot;Dino Raphael&quot; Salon, all my customers cried when I told them I was leaving.
L402114 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I think it's still available.
L402113 +++$+++ u6770 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ It's still available I hope?
L403001 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ That's good, memories are good sweetheart. Vada, I'm sorry; I was trying to keep it from you, I just couldn't. You're a good girl, and I want you to be happy; don't be an old grump like me.  Seeya in the morning.
L403000 +++$+++ u6772 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll think of Thomas J.
L402999 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Yes, I did, very much for a long time, and even now, I get a little sad when I think of a pretty flower or a sunset that your mother would have liked.
L402998 +++$+++ u6772 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ Do you miss her?
L402997 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Uh huh. You know what your mother did when she found out she was gonna have you? She came home and painted this whole room pink. She was so sure she was gonna have a little girl.
L402996 +++$+++ u6772 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ Really?
L402995 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes. Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when you laugh, you sound just like her.
L402994 +++$+++ u6772 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ What was my mama like?
L402993 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.
L402992 +++$+++ u6772 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ In the garage.
L402991 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I forgot about that picture, where did you find it?
L402990 +++$+++ u6772 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ I found this.
L402988 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ No, no.
L402987 +++$+++ u6772 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my mother.
L402986 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What??
L402985 +++$+++ u6772 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ Did I kill my mother?
L402936 +++$+++ u6772 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ Get away, get away!!
L402935 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ He's gone sweetheart. He's gone!
L402891 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ There were just too many of 'em.
L402890 +++$+++ u6772 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ He's okay isn't he?
L402889 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ He was allergic to bees.
L402888 +++$+++ u6772 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ Why not?
L402887 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ No sweetheart, you can't.
L402886 +++$+++ u6772 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ Maybe I should go over and yell at him.
L402885 +++$+++ u6772 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ I told him not to tease those bees. Did he get stung?
L402884 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Vada, something happened to Thomas J last night, he stepped on a beehive.
L402883 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ He's getting big.  Vada, come here and sit down for a minute.
L402882 +++$+++ u6772 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ Yes.

L402237 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Any more soda left?

L402055 +++$+++ u6772 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ I was born jaundiced. Once I sat on a toilet seat at a Truck stop and caught hemorrhoids. And i've learned to live with this chicken Bone that's been lodged in my throat for the past three years, so I knew Dad would be devastated when he learned of my latest affliction.  Dad, I don't wanna upset you, but my left breast is developing at a significantly faster rate than my right. It can only mean one thing.  Cancer.  I'm dying.
L402582 +++$+++ u6765 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Look if you think you know how, why don't you pre-measure the briquettes in little packages, put out a product, support me for a while!

L403020 +++$+++ u6772 +++$+++ m451 +++$+++ VADA +++$+++ Weeping willow with your tears running down, Why do you always weep and frown, Is it because he left you one day, Is it because he could not stay, On your branches he would swing, Do you long for the happiness that they would bring, He found shelter in your shade, He thought his laughter would never fade, Weeping willow stop your tears, There is something to calm your fears, You think death as if you forever part, But I know he'll always be in your heart.
