L28045 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ What did you expect - live sables?
L28044 +++$+++ u3601 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BIRDIE +++$+++ She's on her way. With half the men in the joint.  It's only a fur coat...
L28043 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ But she just got here...
L28042 +++$+++ u3601 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BIRDIE +++$+++ The bed looks like a dead animal act. Which one is sables?
L27702 +++$+++ u3601 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BIRDIE +++$+++ I know. She just keeps hearin' her dead father play the banjo.
L27701 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Margo does not play a lunatic, Birdie.
L27688 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ No thanks, Birdie.
L27687 +++$+++ u3601 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BIRDIE +++$+++ Lemme fix you a drink.
L28134 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Well, I certainly think it's odd he hasn't even come up...
L28133 +++$+++ u3601 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BIRDIE +++$+++ I ain't dense. And he's been here twenty minutes.
L28132 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Don't be dense. The party.
L28131 +++$+++ u3601 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BIRDIE +++$+++ Late for what?
L28130 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ The only thing I ordered by mistake is the guests.  They're domestic, too, and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns... where's Bill? He's late.
L28129 +++$+++ u3601 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BIRDIE +++$+++ There was nothing he didn't know.  There's a message from the bartender. Does Miss Channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake?
L28128 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?
L28127 +++$+++ u3601 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BIRDIE +++$+++ The caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres-  Voila.
L28126 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ You're not being funny, I could get actors for less. What about the food?
L28125 +++$+++ u3601 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BIRDIE +++$+++ There's some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers. Who'd you call - the William Morris Agency?
L28124 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ My back's open.  Did the extra help get here?
L28123 +++$+++ u3601 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BIRDIE +++$+++ You all put together?
L27995 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I'm sure that's very flattering, Birdie, and I'm sure there's nothing wrong with that!
L27994 +++$+++ u3601 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BIRDIE +++$+++ I'll tell you how. Like - let's see - like she was studyin' you, like you were a play or a book or a set of blueprints. How you walk, talk, think, eat, sleep-
L27993 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ How do you mean that?
L27992 +++$+++ u3601 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BIRDIE +++$+++ Well... let's say she thinks only about you, anyway...
L27991 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ She thinks only for me...  ... doesn't she?
L27990 +++$+++ u3601 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BIRDIE +++$+++ Like an agent with one client.
L27989 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ She's loyal and efficient-
L27988 +++$+++ u3601 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BIRDIE +++$+++ Night an' day.
L27987 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ She works hard.
L27986 +++$+++ u3601 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BIRDIE +++$+++ Now you want an argument.
L27985 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Why not?
L27984 +++$+++ u3601 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BIRDIE +++$+++ No.
L27983 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ An answer.
L27982 +++$+++ u3601 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BIRDIE +++$+++ Do you want an argument or an answer?
L27981 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ You don't like Eve, do you?
L27980 +++$+++ u3601 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BIRDIE +++$+++ Hmm?
L27979 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Birdie-
L27934 +++$+++ u3601 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BIRDIE +++$+++ She's got two things to do - carry clothes an' press 'em wrong - an' just let anybody else muscle in...
L27933 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Oh-oh.
L27932 +++$+++ u3601 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BIRDIE +++$+++ But the wardrobe women have got one. And next to a tenor, a wardrobe woman is the touchiest thing in show business-
L27931 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Well?
L27930 +++$+++ u3601 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BIRDIE +++$+++ I haven't got a union. I'm slave labor.
L27929 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Behind in your dues? How much?
L27928 +++$+++ u3601 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BIRDIE +++$+++ If I may so bold as to say something - did you ever hear the word "union"?
L27924 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Just because you can't even work a zipper. It was very thoughtful, Eve, and I appreciate it-
L27923 +++$+++ u3601 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BIRDIE +++$+++ Adorable. We now got everything a dressing room needs except a basketball hoop.
L27918 +++$+++ u3601 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BIRDIE +++$+++ I couldn't get into the girdle in two an' a half hours...
L27917 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ When we get home you're going to get into one of those girdles and act for two and half hours.
L27916 +++$+++ u3601 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BIRDIE +++$+++ Something maybe grew a size bigger.
L27915 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ You bought the new girdles a size smaller. I can feel it.
L27867 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ See you home...
L27866 +++$+++ u3601 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BIRDIE +++$+++ Kill the people.  Got your key?
L27801 +++$+++ u3601 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BIRDIE +++$+++ Imagine. All this admiration in just one room.
L27800 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ She, too, is a great admirer of yours.
L27776 +++$+++ u3601 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BIRDIE +++$+++ You don't have to apologize for me!  I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. It's just my way of talkin'...
L27775 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ There are some human experiences, Birdie, that do not take place in a vaudeville house - and that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian should understand and respect!  I want to apologize for Birdie's-
L27738 +++$+++ u3601 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BIRDIE +++$+++ If I haven't, I'll find something till you're normal.
L27737 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I'm sure you must have things to do in the bathroom, Birdie dear.
L27734 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Miss Coonan...
L27733 +++$+++ u3601 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BIRDIE +++$+++ Oh, brother.
L27732 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ And this is my good friend and companion, Miss Birdie Coonan.
L27727 +++$+++ u3601 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BIRDIE +++$+++ Oh, brother.
L27726 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ How do you do, my dear.
L27700 +++$+++ u3601 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BIRDIE +++$+++ Well. I guess a real tight girdle help when you're playin' a lunatic.
L27699 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Of course!
L27698 +++$+++ u3601 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BIRDIE +++$+++ The same size?
L27697 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Buy some.
L27696 +++$+++ u3601 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BIRDIE +++$+++ You need new girdles.
L27692 +++$+++ u3601 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ BIRDIE +++$+++ I never played Fort Sumter.
L27691 +++$+++ u3606 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ It was Fort Sumter they fired on-
L29026 +++$+++ u3603 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ You rest. I'll get it...
L29025 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ That's the door.
L29024 +++$+++ u3603 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ I don't care if I never get home.
L29023 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ It's after one now. You won't get home till all hours.
L29022 +++$+++ u3603 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ With changing and everything, a little over an hour.
L29021 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ How long does it take?
L29020 +++$+++ u3603 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ Subway.
L29019 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ How'd you get all the way up here from Brooklyn?
L29018 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Don't bother.
L29017 +++$+++ u3603 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ I'll just pick up the broken glass.
L29016 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ The maid'll fix it in the morning.
L29015 +++$+++ u3603 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ That spilled drink is going to ruin your carper.
L29014 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I might.
L29013 +++$+++ u3603 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ You're going to Hollywood - aren't you?  From the trunks you're packing, you must be going to stay a long time.
L29012 +++$+++ u3603 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ Lots of actresses come from Brooklyn. Barbara Stanwyck, Susan Hayward - of course, they're just movie stars.
L29011 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Erasmus Hall. That's in Brooklyn, isn't it?
L29010 +++$+++ u3603 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ Ours was one of the first. Erasmus Hall. I'm the president.
L29009 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I've heard of them.
L29008 +++$+++ u3603 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ About how you live, what kind of clothes you wear - what kind of perfume and books - things like that. You know the Eve Harrington clubs - that they've got in most of the girls' high schools?
L29007 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ What report? To whom?
L29006 +++$+++ u3603 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ It was for my report.
L29005 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Probably not.
L29004 +++$+++ u3603 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ You probably won't believe me.
L29003 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ What for?
L29002 +++$+++ u3603 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ That's all.
L29001 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ You were just looking around...
L29000 +++$+++ u3603 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ I hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed. She must've forgot something and when she went to get it, she left the door open. I sneaked in and hid till she finished. Then I just looked around - and pretty soon I was afraid somebody'd notice the lights were on so I turned them off - and then I guess, I fell asleep.
L28999 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ How did you get in here?
L28998 +++$+++ u3603 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ Please don't have me arrested, please! I didn't steal anything - you can search me!
L28997 +++$+++ u3603 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ I - I guess I fell asleep.
L28996 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L28995 +++$+++ u3603 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ Miss Harrington...
L28994 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Who are you?
L28978 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Thank you, Karen.
L28977 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Congratulations, Eve.
L28899 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ But not all of it - not that Lloyd and I are going to be married.
L28898 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ She knows enough not to be here.
L28769 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I'd do much more - for a part that good.
L28768 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ A part in a play. You'd do all that - just for a part in a play.
L28767 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ That won't be necessary. Addison knows how Margo happen to miss that performance - how I happened to know she'd miss it in time to call him and notify every paper in town...  ... it's quite a story. Addison could make quite a thing of it - imagine how snide and vicious he could get and still write nothing but the truth. I had a time persuading him...  ... you'd better sit down. You look a bit wobbly.  If I play "Cora," Addison will never tell what happened - in or out of print. A simple exchange of favors. And I'm so happy I can do something for you - at long last...  Your friendship with Margo - your deep, close friendship - what would happen to it, do you think, if she knew the chap trick you'd played on her - for my benefit? And you and Lloyd - how long, even in the Theater, before people forgot what happened - and trusted you again?  No... it would be so much easier on everyone concerned, if I were to play "Cora." And so much better theater, too...
L28766 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Over my dead body...
L28765 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Addison wants me to play it.
L28764 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I don't think anything in the world could make me say that.
L28763 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ "Cora" is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd it's for me.
L28762 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You talk just as Addison said you did.
L28761 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ It could have been - fifteen years ago. It's my part now.
L28760 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ After all you've said... don't you know the part was written for Margo?
L28759 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ If you told him so, he'd give me the part. He said he would.
L28758 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You want to play "Cora." You want me to tell Lloyd I think you should play it.
L28757 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Something most important you can do.
L28756 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I think I know...
L28754 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Give yourself time. Don't worry too much about what people think, you're very young and very talented...  ... and, believe it or not, if there's anything I can do-
L28753 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I wish I could believe that.
L28752 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Yes, you will. You Theater people always do. Nothing is forever in the Theater. Love or hate, success or failure - whatever it is, it's here, it flares up and burns hot - and then it's gone.
L28751 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I'll never get over it.
L28750 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Eve. I - I don't think you meant to cause unhappiness. But you did. More to yourself, perhaps - as it turned out - than to anyone else...
L28749 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I wish I'd never met him, I'd like him to be dead... I want my friends back.
L28748 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ He can help you.
L28747 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ He's not my friend. You were my friends...
L28746 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Well. I think you're painting the picture a little darker than it is, really. If nothing else - and don't underestimate him - you have a powerful friend in Addison.
L28745 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ - an understudy's performance.
L28744 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ But the raves about your performance-
L28743 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Some vague promises of a test, that's all - if a particular part should come along, one of those things-
L28742 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Tell me. How did your lunch turn out - with the man from Hollywood?
L28741 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I'm not crying.
L28740 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Eve... don't cry.
L28739 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ You've really got a low opinion of me, haven't you? We'll I'll give you some pleasant news. I've been told off in no uncertain terms all over town. Miss Channing should be happy to hear that. To know how loyal her friends are - how much more loyal they are than she had a right to expect me to be...
L28738 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Let's not get over-dramatic.
L28737 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ No! I don't expect you to believe anything. Except that the responsibility is mine. And the disgrace.
L28736 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Do you expect me to believe that you didn't say any of those things - that they were all Addison?
L28735 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ In a way. You find yourself trying to say what you mean, but somehow the words change - and they become his words - and suddenly you're not saying what you mean, but what he means-
L28734 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ - and you felt just like that talking to Addison.
L28733 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ You know, I've always considered myself a very clever girl. Smart. Good head on my shoulders, that sort of thing, never the wrong word at the wrong time... but then, I'd never met Addison deWitt.  I remember once I had a tooth pulled. They gave me some anaesthetic - I don't remember the name - and it affected me in a strange way. I heard myself saying things I wasn't even thinking... as if my mind were someplace outside of my body, and couldn't control what I did or said-
L28732 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Why shouldn't you?  Please sit down.
L28731 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ - and easy or not, I won't believe a word.
L28730 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Oh, but there is-
L28729 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ There can't be very much-
L28728 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I've got a lot to say. And none of it is easy.
L28727 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Can't we sit down? Just for a minute...
L28726 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I don't intend to be.
L28725 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I don't expect you to be pleasant.
L28724 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Don't get up.  And don't act as if I were the queen mother.
L28723 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I was wondering whether you'd come at all..
L28616 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Nothing definite yet - it's just to have lunch.
L28615 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ They certainly don't waste much time.
L28614 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ We're having lunch with a movie talent scout.
L28608 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Mostly relief that I managed to stagger through it at all...
L28607 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Eve. I've heard the most wonderful things about your performance-
L28180 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Please...
L28179 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Don't bother, I can take it up myself...
L28178 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ May I have your coat?
L28120 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ No, Eve, I won't forget...
L28119 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Karen...  ... you won't forget, will you? What we talked about before?
L28112 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Well - if she's got to pick on someone, I'd just as soon it was me.
L28111 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Eve. I'm fond of Margo too. But I know Margo. And every now and then there is nothing I want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants.
L28110 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ If I thought I'd offended her, of all people-
L28109 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.
L28108 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ But there must be some reason, something I've done without knowing...
L28107 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You mustn't mind Margo too much, even if I do...
L28041 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I seem to be forever thanking you for something, don't I?
L28040 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I won't forget.
L28039 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ You won't forget it?
L28038 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Of course.
L28037 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Then - would you talk to Mr. Fabian about it?
L28036 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ They'll do as they're told.
L28035 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson-
L28034 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I think she would cheer.
L28033 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Do you think Miss Channing would approve?
L28032 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ No, dear. Margo must go on.  As a matter of fact, I see no reason why you shouldn't be Margo's understudy...
L28031 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ The show must go on.
L28030 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Don't worry too much about that. Margo just doesn't miss performances. If she can walk, crawl or roll - she plays.
L28029 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I don't let myself think about it, even-  - but I do know the part so well, and every bit of the staging, there'd be no need to break in a new girl-  - but suppose I had to go on one night? To an audience that came to see Margo Channing. No, I couldn't possibly...
L28028 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ ... you want to be Margo's new understudy.
L28027 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Well... Miss Channing's affairs are in such good shape... there isn't enough to keep me as busy as I should be, really - not that I've ever considered anything that would take me away from her... but the other day - when I heard Mr. Fabian tell Miss Channing that her understudy was going to have a baby, and they'd have to replace her...
L28026 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Nobody's done so much, Eve, you've got to stop thinking of yourself as one of the Hundred Neediest Cases... what is it?
L28025 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Karen...  ... isn't it awful, I'm about to ask you for another favor - after all you've already done.
L28024 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Karen.
L28023 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Mrs. Richards.
L28022 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Lloyd says Margo compensates for underplaying on the stage by overplaying reality...  ... next to that sable, my new mink seems like an old bedjacket...  ... you've done your share, Eve. You've worked wonders with Margo...
L28021 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ There should be a new word for happiness. Being here with Miss Channing has been - I just can't say, she's been so wonderful, done so much for me-
L28020 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Tell me, Eve - how are things with you? Happy?
L28019 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Hollywood.
L28018 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Discouraging, isn't it? Women with furs like that where it never gets cold...
L28017 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Some Hollywood movie star, her plane got in late.
L28016 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Now who's show up at this hour? It's time people went home - hold that coat up...  ... whose is it?
L27819 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I'd like that.
L27818 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Not just that way. As a friend...
L27817 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I'll be at the old stand, tomorrow matinee-
L27816 +++$+++ u3604 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Good night, Eve. I hope I see you again soon-
L27804 +++$+++ u3602 +++$+++ m238 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I think I'd better. It's been - well, I can hardly find the words to say how it's been...
