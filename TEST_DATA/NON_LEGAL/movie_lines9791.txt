L192270 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ How's your mining operation going?
L192269 +++$+++ u5098 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ I'll have my people get to work on it right away.  Hate the thought of the Millennium Falcon without her heart.
L192268 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Hyperdrive.
L192267 +++$+++ u5098 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ That ship saved my life a few times.  It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy.  What's wrong with her?
L192265 +++$+++ u5098 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ What have you done to my ship?
L192264 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Repairs ...
L192263 +++$+++ u5098 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ That won't be easy, my friend ... What brings you here, anyway?
L192255 +++$+++ u5098 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ I'll bet.
L192254 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ I always said you were a gentleman.
L192253 +++$+++ u5098 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ Are you kidding?
L192252 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ No hard feelings?
L192251 +++$+++ u5098 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ Why you slimy, double-crossing no-good swindler ... am I glad to see you.
L192426 +++$+++ u5104 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ VADER +++$+++ I'm altering the bargain.  Pray I don't alter it any further.
L192425 +++$+++ u5098 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ That wasn't the bargain.  You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in--
L192424 +++$+++ u5104 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ VADER +++$+++ Take them, but I'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them.
L192423 +++$+++ u5098 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ I'll take what's mine now.
L192403 +++$+++ u5104 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ VADER +++$+++ I think not.  But I don't wish my prize to be damaged.  We'll test it first.  Bring in Captain Solo.
L192402 +++$+++ u5098 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ We only use this chamber for carbon freezing.  If you put him in there, it'll kill him.
L192370 +++$+++ u5104 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ VADER +++$+++ Good.  It would be most unfortunate if I had to leave a permanent garrison here.
L192369 +++$+++ u5098 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ No.
L192368 +++$+++ u5104 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ VADER +++$+++ I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
L192367 +++$+++ u5098 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ That was never mentioned.  Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.
L192366 +++$+++ u5104 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ VADER +++$+++ You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.
L192365 +++$+++ u5098 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ What about Leia and the Wookiee?
L192547 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ That sounds familiar.
L192546 +++$+++ u5098 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ I'm sure my men fixed it.  We've got nothing to worry about.
L192543 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Are the coordinates set?
L192542 +++$+++ u5098 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ The deflector shields are gone.
L192535 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ It's Luke.  Get under him.  Slow down.  Easy Chewie.  Line up your tracking system.  Lando, open the hatch.
L192534 +++$+++ u5098 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ Someone's falling.
L192529 +++$+++ u5098 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ Wait a minute.  We're not going back there.
L192528 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ No argument, just do it.  That's a command!
L192523 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Luke needs help.  We must go back.
L192522 +++$+++ u5098 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ What?
L192521 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Luke!
L192520 +++$+++ u5098 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ I knew that set-up was too good to last .... I'm going to miss it.
L192517 +++$+++ u5098 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ I didn't say anything?
L192516 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ What'd you say?
L192499 +++$+++ u5098 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ His fate is sealed.  You'll be lucky to get out yourself.  All systems are on alert.  everything's locked.
L192498 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ We've got to find Luke.
L192489 +++$+++ u5098 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ Don't worry about a thing.  I'll get us going.
L192488 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ You'd better know what you're doing, or this is going to get very messy.
L192480 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ What chance have we got in here? What are we going to do when they cut ...
L192479 +++$+++ u5098 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ Sure I did ... once.  It turned out lousy.
L192478 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
L192477 +++$+++ u5098 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ Very noble.  Not smart, but noble.
L192446 +++$+++ u5098 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ There's not much chance, but the bounty hunter's ship is on the East Landing Platform.
L192445 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Chewie's right.  We must try to save Han.
L192438 +++$+++ u5098 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ This is no time to be choosy, honey.  What do you say we debate this later?  There's still a chance I can get you out of here.
L192437 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ We have no use for your kind.
L192436 +++$+++ u5098 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ Look, I stand to lose everything by this.
L192435 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ And when do you betray us again?
L192434 +++$+++ u5098 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ I'm coming over to your side, that's what.  And I have a feeling I'm making a big mistake.
L192433 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ What's going on?
L192390 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ ... we're the bait.
L192389 +++$+++ u5098 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ Lord Vader has set a trap for him and ...
L192385 +++$+++ u5098 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ I didn't know you had a price on your head.  Vader has given you to the bounty hunter.
L192384 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ What about Han?
L192322 +++$+++ u5098 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ Yes, we keep pollution down by having the power reactor far below the city.  It's connected by a transfer shaft.
L192321 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ It's a lovely outpost.
L192320 +++$+++ u5098 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ Not actually .... Our operation is small enough not to be noticed, so you might say we're enterprisers. Most of our trade is, well ... unofficial.
L192319 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ You're part of the mining guild then?
L192318 +++$+++ u5098 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ .... We are a free station and do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Empire.
L192313 +++$+++ u5098 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ Would you care to join me for a little refreshment?
L192312 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Thanks.
L192311 +++$+++ u5098 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ I must say, your beauty is unpar- alleled.  Truly you belong here with us among the clouds.
L192310 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Not really.
L192309 +++$+++ u5098 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ Sorry, am I interrupting anything?
L192260 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ You may call me Leia.
L192259 +++$+++ u5098 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ Hello!  What have we here?  Welcome, I am Baron Lando Calrissian, Administrator of this facility ... and who might you be?
L191823 +++$+++ u5102 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ RIEEKAN +++$+++ We have no choice.  Send them up ... and start clearing everyone out.
L191822 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Two transports at a time is awfully risky.
L191702 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ What is it?
L191701 +++$+++ u5102 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ RIEEKAN +++$+++ We've picked up something outside the base in zone one, moving East.
L191695 +++$+++ u5102 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ RIEEKAN +++$+++ Not yet.  They're working on it now.
L191694 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Have they analyzed the one that was killed?
L191677 +++$+++ u5102 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ RIEEKAN +++$+++ Slim, but yes, there's a chance. They have a shelter.  It's not much, but ...
L191676 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Is there any chance of them surviving out there?
L191675 +++$+++ u5102 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ RIEEKAN +++$+++ The speeders should be ready in the morning.  They'll make the search easier.
L191674 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ I understand.
L191673 +++$+++ u5102 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ RIEEKAN +++$+++ Nothing more can be done tonight. The shield doors must be closed. I can't wait any longer.  I'm sorry.
L192514 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Let's go.
L192513 +++$+++ u5103 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ THREEPIO +++$+++ Artoo, you did it!  I never doubted you for a second ...
L192240 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ I thought you knew this person.
L192239 +++$+++ u5103 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ THREEPIO +++$+++ Rather touchy, aren't they.
L192164 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Well, what now?
L192163 +++$+++ u5103 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ THREEPIO +++$+++ Sir, we've lost the rear deflector shield.  One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.
L192128 +++$+++ u5103 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ THREEPIO +++$+++ Oh my, no!
L192127 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ What??
L191972 +++$+++ u5103 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ THREEPIO +++$+++ Sir, it's very possible this asteroid is not stable.
L191971 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ A tremor!
L191943 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Closer?!
L191942 +++$+++ u5103 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ THREEPIO +++$+++ Closer?!
L191926 +++$+++ u5103 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ THREEPIO +++$+++ If I might remind you, sir, the probability of successfully navi- gating through an asteroid field is approximately 365,000 to one ... a graceful surrender might not be ...
L191925 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ You don't have to do this to impress me.
L191739 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ I'll be back later.
L191738 +++$+++ u5103 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ THREEPIO +++$+++ So much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir.
L191737 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ You rest now.
L192545 +++$+++ u5100 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I've never seen it fail.
L192544 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ This hyperdrive had better work.
L192539 +++$+++ u5100 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ He'll survive.
L192538 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Lando, is he alright? ... Lando? Are you there?  How's Luke?
L192428 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Luke, no!  It's a trap.
L192427 +++$+++ u5100 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Leia!
L191752 +++$+++ u5100 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Snow creatures ... they're here?!
L191751 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.
L191750 +++$+++ u5100 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Jabba the Hutt?
L191749 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ He wants to pay off that criminal he's in hock to.
L191748 +++$+++ u5100 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Calm down, will ya?  Tell me about Han.
L191747 +++$+++ u5100 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Han's leaving?
L191746 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ First Han, now you.  When am I going to learn not to count on anyone but myself? ...
L191745 +++$+++ u5100 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L191744 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?
L191743 +++$+++ u5100 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I have this ... feeling.  I'm not sure, really ...
L191742 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Where are you going?
L191741 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ What did you say?!
L191740 +++$+++ u5100 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Leia ... What would you think if I went away for a while?
L191731 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Me too.  I was afraid.
L191730 +++$+++ u5100 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I'm fine.  Really.  Leia ... when I was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well, it made me think about things.
L191729 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ The Bacta are growing well.  The scars should be gone in a day or so.  Does it still hurt?
L192347 +++$+++ u5105 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ If it must be.  Yes.
L192346 +++$+++ u5100 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ And sacrifice Han and Leia?
L192338 +++$+++ u5100 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I've learned so much since then.  And I'll return to finish ... I promise that, master.
L192337 +++$+++ u5105 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Yes, yes.  To Obi-wan you listen young one.  The tree.  Remember your failure at the tree!  Heh?
L192290 +++$+++ u5105 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Foreknowledge is helpful, but painful sometimes and dangerous too.  You have far to go in your training.
L192289 +++$+++ u5100 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ They're my friends.
L192288 +++$+++ u5105 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Difficult to see.  Always in motion is the future ... Back away, little machine!
L192287 +++$+++ u5100 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Will they die?
L192286 +++$+++ u5105 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ It is the future you see.
L192285 +++$+++ u5100 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.
L192284 +++$+++ u5105 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Bespin.  I see it too ... Friends you have there, heh?  Concentrate and see them you will.
L192283 +++$+++ u5100 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I see a city in the clouds.
L192282 +++$+++ u5105 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Control, control you must learn of what you see.  Not easy, not fast.
L192281 +++$+++ u5100 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ My mind fills with so many images.
L192280 +++$+++ u5105 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Free your mind and return he will.
L192279 +++$+++ u5100 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Ben?  Ben?
L192235 +++$+++ u5105 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Only what you take with you.
L192234 +++$+++ u5100 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ What's in there?
L192233 +++$+++ u5105 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ This tree is strong with the dark side of The Force.  A servant of evil it is.  Into it you must go.
L192232 +++$+++ u5100 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I feel cold.
L192230 +++$+++ u5100 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Yes ... I also feel danger ... death.  Something's not right.
L192229 +++$+++ u5105 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Four this time!  The Force you feel.
L192199 +++$+++ u5105 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ No!  Nothing more will I tell you now. Clear your mind of questions ... Quiet now be ... at peace ...
L192198 +++$+++ u5100 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ But tell me why ...
L192197 +++$+++ u5105 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ You will know.  When you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense.  Never for attack.
L192196 +++$+++ u5100 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ But how am I to know the good side from the dark?
L192195 +++$+++ u5105 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ No, no.  Easier, quicker, more seductive.
L192194 +++$+++ u5100 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?
L192193 +++$+++ u5105 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ The dark side beckons.  But if once start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.  Consume you it will ... as it did Obi-wan's apprentice.
L192192 +++$+++ u5100 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Price?  What do you mean?
L192191 +++$+++ u5105 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Anger, fear, aggression!  The dark side of The Force are they.  Easily they flow ... quick to join you in a fight.  Beware, beware, beware of them.  A heavy price is paid for the power they bring.
L192190 +++$+++ u5100 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ But I feel The Force flowing!
L192189 +++$+++ u5105 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ No, no.  This will not do.  Anger is what you feel.
L192187 +++$+++ u5105 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ That would matter not were The Force flowing through you.  Higher you'd jump!  Faster you'd move! Open yourself to The Force you must.
L192186 +++$+++ u5100 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ They're a lot stronger than I'm used to.
L192185 +++$+++ u5105 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ That they are.
L192184 +++$+++ u5100 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I thought those seekers were set for stun!
L192183 +++$+++ u5105 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Concentration.  Heh?  Concentration.
L192151 +++$+++ u5105 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ That is why you fail.
L192150 +++$+++ u5100 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I don't believe it.
L192147 +++$+++ u5105 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Size has no meaning.  It matters not.  Look at me.  Judge me by my size do you?
L192146 +++$+++ u5100 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I can't. It's too big.
L192145 +++$+++ u5105 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ No.  Try not.  Do, do.  Or do not. There is no try.
L192144 +++$+++ u5100 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Okay.  I'll give it a try.
L192143 +++$+++ u5105 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.
L192142 +++$+++ u5100 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little different.
L192134 +++$+++ u5105 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Yes, but by what standard, ask I?  Forget your old measures. Unlearn, heh, unlearn.
L192133 +++$+++ u5100 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I thought I was in good shape.
L192132 +++$+++ u5105 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ It would be in seven pieces, were you a Jedi.
L192088 +++$+++ u5105 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ You will be, my young one.  Heh. You will be.
L192087 +++$+++ u5100 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I will not fail you.  I'm not afraid.
L192081 +++$+++ u5105 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ You are reckless!
L192080 +++$+++ u5100 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I have followed my feelings.
L192077 +++$+++ u5105 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ To become a Jedi takes the deepest commitment, the most serious mind.
L192076 +++$+++ u5100 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Why not me?
L192075 +++$+++ u5105 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ YODA +++$+++ Ready are you?  What know you of ready?  I have trained Jedi for 800 years.  My own counsel I'll keep on who is to be trained.
