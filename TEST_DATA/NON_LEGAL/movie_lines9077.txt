L232380 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ No one wants to turn the table on the enemy more than I.  But if victory is remote and there's any hope for a negotiated peace, we must keep this army intact.
L232379 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ HAMILTON +++$+++ Excuse me, General, but may I ask how do you feel?
L232366 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ HAMILTON +++$+++ Delighted, sir.
L232365 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ I'll expect you for dinner this evening, Captain Hamilton.  For Christ's sake, have a bath.
L232364 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ HAMILTON +++$+++ I'll be twenty next year, sir.
L232363 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ How old are you, Captain?
L232176 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Then use rocks!
L232175 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ HAMILTON +++$+++ We've got powder but no ball!
L232174 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Hamilton, you're going to have to cover our asses as we cross.
L232173 +++$+++ u1054 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ HAMILTON +++$+++ Captain Alexander Hamilton, sir!
L232194 +++$+++ u1055 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ HORATIO GATES +++$+++ George, we've got to get you out there before we lose our whole army.
L232193 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Who the hell knows?  Everyone's giving orders.  It's all very democratic.
L232192 +++$+++ u1055 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ HORATIO GATES +++$+++ Who's in command out there?
L232191 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ The last I heard, a bunch of drunken militia have dug in on Breed's hill.  With one stroke the British could cut them off and apparently their leaders are too dumb to see it.
L232190 +++$+++ u1055 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ HORATIO GATES +++$+++ Good day, Mister Adams... George, what's the word from Boston?
L232189 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Horatio!  Horatio Gates, of course you know John Adams of the Massachusetts Delegation.
L232888 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went?
L232887 +++$+++ u1056 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ JOHN ADAMS +++$+++ They are... friends of Congress.
L232886 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Of course the army will acquit him, that's not the point... Arnold is a man and will understand.  What I need to understand is, John, Sam... what is happening here?  Who are those people in there?  The fat ones in silk?
L232885 +++$+++ u1056 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ JOHN ADAMS +++$+++ George, I'm sorry.  We all know the army will acquit Arnold...
L232868 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Lafayette is my friend!  He believes in glory and truth and the freedom of all mankind; so, of course he's a child.  But he would have died before he would have let me down.
L232867 +++$+++ u1056 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ JOHN ADAMS +++$+++ Lafayette is a child!
L232866 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ If he supports the British why is it that every time he gets near them he kills so many of them?  Unlike General Lee... who you and Congress backed for second in command and who is a goddamned incompetent!
L232223 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ I think many would like to see him commander-in-chief.
L232222 +++$+++ u1056 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ JOHN ADAMS +++$+++ Colonel Charles Lee... Hounds and all.  Quite the character.  He's got a tremendous reputation.
L232215 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ I don't know:  delivering men and delivering men with their goodwill are two different things.  And, if he's popular with his men...
L232214 +++$+++ u1056 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ JOHN ADAMS +++$+++ You won't be needing his largess, Rhode Island is already committed to your appointment.
L232196 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ As does your ability, Horatio.  We must talk further, when it's more convenient.
L232195 +++$+++ u1056 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ JOHN ADAMS +++$+++ With your support, Horatio.  As one of our own who has seen combat with the British, your opinion counts.
L232188 +++$+++ u1056 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ JOHN ADAMS +++$+++ Yes, an astonishing power over weak minds.
L232187 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Well, John Adams, your cousin has a marvelous gift.
L232890 +++$+++ u1063 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SAM ADAMS +++$+++ It's the political 'cost of doing business', George.
L232889 +++$+++ u1056 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ JOHN ADAMS +++$+++ Partially...
L232646 +++$+++ u1056 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ JOHN ADAMS +++$+++ Again, just to touch on a touchy subject, but... would the people accept another leader over Washington?
L232645 +++$+++ u1063 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SAM ADAMS +++$+++ Finally!?  It's people like these who, as soon as they get a little power, want more and more.  More ale, here!
L232644 +++$+++ u1056 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ JOHN ADAMS +++$+++ No one wants another failure right now, God knows.  But people like Arnold and, God knows, I'm having my fears about General Washington.
L232641 +++$+++ u1063 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SAM ADAMS +++$+++ He has the soul of an aristocrat who'd like nothing more than to become a king in the minds of the people!
L232640 +++$+++ u1056 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ JOHN ADAMS +++$+++ You think that?
L232638 +++$+++ u1063 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SAM ADAMS +++$+++ You invented this, this...
L232637 +++$+++ u1056 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ JOHN ADAMS +++$+++ Oh, come now...
L232636 +++$+++ u1063 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SAM ADAMS +++$+++ Gag on your own invention, then.
L232635 +++$+++ u1056 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ JOHN ADAMS +++$+++ Makes you gag.
L232634 +++$+++ u1063 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SAM ADAMS +++$+++ I tell you every damned place I go the man is adored!  "General Washington!  Champion of Trenton! Savior of the Republic!"  And you should hear the way people are deprecating Congress!
L232633 +++$+++ u1056 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ JOHN ADAMS +++$+++ Let's not over do it...
L232235 +++$+++ u1056 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ JOHN ADAMS +++$+++ Hancock led the Boston 'tea party' because he's a goddamned tea smuggler!  He wasn't protesting inequality, he was eliminating competition.  Now, you listen to me:  we need to get a Southerner elected commander-in-chief, or the south will not fight!  What have we been struggling for all these years?  For this moment!  And, if we fail now, remember:  you stopped us!
L232234 +++$+++ u1063 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ SAM ADAMS +++$+++ He's from Virginia -- there is no more classist, elitist... English place on earth than Virginia.  And, what in hell has he done for our cause?  Washington has been preaching compromise, compromise, compromise!  Hancock acts, he led the Boston Tea party!  That's why New England loves him.
L232233 +++$+++ u1056 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ JOHN ADAMS +++$+++ Washington is perfect.  He's a Southerner, he's a war hero and he's rich!
L232345 +++$+++ u1061 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ NATHANAEL GREENE +++$+++ What's the difference?
L232344 +++$+++ u1057 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ JOSEPH REED +++$+++ Unofficially, General Greene.
L232343 +++$+++ u1061 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ NATHANAEL GREENE +++$+++ We already have black soldiers in our army...
L232342 +++$+++ u1057 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ JOSEPH REED +++$+++ Congress is bitterly opposed to allowing Negroes in the army!
L232339 +++$+++ u1061 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ NATHANAEL GREENE +++$+++ The British Army is right back there, across that river!  Sir!  I think it must be something else that detains General Lee.
L232338 +++$+++ u1057 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ JOSEPH REED +++$+++ The British army, sir!
L232337 +++$+++ u1061 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ NATHANAEL GREENE +++$+++ Detained by what?
L232336 +++$+++ u1057 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ JOSEPH REED +++$+++ General Lee is detained captain...
L232335 +++$+++ u1061 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ NATHANAEL GREENE +++$+++ I hear General Lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in New York -- why won't he come on!?
L232334 +++$+++ u1057 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ JOSEPH REED +++$+++ No officer is going to get these men to fight!  They had the life crushed out of them on Long Island. At the most, perhaps we could make a feint at an outpost, then retire to protect Congress.
L232333 +++$+++ u1061 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ NATHANAEL GREENE +++$+++ These men have suffered but I believe they will fight.
L232332 +++$+++ u1057 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ JOSEPH REED +++$+++ Did God ever make such a pitiful army?
L232331 +++$+++ u1057 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ JOSEPH REED +++$+++ If he isn't, then he's stupid.
L232330 +++$+++ u1061 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ NATHANAEL GREENE +++$+++ I doubt Arnold will be afraid.
L232883 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Are you all going insane!? Benedict Arnold!  The man who stopped the British on Lake Champlain!  Who carried the day at Saratoga!  Goddamn-it, Joseph, you own two mansions, ride in an expensive, Tory coach!  You are all nothing but a pack of greedy pigs!
L232882 +++$+++ u1057 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ JOSEPH REED +++$+++ Well, I shall deny him to you!  He is evil on earth!
L232881 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Arnold is indispensable, do you understand?  I need Arnold to help me win this war!
L232863 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ How can you say that?
L232862 +++$+++ u1057 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ JOSEPH REED +++$+++ The man is a traitor!
L232861 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Gentlemen, let me get to the point, I can't see the wisdom of pursuing this old court-martial against General Arnold.
L232611 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Joseph, are you afraid to cross that river with me?  I accept your resignation.  With regret.  You have leave to return to Philadelphia...
L232610 +++$+++ u1057 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ JOSEPH REED +++$+++ Understand?  You need to be listening to people like John Adams, and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind!
L232609 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ They help me understand why we fight.
L232608 +++$+++ u1057 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ JOSEPH REED +++$+++ And, Hamilton?  Greene?
L232607 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ How many generals do we have like Arnold?  He's got guts -- he's vain, and he fights!
L232606 +++$+++ u1057 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ JOSEPH REED +++$+++ George, I'm afraid if you go through with this madness I must tender my resignation as your aide. I see where we're headed, you're putting your trust in the likes of Hamilton and Arnold...
L232605 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ They are also very religious.  So, we will attack them three days from now, on Christmas.  One force under me, and another to the south under Colonel Cadwalader...
L232604 +++$+++ u1057 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ JOSEPH REED +++$+++ But the Hessians are there!  No one can beat them!  That's why Cornwallis stationed them there! They have the post of honor!  They are invincible!
L232572 +++$+++ u1057 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ JOSEPH REED +++$+++ No, I did not.  Really?  Well, what the hell is a deist, precisely?
L232571 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ I mean, I'm a Deist.  A belief I share with the likes of Tom Jefferson and Ben Franklin.  Surely you knew that.
L232570 +++$+++ u1057 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ JOSEPH REED +++$+++ What do you mean you're not a Christian?  Of course you're a Christian, we're all Christians...
L232562 +++$+++ u1057 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ JOSEPH REED +++$+++ To assert the rights of our founding fathers!  This country was colonized by Christians!  This shall become a Christian revolution.  Surely as a good Christian you understand that!
L232561 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ No.  As a matter of fact I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about.
L232560 +++$+++ u1057 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ JOSEPH REED +++$+++ A ground swell-Christian movement, George, you see?
L232559 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ A grand scheme?
L232557 +++$+++ u1057 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ JOSEPH REED +++$+++ Well, George, Congress just passed a resolution censuring Arnold for destruction of government property. I wouldn't cast my fate with that man.
L232556 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Joseph, the British spent thousands of pounds and precious months putting together a fleet that Arnold stopped by sacrificing a heap of old barges.  In my opinion he saved my army.
L232555 +++$+++ u1057 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ JOSEPH REED +++$+++ That damned Arnold is here, isn't he?  Did you know he lost all his ships?  Outrageous and completely unacceptable.
L232554 +++$+++ u1057 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ JOSEPH REED +++$+++ George!  So good to be back!
L232553 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Colonel Reed...
L232349 +++$+++ u1057 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ JOSEPH REED +++$+++ I understand, George.
L232348 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ If we have any hope for a compromise or truce with England now, we have to hold on here:  our men must believe they can win -- the British must believe that somehow, in some mad, impossible way we might actually be able to hurt them.
L232329 +++$+++ u1057 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ JOSEPH REED +++$+++ What can he do?  The British have massive superiority.
L232328 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ My God... They mean to finish us. What about Arnold?  He's up there.
L232325 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ A fleet?
L232324 +++$+++ u1057 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ JOSEPH REED +++$+++ Spies from Quebec confirm that the British are sending an entire fleet down Lake Champlain...
L232323 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Any word from Canada?
L232914 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ I will continue with our French allies, concentrating on New York.
L232913 +++$+++ u1058 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ LAFAYETTE +++$+++ I feel the same, sir.
L232817 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Get these men back in line!
L232816 +++$+++ u1058 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ LAFAYETTE +++$+++ General Lee, sir!
L232815 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ My God!  Who ordered this retreat?!
L232791 +++$+++ u1058 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ LAFAYETTE +++$+++ My baby daughter has died... my baby... mon petite Henriette...
L232790 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ What is it, Marquis?
L232758 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ When the snow melts, mon petite Marquis, I suspect the only thing blossoming will be bright red British soldiers.
L232757 +++$+++ u1058 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ LAFAYETTE +++$+++ Like flowers after the snow melts.
L232752 +++$+++ u1058 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ LAFAYETTE +++$+++ Yes, I will write him and tell his ministers and the court.
L232751 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Because, if the British got off their asses and came up here, now, we would be smashed.  And the revolution would be finished.  Tell King Louis, it's that bad.
L232744 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Chose another.  Any general worth anything should have a brace of horses.
L232743 +++$+++ u1058 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ LAFAYETTE +++$+++ I rode here, on my horse.
L232742 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Well, we will accept these charming little gifts.  When we see them. Meanwhile, please, take your pick of a horse.
L232741 +++$+++ u1058 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ LAFAYETTE +++$+++ Sir, these are our finest firearms from the armory at Charleville! They are a gift from the people of France!
L232740 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ And how rusty are these muskets?
L232739 +++$+++ u1058 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ LAFAYETTE +++$+++ Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets.
L232738 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ These supplies...?
L232737 +++$+++ u1058 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ LAFAYETTE +++$+++ I only meant...
L232736 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ 'Charming little victories?' Please don't expect much more of us, Monsieur.
L232735 +++$+++ u1058 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ LAFAYETTE +++$+++ I am.  Then, I understand you too serve without salary.  You know, since your charming little victories at Trenton and Princeton, the French court is softening.  I expect any time now a ship load of supplies...
L232734 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ You must be very rich.
L232733 +++$+++ u1058 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ LAFAYETTE +++$+++ Mon General, I have come here to learn and to give, not to take.  I am serving without salary.
L232732 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ No, please; an advance on your salary.
L232731 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ The one with 'Philadelphia' spelled correctly is the counterfeit.
L232730 +++$+++ u1058 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ LAFAYETTE +++$+++ I... they look both the same.
L232729 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ 'Continentals', Congress' paper money.  It was worthless to start with, but as you see, counter feiters have made them even less than worthless.  Can you tell which one is fake?
L232723 +++$+++ u1058 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ LAFAYETTE +++$+++ Uh... none just now, but...
L232722 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Gentlemen, my I introduce a French gentleman, recently appointed major general by Congress...  Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette. General Lafayette has brought us the greetings and goodwill of his countrymen, and... how many cases of muskets, Mon petite Marquis?
L232720 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ What I want to know is sir:  where is your daddy?
L232719 +++$+++ u1058 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ LAFAYETTE +++$+++ Sir, please accept my commission from Congress... and...  You must see this portrait of my beautiful wife, Adrienne, we had the most perfect little baby girl just before I left.  Her name is Henriette...
L232718 +++$+++ u1058 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ LAFAYETTE +++$+++ But, general, I assure you my motives are sincere.
L232717 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ We have more officers created by Congress than we know what to do with.
L232716 +++$+++ u1058 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ LAFAYETTE +++$+++ However, through my relations with members of his majesty's court, I am a representative of the French government whose deepest desire is to be one people, united with our American brothers in arms to defeat the rapacious armies of King George of England.  Vive la France!  Vive l'Amerique!
L232700 +++$+++ u1059 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ I don't want to see your hospital.
L232699 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ I want you to see our hospital.
L232698 +++$+++ u1059 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Not today.
L232697 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Come out and meet my soldiers. They're good people.
L232696 +++$+++ u1059 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Leave me, now sir, I am tired.
L232695 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Martha!  For God's sake!
L232694 +++$+++ u1059 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Well, we must keep in mind the Dower Laws.  One third of everything we have is mine and since our Negroes have been interbreeding, it would be legally impossible to distinguish them.
L232693 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Our 'kind'?  What is that supposed to mean?  These men are all I have left and they stay because they will fight!  They desire it!  They seek it!  Of course Virginia is terrified!  For my soldiers this is a war to obliterate the 'upper class' from the face of the earth! Should I tell them all to go home because if they win it will ruin me!?  It is impossible for me to imagine that Negroes are fighting so that only white men may be free! If we win this war they will own this country too!
L232692 +++$+++ u1059 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Don't condescend to me!  We have both of us prospered from the arrangements of our kind...
L232691 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Is that why you come in here tossing pennies to my starving men? It's damned condescending!
L232690 +++$+++ u1059 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Some things must never change.
L232689 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ What's the point of a revolution if it doesn't?
L232688 +++$+++ u1059 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Oh, indeed?  You know very well people are frightened of arming the Negroes!  They beg you to consider the future.  What good is a revolution if it overturns those things we cherish!?
L232687 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ To win this war I need an army.
L232686 +++$+++ u1059 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army.  There's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal.  They wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests.
L232685 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Martha... what?
L232684 +++$+++ u1059 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Well, I wouldn't want to trouble you with this now.
L232683 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ What else?  From Virginia?
L232682 +++$+++ u1059 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ It's an anti-Christian dogma!  I cannot believe you are so calm about it!
L232681 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ I think I heard that.
L232680 +++$+++ u1059 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Did you know that Jefferson has proposed a law in Virginia aiming at an absolute separation of state from the church?
L232304 +++$+++ u1059 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ And have you heard anything from our dear friend, Sally?  What with all the rumors getting back to England.  I thought she might inquire after us.  But then I believe she always looked down on us.
L232303 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ That's right...
L232302 +++$+++ u1059 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ That's when Sally Fairfax was tutoring you...
L232301 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ When I was a young man we used to recite Cato... We would come together recite it like they were words from heaven.  Devotion to country, duty, purity of heart... Purity of heart.  I was drunk on something then...
L232300 +++$+++ u1059 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ When you lived with the Fairfaxes?
L232299 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ "Liberty, Virtue, Country"... That's from Cato... you know, that play about the noble Romans?  As I was riding up to Philadelphia, I found myself thinking about the old days...
L232298 +++$+++ u1059 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ You're no fool, George.  You never have been.
L232297 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ But, as usual, it will not go well for... them.  Martha, you must trust me.
L232294 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Everything.  If we force Britain into concessions it will open up the western lands -- and that would be a boon for our family.  We already have more slaves than we need, but we need more land.
L232293 +++$+++ u1059 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ And, what 'prize' do you see?  What could we possible gain?
L232292 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ The day Tom Jefferson frees a slave I'll ride naked through the streets of Williamsburg on a mule.  Tom Jefferson is one of those people who talks big and acts small.  The only man out there who really does what he says is Sam Adams and everyone thinks he's crazy.  Believe me, this 'disturbance' isn't going to last long.  You have to understand, congress is a chicken coop full of foxes, Martha, each and every one has his eye on a nice, fat prize.
L232291 +++$+++ u1059 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Have you been reading what Minister Jefferson has to say?  If he had his way, all our slaves would be freed no matter what the outcome. And that would destroy us as surely as a British victory.
L232290 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Don't be ridiculous, of course that won't happen.
L232289 +++$+++ u1059 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated, to be destroyed...
L232288 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ I'm very aware of that.
L232287 +++$+++ u1059 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Well, a very real expectation is the British will hang you!  They'll burn Mount Vernon and they'll hang you!  Our marriage is a business just as surely as...
L232286 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ The eternal dream of the disenfranchised, my dear:  a classless world.  Not a very real expectation.
L232285 +++$+++ u1059 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ My God, what?
L232284 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Of course, if it were that simple.  These people?  They're after something else...
L232283 +++$+++ u1059 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ But to go to war over trade, over money?  Surely there's still time for a compromise.
L232282 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Our beloved father, the King, also refuses to bend.
L232281 +++$+++ u1059 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ War?  No!  I did not!  When you said compromise was possible I believed it was probable.  There's no middle ground at all?  We're the King's children!
L232280 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Surely you knew this was coming.
L232279 +++$+++ u1059 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ My God, these people mean to go to war!  They really mean it.
L232278 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ It's another demonstration against the king.  This is the wildest yet.
L232966 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ You know, I came back to Mount Vernon to retire.  I don't need to be in government.
L232965 +++$+++ u1061 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ NATHANAEL GREENE +++$+++ If the constitution is ratified... we'll have a country.  They'll want to elect you president of the convention, which means president of the country.
L232960 +++$+++ u1061 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ NATHANAEL GREENE +++$+++ It is; we need you George.
L232959 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Well, this must be about something!
L232917 +++$+++ u1061 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ NATHANAEL GREENE +++$+++ Yes sir, it's a wise idea...
L232916 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ They're for my bodyguard.  I have an absolute conviction that Arnold is planning to have me assassinated!  It will be harder if I am surrounded by a body of men who look like me, don't you think?
L232915 +++$+++ u1061 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ NATHANAEL GREENE +++$+++ Sir, I have to act on instructions from you ordering thirty copies of your own dress uniform...
L232912 +++$+++ u1061 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ NATHANAEL GREENE +++$+++ I'm honored, but, reluctant to leave you.
L232911 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Nathanael, I'm sending you to Virginia to head the southern army, to harass Cornwallis.  Marquis, you must go with him.
L232828 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ You've got to stop them here or our whole line will cave-in!  It's all right boys, I'm here!
L232827 +++$+++ u1061 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ NATHANAEL GREENE +++$+++ What the hell are we doing?
L232597 +++$+++ u1061 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ NATHANAEL GREENE +++$+++ Then, maybe I do see what you're after -- perhaps... you get to chose again...
L232596 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ At one time I could have chosen not to be.
L232595 +++$+++ u1061 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ NATHANAEL GREENE +++$+++ But you are an aristocrat and a slave owner.  Sir.
L232594 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ I will not betray you, Nathanael.
L232593 +++$+++ u1061 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ NATHANAEL GREENE +++$+++ No.  We're all of us after something.  It's easy for me to fight for the common man.  My father could only dream that I would be... a general someday?  And what of my daughter or son?  I know what I'm after.  But now, with all this talk about compromise?  It means the rich will just be more wealthy and the common man has no hope.
L232592 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ You don't believe I can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism?
L232591 +++$+++ u1061 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ NATHANAEL GREENE +++$+++ Sir, if you don't mind my saying, I don't understand your history at all.  I mean, why would you want to win the war?  You're not after glory, like Benedict...  You're a slave owner, and yet you invite blacks to fight in your army.
L232544 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ You have a free tongue, Captain Hamilton.
L232543 +++$+++ u1061 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ NATHANAEL GREENE +++$+++ They're just disgusting, jealous, bottom-feeding swine.  It's their nature.
L232378 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ Yes, I thought that's how you'd feel, Nathanael.
L232377 +++$+++ u1061 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ NATHANAEL GREENE +++$+++ I'm with Captain Hamilton.
L232376 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ General Greene?
L232362 +++$+++ u1061 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ NATHANAEL GREENE +++$+++ You wrong me, general; I am an officer and a horse-shoer.
L232361 +++$+++ u1064 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ WASHINGTON +++$+++ I certainly didn't mean you.  Of course you are a gentleman, an officer and a gentleman.
L232360 +++$+++ u1061 +++$+++ m69 +++$+++ NATHANAEL GREENE +++$+++ Well sir, I was an ironmaster before you got me.  Maybe I will let you down yet.
