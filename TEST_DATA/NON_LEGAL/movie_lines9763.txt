L175720 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Why aren't you on your honeymoon? Where's Myrna?
L175719 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Shit!  Bela, what's with the gun?
L175718 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Why are you here??
L175609 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I know it's a lot to give you at the last second.
L175608 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Eddie, this is quite a scene.
L175607 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I wrote something special for you. I got to thinking about all the sacrifices you've made... and so I wrote you a new final speech.
L175606 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Well, there aren't too many other fellas I'd do it for...
L175605 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No.  Seriously.  I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done for me.  A great man like you shouldn't have to run around in freezing water at four in the morning.
L175604 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ That's fine, Eddie.  All in the line of duty.
L175603 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Bela.  I just wanna thank you again for last night.
L175597 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Alright!  Let's put it on film. CAMERA!  SOUND!
L175596 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Don't let me slow you down.
L175595 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Bela, I've got twenty-five scenes to shoot tonight.
L175594 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ After I did "Dracula," the studio offered me "Frankenstein"!  But I turned it down, the part wasn't sexy enough.  It was too degrading for a big star like me.
L175593 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Huh?
L175592 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Do you know I turned down "Frankenstein"?
L175591 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Bela, somebody misplaced the motor. So when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it's killing you.
L175590 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Okay!  How do we turn this thing on?
L175589 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Fuck you!  <u>You</u> come out here.  Hey, toss me that J.D.
L175588 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Once you're in it, it warms up.
L175587 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Goddamn, it's cold!
L175586 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Oh, for Christ's sake.
L175585 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ This'll look a lot better.  We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater.
L175584 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Out <u>there</u>?!  What happened to the stream?
L175583 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You'll be fighting with the octopus.
L175582 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Let's shoot this fucker!  Where do I go?
L175576 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Nonsense!  You look great --  Look, uh, why don't you lie down and take a little nap?  We'll film around you for a while.
L175575 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Eddie, I'm so tired... I don't know if I can handle a night shoot...
L175503 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Correct.  So instead, I stayed here, waiting for my comeback.  Always hoping... the next film, the next film... that would be the one.
L175502 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ But maybe not.
L175501 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ I didn't know if it was a trick. They might arrest me and throw me in a gulag.  I am Hungary's most famous emigrant. they'd use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave.
L175500 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ So why didn't you do it?
L175499 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ It was a very impressive offer. Fancy offices, a big home... I'd be treated like a king.
L175498 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Really?
L175497 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ In life, the decisions that haunt you are the ones where you just don't know... where right or wrong will never be answered.  Years ago, the Hungarians contacted me.  The government wanted me to come home, to be Minister of Culture.
L175496 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah, I did.
L175495 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Eddie, you screwed up.
L175494 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ But was it a bad decision?  At the time, I thought her money would save the movie.
L175493 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Bad decisions are easy to live with. Forget.  Just keep looking forward.
L175492 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Was I wrong to cast Loretta?
L175488 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ This is the Philosophical Research Society.  A refuge for free thinkers. I've been coming here for twenty years.
L175487 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What is this place?
L175485 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Stop worrying.  This is going to raise your spirits.
L175484 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Bela, I don't know what I'm doin' anymore...
L175429 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ "Dear, you're lovely."  "Strap her to the table."
L175428 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ That's fine, Bela.  We're still rolling.  Just say "Dear, you're lovely."
L175427 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ "Dear, you are a woman of super strength and beauty.  A lovely vision of exquisitely beauty -- shit!"  Damn!  Eddie, I'm sorry I can't remember all this.  I'm an old man. It's too long.
L175423 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Okay.  Then you'll be sitting on the <u>left</u>.
L175422 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ I'm not getting near that goddamn thing.  One of those burned me on "The Return Of Chandu."
L175421 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You'll be sitting on the right.
L175420 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You're shooting "Bride Of The Atom." Scene 85.
L175419 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Mmph?  Where am I?
L175418 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Bela, are you ready?
L175353 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ We didn't make a dime.
L175352 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ So how'd we do?
L175351 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Goodbye!  Goodbye!
L175312 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Forget about it.  We'll make our new movie, and you'll be a star again.
L175311 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ I never said I could ad-lib...
L175310 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Bela, don't worry.  You're better than all this crap.
L175294 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Ach!  How do they expect a Hungarian to pronounce this dialogue?  This live television is madness!
L175293 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No Bela, that's "incorporates."  Look, just say "This casket has..."
L175292 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ "Beg to differ.  This casket incarpratates, er, inporporates --"
L175291 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ "Oh, tract housing, huh?"  Laugh. "You need a new real estate agent."
L175290 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ "It is my home."
L175289 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ "Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure." Audience laughs.  Applause.  "Say, that's a funny place to sleep."
L175288 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ "Greetings.  I am the Count."
L175278 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Don't worry.  I'll do something.
L175277 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Morphine, with a demerol chaser.  Eddie, I'm so broke.  I don't know what I'm gonna do...
L175276 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What's in the needle?
L175275 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I don't know how to make goulash.
L175274 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Goulash.
L175273 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Is there anything I can get you? Water?  A blanket?
L175272 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Nah.  This happens all the time...
L175271 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Should I call a doctor?
L175270 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ No hospital.  Just take me to the couch...
L175269 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Let me take you to the hospital.
L175268 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ I didn't feel well...
L175267 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Bela, what happened?!
L175191 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I gotta type this up, while it's still fresh!
L175190 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Ah!  This is very exciting.
L175189 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No!  <u>Doctor Acula</u>!  You can still wear the cape, have the fangs... but you're a doctor!  Not a count.
L175188 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Dracula?
L175187 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Ha-ha!  Dr. Acula!
L175186 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ They do?  Shoot.  There <u>must</u> be a way to get around that...
L175185 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ We can't.  Those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
L175184 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ So let's make another "Dracula." Let's make "The Return of Dracula"!
L175183 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Those bastards at Universal.  I made so much money for them, and now I can't get the time of day.
L175182 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Of course!
L175181 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Hmm... my biggest hit?  That would probably be "Dracula."
L175180 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ But we need to start off with a bang! Something we <u>know</u> the audience will want to see.  Mmm.  What was your biggest hit?
L175179 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ That's good.  I could use the money.
L175178 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Sure.  Romance, that's great!  To engineer your comeback, we're gonna need a whole slate of pictures.  Once "Glen Or Glenda" takes off, we'll slam you into one, then another, then another!
L175177 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Well... can't I play the romantic part?  I'm tired of always being the bad guy.  You know, back in Hungary, I played Romeo!  I would like to be the lover again -- me, in a boat, with the girl...
L175176 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Uh, a cop.  NO!  You play the father. He's <u>angry</u>!  He doesn't like seeing his son -- no -- he doesn't like seeing his <u>daughter</u> behave this way!
L175175 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Who do I play?
L175174 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Eh, forget it.  What else is big?  Teenagers!  Jailbait pics!  Yeah... You got the juvenile delinquent, his girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks --
L175173 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ But, I don't like horses.  Do I have to get on one?
L175172 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ How 'bout a western?  People love westerns.
L175127 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ BULLSHIT!  I am ready now!  Roll the camera!!
L175126 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Look, you seem a little agitated. Do you maybe wanna take a little break, go for a nice walk... and then we'll come back and shoot the scene?
L175125 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Of course!  Dracula requires <u>presence</u>.  It's all in the voice, and the eyes, and the hand --
L175124 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You're right, Bela.  Now Dracula, <u>that's</u> a part that takes acting.
L175115 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Huh?!  Oh yeah, of course.
L175114 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Uh, Eddie, do you have my money?
L175113 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Of course!  Well, we got a big day planned for you... First, we're gonna start off a little easy, with you in that armchair over there.  Then, once you're up to speed and cooking, we'll reset and bring out the laboratory equipment --
L175112 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ I am always on time.
L175111 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Bela! It's so great to see you!  And eight o'clock on the dot.  Right on time!
L175058 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah.  You pull the strings --  "Pull the strings"... hey, that's pretty good!
L175057 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Ah, so I pull the strings!
L175056 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.
L175055 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ I don't understand.
L175054 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Ehh, your part's a little different. You're like the God that looks down on all the characters, and oversees everything.
L175053 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Oh, like Jekyll and Hyde!  Ah, I've always wanted to play Jekyll and Hyde!  I'm looking forward to this production.
L175052 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Well, It's about how people have two personalities.  The side they show to the world, and then the secret person they hide inside.
L175051 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Eddie, what kind of movie is this?
L175050 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah, it's gonna be a great picture! You'll love your character!  Bunny, Bela's here.  Look, hit the bars, work some parties, and get me transvestites!  <u>I need transvestites</u>!
L175049 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Eddie, you got a new movie for me?!
L175022 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Don't worry.  I do it every Halloween.
L175021 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Are you sure this is okay?
L175013 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ No thank you, Eddie.  I'll be alright.
L175012 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Do you want me to get it for you?
L175011 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ I am getting tired.  I need to take my medicine.
L175010 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ You must be double-jointed, and you must be Hungarian.  Vampira, look at me!  Stare into my eyes.
L175009 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Hey Bela, how do you do that?
L175008 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Vampira!  You will come under my spell!  You will be my slave of love.
L175007 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ I think she's a honey.  Look at those jugs.
L175006 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Ugh!  I hate the way she interrupts the pictures.  She doesn't show 'em the proper respect.
L174982 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Certainly.  But now the children of the night are calling me.
L174981 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Well... I guess I should go.  Perhaps we could get together again?
L174980 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Shh!  I'm coming!  I will feed you!
L174978 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Take my word for it.  You want to "score" with a young lady, you take her to see "Dracula."
L174977 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I never thought of that.
L174976 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ The pure horror, it both repels and attracts them.  Because in their collective unconsciousness, they have the agony of childbirth.  The blood. The blood is horror.
L174975 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ The <u>women</u>?
L174974 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ They were <u>mythic</u>.  They had a poetry to them.  And you know what else?  The women prefer the traditional monsters.
L174973 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ The old ones were much spookier. They had castles, full moons...
L174972 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ They don't want the classic horror films anymore.  Today, it's all giant bugs, giant spiders, giant grasshoppers -- who would believe such nonsense!
L174971 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ No more.  I haven't worked in four years.  This town, it chews you up, then spits you out.  I'm just an ex-bogeyman.  Make a right.
L174970 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ But you're a big star!
L174969 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Back in the old days, yes.  But now -- no one give two fucks for Bela.
L174968 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Ah, you gotta be jokin'!  A great man like you... I'll bet you have dozens of 'em lined up.
L174967 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ I have no next picture.
L174966 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Boy, Mr. Lugosi, you must lead such an exciting life.  When is your next picture coming out?
L174965 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ I refuse to drive in this country. Too many madmen.
L174964 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Don't you bave a car?
L174963 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Oh, there's my bus.  Shit, where's my transfer?!
L174962 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ I apologize.  When I play Dracula, I put myself into a trance.  It takes me much time to re-emerge.
L174961 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I waited to get your autograph, but you never came outside.
L174960 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Thank you.
L174959 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I thought it was great.  You were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie.
L174958 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Eh, that was a terrible production. Renfield was a drunk!
L174957 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You know, I saw you perform "Dracula."  In Poughkeepsie, in 1938.
L174956 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Yes.  I'm embarking on another bus- andótruck tour of "Dracula." Twelve cities in ten days, if that's conceivable.
L174955 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Really?
L174954 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Because I'm planning on dying soon.
L174953 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Why were you buying a coffin?
L174952 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Ha!
L174951 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I don't want anything.  I'm just a really big, big fan.  I've seen all your movies.
L174950 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Who are you?  What do you want?
L174949 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ Huh?
L174948 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No.  I don't work here.
L174947 +++$+++ u4934 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ BELA +++$+++ I told you, I don't want any of your goddamn coffins.
L174946 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Excuse me, Mr. Lugosi??
L175392 +++$+++ u4941 +++$+++ m329 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ If you say so.
