L221678 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ You didn't say 'Symington says'.
L221677 +++$+++ u967 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ SYMINGTON +++$+++ Is there something else?
L221675 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Oh, that's good, very professional. In control. But the tiny beads of sweat on your upper lip give you away.
L221674 +++$+++ u967 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ SYMINGTON +++$+++ I'll have someone show you to your room.
L221673 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you?  Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better...  and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable...  then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, "Doctor?"
L221672 +++$+++ u967 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ SYMINGTON +++$+++ Stay calm, please.
L221671 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ This whole thing is a joke!
L221670 +++$+++ u967 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ SYMINGTON +++$+++ Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
L221669 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ ...Did you really say that?
L221668 +++$+++ u967 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ SYMINGTON +++$+++ All right. Will you please sit down now?  Symington says.
L221667 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Normal. Average.
L221666 +++$+++ u967 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ SYMINGTON +++$+++ And what's that?
L221665 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Besides, I don't want to be what you want to make me.
L221664 +++$+++ u967 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ SYMINGTON +++$+++ I see.
L221663 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
L221662 +++$+++ u967 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ SYMINGTON +++$+++ Please sit down...
L221661 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Do you expect me, for one moment, to believe you have greater insight into my personality than I do?
L221660 +++$+++ u967 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ SYMINGTON +++$+++ Among persons such as yourself, creative people under great stress, erratic behavior is not at all uncommon and certainly nothing to be ashamed of. It's just that the neuroses which fuel your talent can also generate certain character disabilities which... 
L221659 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Oh! Are you really?
L221657 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Why, Doctor! We've only just met!
L221656 +++$+++ u967 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ SYMINGTON +++$+++ So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
L221655 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ It ain't for lack of trying.
L221654 +++$+++ u967 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ SYMINGTON +++$+++ I'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.
L221653 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.
L221652 +++$+++ u967 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ SYMINGTON +++$+++ Thanks are hardly necessary.
L221651 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?
L221650 +++$+++ u967 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ SYMINGTON +++$+++ I find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance.
L220977 +++$+++ u960 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ KAMINSKI +++$+++ Good! Because, Brothers, that's you!
L220976 +++$+++ u968 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ YORK & CROWD +++$+++ No! No!
L220975 +++$+++ u960 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ KAMINSKI +++$+++ Is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country?
L220974 +++$+++ u968 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ YORK & CROWD +++$+++ No!
L220973 +++$+++ u960 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ KAMINSKI +++$+++ Is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future, and the future of your children?
L220972 +++$+++ u968 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ YORK & CROWD +++$+++ No!
L220971 +++$+++ u960 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ KAMINSKI +++$+++ And do you think it's radical for a man to have a job and feed a family?
L222021 +++$+++ u965 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ OLDER NURSE +++$+++ 'Incurable.'
L222020 +++$+++ u970 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ YOUNG NURSE +++$+++ What?
L222019 +++$+++ u965 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ OLDER NURSE +++$+++ Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure hate to use that word.
L222018 +++$+++ u970 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ YOUNG NURSE +++$+++ You're kidding.
L222017 +++$+++ u965 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ OLDER NURSE +++$+++ I checked the files. This one holds the record for shock treatments. Four hundred seventeen and no end in sight.
L222016 +++$+++ u970 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ YOUNG NURSE +++$+++ Yeah?
L222015 +++$+++ u965 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ OLDER NURSE +++$+++ I don't know why they even bother. She's had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant.
L222770 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ Build for him a pyre. Light up the sky with his passing.
L222769 +++$+++ u982 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALTON +++$+++ What kindness?
L222768 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ I've never been shown a kindness. Show me one now.
L222766 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ Would you not? He was father. And mother. We fell from grace together. He from his God. I from mine.
L222765 +++$+++ u982 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALTON +++$+++ Then why weep for him?
L222764 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ And he drove me to mine.
L222763 +++$+++ u982 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALTON +++$+++ You drove him to his torment.
L222762 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ I am as he made me. In his own image.
L222761 +++$+++ u982 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALTON +++$+++ What is that to you? Evil as you are.
L222760 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ I longed to be with him. But I wanted his final moments to have peace. I could see you were a friend to him.
L222759 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ I was watching.
L222758 +++$+++ u982 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALTON +++$+++ Yes.
L222757 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ You were with him at the end.
L222502 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ I am afraid.
L222501 +++$+++ u974 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ People can be kinder than you think.
L222500 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ I have been... afraid. Afraid... they will hate me... because I am so very ugly... and they are so very beautiful
L222499 +++$+++ u974 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ Why do you not go to them?
L222498 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ Yes. Very close
L222497 +++$+++ u974 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ Friends? Do they live around here?
L222496 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ Yes. I have been seeking my friends.
L222495 +++$+++ u974 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ You're an outcast.
L222493 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ Worse.
L222492 +++$+++ u974 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ It can't be as bad as that.
L222491 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you.
L222490 +++$+++ u974 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ Why?
L222489 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ Better that way... for me.
L222488 +++$+++ u974 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ I'm glad you finally came to the door. A man shouldn't have to scurry in the shadows.
L222487 +++$+++ u974 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ The music? Or the fire?
L222486 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ Nice.
L222739 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ SHE'LL NEVER BE YOURS! SHE SAID MY NAME! SHE REMEMBERS!
L222738 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ GET AWAY FROM HER! SHE'S MINE!
L222734 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ I'm sure the lady knows her own mind. Doesn't she? Let her decide the proper suitor.
L222733 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ She's not for you.
L222732 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ She's beautiful.
L222677 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ That is mild compared to what will come. If you deny me my wedding night. I'll be with you on yours.
L222676 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I will not! Kill me now!
L222675 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ You will honor your promise to me!
L222674 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ No. I draw the line.
L222673 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ What does it matter? She'll live again. You'll make her.
L222672 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ This was not taken from a grave.
L222671 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ A brain. Extremities.
L222670 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ What is this?
L222664 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ Her body pleases me.
L222663 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Why... her?
L222642 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ I'll be waiting. And watching.
L222641 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Yes. I want this over and done with.
L222640 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ Soon?
L222639 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ We'd travel north, my bride and I. To the furthest reaches of the Pole, where no man has ever set foot. There we would live out our lives. Together.  No human eye would ever see us again. This I vow.
L222638 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ And if I consent?
L222637 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all.  I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. And rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will demonically indulge the other. That choice is yours.  You're the one who set this in motion, Frankenstein.
L222636 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Like you? Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking.
L222635 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
L222634 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Friend?
L222633 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ There is something I want.  A friend.
L222632 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ What can I do?
L222631 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ Then perhaps I believe in evil after all.
L222630 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I don't know.
L222629 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these?  Who am I?
L222628 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
L222627 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ In which part of me did this knowledge reside? In these hands? In this mind? In this heart?  And reading and speaking. Not things learned... so much as things remembered.
L222626 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ You're wrong. Do you know I knew how to play this?
L222625 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Materials. Nothing more.
L222624 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ What of my soul? Do I have one? Or was that a part you left out?  Who were these people of which I am comprised? Good people? Bad people?
L222623 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
L222622 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ Why, Victor? Why? What were you thinking?
L222615 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ I'm not sure I believe. But then I had no one to instruct me. I had no mother... and my father abandoned me at birth.
L222614 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I see it before me.
L222613 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ Evil?  Do you believe in evil?
L222612 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ How dare you. You're disgusting and evil.
L222611 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ Your crime... as well as mine.
L222610 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Fine words from a child killer. You who murdered my brother.
L222609 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ More to the point, why am I here? What did you want with me?  What does one say to one's Maker, having finally met him face to face? Milton gave it voice.  Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay to mould me Man? Did I solicit thee from Darkness to promote me?
L222608 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
L222607 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ Kill you? Hardly that.
L222606 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Kill me and have done with it.
L222605 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ The letters in your journal. That and a geography book.  Your Elizabeth sounds lovely.
L222604 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ How did you find me?
L222603 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ Yes, I speak. And read. And think... and know the ways of Man.  I've been waiting for you. Two months now.
L222602 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ You speak.
L222601 +++$+++ u971 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ CREATURE +++$+++ Come warm yourself if you like.
L222540 +++$+++ u977 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ JUSTINE +++$+++ Fine.
L222539 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Are you all right?
L222388 +++$+++ u977 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ JUSTINE +++$+++ Read him one of the old letters and rephrase it. We'll say it came today. It'll set his mind at ease.
L222387 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ And not a word of them to Father. He's agitated enough not hearing from Victor.
L222386 +++$+++ u977 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ JUSTINE +++$+++ Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors.
L222385 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ I should go. I should leave today.
L222384 +++$+++ u977 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ JUSTINE +++$+++ So have I
L222383 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Something's wrong. I know it.  I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg.
L222382 +++$+++ u977 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ JUSTINE +++$+++ It's been months. It's not like him.
L222381 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Nothing. Still nothing.
L222311 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ He was almost expelled for calling one of his professors a "pompous...  Fellow..."
L222310 +++$+++ u977 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ JUSTINE +++$+++ Must've been a terrible row.
L222186 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ And you look so lovely.
L222185 +++$+++ u977 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ JUSTINE +++$+++ You dance so beautifully together.
L222182 +++$+++ u977 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ JUSTINE +++$+++ One-two-three, one-two-three, twirl- two-three...
L222181 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
L222180 +++$+++ u977 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ JUSTINE +++$+++ Elizabeth, really! He's quite mad!
L222176 +++$+++ u977 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ JUSTINE +++$+++ Quite right!
L222175 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ That's the nature of all progress, William. Don't let your brother sway you otherwise.
L222170 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ There, there... shhh...
L222169 +++$+++ u977 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ JUSTINE +++$+++ Poor William! What indignant tears!
L222545 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ It's far too late for him to still be out.
L222544 +++$+++ u973 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time. They say he never arrived.
L222543 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Is he not back yet?
L222542 +++$+++ u973 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Have you seen Willie?
L222527 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Let this locket be a token of the vow we took the night I left.  He's coming home to marry me.
L222526 +++$+++ u973 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ What does it say?
L222313 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ He set things right with a proper apology... and now they've put him in charge of dissection lab!
L222312 +++$+++ u973 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ He always was opinionated.
L222713 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Open this door for no-one!
L222712 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Victor!
L222711 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ I have been waiting for this ever since.
L222710 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I remember the first time I ever saw you. Crossing the floor of the grand ballroom with my parents at your side. So beautiful even then.
L222709 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Now husband and wife.
L222708 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Brother and sister no more.
L222686 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I do. But you must trust me for now.
L222685 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
L222684 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
L222683 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
L222682 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ We'll leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony. Pack only what you need.
L222681 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ It is
L222680 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?
L222679 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Why the change? What about your work?
L222678 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ No. Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me today.
L222655 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ A month at most, that's all I ask.  Elizabeth, please. Things have not yet resolved. I must take steps to see that they do. For our family's sake. For our sake.  You are life itself. We shall seal our vow. The moment I am done.
L222654 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
L222653 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ So do I.
L222652 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ What of our marriage? Victor, we've had so much tragedy. I want this family to live again.
L222651 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.
L222650 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ What sort of task?
L222644 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I'm all right. I'm safe,
L222643 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ I thought I'd never see you again!
L222599 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I know only that he is a killer. And I shall bring back his carcass.
L222598 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Do you know this man? Is there something between you?
L222597 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ They've done a fine job. Hanging an innocent for the crime of a fiend.
L222596 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!
L222595 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I've no choice
L222594 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?
L222593 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ My mind was not playing tricks. He was there in the storm... gloating over his crimes... challenging me to come.
L222223 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Elizabeth. My more than sister.
L222222 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Victor. I love you,
L222221 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ ...until our wedding night. When our bodies will join.
L222220 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ I give you my soul...
L222219 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Your decision. For us.
L222218 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Our decision. Together.
L222217 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Not as weak as I.
L222216 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ You make me weak.
