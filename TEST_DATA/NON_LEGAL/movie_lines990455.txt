L623629 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ No. Me Neither.
L623628 +++$+++ u8591 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ No.
L623627 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ Following the game at all?
L623626 +++$+++ u8591 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ No.
L623625 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ Are you getting out much?
L623410 +++$+++ u8589 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SPUD +++$+++ Would not say no, would not say no.
L623409 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ Another dab?
L623408 +++$+++ u8589 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SPUD +++$+++ A little too well, if anything, a little too well, that's my only fear, compadre.
L623376 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ Try this.
L623375 +++$+++ u8589 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SPUD +++$+++ My problem is that I tend to clam up. I go dumb and I can't answer any questions at all. Nerves on the big occasion, like a footballer.
L623374 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ It's a tightrope, Spud, a fucking tightrope.
L623373 +++$+++ u8589 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SPUD +++$+++ Nightmare.
L623372 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ Exactly.
L623371 +++$+++ u8589 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SPUD +++$+++ And you might get the fucking job.
L623370 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ But try too hard --
L623369 +++$+++ u8589 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SPUD +++$+++ Right.
L623368 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ If they think you're not trying, you're in trouble. First hint of that, they'll be on to the DSS, 'This cunt's no trying' and your Giro is fucking finished, right?
L623367 +++$+++ u8589 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SPUD +++$+++ Yeah.
L623366 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ Now remember --
L623365 +++$+++ u8589 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SPUD +++$+++ Cheers.
L623364 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ Good luck, Spud.
L623755 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ Sorry, boys, I don't have two thousand pounds.
L623754 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ Come on, Mark, every cunt knows you've been saving up down in London.
L623753 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ That's tough.
L623752 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ We're two thousand short.
L623751 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ But you don't have the money?
L623750 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ Four Grand.
L623749 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ What was your price?
L623747 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ So we've just come from Tommy's funeral and you're telling me about a skag deal?
L623746 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ So he met me and I offered to take it off his hands at a very reasonable price, with the intention of punting it on myself to a guy I know in London.
L623745 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ So?
L623744 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ About four kilos. So he tells me. Got drunk in a pub down by the docks last week, where he met two Russian sailors. They're fucking carrying the stuff. For sale there and then, like. So he wakes up the next morning, realizes what he's done and get very fucking nervous. Wants rid of this. {---------- He's looking for Swanney to punt it, but Swanney's nowhere to be seen since he lost his leg. ---------- }
L623743 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ How much?
L623742 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ There's a mate of swanney's. Mikey Forrester -- you know the guy. He's come into some gear. A lot of gear.
L623741 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ What?
L623723 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ It was just an idea.
L623722 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ Why would I want to sell my passport?
L623721 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ Well, this guy I've met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts. Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to foreigners. Get you a good price.
L623720 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ Why?
L623719 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ Well, Christ, if I'd known you were going to get so humpty about it, I wouldn't have bothered. Are you going to eat that?
L623718 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ It was my fucking television.
L623717 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ I got a good price for it. Rents, I need the money.
L623716 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ I can't believe you did that.
L623668 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ And I'll tell you why. Because I'm fed up to my back teeth with losers, no-hopers, draftpacks, schemies, junkies and the like. I'm getting on with life. What are you doing?
L623667 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ Fuck you.
L623666 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ I know a couple of addicts. Stupid wee lassies. I feed them what they need. A little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull. It's easy money for me. Not exactly a fortune, but I'm thinking, 'I should be coining it here.'  Less whores, more skag. Swanney's right. Get clean, get into dealing, that's where the future lies. Set up some contacts, get a good load of skag, punt it, profit. What do you think?
L623665 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ You're all hear.
L623664 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ Fuck you. OK, so Tommy's got the virus. Bad news, big deal. The gig goes on, or hadn't you noticed? Swanney fucks his leg up. Well, tough shit, but it could have been worse.
L623663 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ You're a real mate. And what about Tommy? Have you been to see him yet?
L623662 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ Don't know. Maybe Thursday.
L623661 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ When are you going to visit him?
L623660 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ Cut it out.
L623659 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ And I got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off.
L623658 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ God, you're sick.
L623657 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ He made me lick it.
L623656 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ Oh no, don't even mention it.
L623655 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ No, he didn't make me touch it.
L623654 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ You know.
L623653 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ What?
L623652 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ Did he -- you know?
L623651 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ It wasn't that bad.
L623650 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ Eughh. Sounds horrible.
L623558 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ I'm cooking' up. There is a silence.
L623557 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ Say something, Mark, say something --
L623556 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ It wasn't my baby. She wasn't my baby. Baby Dawn. She wasn't mine. Spud's? Swanney's? Sick Boy's? I don't know. Maybe Allison knew. Maybe not. I wished I could think of something to say, something sympathetic, something human.
L623555 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ Oh, fuck. Sick Boy reaches out to Allison.
L623553 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ What's wrong, Allison?
L623552 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ I think Allison had been screaming all day, but it hadn't really registered before. She might have been screaming for a week for all I knew. It's been days since I've heard anyone speak, though surely someone must have said something in all that time, surely to fuck someone must have.
L623361 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ Clear enough, Moneypenny. This should present no significant problem.
L623360 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ Do you see the beast? Have you got it in you sights?
L623358 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ Give me the gun.
L623357 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.
L623356 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ That's your theory?
L623355 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ Yeah.
L623354 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ Right. So we all get old and then we can't hack it any more. Is that it?
L623353 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ That means fuck all. The sympathy vote.
L623352 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ Despite the Academy award?
L623351 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ I don't rate that at all.
L623350 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ What about The Untouchables?
L623349 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ All I'm trying to do is help you understand that The Name of the Rose is merely a blip on an otherwise uninterrupted downward trajectory.
L623348 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ OK, OK, so what's the point you're trying to make?
L623347 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -
L623346 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ So who else?
L623345 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ No, it's not bad, but it's not great either, is it? And in your heart you kind of know that although it sounds all right, it's actually just shite.
L623344 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ Some of his solo stuff's not bad.
L623343 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ Well, at one time, you've got it, and then you lose it, and it's gone for ever. All walks of life: George Best, for example, had it and lost it, or David Bowie, or Lou Reed -
L623342 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ What do you mean?
L623341 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ It's certainly a phenomenon in all walks of life.
L623339 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ Roald Dahl. Fuck me.
L623338 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ Roald Dahl.
L623337 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ Who wrote it?
L623336 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up.
L623335 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ The park?
L623334 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ And I wondered if you'd care to go to the park tomorrow.
L623333 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ You don't know, do you?
L623332 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ But you're looking better, it has to be said. Healthier. Radiant even.
L623331 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ Who wrote it?
L623330 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ You can look it up.
L623329 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ OK, so who was it, then?
L623328 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ Fuck off! He never wrote any of them.
L623327 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ Eh - Ian Fleming?
L623326 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ Screenwriter?
L623325 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ Lewis Gilbert.
L623324 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ Director?
L623323 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ One hundred and sixteen minutes.
L623322 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ Running time?
L623321 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ Nineteen-sixty-seven.
L623320 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ You Only Live Twice?
L623288 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ The only drawback, or at least the principal drawback, is that you have to endure all manner of cunts telling you that -
L623287 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ I would say, in those days, he was a muscular actor, in every sense, with all the presence of someone like Cooper or Lancaster, but combined with a sly wit to make him a formidable romantic lead, closer in that respect to Cary Grant.
L623286 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ People think it's all about misery and desperation and death and all that shite, which is not to be ignored, but what they forget - Spud is shooting up for the pleasure of it. Otherwise we wouldn't do it. After all, we're not fucking stupid. At least, we're not that fucking stupid. Take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near it. When you're on junk you have only one worry: scoring. When you're off it you are suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other shite. Got no money: can't get pished. Got money: drinking too much. Can't get a bird: no chance of a ride. Got a bird: too much hassle. You have to worry about bills, about food, about some football team that never fucking wins, about human relationships and all the things that really don't matter when you've got a sincere and truthful junk habit.
L623285 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ Goldfinger's better than Dr. No. Both of them are a lot better than Diamonds are Forever a judgement reflected in its relative poor showing at the box office, in which field, of course, Thunderball was a notable success.
L623284 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ I chose not to choose life: I chose something else. And the reasons? There are no reasons. Who need reasons when you've got heroin?
L623649 +++$+++ u8590 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SWANNEY +++$+++ Sure will, pal, sure will.
L623648 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ You'll have to send us a postcard.
L623647 +++$+++ u8590 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SWANNEY +++$+++ Yeah.
L623646 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ Sounds great, Swanney.
L623645 +++$+++ u8590 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SWANNEY +++$+++ The strategy is this: get clean, get mobile, get into dealing, and this time next year I'll be watching the rising sun with a posse of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon.
L623644 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ Sure.
L623643 +++$+++ u8590 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SWANNEY +++$+++ And see when I get out of here. I've got plans. Going to get myself straightened out and head off to Thailand, where women really know how to treat a guy. See, out there you can live like a king if you've got white skin and a few crisp tenners in your pocket. No fucking problem.
L623642 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ Great.
L623595 +++$+++ u8590 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SWANNEY +++$+++ As you wish.
L623594 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ No, thank you. I'll proceed directly to the intravenous injection of hard drugs, please.
L623592 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ In that case --
L623591 +++$+++ u8590 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SWANNEY +++$+++ Regret to inform, sir, that your credit limit was reached and breached a long time ago.
L623590 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ Stick it on my tab.
L623589 +++$+++ u8590 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SWANNEY +++$+++ And would sir care to settle his bill in advance?
L623588 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ Why, thank you.
L623587 +++$+++ u8590 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SWANNEY +++$+++ Your usual table, sir?
L623586 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ Excellent.
L623585 +++$+++ u8590 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SWANNEY +++$+++ Your favourite dish.
L623584 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ What's on the menu this evening?
L623306 +++$+++ u8590 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SWANNEY +++$+++ To see you through the night that lies ahead.
L623305 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ No, I don't think so.
L623304 +++$+++ u8590 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SWANNEY +++$+++ you'll need one more hit.
L623303 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ That's hardly a substitute.
L623302 +++$+++ u8590 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SWANNEY +++$+++ He knows a lot about Sean Connery.
L623301 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ He's always been lacking in moral fibre.
L623300 +++$+++ u8590 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SWANNEY +++$+++ Yeah, well, it surely worked for him.
L623299 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ The Sick Boy method.
L623298 +++$+++ u8590 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SWANNEY +++$+++ Sure, sure. I've heard it before.
L623297 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ I'm going to get it right this time. Going to get it set up and get off it for good.
L623296 +++$+++ u8590 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SWANNEY +++$+++ Well, it's up to you.
L623295 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite.
L623294 +++$+++ u8590 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SWANNEY +++$+++ Are you serious?
L623293 +++$+++ u8587 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ RENTON +++$+++ From time to time, even I have uttered the magic words.
L623540 +++$+++ u8591 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Doesn't it make you proud to be Scottish?
L623539 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ Look, Tommy, we know you're getting a hard time off Lizzy, but there's no need to take it out on us.
L623538 +++$+++ u8591 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ It's fresh air.
L623537 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ It's really nice, Tommy. Can we go home now?
L623536 +++$+++ u8591 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ It's the great outdoors.
L623533 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ Are you serious?
L623532 +++$+++ u8591 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ There.
L623527 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ Such as sitting in a darkened room, watching videos, drinking, smoking dope and wanking. Does that answer your question?
L623526 +++$+++ u8591 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Such as?
L623525 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ If I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I could be doing.
L623524 +++$+++ u8591 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ It will be. It'll make a change for three miserable junkies who don't know what they want to do with themselves since they stopped doing smack.
L623523 +++$+++ u8588 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SICK BOY +++$+++ This had better be good.
L623535 +++$+++ u8589 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SPUD +++$+++ I don't know, Tommy. I don't know if it's... normal.
L623534 +++$+++ u8591 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Well, what are you waiting for?
L623531 +++$+++ u8589 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SPUD +++$+++ But where?
L623530 +++$+++ u8591 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ A walk.
L623529 +++$+++ u8589 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SPUD +++$+++ What?
L623528 +++$+++ u8591 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ We go for a walk.
L623442 +++$+++ u8591 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Well, I've paid for the ticket.
L623441 +++$+++ u8589 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SPUD +++$+++ So what's it going to be?
L623440 +++$+++ u8591 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Big time. Absolutely fucking radge. 'It's me or Iggy Pop, time to decide.'
L623439 +++$+++ u8589 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SPUD +++$+++ Went ballistic?
L623438 +++$+++ u8591 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Yes, but then she finds out I've bought a ticket for Iggy Pop the same night.
L623437 +++$+++ u8589 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SPUD +++$+++ That's fair enough.
L623436 +++$+++ u8591 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Useless motherfucker, that's what she called me. I told her, I'm sorry, but theses things happen. Let's put it behind us.

L623428 +++$+++ u8591 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Six weeks and no sex?

L623426 +++$+++ u8591 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Where did she come up with that?
L623425 +++$+++ u8589 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SPUD +++$+++ It's a nightmare. She told me she didn't want our relationship to start on a physical basis as that is how it would be principally defined from then on in.

L623404 +++$+++ u8589 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SPUD +++$+++ No. Well, yes. I have to admit it: I'm a perfectionist. For me, it's the best or nothing at all. If things go badly, I can't be bothered, but I have a good feeling about this interview. Seems to me like it's gone pretty well. We've touched on a lot of subjects, a lot of things to think about, for all of us.
L623403 +++$+++ u8592 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Mr. Murphy, {leaving your friend aside,} do you see yourself as having any weaknesses?
L623402 +++$+++ u8589 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SPUD +++$+++ No, not homeless people. Beggars, Francis Begbie -- one of my mates. I wouldn't say my best mate, I mean, sometimes the boy goes over the score, like one time when we -- me and him -- were having a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face, right --
L623401 +++$+++ u8592 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Homeless people?
L623400 +++$+++ u8589 +++$+++ m582 +++$+++ SPUD +++$+++ I love people. All people. Even people that no one else loves, I think they're OK, you know. Like Beggars.
