L326854 +++$+++ u6132 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ CUSH +++$+++ I see what you're saying.
L326853 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Let me think about that.  Want something to drink?
L327253 +++$+++ u6133 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOOLER +++$+++ Then you shouldn't have begged me to hire him.
L327252 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Airight.  Enough.  I'm pulling him out of this.  This isn't what I had in mind anyway.
L327247 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Bill, Rod, wait --
L327246 +++$+++ u6133 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOOLER +++$+++ Look, Rod, just get on the camel!
L326636 +++$+++ u6133 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOOLER +++$+++ They ain't laughing, man. Something's wrong.
L326635 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ ... this is... uh... too funny...
L326627 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You're imagining it.
L326626 +++$+++ u6133 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOOLER +++$+++ This is fuckin Michael Jordan, man! They should be screaming.
L326625 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Oh come on --
L326624 +++$+++ u6133 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOOLER +++$+++ You hear those courtesy laughs, Jerry? There is a seething wrongness at the edges of this party.
L327456 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Aw, shut up.  You had me at hello. _ 130.
L327455 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ This used to be my specialty. I was good in a living room.  Send me in there, I'll do it alone. And now I just... I don't know... but on what was supposed to be the happiest night of my business life, it wasn't complete, wasn't nearly close to being in the same vicinity as complete, because I couldn't share it with you.  I couldn't hear your voice, or laugh about it with you.  I missed my wife.  We live in a cynical world, and we work in a business of tough competitors, so try not to laugh --  I love you.  You complete me.
L327392 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Come on, Jerry.  You know this isn't easy for me.  _ 118.
L327391 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ So this break... is a break-up.
L327390 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ There's no question you'll be friends. Of course you'll be friends.
L327389 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ What about Ray?
L327388 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh please.  My need to make the best of things, and your need to be what, "responsible"... if one of us doesn't say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it. Why don't we call this next road trip what it is.  A nice long break.
L327387 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I don't like to give up.
L327386 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ I know.  I watched it.  I sort of know it by heart.
L327385 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ What if it's true?  "Great at friendship bad at intimacy." I mean, come on.  It's the theme of my bachelor film --
L327384 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ I think we made a mistake here.
L327383 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?
L327382 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Why fucking not!  I deserve it.
L327381 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ ...my soul or something. _ 117.
L327380 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ I don't know --
L327379 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You want...
L327378 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ I don't need you to "stick."
L327377 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Well -- I'm not the guy who's going to run.  I stick.
L327376 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ I took advantage of you and worst of all, I'm not alone. I did this with a kid.  I was just on some ride where I thought I was in 1ove enough for both of us.  I did this.  And at least I can do something about it now.
L327375 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Tell me -- let me help --
L327374 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ It's not fair to you.  This whole --
L327373 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ What --
L327372 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ It's my fault.
L327368 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Why do you love me?
L327367 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Why do you love me?
L327366 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Okay... I will...
L327365 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Well, when you wonder, ask me.
L327364 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ And I really don't know your noises yet.
L327363 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Sometimes I can't tell at all, what's going through that head of yours.
L327362 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I was thinking I hope he doesn't get injured. I felt responsible.
L327300 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Will you marry me?
L327299 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say that if you don't...
L327298 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ If I said that, would you stay?
L327293 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Look, just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes... whatever...  Don't make a joke of your life. Go back and read what you wrote. You're better than the rest of them, better than the Bob Sugars, and don't forget it.
L327292 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ What --
L327289 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ So I'll see you this weekend.
L327288 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ This rig? Phht.  No problem.
L327287 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Sure you're okay to drive this?
L327227 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ And I appreciate that impulse.
L327226 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Fine, I just --
L327225 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Another time, okay Dorothy?
L327201 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Easy, easy --
L327200 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh God.
L327179 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Oh hell yes.
L327178 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Okay. Wait here a second.  Do we really want to do this?
L327177 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Right.  I'll come in.
L327176 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ No.  I have to go in.  I live here.
L327175 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Same to you.
L327174 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ I think you should not come in, or come in depending on how you feel.
L327171 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Good night.
L327170 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Well -- this would be goodnight.
L327166 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Let's not tell our sad stories.
L327165 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ What?
L327164 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Yeah.  It wasn't like my marriage to Roger was so great, even before --  Jerry?
L327160 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ No no no.  I just underestimated her...  her temper, I guess.  Why are we even talking about this?
L327159 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Maybe you should call her.
L327154 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Maybe love shouldn't be such hard work. I know, but --
L327153 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ It was laziness1 my whole breakup with Avery. You know that thing you say, "it's nobody's fault." It's one of the great lies, right? Someone is always to blame -- if you go for it, go for it like you do a job, work at it --
L327146 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Bye you guys. _ 88.
L327145 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
L327139 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Yeah, I did -- am I dressed okay? I guess I didn't realize we were...
L327138 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster.  You meet Chad the nanny?
L327137 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Wow.  That's more than a dress. That's an Audrey Hepburn movie.
L327130 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Exactly because I know this is a time when you need to be alone with your thoughts.  _ 86.
L327129 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that.
L327128 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh good.
L327127 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I mean, the other night was... I felt like you understood something I could barely even say, something way down deep in the murk --  -- but we have a company here to think about.  I won't ever take advantage of you in that way again.
L327126 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ I'm relieved you said that.
L327125 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ We're two people working together and we can't have an atmosphere.
L327124 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Yeah, what happened there.
L327123 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Look, the other night, I want to apologize.
L327122 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ You don't have to explain.
L327121 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I sunk most of what I had into this condo, which devalued, and --
L327120 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Plus, you could use that commission.
L327119 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Good.  Good.  Glad is good.
L327118 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Actually he said "glad." _ 85.
L327117 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Happy. He said "happy?"
L327116 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona to say he's faxing in the new Tidwell offer on Thursday morning, and you'll be happy.
L327078 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Good evening.
L327077 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Well, good evening.
L327076 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ I may not sue.
L327075 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ No, I do.  I feel like Clarence Thomas.  I'm like... harrassing you... right now.
L327074 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ No.  No don't feel like Clarence Thomas.
L327073 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.
L327072 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Yeah, I did.
L327071 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Oh shit.  You said "boss."
L327070 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Don't worry about it, boss.
L327069 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Sorry about this hand.  You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment?
L327068 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Well.
L327067 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Mission... statement...
L327066 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ I'm working with you because of that memo...
L327065 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ What you wrote inspired me. _ 79.
L327064 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Me too.
L327062 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Sure.
L327061 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Truth?
L327059 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ And I am...
L327058 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ -- especially one like this.
L327057 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ We will be fine!
L327056 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Don't worry about me.  I can get jobs --
L327050 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Good idea.  Thank you.
L327049 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Drinks.  Food.  Plus, I called you a cab.
L327019 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Yeah, thanks.
L327018 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Beer okay?
L327015 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Sure --
L327014 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Do you have something to drink?
L327013 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Sorry.  Uh, let me see, have a seat. I'll get you some aloe vera for that cut too.
L327012 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ And just think if I got her the ring she really wanted.
L327011 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?
L327010 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Better now than later.  We'll still be friends. I'm dying here.
L327009 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Too bad.
L327008 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Yeah.  That too.  I broke up with Avery.
L327007 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh my God.
L327006 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I'm glad you're home.  That "alone" thing is... not my specialty...
L327005 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
L327004 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Thanks for inviting me over. Where's the little guy?
L327003 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Hi.
L327002 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Hey you.
L326847 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Yep.  Have a good time at school, Ray.  Wish me luck.
L326846 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Okay, have we gone over everything? Back on Tuesday, right?
L326827 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Call me later, hon.
L326826 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Thanks.
L326825 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Happy for us... okay.  Here's the number. 404-453-2222.
L326824 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Happy for us.
L326823 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Well, I'm happy for you.
L326822 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ It's all going to work.  We're going to save the world.
L326821 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ I just got goosebumps.
L326820 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ It's all going to work.
L326819 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ We are?
L326818 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Dorothy, let me tell you something, we are back. We are so very very back.  I re-signed Cush. We're set.
L326816 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Shit, it's just so frustrating to not be able to talk to Avery --
L326815 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ ... light.
L326814 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Wait.  That's yesterday, from the other office. Today is...
L326813 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ No, that's fine.  What calls came in today?
L326812 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Sorry, that's my son and the nanny. I had the calls transferred to my home so I could go over your stuff.
L326811 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Hello?
L326810 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Honey -- later, okay?  Whoop.  Wait.
L326753 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Same to you.
L326752 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ That took guts.
L326749 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Absolutely.
L326748 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ But I mean really... wonderfully...  great.
L326747 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ No no, I know --
L326746 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Give me your number.  I'll call tomorrow.  I'm just a little. I'm a little insane right now.  But it's going to be great.
L326745 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ And I guess we didn't talk about money.  So, I'll just dive in --
L326744 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Sure. Yes. Medical, I don't know.
L326743 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ So I know this is a bad time, but -- you will have a medical program, right?
L326742 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ My favorite aunt is hearing impaired. He said "you complete me." _ 40.
L326741 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Wonder what he said.
L326606 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Dorothy.  Ray.  A pleasure.
L326605 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh no.  I'm sure it would just make your day to drive us all the way to Manhattan Beach, taking that left down to little tiny Waterloo street where you have to play chicken with oncoming traffic, and your life flashes before your eyes, but -- hey, I've obviously had too much coffee and all -- here's my sister Laurel to pick us up.  Thanks, though. Bye.
L326599 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ -- the part about "we should embrace what it is still virginal about our enthusiasm" --
L326598 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I appreciate that, because some of that stuff... you know, it was two in the morning and...
L326597 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh tsht. Yes.
L326596 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You think so?
L326595 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ I think in this age, optimism like that... it's a revolutionary act.
L326592 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ No, I'm just... anxiously looking past it.  I already had my bachelor party.  It was called "my twenties." See you later.
L326591 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Nnnnn.  I just killed the surprise.
L326590 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ No no. I knew.
L326589 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh no.
L326588 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ And have fun at your bachelor party.
L326587 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Well, take care.
L326586 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Well, thanks.
L326583 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ My son... my mind...
L326582 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Now what did you lose?
L326581 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Hmm.  Pretty good.
L326580 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I know who y6u are.  You're Dorothy Boyd.  You're in... wait... you're in Accounts.  You have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of Albert Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0 Neal's body.
L326579 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh.  Hi.  I work in your office. I was on the junket to the conference. I'm --
L326578 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Can I help?
L326555 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, tell the story.
L326554 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ No no...
L327198 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, well, why didn't you say so? And oh, I don't know if you're interested in this detail, but I was just about to tell you that I love him.  I love him, and I don't care what you think.  I love him for the guy he wants to be, and I love him for the guy he almost is. I love him.
L327197 +++$+++ u6137 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Easy, hon, I was just looking for fun details --
L327195 +++$+++ u6137 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Guys are just different people when they're hanging onto the bottom rung.
L327194 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Please, if I start talking --
L327193 +++$+++ u6137 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Because I'm worried that you're putting your faith in this guy who, because of the way things are going, may not have an emotional marble in his head.
L327192 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ No--
L327191 +++$+++ u6137 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ First you gotta tell me something.
L327151 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Oh, knock it off! _ 89.
L327150 +++$+++ u6137 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ No no.  Don't cry at the beginning of the date.
L327149 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ That's the first time I ever saw him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't that just... thrilling?  I mean, he must have been needing that.
L327148 +++$+++ u6137 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Forgot your keys --
L327035 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Thanks.
L327034 +++$+++ u6137 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Good.
L327033 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ I've got a 24 hour a day reminder of Roger, for the rest of my life. I have had three lovers in four years, all boring, all achingly self-sufficient all friends of yours I might add, and all of them running a distant second to a warm bath.  Look at me, Laurel, look at me.  I'm the oldest 26 year old in the world!  How do I look?
L327027 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ As opposed to twenty angry women?
L327026 +++$+++ u6137 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ But you just gotta hear me out on one thing.  You're very responsible with Ray and you know it's not right for a little boy to hear some strange man's voice in the house.
L327025 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ That's the girl I love.
L327024 +++$+++ u6137 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Look, here's some of that chicken with salsa too, I warmed it up -- _ 74.
L327023 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Thank you.
