L586659 +++$+++ u8250 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ MIRIAM +++$+++ You shut up. Who do you think you are?
L586576 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Fucking kike.
L586575 +++$+++ u8250 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ MIRIAM +++$+++ Danny, I'm trying to -- save you.
L586574 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ The truth doesn't mean anything to you, does it?
L586573 +++$+++ u8250 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ MIRIAM +++$+++ Think about your father. Your sister.
L586572 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I can't say that.
L586571 +++$+++ u8250 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ MIRIAM +++$+++ And only talked about killing Manzetti to convince them you were an anti-Semite. If you'd had any idea somebody would take it seriously, you never would have said it.
L586570 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ But I wasn't.
L586569 +++$+++ u8250 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ MIRIAM +++$+++ All right, what if all along you were actually infiltrating the Nazis -- to expose them....
L586568 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I was just talking. I -- look, I can't help what I think.
L586567 +++$+++ u8250 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ MIRIAM +++$+++ So are you... But they'll believe you....  Lina Moebius is saying the whole thing was your idea. That you proposed it in a meeting at her house.  Ah, Jesus, Danny... What were you thinking? Are you glad Manzetti's dead? Do you really want to kill Jews? You want to kill me?
L586566 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ You're lying.
L586565 +++$+++ u8250 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ MIRIAM +++$+++ It was a nine millimeter.
L586564 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ A forty-five.
L586563 +++$+++ u8250 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ MIRIAM +++$+++ You're telling me you killed him? You? Killed him? Bullshit. What kind of gun did you use?
L586477 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ With the shoes... There was more than one?
L586476 +++$+++ u8250 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ MIRIAM +++$+++ Which <i>Times</i> guy?
L586475 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ You mean the <i>Times</i> guy?
L586474 +++$+++ u8250 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ MIRIAM +++$+++ I work in the DA's office. You go to those meetings, half the people there are informants.
L586473 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ How did you...?
L586472 +++$+++ u8250 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ MIRIAM +++$+++ Tell me about Lina Moebius.
L586471 +++$+++ u8250 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ MIRIAM +++$+++ This is me.
L586470 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I can't help what I think.
L586469 +++$+++ u8250 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ MIRIAM +++$+++ You know the joke: a Jew's shipwrecked on a desert island. When they rescue him, they see he's built two synagogues. They say, for vhat do you need two synagogues? He says, vun to pray in, and vun I'd never set foot in so long as I live, so help me God.  You pray in the one you'd never set foot in...and vice versa.
L586468 +++$+++ u8250 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ MIRIAM +++$+++ Point out all the lies and fucked-up thinking.
L586467 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ That doesn't mean I don't like hearing it.
L586466 +++$+++ u8250 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ MIRIAM +++$+++ I thought you hated Torah.
L586465 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ To hear them read Torah.
L586464 +++$+++ u8250 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ MIRIAM +++$+++ Why did you come tonight? To see me?
L586412 +++$+++ u8250 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ MIRIAM +++$+++ The arguments, anyway.
L586411 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I always won.
L586190 +++$+++ u8249 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ LINDA'S VOICE +++$+++ Yes!
L586189 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ No!
L586188 +++$+++ u8249 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ LINDA'S VOICE +++$+++ ...I want you to do it on the outside, too.
L586187 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Don't tell me what I --
L586186 +++$+++ u8249 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ LINDA'S VOICE +++$+++ You do it on the inside....
L586185 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I don't do that.
L586184 +++$+++ u8249 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ LINDA'S VOICE +++$+++ I want you to say kaddish for her. It's the only thing she asked from us....
L586183 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ How did you get the fucking number?
L586606 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Lina, you said if I was going to plant a bomb, I should --
L586605 +++$+++ u8247 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ LINA +++$+++ Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...?
L586604 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Beth Shalom. Like you wanted.
L586603 +++$+++ u8247 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ LINA +++$+++ What is happening?
L586602 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Lina... It's happening. Tonight.
L586601 +++$+++ u8247 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ LINA +++$+++ Hello...?
L586320 +++$+++ u8247 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ LINA +++$+++ We want to talk to you about something....  We're about to launch an aboveground, intellectually serious fascist movement.
L586319 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Fine.
L586318 +++$+++ u8247 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ LINA +++$+++ How have things been going?
L586175 +++$+++ u8247 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ LINA +++$+++ Forget Manzetti.... Take on something simple. Something you can actually accomplish.  Maybe he'd be more valuable in the city.
L586174 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ You mean Ilio Manzetti?
L586173 +++$+++ u8247 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ LINA +++$+++ Do you feel you're making progress here?
L585877 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Ilio Manzetti...former ambassador to France. Managing partner at Damon, Schwarzchild.
L585876 +++$+++ u8247 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ LINA +++$+++ So what Jew would you kill first?
L585875 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ We're already marginal. We are saying what no one else has the guts to say. Isn't that precisely our appeal?
L585874 +++$+++ u8247 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ LINA +++$+++ Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us.
L585873 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Without blood -- a willingness to spill it -- there's no real power, no authority.
L585871 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I was going to ask you the same thing.
L585870 +++$+++ u8247 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ LINA +++$+++ Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?... Or any other law enforcement agency?
L585869 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ From the Rhineland originally.
L585868 +++$+++ u8247 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ LINA +++$+++ What part of Germany are you people from?
L585867 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ It's German.
L585866 +++$+++ u8247 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ LINA +++$+++ Balint?
L585865 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Daniel Balint.
L585864 +++$+++ u8247 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ LINA +++$+++ Lina Moebius. And you are...?
L586110 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Steve's going to explain it.
L586109 +++$+++ u8243 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ FIRST WAITER +++$+++ Steve...
L586108 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ But you already talked about it: you said it's not stupid. Why isn't it stupid?
L586107 +++$+++ u8243 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ FIRST WAITER +++$+++ I'm not here to talk about religious law, if you don't like --
L586106 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ You can have chicken with eggs but not with milk. Why is that?
L586105 +++$+++ u8243 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ FIRST WAITER +++$+++ No, I don't admit it's stupid.
L586104 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ But it's stupid, right? You admit it's stupid.
L586103 +++$+++ u8243 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ FIRST WAITER +++$+++ Look, you want cheese, go someplace else.
L586102 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ The Bible only says don't seethe a kid in its mother's milk. But chickens don't give milk.
L586101 +++$+++ u8243 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ FIRST WAITER +++$+++ That's meat.
L586100 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ What about chicken?
L585939 +++$+++ u8248 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ You can heat them up and eat with him.
L585938 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I've got to get back to the --
L585937 +++$+++ u8248 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Do you know them?  I made him some noodles for dinner. You can heat them up and --
L585936 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Nobody ever beat me up.  Look, Linda, there're fifty reasons. Even if you knew them all, there'd be another fifty you didn't know.
L585935 +++$+++ u8248 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ The Polacks? From Sacred Heart?
L585934 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ What kids?...
L585933 +++$+++ u8248 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Is this because of those kids who used to beat you up?
L585932 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Oh, he decides? Hitler's the chief rabbi now?...
L585931 +++$+++ u8248 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Tell it to Hitler.
L585930 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ They're not my people....
L585929 +++$+++ u8248 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Ah, Jesus Christ, Danny, how can you wear that thing?... You know what it means? To your people...
L585928 +++$+++ u8248 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Why deprive him of his greatest pleasure?
L585927 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Then he couldn't be bitter about living alone.
L585926 +++$+++ u8248 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ He's going to die.  He won't take his medicine. He eats dairy. He probably still smokes when I'm not around.  I asked him to come live with us. Alex offered to share his room, unsolicited.... But he didn't want to be any trouble.
L585925 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I just came to get some stuff. I'll be out in five minutes.  He doesn't want me around.
L585924 +++$+++ u8248 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L586521 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Can anybody imagine why I would say a Jewish prayer?
L586520 +++$+++ u8256 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ A Jewish prayer.
L586519 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Who knows what that is?
L585969 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ No, it's...yeah, it's true, but... how'd you get this number?... No, not here... Maybe Sunday? There's a place off Queens Blvd. Near the courthouse...
L585968 +++$+++ u8256 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Isn't it true?
L585967 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Who told you that?
L585966 +++$+++ u8256 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ I'm doing a piece on right-wing groups, post Oklahoma City. I hear you're an important figure in those circles. You have a lot of interesting ideas....
L585965 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ <i>New York Times</i>...?
L585964 +++$+++ u8256 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Daniel Balint? My name's Guy Danielsen. I'm a reporter with the <i>New York Times</i>.
L585963 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Hello...?
L586640 +++$+++ u8246 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ KYLE +++$+++ So that's what? Nineteen thirty minutes...what time is it now...

L586638 +++$+++ u8246 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ KYLE +++$+++ When do you want it to go off?
L586635 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Just do it.
L586634 +++$+++ u8246 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ KYLE +++$+++ It's not going to be fine. It's --
L586633 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ No, it has to be tomorrow. You won't get this many of them in here for another year. It'll be fine.
L586632 +++$+++ u8246 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ KYLE +++$+++ If I went back to the lumberyard, the guy'd give me all the dynamite I wanted. Untraceable, you wouldn't -- need to...
L586629 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I have an idea....
L586628 +++$+++ u8246 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ KYLE +++$+++ Where?
L586627 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Take a right on 59th...  We'll put it someplace else.
L586626 +++$+++ u8246 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ KYLE +++$+++ So what do we do with the device?
L586625 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She thinks she'll get implicated.
L586624 +++$+++ u8246 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ KYLE +++$+++ Why? Why would she?
L586623 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Mrs. Moebius.
L586622 +++$+++ u8246 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ KYLE +++$+++ Who even knew?
L586621 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ They don't. I checked twenty times.... Somebody must have talked.
L586620 +++$+++ u8246 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ KYLE +++$+++ You said they didn't have night guards.
L586619 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Not too fast.
L586618 +++$+++ u8246 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ KYLE +++$+++ Christ...
L586617 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Keep driving. Don't slow down.
L586616 +++$+++ u8246 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ KYLE +++$+++ Oh, what is this shit?
L586612 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I'm not hungry.... Come on, let's drive around.... We don't want to be spotted here.
L586611 +++$+++ u8246 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ KYLE +++$+++ Didn't you get anything?
L586610 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ It'll be enough if we use it right.  Okay, the service'll go about another hour. Say an hour for the janitors, then one more just to be safe... We'll go in at midnight.
L586609 +++$+++ u8246 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ KYLE +++$+++ That's all we've got left.
L586383 +++$+++ u8246 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ KYLE +++$+++ No, it's weird, man. Nobody knows where he went.
L586382 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ What about Drake, did he ever show up?
L586381 +++$+++ u8246 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ KYLE +++$+++ It will.
L586380 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I've gotta kill some Jews, Kyle. I'm serious. I'm always talking about it. This time it's gotta happen.
L586379 +++$+++ u8246 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ KYLE +++$+++ I'm sorry, Danny. It won't happen again. I'm going to use a brand-new power cell. Plus we'll have a back-up timer.
L586378 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ That damn thing. You know how it made me look...?
L586377 +++$+++ u8246 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ KYLE +++$+++ This will be a different kind of device.
L586242 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Here...
L586241 +++$+++ u8246 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ KYLE +++$+++ Open it up.

L586161 +++$+++ u8246 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ KYLE +++$+++ Green dot -- shotgun powder. For pipe bombs.  A guy in a lumberyard gave it to me. A donation to the cause.
L586160 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ What is it?
L586069 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ The mother.
L586068 +++$+++ u8246 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ KYLE +++$+++ Which one were you aiming at?
L586065 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ You look right through him. He's there, but there's something on the other side of him that you want. It's all you want. And whatever's in the way doesn't matter.... Then it's easy.
L586064 +++$+++ u8246 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ KYLE +++$+++ Get out of here....
L586063 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ You could do it.
L586062 +++$+++ u8246 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ KYLE +++$+++ That was unbelievable what you did to Lucas. The guy's an animal.
L586059 +++$+++ u8246 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ KYLE +++$+++ Her place is down the road. But she just comes out for weekends sometimes.
L586058 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Where's Mrs. Moebius?
L586053 +++$+++ u8246 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ KYLE +++$+++ Number ten.

L586665 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Get out of my way.
L586664 +++$+++ u8255 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ STUART +++$+++ Danny, listen, people expect me to daven; they don't want someone they don't know -- leading their prayers.
L586658 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Shut up...
L586657 +++$+++ u8255 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ STUART +++$+++ Listen, Danny, you can't just barge in and --
L586405 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Wow, that's uh...great...
L586404 +++$+++ u8255 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ STUART +++$+++ She's at Yale Law -- interning with the district attorney...  We're getting married next spring. In Israel.

L586401 +++$+++ u8255 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ STUART +++$+++ You remember Miriam....
L586400 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ No, no... Not that kind of... underground. More a private... business. Private.
L586399 +++$+++ u8255 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ STUART +++$+++ Are you an artist?
L586398 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I'm in a kind of...underground...thing.
L586397 +++$+++ u8255 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ STUART +++$+++ What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet.
L586396 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ JTS...?

L586310 +++$+++ u8241 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DRAKE +++$+++ You missed on purpose.
L586308 +++$+++ u8241 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DRAKE +++$+++ Just get him in the cross-hairs. With those shells, anywhere you hit him, it'll bounce around, rip his insides all up.
L586307 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I'm a bad shot. I don't think I can --
L586306 +++$+++ u8241 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DRAKE +++$+++ Shoot him in the head. Always shoot a Jew in the head.
L586304 +++$+++ u8241 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DRAKE +++$+++ I was a Jew in a previous life.
L586303 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ How?

L586299 +++$+++ u8241 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DRAKE +++$+++ Four. But no one this important.
L586298 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Who'd you kill?
L586297 +++$+++ u8241 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DRAKE +++$+++ You want to kill a Jew. I already did.
L586296 +++$+++ u8240 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Why me?
L586295 +++$+++ u8241 +++$+++ m560 +++$+++ DRAKE +++$+++ Lie on your stomach and come up on your elbows.
