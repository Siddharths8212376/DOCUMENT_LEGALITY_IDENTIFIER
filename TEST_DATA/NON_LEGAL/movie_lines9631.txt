L107050 +++$+++ u4209 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ COP #1 +++$+++ This is a beautiful place.
L107027 +++$+++ u4209 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ COP #1 +++$+++ You did the right thing.
L107026 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.
L107025 +++$+++ u4209 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ COP #1 +++$+++ See?  We're for real.
L107021 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ All right.
L107020 +++$+++ u4209 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ COP #1 +++$+++ Ma'am, you have to open the door.
L107019 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ How do I know you are cops?
L107018 +++$+++ u4209 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ COP #1 +++$+++ No joke, ma'am.  Please open the door.
L107017 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Gunfire?  Is this a joke?
L107016 +++$+++ u4209 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ COP #1 +++$+++ We had a report of gunfire, so if you could --
L107014 +++$+++ u4209 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ COP #1 +++$+++ This is the police, ma'am.
L107013 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Hello?
L107295 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ ...  Me neither.
L107294 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ No.
L107293 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ You know what the difference is between us, Violet?
L107290 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ I'm here, aren't I?
L107289 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ How'd it go?
L107288 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Hey.
L107287 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Hey.
L107159 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Don't be sorry.  Help me.
L107158 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ I'm sorry, Corky ...
L107102 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ You don't quit on me, Violet, and I won't quit on you.
L107101 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ I was so afraid you ...
L107100 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ I'm still here.
L107099 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Oh, thank God.
L106882 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ We're almost there, Violet.  just hang on.
L106881 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ okay, all right.
L106880 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Listen, if he doesn't run, all you have to do is break down, go to your bedroom and pack some things, start crying, saying you love him but you can't do it.  You're sorry but you have to leave and just walk out.
L106879 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here!
L106878 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ That means he probably will kill Johnnie.
L106877 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ What if he doesn't run?
L106876 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ It's all right, Violet.  It's working. All we got to do is wait him out and see what he does.
L106875 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Believes it!  Jesus, it's driving him crazy.  He wants to kill him.  I don't know, Corky, I don't know what he is going to do.  I'm getting nervous, really nervous.
L106874 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ That's okay, as long as he believes it was Johnnie.
L106873 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ He totally freaked.  I've never seen him like this.  He's out of his fucking mind.
L106872 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ What happened?
L106871 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ It's me.
L106845 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ I think we're going to find out.
L106844 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ I won't.
L106843 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ I had a partner and she fucked me.
L106842 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Every job like this has moments where things don't go so well and everyone starts thinking about their own ass. It's in those moments that everything comes together or falls apart.
L106841 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?
L106840 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Thank you.
L106839 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Jesus, that's beautiful.
L106838 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ You'll be clean and we'll be rich.
L106837 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.
L106836 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ He'll have to run.
L106817 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ C!  Shit, I'm sorry!
L106816 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ If it's real enough, he'll believe it, because deep down he'll want to.
L106815 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Because of what you are going to tell him.  You have to make it as real as you can.  The moment you open the door with the Scotch in your hand, you will be covered, and that moment is the most important moment in the plan.
L106814 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Why?
L106813 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Not Caesar.
L106812 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ I still don't see how I'm going to get clean with the money in the apartment.  Everyone will think I did it.
L106811 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ The same way I'll know that you went to Scotch.  Trust.
L106810 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ When I get the Scotch, how do I know you won't take off?
L106809 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ There is no going back.
L106802 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ If he does ...
L106801 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ I'm just asking, what if?
L106800 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Trust me, Violet.
L106799 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ You can't know for certain that he won't see you.
L106798 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ He won't.
L106797 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ What if he sees you?
L106784 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Shit!  Oh shit!
L106783 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ An accident.
L106782 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ And as you do, the bottle will slip from your hands.  -- and shatter against the hardwood floor.
L106777 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Waiting in the apartment next door.
L106776 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Where will you be?
L106774 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Poor boy, has to work so hard.
L106773 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ We want him to come down, to relax, feel in control again.
L106769 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Fine.
L106768 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Gino travels with a big man named Roy.  Caesar calls him the driver.
L106767 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Any bodyguards?
L106766 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
L106765 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ What time did you say they would be there?
L106760 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Scotch, Glenlivet.  I remember that Caesar made a huge deal about it.
L106759 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ What did Gino drink?
L106758 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Gino doesn't know English, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much.  He gets right to the point.  Both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left.
L106757 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ It's getting better and better. Keep going.
L106756 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ He does it right in front of him.
L106755 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Has Caesar ever seen him?
L106754 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
L106753 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Does Johnnie hit on you?
L106752 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Not much, really.  Caesar was nervous, kept cleaning the apartment.  |The first time, he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear.
L106751 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ What happened?
L106750 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Yeah, twice.
L106749 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Gino Marzzone is coming to your apartment.  It's a big deal, isn't it?  That means Caesar will be ready. He doesn't want to look like an idiot. Gino has been there before?
L106747 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Sweet Jesus.
L106746 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Yeah.
L106745 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie Marzzone?
L106744 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Yeah.
L106743 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Gino Marzzone is coming tonight to pick up the money?
L106742 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ ...  shit.
L106741 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ That's his brother.
L106740 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Marzzone?  As in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family?
L106739 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Gino Marzzone.
L106738 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Who is Gino?
L106737 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ It started way before I was around. I think basically it's because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot. But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father.
L106736 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Why?
L106735 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Like each other?  They hate each other.
L106734 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other.
L106733 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Johnnie?
L106732 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ All right, now, tell me about Johnnie.
L106731 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Good.
L106730 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Yes.
L106729 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Does the case lock?
L106728 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ It's in a case, on his desk.
L106726 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ In his office.  I saw it this morning.
L106725 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ And where is it now?
L106716 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ To let it dry.
L106715 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ What?
L106714 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ He hung it up.
L106713 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Then what?  Exactly.
L106712 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Yeah.
L106711 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ You said he washed the money?
L106691 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ I think ...
L106690 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Do you think you know me like that?
L106689 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ The difference is, I can have sex with someone I just met, someone I hardly know, but to steal I need to know someone like I know myself.
L106687 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ I'm just making a point.  You have no idea what you're asking.  How much trust two people need to do something like this.
L106686 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Is that what you think?
L106685 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ All you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected, someone like me.
L106684 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ I didn't say that, but since you did, let's say that you are.  It would have been easy to set Shelly up.  You could have got him killed knowing that Caesar would bring the money to the apartment.
L106683 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ You think I'm lying?
L106682 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ All right, let's say for the moment that I believe everything you are saying.
L106681 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ I am, but ...
L106680 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ That's why I need your help.  You said you were good.
L106679 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ These people are serious, Violet. If you want to know how serious, ask Shelly.  They're worse than any cop because they have lots of money and no rules.  You fuck them, you've got to do it right.
L106678 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Do you have any idea what you are saying? You are asking me to help you fuck the mob.
L106677 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Caesar will bring it to the apartment to count and go through |Shelly's books to figure out how he did it.
L106676 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Shelly said it was over two million dollars.
L106675 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ How much money?
L106674 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Caesar is going to get the money and bring --
L106672 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ If those quarters fell to the floor, would you still reach up to that cash register?
L106671 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ What choice?
L106670 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ You made a choice once.  Do you think you would make that same choice again?
L106669 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ For what?
L106668 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ I want out.  I want a new life.  I see what I've been waiting for, but I need you, Corky.
L106665 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ He's the part of the business that the rest of them pretend to be. |But Mickey doesn't like it like they do.  I suppose that's why he's good at it.
L106664 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Mickey?
L106663 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Caesar lives for these moments.  He tells me it's just the business, but I know it's more than that.  He likes it.  The violence.  I'll catch him in the bathroom mirror touching his scars.  He says they remind him who he his.  They're all like that. Except maybe Mickey.
L106662 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Maybe he did.  He would brag to me all the time.  He was never afraid of Caesar because he didn't know him.  Not like I do.
L106661 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Sounds like he wanted to get caught.
L106660 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ For Shelly, taking the money was a way to take from Caesar.  He could have run at any time, but he didn't because he didn't want out.
L106659 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ That's what he told himself.  But it wasn't even about me, it was about Caesar.  He wanted what Caesar had. That's how they are.  I understand them.
L106658 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ He was in love with you, right?
L106657 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Yes.
L106656 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Even though he knew about you?
L106655 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Shelly was skimming from the business. He came to see me yesterday because he was afraid Caesar figured it out. He wanted to run but he wanted me to come with him.
L106617 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ I think so, too.
L106616 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Fuck it!  I think you better leave.
L106615 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ I suppose he just wants to watch.
L106614 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ No.  Shelly knows what I am.  He saw me in a bar with another woman.
L106613 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Don't tell me, you're a workaholic.
L106612 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ You mean Shelly?
L106611 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ What about that guy this morning?
L106610 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ We make our own choices and we pay our own prices.  I think we're more alike than you want to admit.
L106608 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Work.
L106607 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ What was it then?
L106606 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ All my life, everyone has been telling me that when I have sex, I'm not really having sex.  Not real sex. But they're wrong.  I know what is and isn't sex and what you heard was definitely not sex.
L106605 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ What the fuck was it?
L106604 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ What you heard wasn't sex.
L106603 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ For Christ's sake, Violet!  I heard you!  Thin walls, remember?
L106602 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ I don't.
L106601 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ What are you saying?  That you don't have sex with men?
L106600 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ I know what I am.  I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.
L106599 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Is that what her daddy tells her?
L106598 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Oh no, she's nothing like you.  She's a lot smarter than you.
L106597 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Let me guess.  This is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside.  That inside you, there is a little dyke just like me?
L106596 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Because it's the truth.
L106595 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ How can you sit in that bed and say that?
L106594 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ We're not that different, Corky.
L106593 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ I know!  You can't understand, because we're different, Violet.  We're different.
L106592 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ I don't understand - ?
L106591 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ I'm not afraid of anything.
L106590 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ What are you afraid of?
