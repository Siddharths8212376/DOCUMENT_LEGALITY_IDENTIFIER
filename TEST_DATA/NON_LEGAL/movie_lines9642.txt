L113278 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ No...no.
L113277 +++$+++ u4272 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ I know...I mean you didn't do anything special for me tonight.  You just had what I think are good manners, decency. And it really makes me want to be nice back and it has nothing to do with any homosexual thing.  Honestly.  Because I don't know if you've homosexual or not and -- you're not, are you?
L113276 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Yes.  That's right.
L113275 +++$+++ u4272 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Bad manners.
L113274 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I've been doing some morning show stuff, but mostly radio -- that doesn't bother me.  I'm in no rush for anything.  It's just the snotty attitude, even if I have it coming, it's still...
L113267 +++$+++ u4272 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ You talked me into it.
L113266 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Follow me.
L113265 +++$+++ u4272 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ How do I get out of here?
L113264 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ No, I don't think so.
L113263 +++$+++ u4272 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ They're not really going to call security are they?
L113893 +++$+++ u4282 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ WIFE +++$+++ Okay, sweetie.
L113892 +++$+++ u4274 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ ERNIE +++$+++ Bye, sweetie.
L113891 +++$+++ u4282 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ WIFE +++$+++ I could use somebody to talk to on a day like this.  Sorry. Go ahead.
L113890 +++$+++ u4274 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ ERNIE +++$+++ No.  They're firing even more people than they said.  Some will want to talk.  It could help.
L113889 +++$+++ u4282 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ WIFE +++$+++ How horrible.  We'll be fine.  You'll be fine.  Stay here with me -- we'll go for a drive, have some drinks, make happy plans.
L113888 +++$+++ u4274 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ ERNIE +++$+++ They fired me.
L113887 +++$+++ u4282 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ WIFE +++$+++ What?
L113884 +++$+++ u4282 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ WIFE +++$+++ It's Paul.
L113883 +++$+++ u4274 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ ERNIE +++$+++ Tell me I'm on the way in.
L113882 +++$+++ u4282 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ WIFE +++$+++ Ernie, they're calling from work.
L112987 +++$+++ u4275 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Finish quickly.  I don't want you getting obsessive about these things.  Good night.
L112986 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Nooo.  This way the rotation stays the same.
L112985 +++$+++ u4275 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ You don't have to finish tonight.
L112984 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I just have two more pen pals and then I'm done.
L112983 +++$+++ u4275 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Jane -- For God's sake...  Look, it's time for you to go to sleep.
L112981 +++$+++ u4275 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Honey?...
L112980 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ ...am starting to get jealous. I read in the newspapers about the Italian strike and riots in Milan.  I hope you weren't...
L112970 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ That would be great.  It better help.  What can you do with yourself if all you do is look good?
L112969 +++$+++ u4276 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ GERALD +++$+++ Would it help if I got you a tutor?
L112968 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Thanks, Dad, this talk helped.  Will you sign it, please?
L112967 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I'll just have to try harder.  I don't know.  I will.  I will.  I will.  I will.
L112966 +++$+++ u4276 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ GERALD +++$+++ Oh my.  I see you studying so hard, Tom.  What do you think the problem is?
L112965 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I got my report card.  Three Cs, two Ds and an incomplete.
L112964 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ It's not.
L112963 +++$+++ u4276 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ GERALD +++$+++ As long as that's your only problem you're...
L112962 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Proud?  I'm just embarrassed that I like when they say those things.
L112961 +++$+++ u4276 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ GERALD +++$+++ You know, Tom, I feel a little proud when people comment on your looks.  Maybe you should feel that way.
L112960 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ No.  But, honest.  What are you supposed to say when they keep talking about your looks?  I don't even know what they mean -- "Beat them off with a stick."
L112959 +++$+++ u4276 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ GERALD +++$+++ Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?
L112958 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ No, nothing.  I've got a problem, I guess.
L112957 +++$+++ u4276 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ GERALD +++$+++ Go ahead.
L112956 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I don't know.
L112955 +++$+++ u4276 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ GERALD +++$+++ Why so glum?
L112954 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ No.  Not even you.
L112953 +++$+++ u4276 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ GERALD +++$+++ I don't know a recent Saturday I've sold more.  You didn't think I'd sell that health restaurant, did you?
L113473 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Fill for a second.
L113472 +++$+++ u4280 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I had no idea she was this good.
L113407 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ No, it's awful.  Oh my, it's awful.
L113406 +++$+++ u4280 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It must be nice to always believe you know better.  To think you're always the smartest person in the room.
L113405 +++$+++ u4280 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You're just absolutely right and I'm absolutely wrong?
L113404 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ It's not opinion.
L113403 +++$+++ u4280 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Okay, that's your opinion.  I don't agree.
L113402 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Tom isn't ready for the job you're about to hand him.  Not near ready.  Not by the longest shot.  Aaron's spent six weeks in Tripoli, he's interviewed Gaddafi -- he reported on the Eight-one story.  I think he's essential to do the job we're capable of and I think it's my responsibility to tell you that.
L114086 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Okay...It's so good to see you.
L114085 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.
L114084 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Well, we should talk.  You going to have time for  dinner?  I'd like you to meet Lila.
L114083 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll fly up a lot.
L114082 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ What a great surprise.  I didn't think we had a chance.  I heard you wanted to stay in Washington.
L114075 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I thought for ol' Cliff here -- Look at you?  You're more adorable than your pictures.  Look what I got for you.
L114074 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ A picnic?
L114073 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Well, why not?  Hey, what is this?  My life's rushing in front of my eyes.
L114049 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Why did I have to do this to myself?  Watch you take off.  Call me if you need anything.
L114048 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Take it easy.
L114047 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ It's better when you let me say it.
L114046 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Then you should stay here.
L114045 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ It's just that one of the few things I'm not confused about is what I was saying downstairs, that...
L114044 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ You want to come?
L114043 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ So you have an extra bathing suit, huh?
L114041 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ It's okay.
L114040 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Yes, I am.  Thanks.  I mean it.
L114039 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ You're lucky I came after you so you got that off your...
L114038 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ What I don't know, I can learn and what I know, nobody can teach. Excuse me for saying it about myself, but I think it's true.  What do you think?  Never mind what you think.
L114037 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I knew what you meant.
L114036 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Well, let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news.
L114035 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I don't wan to discuss work.
L114034 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ You keep coming after me and looking down on me.  It's starting to make me batty.
L114033 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ That's not going to be the way we say good-bye.  Even though I think what you did was rotten -- it's not all impersonal.  You mean something to me.
L114031 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I'm leaving now.  Gate 43.
L114030 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ It's amazing.  You commit this incredible breach of ethics and you act as if I'm nitpicking.  Try and get this.  When you edited that...
L114029 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ This is a one-way argument.  We've got six days; if you go and we fight and we hate it -- we'll come home.  If you don't go?  Well, that's a much bigger deal.  I go to London right after that. So, it'd be very big deal if you stay here.  The plane's boarding.  You're good at deadline.  Here's your ticket.
L114028 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ It just proves that the difference we have are...
L114027 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ It's hard not to cross it; they keep moving the little sucker, don't they?
L114026 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between...
L114025 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I got promoted for things like that.
L114024 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ It made me ill.  You could get fired for things like that.
L114023 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane...
L114022 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it.  I was up all night and...
L114021 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ We disagree on how God-awful it was.  Why don't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time?
L114020 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Of course it's the reason.  It's terrible what you did.
L114019 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I felt funny about it afterwards.  It's verboten, huh?  I thought since I did it for real the first time -- but I get you.  That's not the reason you're not coming?
L114018 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl.  I know you 'acted' your reaction after the interview.
L114017 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Why?
L114013 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ You fucking...
L114012 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Then give me a minute...
L113975 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ That's more than 'yes' -- that's 'you bet.'
L113974 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ That's yes?
L113973 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Well, I just think that' an extraordinary proposal.
L113972 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Sorry.  I can't stand here feeing bad that I don't feel worse.  This has happened at every station I ever worked for. Look, I think it's crazy for you to come in here tomorrow and start a new job.  I have a week to get to my job.  Let's get the hell away to some island fast and find out how we are together away from this.
L113971 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ How can you say that to me?
L113970 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Maybe I haven't been here long enough.  But, hey, congratulations on the promotion.
L113930 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ That's so perfectly...It really makes me feel a little faint...  Whooo.
L113929 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ That it would be a treat to make someone like you feel better... He gets like that sometimes.
L113928 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ What?
L113927 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Yes.  Then he said a really weird thing...
L113926 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ No.  Did he really?
L113925 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ He -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty.
L113924 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I feel terrible about what happened. What did he say?
L113877 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Okay, great, Grunick -- Easy shots now -- huh?  Good night.
L113876 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Jane, I'm not some chore you have to finish so you can stay on schedule.
L113875 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Good night??!
L113874 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Okay.  Good night.
L113873 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Yes.
L113872 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Hello?
L113871 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I'll see you at the office.  Good night.
L113870 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L113869 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I've got my father coming through tomorrow anyway.  I should get some sleep.
L113868 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I don't know if that's absolutely necessary.
L113867 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ No.  That sounds more important. Let's forget about tonight.
L113866 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Hi, again.  Sorry about...
L113858 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Not if you count 'Singing in the Rain.'  Do him a favor and don't treat it like a tragedy.  You want me to talk to him?
L113857 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ It wasn't as bad as he think, was it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or anything?
L113856 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I know.  I taped it.
L113855 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I'm not sure.  It seems like he had sort of a mishap on the news.
L113854 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Well, when?
L113853 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I can't get away just yet.  I'm at Aaron's.
L113852 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Where are you?
L113851 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Hi.  It's me.
L113801 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Okay.  Sorry.  Don't yell at me like that again, you scared the life out of me.
L113800 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ It's not that it's hard.  I just want you to give me a minute to catch up.
L113799 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ He might be weird -- he can talk more freely if I go alone -- why's that so hard to understand?
L113798 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Don't run off --  like everything's settled the minute you make up your mind.
L113797 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ What happened?
L113795 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ No.  I'll see you at your apartment as soon as I can.
L113794 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I'd like to know.  I'll go along.
L113793 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I forgot all about Aaron.  I promised to stop by and see how he did.
L113790 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Good...Another is you're trying to make it all about sex and heat and nothing else.
L113789 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ That's not it.
L113788 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Three...I just thought of a third... If you talk about it, you don't have to do it.
L113787 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ What?
L113786 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Oh let's see -- wait a minute, well, I can think of two reasons.
L113785 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I don't remember saying anything like that -- exactly...I don't know why I just did.
L113782 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Right, right -- Isn't she fun to tease?
L113781 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Because you're nuts.
L113780 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I was half hoping I wouldn't have a good time tonight.  You know why?
L113779 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ This is hysterical.
L113778 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ You just can't stop editing me. Huh?
L113777 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ At least kiss me when you do that.
L113776 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Well...
L113775 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Why can't I let go of this woman?
L113774 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Great.
L113773 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ You okay?
L113754 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Uh-uh.
L113753 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ You're not going to take off on me, are you?
L113751 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Good.  That's it...See you.
L113750 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Suppose I go in for a little while and you wait in the lobby-bar.  How's that?
L113734 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Me!
L113733 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Who?
L113732 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ It's incredible who's here.
L113649 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Yeah.
L113648 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay?
L113647 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ So what did you think?
L113633 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I like you as much as I can like anyone who thinks I'm an asshole.
L113632 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ So you like me, huh?
L113631 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ We can go together.
L113630 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Oh, good.
L113629 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Maybe I'll get off work.  I'd like to go.
L113628 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L113627 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ No.  Were you going to you?
L113626 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Why, you need me for the story?
L113625 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ No.  Are you going to the Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?
L113624 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Nooo.  Is it your story?
L113623 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ What pills did you take?  You sound more like someone on a general anesthetic.  Maybe I'd better speak to you tomorrow.
L113622 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
L113621 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ It's not important.
L113620 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I had to sleep fast so I took two allergy pills to help me...I'm sorry...Hey, you called me.
L113619 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Yes.
L113618 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Jane, yes.  Tom?  Tom, is that you? Is this Tom?
L113617 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I'm not sure I dialed right -- Jane?
L113611 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Yes, Tom -- I think I can manage.
L113610 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ If I tell you, can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it won't work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that?
L113609 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Well, what is it?
L113608 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me.
L113607 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ What?
L113606 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.
L113605 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?
L113604 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I'm going to have to do a story from beginning to end on my own.
L113603 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Too many smart people in one room -- it's not healthy...
L113602 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?
L113601 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Maybe we could just sit here -- talk a little?
L113558 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I'll get you through.  Move and smile.  And smile and move...
L113557 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
L113556 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ It's much too soon for you to have this kind of buzz around you.
L113555 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I'll be the judge of that.
L113554 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I'm not sure I'd be good company tonight.
L113553 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Come on, I'll buy you a drink. There's a big thing over at the Italian embassy.
L113527 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Hey, I know how to have a burger by myself.  I feel like a little solitude.
L113526 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Jennifer, you want to have another drink?
L113525 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Well, I'll go in and have a bite.
L113524 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ There's no gang in there -- We were the last ones.
L113523 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Well, I thought I'd check if all of you were still here.  I'll just go in and join the gang and you two go on.
