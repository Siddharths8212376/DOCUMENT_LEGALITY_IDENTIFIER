L349005 +++$+++ u1796 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ Then it sounds like I'm doing you a favor.
L349004 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ From the day I started...to today.  Can't stand it.
L349003 +++$+++ u1796 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ What are you talking about?  You love your job.
L349002 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I hate this job.
L349001 +++$+++ u1796 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ Listen...maybe I can get you a year.
L348999 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I was a sophomore when I got the call my parents were dead.
L348998 +++$+++ u1796 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ Class of eighty-six!  I didn't know you were there.
L348997 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ We were probably in school together.  You went to Berkley?
L348996 +++$+++ u1796 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ Forty.
L348995 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ How old are you?
L348994 +++$+++ u1796 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ Oh.
L348991 +++$+++ u1796 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ That's too long.
L348990 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Maybe...?
L348989 +++$+++ u1796 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ Maybe that's too long.
L348988 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I've been here twenty years.
L348987 +++$+++ u1796 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ Which is why we bid out a quarter of our projects.  It doesn't make a lot of sense anymore to want what we don't have and don't want what we do.
L348986 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'm not.
L348985 +++$+++ u1796 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ All of us are typing and clicking, George.  Whether we want to, or not.
L348984 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Typing and clicking myself to renderings isn't why I started building models.
L348983 +++$+++ u1796 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ This isn't me.  We can show clients endless options, change anything in a matter of hours on the computer.  But you won't change.
L348982 +++$+++ u1796 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ Well, that's sort of...you're sure you're not hungry?
L348981 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I did tell you, didn't I?  That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today?
L348980 +++$+++ u1796 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ Peter Webber!  Right.  Quite the spotlight on that guy.
L348979 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ He buys and sells the world.
L348978 +++$+++ u1796 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ Right...she married...what was he?
L348977 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ When we divorce a decade ago, she was very, very angry.  Now she's just hostile.
L348976 +++$+++ u1796 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ How's your wife?
L348975 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Oh...nothing.  Thirty pounds.  I just haven't been very hungry.
L348974 +++$+++ u1796 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ how much weight have you lost?
L348973 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Pardon me?
L348972 +++$+++ u1796 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ BRYAN +++$+++ What are you on?
L348971 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'm good, thanks.
L349886 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Nothing.  My dad's dying.  I really need to talk to Alyssa.
L349885 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ It's midnight.  What's the matter, Sam?
L349884 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Is Alyssa here?
L349474 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ We're getting out of the ground today.
L349473 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ You're here early today.
L349472 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Thank you.
L349471 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ If she's not up, you can use my shower.
L349350 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Thanks, I'd like that.  Thank you.
L349349 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ Come over anytime you need to, Sam.
L349345 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ I want you both to stay.
L349344 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Thanks for the shower.
L349324 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Not a shower.
L349323 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.
L349322 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L349321 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ I didn't recognize you!
L349320 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Uh huh.
L349319 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ Sam?
L349318 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Oh...okay.
L349317 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ She didn't really say.
L349316 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Oh...do you know when she'll be home?
L349315 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ She's out with a friend.
L349314 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Is Alyssa home?
L349836 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ Where are you?  You're driving me crazy, waiting like this.  I want you in me now!
L349835 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Hello?
L349129 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ And you thought they might be under her dress?
L349128 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I forgot where I put my keys.
L348864 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ My life is a warning.  I just can't figure out for what.
L348863 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ I did warn you.
L348862 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You were the only neighbor I could tolerate.
L348861 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ You'll have to explain that to the police.
L348860 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ The plumber's due out on Friday.
L348859 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ George, this is the third time.
L348858 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ There are no windows facing my...exposure.
L348857 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ Does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose your...penis in plain view of my sixteen year-old daughter?
L348856 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ He escaped.  He's going back in.
L348855 +++$+++ u1797 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ This has got to stop!
L349109 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You don't know what the deal is.  There is no fucking deal.
L349108 +++$+++ u1798 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COREY +++$+++ I know what the deal is.  Josh is a pimp. I'm not stupid.
L349107 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I never said anything.  I haven't done anything.
L349106 +++$+++ u1798 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COREY +++$+++ Hey, it beats letting town folk go down on you for the summer.
L349105 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'll ask.
L349104 +++$+++ u1798 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COREY +++$+++ It'll just be my brother the dweeb on weekends.  All we gotta do is sand and paint the cabin, dude.  My dad's gonna let me use the boat and my charm is gonna let me use my rod.  Income village is the place to hook up with hump.
L349103 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I don't know.
L349102 +++$+++ u1798 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ COREY +++$+++ The whole summer, man.  Party in Tahoe.
L349980 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Here.
L349979 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I don't wanna go, Sam.
L349883 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Well, congratulations!  You fucking pulled it off!
L349882 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I never tried to get you to like me.  I tried to get you to love me.
L349881 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ This was all for your sake, wasn't it? Having me here?  Trying to get me to like you.
L349880 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I would have lied to me if I thought I'd believe it.
L349879 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You lied to me!
L349878 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ We're all dying from the start.  I just got picked for Advanced Placement.
L349876 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yes.
L349875 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ And you told Mom today?
L349873 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
L349872 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I still don't know what that means.
L349871 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ The kind where there isn't really an answer.
L349870 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
L349867 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
L349866 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I still don't know what that means.
L349865 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ The kind where there isn't really an answer.
L349864 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
L349862 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ No, but I count them.  In a sock isn't new, you know?
L349861 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Are you taking them still?
L349860 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I mean, do you need to have surgery on it or what?  Because those pills you're taking are for a lot of pain.  And you're going through them quick.
L349859 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What's wrong with your back?
L349858 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ She seemed upset.
L349857 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I don't think Mom cares that much that my...that Peter left.
L349856 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You look better than ever.
L349798 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Absolutely.  Have him put it on a separate line.  At Christmas, we'll pact it so full of lights, we'll make God wear sunglasses.
L349797 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Dale wants to know if we should run an outside outlet for Christmas lights with a switch inside?
L349591 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ That's so weird...
L349590 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ After everything.
L349589 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ After everything he did to you and your mom?
L349588 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I loved him too much.
L349587 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Do you ever wish you had done it?
L349586 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Everything would have been better if you had.  You'd have liked your grandmother. And there'd be a girl out there that'd have her mother.  I remember reading about her in the paper.  They couldn't find her father and her mother was dead. I still feel guilty about that.
L349585 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I would have killed him.
L349584 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.
L349583 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Why wouldn't she leave?
L349582 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ To hide a black eye.
L349581 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Sun glasses?
L349580 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I was just thinking about my mom.  She wouldn't leave him.  I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses.  I mean it was dark outside and in.  But we never talked about it.
L349579 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Are you talking?
L349576 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Don't be.  And hide whatever that new drug is you have.  I like it.
L349575 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'm proud of you, Sam.
L349574 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
L349573 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ If I asked you to stop, would you?
L349572 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Getting high, I guess.
L349571 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What would you be doing now?
L349570 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up.
L349569 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I gave up on you.
L349568 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm telling you now.
L349567 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I wish you had told me then.
L349566 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ He was a prick when I was six, and he's a prick today.
L349565 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I couldn't imagine how I could compete with him for any part of you.  So, I didn't.  He wanted you to have his last name...I let him even take that.
L349564 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ He's got nothing to do with me.
L349563 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ When you started first grade and your mom went to work, it was so she could save for an apartment.  But then she met Peter and skipped the idea of renting.
L349562 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What do you know about me?
L349561 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I know parts of who you are.
L349560 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ See, that's the thing...I am what I say I am.
L349559 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ That's not true.
L349558 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Nothing.
L349557 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What are you now?
L349556 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What I'm not.
L349555 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What would you like to be?
L349554 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ How do you become something you're not?
L349553 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I know the feeling.
L349552 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I like how it feels not to feel.
L349551 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I know.  Why?
L349550 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I took some of your Vicodin.
L349524 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Hi, Mom.
L349523 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Hi, Alyssa.
L349456 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Try it.  It feels good.
L349455 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ We haven't build shit.  You're just tearing down your father.
L349454 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Do whatever you want with it.  I don't care.  All I want from you is for you to remember we built this house together.
L349453 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Don't.  I don't want it.
L349452 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Twenty years of hating what you live in...what you are.  This is the end of it, Sam.  I'm gonna build something of me here that I can be proud to give to you.
L349447 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You know that great thing, though?  Is that change can be so constant you don't even feel the difference until there is one.  It can be so slow that you don't even notice that your life is better or worse, until it is.  Or it can just blow you away.  Make you something different in an instant.  It happened to me.
L349446 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm not even listening.
L349445 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I won't ever hit you.  I don't want you smaller.  I want you to be happy.  You're not.  Not here with me. Not home with your mother.  Not up in Tahoe.  Not alone.  Not anywhere.  You're what I was most of my life, Sam. I see it in your eyes.  In your sleep. In your answer to everything.  You're barely alive.
L349444 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'll have to pay him back.
L349443 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ The game was to make me smaller than he was.  No matter what.  He could be almost invisible as a human being, but I had to be smaller.  So if I got good grades, I was a pussy for not playing football.  If I cut my hair for him, it wasn't short enough.  If I shaved it, I looked like a psycho.  I never won the game.  Not once. And if he couldn't make me smaller with words...
L349442 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I was holding for someone.  That wasn't even mine.
L349441 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ My dad used to play a game.  I never really understood what it was until after he was gone.
L349440 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Oh, so you're in the big shit now!  Child abuse.  People go to prison for what you just did to me.
L349438 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ No.
L349437 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Sit down for a second.
L349436 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You can't make me do a thing.
L349435 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ The gloves on the table are for you.
L349434 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You're too fucking late.
L349433 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'll apologize for everything but today...Today I give a shit.
L349432 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I've been using since I was twelve! You're all so unbelievably stupid.  You didn't give a shit about anything I did until now!
L349417 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I might have a solution.
L349416 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Did you got through my pants?
L349415 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ A friend of yours is here.
L349414 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Where is it?
L349360 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Oh, okay.
L349359 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Well, until you know, you can't go.
L349358 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I don't know.
L349357 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ When are you going to be back?
L349356 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I don't know.
L349355 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Where are you going?
L349354 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Hey...hey!
L349353 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm leaving.
L349313 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You'll have money when you work for it.
L349312 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ If you had a stupid phone or I could use your truck, mom would give me some money.
L349310 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You can't promise me anything!  You don't have anything to promise!  You live in a garage!  You don't have cable!  You're not hooked up to the internet because you don't even own a computer!  You don't have a job!
