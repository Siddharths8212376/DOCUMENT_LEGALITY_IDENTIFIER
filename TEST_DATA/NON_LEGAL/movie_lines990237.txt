L471204 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
L471203 +++$+++ u7288 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
L471202 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Maroon, right?
L471201 +++$+++ u7288 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.
L471200 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
L471199 +++$+++ u7288 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
L471198 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ <u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
L471197 +++$+++ u7288 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ What was <u>that</u>?
L471083 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Yeah, do that.  I'm gonna go rattle Maroon's cage.
L471082 +++$+++ u7288 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Eddie, you still got it.  Hey, tomorrow maybe I'll go down to probate court and see who's sniffin' around Acme's estate?
L471079 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Then why'd they bother to crack the safe?  You can drop a Mosler 90 from Mount Baldy and it won't open.
L471078 +++$+++ u7288 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Maybe they just took it out of his pocket.
L471073 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody wants Acme's property.  Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the will.
L471072 +++$+++ u7288 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ So what's the scam, Eddie?
L471066 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme bad enough to get this.
L471065 +++$+++ u7288 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Can you get him out of it, Eddie?
L471057 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ I oughta have my head examined.  Will you hold still?
L471056 +++$+++ u7288 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ So you decided to help him after all?
L471055 +++$+++ u7288 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ It's all yours.
L471054 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed to him.  Anybody in the back room?
L471053 +++$+++ u7288 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ He's a riot.
L471048 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit.
L471047 +++$+++ u7288 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it is?
L470998 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ He's a Toon... who cares?
L470997 +++$+++ u7288 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ So you're not even gonna bother to find out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?
L470990 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya, Dolores?
L470989 +++$+++ u7288 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ The papers said the safe door was opened, Eddie.
L470985 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Thanks for the vote of confidence.
L470984 +++$+++ u7288 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an ad in the Yellow Pages.
L470969 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.
L470968 +++$+++ u7288 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Do you think the rabbit did it?
L470962 +++$+++ u7288 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Bastards put him on notice.
L470961 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?
L470960 +++$+++ u7288 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ A new outfit bought the Red Car.  Some big company called Cloverleaf Industries.
L470957 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks.
L470956 +++$+++ u7288 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.
L470835 +++$+++ u7288 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ R.K. Maroon.
L470834 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Check the scrawl.
L470833 +++$+++ u7288 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ Is this paper even good?
L470832 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
L470831 +++$+++ u7288 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ This is fifty bucks.  I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.
L470830 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Would this be the same dame who's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out I've got her money.
L470829 +++$+++ u7288 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOLORES +++$+++ So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie? Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a <u>dame</u> who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump.  And it was a <u>dame</u> who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would.  And it's a <u>dame</u> who's tired of waitin' for you to straighten yourself out and get a job!
L471487 +++$+++ u7289 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOOM +++$+++ That's right, me.
L471486 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ You?
L471483 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Not really.  Only a Toon could think of something as goofy as that freeway idea.
L471482 +++$+++ u7289 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOOM +++$+++ Surprised?
L471481 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Holy shit, he's a Toon!
L471447 +++$+++ u7289 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOOM +++$+++ Not for long.  We're retiring the Red Cars.  People will drive, Mr. Valiant, because they'll have to.  And when they drive, they'll have to buy our cars, our tires, our gasoline.
L471446 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ That's what this is all about?  Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.
L471445 +++$+++ u7289 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOOM +++$+++ A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another.
L471444 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ What the hell's a freeway?
L471443 +++$+++ u7289 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOOM +++$+++ Right here where we're standing, will be the cornerstone of my idea... the cloverleaf -- an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways.
L471441 +++$+++ u7289 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOOM +++$+++ They won't care.  Who's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future?
L471440 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Don't you think anyone's gonna notice that Toontown's gone?
L471427 +++$+++ u7289 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOOM +++$+++ It wasn't Toontown they wanted.  It was my idea of how to put the land to better use.
L471426 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Come on, Doom.  What would a company like that want with Toontown?
L471425 +++$+++ u7289 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOOM +++$+++ No one person is Cloverleaf.  We're a vast company with diverse interests... gasoline, tires, automobiles.
L471424 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ So you're Cloverleaf?
L471423 +++$+++ u7289 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOOM +++$+++ No matter.  I don't expect the will to show up in the next fifteen minutes.  By then Cloverleaf will own Toontown quite legally.
L471411 +++$+++ u7289 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOOM +++$+++ I've had enough of your insolence!  Put him in my car.  I think they'll enjoy attending our ribbon cutting at the Acme factory.
L471410 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.
L471409 +++$+++ u7289 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOOM +++$+++ These roads can be very treacherous at night, especially in a maniacal Toon vehicle.
L471258 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Yeah?  Well, don't expect the Toons to give you a gold watch.
L471257 +++$+++ u7289 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOOM +++$+++ Well, why not?  I'm feeling magnanimous tonight.  The successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist. I'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector.
L471253 +++$+++ u7289 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOOM +++$+++ Yes, and for that you're charged with aiding and abetting.  But we'll let Santino handle that.
L471252 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ I don't think it's gonna matter. Sorry, pal, I tried.
L471145 +++$+++ u7289 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOOM +++$+++ You're a very stubborn man, Mr. Valiant.  Very pig-headed.  Boys, show Mr. Valiant how we handle pig-headed men at the Toontown station...
L471144 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me Santino.
L471143 +++$+++ u7289 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOOM +++$+++ Indeed we are.  We'll continue the interrogation there.
L471142 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ You're not takin' me to downtown <u>Toon</u>town?
L471141 +++$+++ u7289 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOOM +++$+++ Oh, not <u>that</u> downtown.  <u>Toon</u>town.
L471140 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Downtown?  Fine.  Get a hold of Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk to him.
L471139 +++$+++ u7289 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOOM +++$+++ Take it easy, Bongo.  We'll handle Mr. Valiant our own way... downtown.
L471138 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ The other people who were in here lookin' for the will.  I woulda caught 'em if Cheetah here hadn't interrupted me.
L471137 +++$+++ u7289 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOOM +++$+++ They?
L471136 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ They must've taken it off me.
L471132 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ He had a will, all right.  She took it off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon knocked him off.  Then she set up her loving husband to take the fall.
L471131 +++$+++ u7289 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOOM +++$+++ Marvin Acme had no will.  I should know, the probate is in my court.
L471128 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Ask her...
L471127 +++$+++ u7289 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOOM +++$+++ Being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective.  What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant?
L470933 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Have you tried Walla Walla?  Kokomo's very nice this time of year.
L470932 +++$+++ u7289 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOOM +++$+++ So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
L470931 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Why would he contact me?  I just took some lousy pictures.
L470930 +++$+++ u7289 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOOM +++$+++ Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift for the work.  The rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he?
L470929 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Men?  They look more like weasles to me.
L470925 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Hey, pal, do I look like a stenographer?
L470924 +++$+++ u7289 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ DOOM +++$+++ Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?
L470923 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ He's not my client.  I was workin' for R.K. Maroon.
L471160 +++$+++ u7290 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Uh, Eddie, do me a favor.  Could you sit in the back so you won't cause as much of a commotion.
L471159 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Not much.  It's hard to talk.
L471158 +++$+++ u7290 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Does it hurt?
L471157 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ No...
L471156 +++$+++ u7290 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.
L471155 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ What am I, Earl?
L471154 +++$+++ u7290 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Boy, I'll say.  They gave you a real Toon-a-Roo.
L471153 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Toon cops worked me over.
L471152 +++$+++ u7290 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?
L471151 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Earl... it's me, Valiant.
L471150 +++$+++ u7290 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Here's one for the books... a Toon wearin' human clothes.
L471406 +++$+++ u7291 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ JESSICA RABBIT +++$+++ Eddie, come on.
L471405 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Hold on a second.
L471397 +++$+++ u7291 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ JESSICA RABBIT +++$+++ He made me laugh.
L471396 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?
L471395 +++$+++ u7291 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ JESSICA RABBIT +++$+++ Looks like our goose is cooked, our hash is slung, our fait is accompli...
L471394 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ A joker to the end.
L471393 +++$+++ u7291 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ JESSICA RABBIT +++$+++ When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.
L471392 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ So where is it?
L471391 +++$+++ u7291 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ JESSICA RABBIT +++$+++ Marvin told me.  Doom was after his land.  Ne was afraid.  That's why he brought me his will.
L471390 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ How did you get onto Doom?
L471387 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ He's right here in the...
L471386 +++$+++ u7291 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ JESSICA RABBIT +++$+++ Where is he?
L471385 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ We're even.  By the way, I did find your husband.
L471384 +++$+++ u7291 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ JESSICA RABBIT +++$+++ I didn't know who I could trust.
L471383 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Why didn't you tell me?
L471382 +++$+++ u7291 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ JESSICA RABBIT +++$+++ It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?
L471379 +++$+++ u7291 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ JESSICA RABBIT +++$+++ Don't worry, you're not the first.  We better get out of here.
L471378 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.
L471377 +++$+++ u7291 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ JESSICA RABBIT +++$+++ That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's men.  He killed R.K. Maroon.
L471376 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ You shot Roger.
L471187 +++$+++ u7291 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ JESSICA RABBIT +++$+++ If I'm as bad as you think, what's stopping me from just killing you right now?
L471186 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.
L471185 +++$+++ u7291 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ JESSICA RABBIT +++$+++ It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it?
L471184 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ So altruistic.
L471182 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ I'm not complainin'.  But give me credit.  I'm the guy who took the pictures of you and Acme playin' pattycake, remember?
L471181 +++$+++ u7291 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ JESSICA RABBIT +++$+++ I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
L471180 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
L471179 +++$+++ u7291 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ JESSICA RABBIT +++$+++ Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
L471178 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.
L471177 +++$+++ u7291 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ JESSICA RABBIT +++$+++ No, no, no... I love my husband.
L471176 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
L471175 +++$+++ u7291 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ JESSICA RABBIT +++$+++ You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything.
L471174 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ No?  I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
L471173 +++$+++ u7291 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ JESSICA RABBIT +++$+++ Toons aren't given imperfections.
L471172 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?
L471170 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a towel.
L471169 +++$+++ u7291 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ JESSICA RABBIT +++$+++ Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.
L471168 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ That's because I don't have a doorbell.
L471167 +++$+++ u7291 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ JESSICA RABBIT +++$+++ Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear it.
L471130 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Look, doll, if I wanted underwear, I woulda broken into Frederick's of Hollywood.  I was lookin' for Marvin Acme's will.
L471129 +++$+++ u7291 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ JESSICA RABBIT +++$+++ Last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir.  Maybe that's what he was after?
L471493 +++$+++ u7292 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ LT. SANTINO +++$+++ Jesus Christ... <u>that</u> was the Judge?
L471492 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Doom.
L471491 +++$+++ u7292 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ LT. SANTINO +++$+++ What the hell is that?
L470951 +++$+++ u7292 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ LT. SANTINO +++$+++ That's how he gets rid of the troublemakers.  It's a combination of acetone, turpentine and paint remover. He calls it the...  Final Solution.
L470950 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ What's with the dip?
L470940 +++$+++ u7292 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ LT. SANTINO +++$+++ No one knows.  He bought the election a few years back.  He's been rulin' Toontown ever since.
L470939 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?
L470910 +++$+++ u7292 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ LT. SANTINO +++$+++ Wait here...
L470909 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ What a gasser.
L470908 +++$+++ u7292 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ LT. SANTINO +++$+++ They say the rabbit got the safe idea from a cartoon he was makin' the other day.
L470906 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Just haven't been this close to Toontown for awhile.
L470905 +++$+++ u7292 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ LT. SANTINO +++$+++ Now what?
L470903 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ That's what you woke me up for?
L470902 +++$+++ u7292 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ LT. SANTINO +++$+++ Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for a Toon named Roger the Rabbit.
L471349 +++$+++ u7293 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ MAROON +++$+++ There's no time to take it easy!  You don't realize the diabolical mind we're dealing with!
L471348 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Take it easy.
L471347 +++$+++ u7293 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ MAROON +++$+++ You tricked me, damn you!
L471346 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ No, I don't.
L471345 +++$+++ u7293 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ MAROON +++$+++ You got the will in there, don't ya?
L471343 +++$+++ u7293 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ MAROON +++$+++ No, you gotta understand, Valiant, I had nothin' to do with Acme gettin' killed.  I just wanted to sell my studio.  But they wouldn't buy my property unless Acme would sell his. And he wouldn't.  So I was gonna blackmail Acme with pictures of him and the rabbit's wife.
L471342 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Well, everybody needs a hobby.
L471341 +++$+++ u7293 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ MAROON +++$+++ No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
L471340 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?
L471339 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ That was the idea.
L471338 +++$+++ u7293 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ MAROON +++$+++ Valiant!  You surprised me.
L471324 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Stop what?
L471323 +++$+++ u7293 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ MAROON +++$+++ Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing.
L471322 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Maybe.  Why?
L471321 +++$+++ u7293 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ MAROON +++$+++ Have you got the will?
L471320 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Maroon?  Whaddaya want?
L471099 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Yeah, but I enlarged this one.  Thought you might be interested.
L471098 +++$+++ u7293 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ MAROON +++$+++ I've already seen your photographs.
L471097 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
L471096 +++$+++ u7293 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ MAROON +++$+++ Valiant?  What're you doin' here?
L471095 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?
L470894 +++$+++ u7293 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ MAROON +++$+++ Sure, Valiant, sure...
L470893 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Son-of-a-bitch...  Mr. Maroon, I think I'll be goin' now, so about the rest of my fee...
L470888 +++$+++ u7293 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ MAROON +++$+++ Frankly, I'm shocked.  Marvin Acme's been my friend and neighbor for thirty years.
L470887 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Well, you better start thinkin' about drinkin' it black.
L470820 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ As soon as is humanly possible.
L470819 +++$+++ u7293 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ MAROON +++$+++ When will I hear from you?
L470818 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Aren't you the lucky one...
L470817 +++$+++ u7293 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ MAROON +++$+++ I got him on loan from Disney.
L470813 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ So's the job.
L470812 +++$+++ u7293 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ MAROON +++$+++ A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.
L470811 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ The job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks.
L470810 +++$+++ u7293 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ MAROON +++$+++ You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You can catch her in action there.
L470809 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ I don't work in Toontown.
L470808 +++$+++ u7293 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ MAROON +++$+++ Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.
L470807 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ So what do you want me to do?
L470806 +++$+++ u7293 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ MAROON +++$+++ Here's the problem...  "Seen cooing over calamari with notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger".  His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.  The doubt's eatin' him up.
L470805 +++$+++ u7293 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ MAROON +++$+++ Nah, that goes with the territory. He's a stunt bunny.
L470804 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ One too many safes dropped on his head?
L470803 +++$+++ u7293 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ MAROON +++$+++ Yeah, and there's no business as expensive.  I'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest Bunnysitter cartoon and it's all because that rabbit can't keep his mind on his work. And you know why?
L470802 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ Only there's no business like it, no business I know.
L470801 +++$+++ u7293 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ MAROON +++$+++ How much do you know about show business, Valiant?
L470795 +++$+++ u7293 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ MAROON +++$+++ So what?  He's already put me three weeks behind on the shooting schedule!
L470794 +++$+++ u7295 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ VALIANT +++$+++ He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?
L470793 +++$+++ u7293 +++$+++ m492 +++$+++ MAROON +++$+++ Valiant, did you see the rabbit?
