L548943 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ It was a veal stock, I thi...
L548942 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Okay, if they're going to <u>have</u> a sauce, put something <u>in</u> it besides flour and chicken broth...
L549433 +++$+++ u7886 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Tucker hasn't penned Ben's present yet -- it won't be too much longer.
L549432 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Something came up.  C'mon Ben! I've got a shoot at three...
L549431 +++$+++ u7886 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ In seven years Jackie's never missed one of Tucker's parties. Where is she?
L549430 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ No.  I'm doing it behind her back.
L549429 +++$+++ u7886 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Does Jackie know this?
L549428 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Hi, I'm here to pick up Ben.
L550354 +++$+++ u7893 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Hmmm...Do I know any...personally...?
L550353 +++$+++ u7887 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ BRADY +++$+++ Well, I'm supposed to watch Schindler's List for homework. The movie's like almost four hours. And then I'm supposed to write a report on survivors.  You know any survivors, Dad?
L550350 +++$+++ u7893 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Oh, yeah?
L550349 +++$+++ u7887 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ BRADY +++$+++ We're studying the Holocaust in Social Studies.
L550329 +++$+++ u7887 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ BRADY +++$+++ Man, I am out of here! This family is so fucked!
L550328 +++$+++ u7893 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ You heard me: leave the table!
L550327 +++$+++ u7887 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ BRADY +++$+++ What?
L550326 +++$+++ u7893 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Out! Leave the table!
L550299 +++$+++ u7893 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ He isn't.
L550298 +++$+++ u7887 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ BRADY +++$+++ What if he is?
L550297 +++$+++ u7893 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Don't ever say that.
L550296 +++$+++ u7887 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ BRADY +++$+++ Maybe he's gay.
L550295 +++$+++ u7893 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ I don't know what's wrong with that kid.
L550506 +++$+++ u7887 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ BRADY +++$+++ Thanks, Scoob.
L550505 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ No prob. I'm cool.
L550504 +++$+++ u7887 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ BRADY +++$+++ And like, don't take this the wrong way...I mean, I'm cool...but...you know...I've got a good reputation at school and, well...I really don't want it ruined.
L550503 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ Oh.
L550502 +++$+++ u7887 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ BRADY +++$+++ You know...Stanley...
L550501 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ Like what?
L550500 +++$+++ u7887 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ BRADY +++$+++ There are some rumors...
L550499 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ What?
L550498 +++$+++ u7887 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ BRADY +++$+++ There's something I need to talk about with you.
L550497 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ Hey. What's up?
L550496 +++$+++ u7887 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ BRADY +++$+++ Hey.
L550361 +++$+++ u7891 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ FERN +++$+++ But that could've happened to him. Or to me, if I'd been alive. Or you.
L550360 +++$+++ u7887 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ BRADY +++$+++ Even though it was only his cousins that were killed?
L550359 +++$+++ u7891 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ FERN +++$+++ Well, he did. With his family. But his cousins, they had to stay and they were all killed. And if he'd stayed, he would have been killed. So in my book he's a survivor.
L550358 +++$+++ u7887 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ BRADY +++$+++ But I thought he came over to America before the war.
L550357 +++$+++ u7891 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ FERN +++$+++ Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis.
L550356 +++$+++ u7887 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ BRADY +++$+++ He was in a concentration camp?
L550355 +++$+++ u7891 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ FERN +++$+++ Well, technically your Zeda is a survivor.
L550301 +++$+++ u7887 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ BRADY +++$+++ He's vegetarian, doesn't do sports...
L550300 +++$+++ u7891 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ FERN +++$+++ Marty, ignore him.
L550492 +++$+++ u7888 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ CONAN +++$+++ TV talk-show host, OK. You were at sidekick eight seconds ago, then TV talk-show host. You'll be a Latin dictator in a bout a minute.
L550491 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.
L550490 +++$+++ u7888 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ CONAN +++$+++ Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
L550489 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ Well, I was thinking...I might work for you.
L550488 +++$+++ u7888 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ CONAN +++$+++ And thank you for dressing up for us. This is very classy. Tell us. What kind of professional plans do you have? What's in your future?
L550487 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ Great to be here.
L550486 +++$+++ u7888 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ CONAN +++$+++ Nice to have you here.
L550485 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ Thank you.
L550484 +++$+++ u7888 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ CONAN +++$+++ Welcome to the show, Scooby.
L550482 +++$+++ u7888 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ CONAN +++$+++ Really? Well, all right! Let's take a look at the television and see how we look.
L550481 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ I'll be your guest!
L550480 +++$+++ u7888 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ CONAN +++$+++ I'm looking for a last-minute guest for my show. Any suggestions?
L550479 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ Conan O'Brien? Whoa! What are you doing here?
L550478 +++$+++ u7888 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ CONAN +++$+++ Hey, Scooby! How's it going?
L550585 +++$+++ u7889 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ CONSUELO +++$+++ Well then, when you get older you can do something about it.
L550584 +++$+++ u7894 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ Sometimes I feel like my parents don't love me.
L550583 +++$+++ u7889 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ CONSUELO +++$+++ It is when you love someone, and they don't love you. And then you do something about it.
L550582 +++$+++ u7894 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ Consuelo, what is rape exactly?
L550581 +++$+++ u7889 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ CONSUELO +++$+++ For rape and murder.
L550580 +++$+++ u7894 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ Why was he on Death Row?
L550579 +++$+++ u7889 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ CONSUELO +++$+++ I know!
L550578 +++$+++ u7894 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ But really, you never know.
L550577 +++$+++ u7889 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ CONSUELO +++$+++ I am sure.
L550576 +++$+++ u7894 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ But still, you can't be sure.
L550575 +++$+++ u7889 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ CONSUELO +++$+++ He wasn't.
L550574 +++$+++ u7894 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ Maybe he was and you just didn't know it.
L550573 +++$+++ u7889 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ CONSUELO +++$+++ Jesus was not bad.
L550572 +++$+++ u7894 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ Maybe it's for the best…I mean, if he was guilty of doing  something wrong…People who are bad should be killed. Don't you think so?
L550571 +++$+++ u7889 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ CONSUELO +++$+++ Poison gas.
L550570 +++$+++ u7894 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ How did they execute him?
L550569 +++$+++ u7889 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ CONSUELO +++$+++ He was executed. He was on Death Row and then he was executed.
L550568 +++$+++ u7894 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ Oh. How did it happen?
L550567 +++$+++ u7889 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ CONSUELO +++$+++ He's dead.
L550566 +++$+++ u7894 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ Gee, I didn't even know you had any children. But why are you so upset about Jesus?
L550565 +++$+++ u7889 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ CONSUELO +++$+++ My grandchild-baby.
L550564 +++$+++ u7894 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ You have a bay?
L550563 +++$+++ u7889 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ CONSUELO +++$+++ My baby.
L550562 +++$+++ u7894 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ Who is Jesus?
L550561 +++$+++ u7889 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ CONSUELO +++$+++ My Jesus…
L550560 +++$+++ u7894 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ Consuelo, I'm sorry, but you know if you don't speak English I can't understand you.
L550559 +++$+++ u7889 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ CONSUELO +++$+++ Mi Jesus esta muerto!
L550558 +++$+++ u7894 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ Speak English.
L550557 +++$+++ u7889 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ CONSUELO +++$+++ Mi Jesus…mi jesus…
L550556 +++$+++ u7894 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ Yes, you are. I can tell. What's the matter?
L550555 +++$+++ u7889 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ CONSUELO +++$+++ No.
L550554 +++$+++ u7894 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ Consuelo. Are you crying?
L550525 +++$+++ u7894 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ But it's not like real work. This is just babysitting.
L550524 +++$+++ u7889 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ CONSUELO +++$+++ This is work.
L550523 +++$+++ u7894 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do?
L550522 +++$+++ u7889 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ CONSUELO +++$+++ I'm always working.
L550521 +++$+++ u7894 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ But like, what do you like to do when you're not working?
L550520 +++$+++ u7889 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ CONSUELO +++$+++ No, Mikey.
L550519 +++$+++ u7894 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ Hmmm.  But, Consuelo, even though your poor, don't you have any hobbies or interests or anything?
L550518 +++$+++ u7889 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ CONSUELO +++$+++ I'm still poor.
L550517 +++$+++ u7894 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ Must've been hard being poor.
L550516 +++$+++ u7889 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ CONSUELO +++$+++ We had to work. My family was poor.
L550515 +++$+++ u7894 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?
L550514 +++$+++ u7889 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ CONSUELO +++$+++ I did not go to high school.
L550513 +++$+++ u7894 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ When I'm in high school I'm not going to play any football. I'm just going to concentrate on class rank.  What did you do in high school?
L550344 +++$+++ u7889 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ CONSUELO +++$+++ No.
L550343 +++$+++ u7894 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?
L550342 +++$+++ u7889 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ CONSUELO +++$+++ It was God's will.
L550341 +++$+++ u7894 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ Wow.  Why did your parents have so many children? I mean, if they were poor, wouldn't it be better to have just one or two?
L550340 +++$+++ u7889 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ CONSUELO +++$+++ Four brothers and five sisters.
L550339 +++$+++ u7894 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ Really? How many?
L550338 +++$+++ u7889 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ CONSUELO +++$+++ Yes.
L550337 +++$+++ u7894 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ Do you have any brothers or sisters?
L550336 +++$+++ u7889 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ CONSUELO +++$+++ Yes, Mikey?
L550335 +++$+++ u7894 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ Consuelo?
L550551 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ I don't know. Maybe they'll like it.
L550550 +++$+++ u7890 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ EDITOR +++$+++ What's an audience going to tell you?
L550549 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Well, I need to see this with an audience!
L550548 +++$+++ u7890 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ EDITOR +++$+++ We're not ready!
L550547 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Hip alternative types who will understand the process better…
L550546 +++$+++ u7890 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ EDITOR +++$+++ We're not ready.
L550545 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ OK, then we can invite serious intellectual types.
L550544 +++$+++ u7890 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ EDITOR +++$+++ I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to go. You still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screening…
L550543 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ OK, you're right, you're right…  You know, we need to screen what we've got…invite some regular people, just some random off-the- street types…and see what real people think of this.
L550542 +++$+++ u7890 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ EDITOR +++$+++ I mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity?
L550541 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Nothing, I guess…
L550540 +++$+++ u7890 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ EDITOR +++$+++ You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
L550539 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ No, no, no. No exploitation. This is serious…But don't you find it a little funny too, at the same time?
L550538 +++$+++ u7890 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ EDITOR +++$+++ I mean, without this footage, without this rigorous documentation, it would feel like exploitation.
L550537 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Yes, I know…But still, it should be somewhat entertaining.
L550536 +++$+++ u7890 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ EDITOR +++$+++ This is entertainment you're making, Toby. This story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has, with this Brady crisis, evolved into something much richer and more provocative.
L550535 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ You think so? You don't think that this might not be a little dry?
L550534 +++$+++ u7890 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ EDITOR +++$+++ This is definitely better.
L550425 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Thanks. I'll tell Mike.  Well, it's still just a beginning. I know I can...dig deeper.
L550424 +++$+++ u7890 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ EDITOR +++$+++ The camerawork's nice.
L550423 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ Yes, I do. I love them!
L550422 +++$+++ u7890 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ EDITOR +++$+++ No, you don't.
L550421 +++$+++ u7890 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ EDITOR +++$+++ You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people.
L550420 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is.
L550419 +++$+++ u7890 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ EDITOR +++$+++ Well, I'm not really sure what you're trying to say. It's funny, I suppose. But it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are.
L550418 +++$+++ u7900 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ TOBY +++$+++ So whaddya think?
L550436 +++$+++ u7894 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ 550 verbal, 520 math. And I'm only in fifth grade!
L550435 +++$+++ u7891 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ FERN +++$+++ What?
L550434 +++$+++ u7894 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ I was looking through Scooby's SATs practice books this afternoon and I took one of the practice tests. Guess what score I got?
L550433 +++$+++ u7891 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ FERN +++$+++ Yes, Mikey?
L550432 +++$+++ u7894 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ Mom?
L550404 +++$+++ u7891 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ FERN +++$+++ Boys, take napkins...Napkins...
L550403 +++$+++ u7894 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ Twinkeys!
L550309 +++$+++ u7894 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MIKEY +++$+++ I'm serious! What happens if he blows up the school?
L550308 +++$+++ u7891 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ FERN +++$+++ Don't even joke about that!
L550654 +++$+++ u7891 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ FERN +++$+++ Of course, honey. Come in bed with us. Come on.
L550653 +++$+++ u7893 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Sure!...
L550613 +++$+++ u7891 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ FERN +++$+++ He's right.
L550612 +++$+++ u7893 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Look, we're not suckers. Everyone else is out there doing the same thing.
L550611 +++$+++ u7891 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ FERN +++$+++ It's all about who you know.
L550608 +++$+++ u7891 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ FERN +++$+++ You know, you have to. Sometimes you just have to, Toby.
L550607 +++$+++ u7893 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ We used pull.
L550406 +++$+++ u7891 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ FERN +++$+++ Don't worry, he doesn't mean money.
L550405 +++$+++ u7893 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Not to be crass, but what do we get out of this?
L550320 +++$+++ u7893 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ You started filling out your college applications yet?
L550319 +++$+++ u7891 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ FERN +++$+++ Marty...
L550316 +++$+++ u7891 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ FERN +++$+++ Got a lot of homework?
L550315 +++$+++ u7893 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Steak's really good tonight. SCOOBY  Good.
L550431 +++$+++ u7891 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ FERN +++$+++ The SATs, knucklehead. SCOOBY I'm not taking them.
L550430 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ What's tomorrow?
L550429 +++$+++ u7891 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ FERN +++$+++ Ready for tomorrow?
L550428 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ Fine.
L550427 +++$+++ u7891 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ FERN +++$+++ Hi, Scooby! How was school today?
L550365 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ But then, in a sense, since you would never have met Dad if your family had stayed in Europe...if it weren't for Hitler, none of us would have been born.
L550364 +++$+++ u7891 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ FERN +++$+++ Well...yes. If it hadn't been for Hitler, he wouldn't have had to leave Europe. We would have been...European.
L550352 +++$+++ u7891 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ FERN +++$+++ How was the class?
L550351 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ We did the same thing last year also.
L550323 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ I dunno.
L550322 +++$+++ u7891 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ FERN +++$+++ What are you going to do?
L550314 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ My CD case like totally collapsed. I'm gonna have to recatalogue all weekend.  Hey. Can you pass the salad over.
L550313 +++$+++ u7891 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ FERN +++$+++ Is everything OK?
L550312 +++$+++ u7898 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ SCOOBY +++$+++ Was anyone in my room today?
L550147 +++$+++ u7901 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ VI +++$+++ I admit it - I was scared! I was shocked, in fact , by what he said. And he's so...convincing. I'm sorry if I let you down, but really, I still say he's just one opinion. I don't even like his books that much. They're all so aggressively confrontational. I don't care if he's won the Pulitzer Prize.
L550146 +++$+++ u7892 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
L550145 +++$+++ u7901 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ VI +++$+++ That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch Catherine.
L550144 +++$+++ u7892 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Patronizing fuck! If you had just been honest with me in the first place I wouldn't have read it. I knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I believed you!
L550143 +++$+++ u7901 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ VI +++$+++ Marcus...You'll write something better next time!
L550142 +++$+++ u7892 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Your story was terrible!
L550141 +++$+++ u7901 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ VI +++$+++ You know he hated my story also.
L550140 +++$+++ u7892 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?
L550139 +++$+++ u7901 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ VI +++$+++ Don't be so upset. It's OK...
L550138 +++$+++ u7892 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ What do you want?
L550126 +++$+++ u7892 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Look, Vi, I don't blame you. You feel You feel pity now. The pleasure isn't there any more. The kinkiness has gone...You've become kind.
L550125 +++$+++ u7901 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ VI +++$+++ I was never much of a sweater. You know that.
L550124 +++$+++ u7892 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ You've lost interest...You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.
L550123 +++$+++ u7901 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ VI +++$+++ Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
L550122 +++$+++ u7892 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ You're tired of me. I can tell.
L550121 +++$+++ u7901 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ VI +++$+++ You'll read it in class tomorrow. Surprise me.  Anyway, I have to go. I promised Melinda I'd help her with her oral.

L550117 +++$+++ u7901 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ VI +++$+++ Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
L550116 +++$+++ u7892 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.

L550114 +++$+++ u7892 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Well, I changed the ending a little.
L550113 +++$+++ u7901 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ VI +++$+++ You mean, again?
L550112 +++$+++ u7892 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ I can read it to you.
L550111 +++$+++ u7901 +++$+++ m534 +++$+++ VI +++$+++ Huh?
