L66406 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.
L66205 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ He can wait. Kendall's out of surgery.
L66204 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ He's not done by a longshot, I can get more out of him --
L66073 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ I'm not gonna let that happen.
L66072 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ Tom, bottom line: I let those kids go out there. If JAG shows up and I don't have any answers for them, my career is finished --
L66071 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ And I'm the closest thing to it, right?
L66070 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
L66069 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Which gives us about five hours. Why'd you call me?
L66066 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ Cadet Roberto R. Nunez. Killed right in front of me.
L66065 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
L66064 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.
L66063 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ And the problem is you only got three.
L66062 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ The exercise was one of his Section Eight "private sessions". Left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning.
L66058 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Well, he's a good soldier.
L66057 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ A few years ago, the Army picked our good buddy as their go to non-com to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder, gentler military. He even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming Basic cadets across the country.
L66053 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ It's not West, is it? Tell me it's not West.
L66052 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ The official term for it is "Clusterfuck". By the time Beth hit us, I'd canceled all off base exercises save one -- a six man cadet team and their Drill out in the bush. We're missing three and the Sergeant. The cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle, nobody here knows much about them, up to and including their names. But the Sergeant...
L66049 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ And here you are going out of house. How's that make you feel, Jules?
L66048 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne, the closest thing we have to an in- house investigator.
L66046 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Tell me what I can do.
L66045 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way --
L66044 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ That bad?
L66043 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ What kind of trouble are you in?
L66042 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ Been better.  I read about what's been happening with you... I should have called --
L66041 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ How are you?
L66996 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Yeah. But he was a lot of other things, too. Thanks.
L66995 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ He was your friend.
L66994 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you.
L66993 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Your phone number?
L66992 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Yeah.
L66991 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ I should probably write that down.
L66990 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ A word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them.
L66989 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Want company?
L66988 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Nah.
L66987 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Think it'll work?
L66986 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
L66985 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
L66984 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ What are you doing out here?
L66954 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.
L66953 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Do I have a choice in this?
L66951 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Nobody saw. But I don't think so.
L66950 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ West?
L66946 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Far as I'm concerned, whatever you did in the past can stay in the past.
L66945 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Really.
L66944 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ You're a good man, Hardy.
L66943 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.
L66942 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ That's not true.
L66939 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Tough.
L66938 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ What if I don't want it?
L66937 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.
L66936 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ This isn't the time --
L66934 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Seven guys. What was it you said? You were "just starting to believe I wasn't the guy people said".
L66933 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ What?
L66932 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Seven.
L66931 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ We need to talk --
L66920 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ No death certificates. No crime.
L66919 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ No bodies, no West...
L66859 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ WHERE'S WEST'S BODY?
L66858 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Hardy, for Chrissakes --
L66857 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ We can tie you to the chair if it'll work better for you --
L66855 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Isn't this how your story goes?
L66854 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Hardy, what are you doing --
L66832 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Right back where we started.
L66831 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ We got maybe three minutes till they break it down.
L66819 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Get in.
L66818 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Four --
L66803 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Good, just making sure.
L66802 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ No.
L66801 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.  I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?
L66800 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ We were close to something with Kendall.
L66799 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ That's gonna stay my secret.
L66798 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ For what?
L66797 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all I did here was follow orders. It didn't add up. Plus, I got kicked out.
L66796 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ You know, you never told me why you left the army.
L66795 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Nah.
L66794 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Think it'll work?
L66793 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
L66792 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ So what now?
L66775 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ So did I.
L66774 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Yeah.
L66773 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ You wanted to break him.
L66772 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ You mean the falsely accused?
L66771 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy.
L66770 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ You wanted to get the truth.
L66769 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Yeah, I could've. Should've.
L66768 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ You couldn't have known --
L66767 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ I pushed him too hard.
L66712 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ See, I just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls; then I call every newspaper in the country with the story about how Senator Kendall's gay son went nuts on a training mission --
L66711 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ That's a fantastic idea --
L66704 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Good idea.
L66703 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Why don't you talk to Levi off the record for a second?
L66699 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Positive. Hardy, they planned this.
L66698 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Are you sure?
L66697 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ What Kendall said -- "the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around." That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter.
L66696 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ What?
L66695 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ They got their stories straight.
L66694 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ We're fucked, I know --
L66649 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Let's go talk to Bill...
L66648 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Little bit.
L66647 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ That bugs you too?
L66646 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?
L66645 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.
L66644 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Buttfucks the cabin?
L66643 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
L66642 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --
L66641 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world.
L66640 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.
L66639 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events.
L66638 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Dunbar.
L66637 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.
L66636 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Talk it through: Childs, Mueller, and Nunez know they're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill, hurricane or no hurricane, so they plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike.
L66499 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ What happened next?
L66498 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ At least you and Kendall agree on that.
L66472 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Dunbar... He said he didn't shoot West. West wasn't shot, Kendall said he was blown apart by a phosphorous grenade and Dunbar never saw the body.
L66471 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ What?
L66470 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ I didn't shoot West...
L66468 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that.  We can do this, Hardy.
L66467 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Why do you care?
L66466 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ But you will.
L66465 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my "great second chance", Osborne. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here --
L66464 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ I was starting to believe you, you know? That you weren't who everyone said. I guess I was wrong --
L66463 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Phenomenal at taking bribes, right?
L66462 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --
L66461 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ West was a monster! Fifteen years ago, I was here, I was Section Eight, I was Pike. Fuck being the knife dummy -- that thing he did, stripping Pike down, making him stand outside all night? He did that every year, he did that to me. Fifteen years ago, I wanted him dead, and now I'm supposed to care that somebody offed him? Sorry, no can do. I tried.
L66460 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ You said you owed Styles and now you're gonna turn your back on him?
L66459 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Watch me.
L66458 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --
L66457 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ You knew what he was capable of and you just stood by. It was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass, and you know what? He deserved it. There's your confession.
L66456 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend --
L66449 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ I don't know.
L66448 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?
L66417 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Well, I'm sure if he'd known this was all going to happen he'd have tried harder to witness it for you --
L66416 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Look, all we've got is what Kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except Nunez. He found West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies -- he didn't see any crime committed.
L66415 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.
L66414 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ I just... He came back for Kendall. I don't think he's capable of murder.
L66413 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ That means under a year. Let me explain what ten years of police work has taught me -- murder is basic. There are no conspiracies, no grand mysteries, and no evil puppet masters behind it all, pulling the strings; murder is shitty people doing a shitty thing to other shitty people -- it doesn't always make sense but it's always neat. Dunbar's our guy.
L66412 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ I don't think that has anything to do with --
L66411 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ "Too neat." How long have you been an investigator?
L66252 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ I lied. Wait for it...
L66251 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ But we have to question him --  Thought you didn't have cigarettes --
L66250 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Have no fear, Osborne, we have not yet begun to fight.
L66249 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ That was kid gloves?
L66237 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Got it.
L66236 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves.
L66232 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Not the happiest of memories?
L66231 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Being back here. Gives me the willies.
L66230 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Something wrong?
L66229 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ What point?
L66228 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ He's telling the truth, up to a point.
L66227 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?
L66226 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here.
L66225 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ So noted.
L66224 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ You're off to a late start.
L66223 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ I plan to grow on you.
L66222 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?
L66221 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ The very same.
L66220 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ This is the straight hitting on me you were talking about, isn't it?
L66218 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Yeah. That's just the story I tell the girls to get them into bed. Truth is... I don't know. The whole honor and duty thing. Make a difference in the world, crap like that. Didn't really work out.
L66217 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ You're kidding.
L66216 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ I lost a bet.
L66215 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Something like that. You?
L66214 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.
L66213 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Typical army brat story. Dad was noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was never any real doubt of joining up.
L66212 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Microrecorder for Kendall -- didn't have time to wire his room. Now tell me why you joined the army or I'll jab this pen through your neck.
L66211 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ What is that?
L66210 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Best time for banal chit-chat.
L66209 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ We're in the middle of a murder case --
L66208 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ You're right. We should sit in silence.
L66207 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ You really want to make banal chit- chat like that now?
L66140 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good -- Everyone knows good cop, bad cop -- by admitting it I appeared trustworthy.
L66139 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ You made me look like an idiot --
L66138 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
L66137 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Baseball?
L66133 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ See, Ray, this is what we call "good cop, bad cop". She shouts, I stand up for you, you're grateful, a bond of trust is established.
L66132 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ The Colonel saw you shoot Nunez, you're a murderer --
L66102 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Ten bucks says I have him talking in under three minutes.
L66101 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ I questioned him for three hours and he didn't make a sound. You don't have a badge, he won't talk to you.
L66099 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Something like that.
L66098 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Good cop/bad cop?
L66097 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Thank you. At some point in there I'm gonna rub my nose. When I do, go at him with everything you got.
L66096 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Is he handsome, self assured, carry himself well, does he look you in the eyes or down at the floor, does he have good bones, suggesting good breeding, does he slouch or sit up straight -- these are important questions, as they reveal a great deal about this man's character so please get over yourself for two and a half seconds and tell me is he cute?
L66095 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ That is the most unprofessional --
L66094 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Is Dunbar cute?
L66093 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Excuse me?
L66092 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms, which doesn't exactly put people at ease. Is he cute?
L66091 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Why?
L66090 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Move him.
L66089 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Yes.
L66088 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ He's in interrogation?
L66087 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Kendall Junior is still in surgery, so he won't be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour -- the cadet we're talking to first is Dunbar.
L66086 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone --
L66085 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
L66084 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Levi? Who names their kid Levi --
L66083 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe, so all we have are their dogtags. Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall --
L66082 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Three things. First -- You don't have a choice. Second -- I've never taken a bribe in my life. And Third -- I'm still a little drunk from last night, so if I skip over the witty banter and move forward to straight hitting on you, try not to take offense. Tell me about the two guys.
L66081 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Subtlety really isn't one of you finer points, is it, Osborne?
L66080 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this.
L66079 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording --
L66078 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.
L66077 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.
