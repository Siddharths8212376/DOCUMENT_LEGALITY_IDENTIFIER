L633123 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Let's do it here.
L633122 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ No.
L633121 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Let's go in the bedroom.
L633120 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ We're going all the way.  Together.
L633119 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ If you want.
L633117 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I told you.  I knew it was there. Didn't I tell you?
L633116 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ There's easily a hundred-thousand in there.  More than that.
L633110 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Don't yell at me!  I know it's here! I know it!
L633109 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You're calling Jake stupid?  You!?
L633108 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ If it isn't here, why would he wear that stupid key?
L633107 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ This is good.  This is real good. This is so good they might not even charge us with murder when they catch us.  They'll probably just lock us up for being idiots.
L633106 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ It's got to be here.  I heard him talk about it.  He bragged about it. Six steps out, three left.
L633105 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ There isn't!  There's nothing under here but more floor.  Jesus fucking Christ!  We killed a man for nothing but floor.
L633104 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ There has to be!
L633103 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Nothing.  There's no safe under here.
L633099 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Don't yell at me!
L633098 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Oh, that's great.  We killed Jake because you heard him talk about some money that you've never seen. That's fucking brilliant!
L633097 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I'm not sure where it is.  Not exactly.  I never saw it.  I just heard him talk about it.
L633096 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You don't know?  Jesus Christ! Don't you think you should have found out before we killed him?
L633095 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I don't know.
L633094 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Where's the safe?
L633091 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You could have hit him, or kneed him in the balls.
L633090 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ What was I supposed to do?
L633089 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Why the hell didn't you do anything?
L632991 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
L632990 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Grace . . . Grace?
L632988 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.
L632987 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You said you couldn't kill anybody.
L632986 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ The only reason I stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
L632985 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.
L632984 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Are you sure?  About me, I mean?
L632983 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I don't give a damn about the money. I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that.
L632982 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
L632981 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I could if I had Jake's money.
L632980 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I thought you couldn't leave.  I thought you couldn't get your car.
L632979 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
L632978 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Because I know you're full of shit.
L632977 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
L632976 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Stop it.
L632975 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I've thought about you every second since I left.  I can still taste you on my lips.
L632974 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace.
L632973 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ There is no us, remember?
L632972 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What about us?
L632971 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I don't think we have anything to talk about.
L632970 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I wanted to talk.
L632969 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I thought you would be on your way to Vegas by now.  Is there something you wanted?
L632791 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Jesus Christ!  Listen to yourself! I can't do it, Grace.  I can't do it.
L632790 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ It's not like he's a young man. He's had time to live.
L632789 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Shit!
L632787 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Is it so bad?  It would be quick. He wouldn't even have to feel it.
L632786 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Kill someone.  I can't do it.
L632785 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L632784 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I don't know what I was thinking, but I can't do it.
L632783 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ John, please--
L632782 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I think this heat is making me crazy.  I was crazy to come back here, I'm crazy for listening to anyone in this town, and I'd sure as hell be crazy if I spent another minute in this place.
L632781 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ John?  John where are you going?
L632780 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ We'd have to kill him.
L632779 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ If the key's on him, to get the key we'd have to . . .
L632778 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ It's not a combination lock.  It takes a key.  He keeps it on him all the time.  I mean all the time.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
L632777 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I . . . nothing.  Just something he said.  So if the money's in a safe we'd have to get the combination--
L632776 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Lied?  What do you mean?
L632775 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of- a-bitch lied to me.
L632774 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Near as I can figure must be about a hundred-thousand.
L632773 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ How much money has he got?
L632772 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Yeah, a bird in a gilded cage.
L632771 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You live pretty good.
L632770 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ He's got money.  In a floor safe in the living room.  I've never seen it, but he talks about it all the time.  More like brags.  He loves his money.  Wouldn't think of spending some of it on me.
L632769 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ From?
L632768 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ He doesn't give it to us.  We take it.
L632767 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You think Jake's going to give me money just so I can take you out of here?
L632766 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Jake.
L632765 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Where?
L632764 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I know where we could get the money. A lot more than one-hundred-fifty dollars.
L632763 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Grace, I can't.  I can't even get out of here myself.  I need a hundred-fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic.
L632762 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Please.  I won't hang on you.  As soon as we get there you can dump me.  I don't care.  I just want to get out of here.
L632761 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I can't.
L632760 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Take me with you.
L632759 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Beautiful.  Beautiful beaches.  Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
L632758 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Is it pretty?
L632757 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Yeah.
L632756 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Have you ever been there before?
L632755 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ From here?  I don't know.  Far.  Far enough.
L632754 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ How far is it to California?
L632749 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Whatever it takes.
L632748 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway.  I mean, I would . . . do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said:  You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
L632747 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You need a meal ticket is what you mean.  Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
L632746 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't.  I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
L632745 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You just walk away.
L632744 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I don't know how.
L632743 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You could just leave him.
L632742 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ All this nothing?  I've spent my life in this stinking desert.  It doesn't get to Jake like it got to me.  He doesn't mind being out here. He doesn't mind being nothing but a land broker.  Big fish in a small pond, he says.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
L632741 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
L632740 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ And I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
L632739 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Yeah, I guess you're right.
L632738 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I'm guessing no.
L632737 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Depends on what you call love.  When I was growing up I had nothing.  I learned to want everything.  I wanted more than Sierra anyway. Jake was my ticket.  He's not much; he's older than me, different than me, but he's got more money than half this town put together.  I courted him.  I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line.  I wanted him.  I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him.  Is that love?
L632736 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Did you ever?
L632735 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ No.
L632734 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You love him?
L632733 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they were like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
L632732 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Doesn't the heat bother you?
L632387 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ If he says that's what happened, Jake, it must be true.
L632386 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Damn it, Grace!  Tell him.
L632373 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Maybe I just want to hear you say it.
L632372 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You know what I want.
L632371 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
L632370 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Still playing?
L632369 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You never did answer my question.
L632368 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I'm just flesh and blood, baby. That and a few memories of bad women; just like most guys.  But you already know that.  You read my fortune.  Thanks for the lemonade.
L632367 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Maybe I like to find out about a man first.  Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
L632366 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I think I can find my own way back to into town.
L632365 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
L632364 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
L632363 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Games?
L632362 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ All right, Grace.  No more games.
L632361 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Such as?
L632360 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I have ideas.
L632359 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?
L632358 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Nothing like a little liveliness.
L632357 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
L632356 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Like they're made of polyester.
L632355 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Beautiful?
L632354 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Like you.
L632353 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You can let go of me now.  I'm safe.  How do they look.
L632352 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Lift me down.
L632351 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What?
L632350 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ There.  All done.  Lift me down.
L632346 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ The same thing you do.
L632345 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ It tells me what every face tells me.  Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
L632344 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ My face tell you all that?
L632342 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Come here.
L632341 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Nice house for a Shaman's daughter. You must be good.
L632340 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Those are white words, not ours.
L632339 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ A medicine man?
L632338 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ From my father.  He was the tribe's Shaman.
L632337 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Where'd you learn to do that?
L632336 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.
L632335 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What do you do anyway?
L632334 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I guess it must.
L632333 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
L632332 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Thank you.
L632331 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Nice place you got here.
L632330 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
L632329 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
L632328 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Did you like it; me watching you?
L632327 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I didn't say it bothered me.
L632326 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
L632325 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
L632319 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I couldn't stay in this place.  I wouldn't.  I'd just pick up, do whatever I had to do, and get out.
L632318 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Somewhere else.  I've never been anywhere else.  Just once.  Years ago.  Went to the state fair.  It was nice, but it wasn't nothing.
L632317 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I pack up and go somewhere else.
L632316 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ What happens if you lose?
L632315 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
L632314 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
L632313 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some work there.
L632312 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Where you headed?
L632311 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I guess I've got wander in my blood.
L632310 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You've been around.
L632309 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ All over.  Chicago, Miami, Detroit. Just lately Albuquerque.
L632308 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Where you coming from?
L632305 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
L632304 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
L632303 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Least you can leave.
L632302 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Yeah, my luck.  I get to be stuck out here in this hole in the desert.
L632301 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Good luck it didn't happen a few miles back.  Maybe they never would have found you.  Day like today you'd be dead for sure.
L632300 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
L632299 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Drove into Sierra?  What for?
L632298 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I just drove in this morning.
L632297 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
L632296 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?

L632290 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ 'Course they cost a little more than I should really be spending.  But, damn it, I don't hardly ever do anything nice for myself.  I deserve nice things.

L632288 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I saw these in the Penny's catalog, and I just knew I had to have them. You ever seen something and just knew you had to have it?

L632278 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You should be more careful.
L632277 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Accident.

L632265 +++$+++ u8677 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
L632264 +++$+++ u8674 +++$+++ m588 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Maybe I don't want you to.
