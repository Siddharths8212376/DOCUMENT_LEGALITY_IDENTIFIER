L306362 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ I don't know what his game is. He dismissed every one of Ruth's proposals. And Sarah, we weren't unreasonable.
L306271 +++$+++ u1525 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ I wish I had your discipline.
L306270 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Please. I'm not seeing anyone until this is over. One husband at a time.
L306266 +++$+++ u1525 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ We do have a man for you.
L306265 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Maybe.
L306258 +++$+++ u1525 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Now? She's a night manager at McDonalds.
L306257 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Who's she?
L306254 +++$+++ u1525 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey that cute little island of George's.
L306253 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Do you know him?
L306252 +++$+++ u1525 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Of Massey Myerson?
L306251 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Miles Massey.
L306246 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ In the words of my Private Investigator, we're going to nail his ass.
L306245 +++$+++ u1525 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Wow.
L306244 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ She did a Harriman.
L306243 +++$+++ u1525 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ She's a legend. Didn't she do Kravis or a Pearlman? She definitely did a Factor.
L306240 +++$+++ u1525 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Neither did I until my lawyer found it -- quite a paper trail -- he had it in the dog's name.
L306239 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ I didn't know Barry had a beach house.
L306238 +++$+++ u1525 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ You want to come out to the beach house tomorrow?
L306911 +++$+++ u1528 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ He tricked you. With a phony wife and a fake pre-nup. Howard Doyle. He got you. You married Marylin, didn't you? You thought she had money. HA HA HA. Howard Doyle made you think that because of what you did to me. And to Marylin Rexroth. Yeah. I heard all about it. My brother Howard Doyle got you.  Neener neener neener.
L306910 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yes, I know Howard Doyle.
L306904 +++$+++ u1528 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ You ruined my life you sonofabitch. Gimme those.
L306903 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Excuse me?
L306902 +++$+++ u1528 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ You're Miles Massey! You probably don't recognize me. The drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair.
L306901 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yes?
L306900 +++$+++ u1528 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Wait. I know you.
L306294 +++$+++ u1528 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ He would invite these girls home from the staple factory to our condominium in Palm Springs. He had a device he called the Intruder.
L306293 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ -- is not a challenge. I need something I can sink my teeth into, professionally speaking.
L306540 +++$+++ u1526 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ She's here now.
L306539 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Marylin Rexroth? When does she --
L306538 +++$+++ u1526 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ I'm sorry, Mr. Massey, but I felt certain you'd want to know -- Marylin Rexroth wants to see you.
L306537 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Please! No calls! I'm feeling very fragile.
L306536 +++$+++ u1526 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Mr. Massey --
L306531 +++$+++ u1526 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ When you have a moment.
L306530 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Herb wants to see me?
L307121 +++$+++ u1524 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ We've outlined a settlement...
L307120 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Where does that leave us?
L306925 +++$+++ u1524 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ That's attorney client privilege.  Sorry, Miles. But as a great and clever man once said, What's good for the goose --
L306924 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ ...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?
L306923 +++$+++ u1524 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.
L306922 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I'll have you suspended. I'll have you disbarred.
L306921 +++$+++ u1524 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ And it's good!
L306920 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Don't give me that crap. That's MY crap.
L306919 +++$+++ u1524 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ ...The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars...
L306918 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I don't have a pre-nup
L306917 +++$+++ u1524 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask her? Anyway, I assume she signed the highly over rated Massey pre-nup.
L306916 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Did Marylin end up with money?
L306915 +++$+++ u1524 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ I have no idea what Howard Doyle eats. I'm not a damn dietician.
L306914 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ He never ate the pre-nup, did he!
L306913 +++$+++ u1524 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ Marylin was friends with Howard and Amanda Doyle. They don't like the way you operate. They helped her.
L306912 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ He divorced his wife -- he married Marylin -- he divorced Marylin -- and he -- remarried his WIFE? What kind of sick --
L306440 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, have you ever been in love?
L306439 +++$+++ u1524 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ ...arty farty!
L306346 +++$+++ u1524 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ Kirshner does not apply. Kirshner was in Kentucky.
L306345 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Are you familiar with Kirshner?
L306336 +++$+++ u1524 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ Yes. Maybe you're right, Miles. Maybe we're being too conservative. Seventy five percent.
L306335 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
L306334 +++$+++ u1524 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ Oh brother. Here we go.
L306333 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why not ask for a hundred percent?
L306332 +++$+++ u1524 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
L306331 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ -- So much for the icebreakers. What're you after, Ruth?
L306328 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Heh heh.
L306327 +++$+++ u1524 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ Ha Ha.
L306326 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
L306325 +++$+++ u1524 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ My client feels sufficiently dispassionate.
L306324 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
L306323 +++$+++ u1524 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ That's delusional.
L306322 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ My client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice.
L306321 +++$+++ u1524 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ My client has ruled that out.
L306320 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.
L306319 +++$+++ u1524 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ So, Miles. If you have a proposal, let's hear it.
L306315 +++$+++ u1524 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ Oh, just a routine mammogram. She said to say hello. She's going to Positano with your brother's family.
L306314 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What?!
L306311 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ A yert.  Ruth is a living legend, Rex. At a time when most women are in Boca, having early bird specials -- she's working so her husband can be in Montana. In a yert.
L306310 +++$+++ u1524 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly fishing. He's in a yert in Montana.
L306309 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ So, Ruth. How's Sam?
L306359 +++$+++ u1523 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ REX +++$+++ Maybe I should reconsider my...
L306358 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ In anticipation of making you sick.
L306357 +++$+++ u1523 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ REX +++$+++ She brought my digestive enzymes.
L306356 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ And she had private investigators assisting her.
L306355 +++$+++ u1523 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ REX +++$+++ She always looked out for me.
L306354 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I think that went as well as could be expected.
L306348 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Please -- let me handle this. Okay, Ruth, forget Kirshner -- what's your bottom line?
L306347 +++$+++ u1523 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ REX +++$+++ What's Kirshner?
L306237 +++$+++ u1523 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ REX +++$+++ Well -- is that possible?
L306236 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ So, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear?
L306235 +++$+++ u1523 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ REX +++$+++ I know that sounds rough but I'm about to close on a deal to develop some mini-malls, and I'm mortgaged up to my ass. If this deal goes south, I'm ruined -- I'll lose millions.
L306234 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Nothing?
L306233 +++$+++ u1523 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ REX +++$+++ That's the problem. I can't afford to give her anything.
L306232 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. Well, let me ask you this: what kind of settlement do you seek? What are, for you, the parameters of the possible?
L306231 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Mmm... And to cut to the chase, forensically speaking -- is there a pre-nup?
L306230 +++$+++ u1523 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ REX +++$+++ Video.
L306229 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
L306228 +++$+++ u1523 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ REX +++$+++ I'm not sure.
L306227 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
L306226 +++$+++ u1523 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ REX +++$+++ I don't know. I can assume...
L306225 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described?
L306224 +++$+++ u1523 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ REX +++$+++ Seems like there's more of it than ever before --
L306223 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
L306222 +++$+++ u1523 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ REX +++$+++ You know what I mean when I say "it."
L306221 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Ah.
L306220 +++$+++ u1523 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ REX +++$+++ No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.
L306219 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Time marches on. Ardor cools.
L306218 +++$+++ u1523 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ REX +++$+++ But then... But then...
L306217 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Mm.
L306216 +++$+++ u1523 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ REX +++$+++ When I first met Marylin -- Well, we were crazy about each other. Not emotionally, of course. We just couldn't keep our hands off each other.
L306215 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ That's her job. You have to respect that.
L306214 +++$+++ u1523 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ REX +++$+++ ...Well, my wife has me between a rock and a hard place.
L306211 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Now Rex.
L306210 +++$+++ u1523 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ REX +++$+++ Thank you.
L306209 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and consider this office your office, your haven, your war room -- for the duration of the campaign.
L306208 +++$+++ u1523 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ REX +++$+++ Rex, please.
L306207 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Mr. Rexroth.
L306856 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Should we counsel fear -- or trust? Should we seek to destroy -- or to build? Should we meet our clients' problems with cynicism -- or with love?
L306855 +++$+++ u1529 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ WRIGLEY +++$+++ Extinguish?
L306825 +++$+++ u1529 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ WRIGLEY +++$+++ -- the coin?
L306824 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yes.  It's for your protection, sweetheart. You're the one with the -- the...
L306814 +++$+++ u1529 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ WRIGLEY +++$+++ The Judge is here. Over here, Judge Munson.
L306813 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ We wanted Ruth here for your protection as well --
L306812 +++$+++ u1529 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ WRIGLEY +++$+++ I tried to reach Ruth, but we couldn't get her.
L306791 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Do you have it?
L306790 +++$+++ u1529 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ WRIGLEY +++$+++ The plastic surgeon! I read about you in LA Style.
L306789 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.
L306788 +++$+++ u1529 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ WRIGLEY +++$+++ Miles.
L306787 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Wrigley?
L306688 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I know you would, Wrigley. But would Kramer?
L306687 +++$+++ u1529 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ WRIGLEY +++$+++ I'd stay away from her, Miles.
L306686 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ She owes me a meal.
L306685 +++$+++ u1529 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ WRIGLEY +++$+++ What...?
L306684 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Get me Marylin Rexroth Doyle.
L306683 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ She deserves every penny. They pay great athletes a fortune. Well, Marylin Rexroth is an athlete at the peak of her power.
L306682 +++$+++ u1529 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ WRIGLEY +++$+++ She could buy and sell you ten times over.
L306681 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?
L306680 +++$+++ u1529 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ WRIGLEY +++$+++ ...and I hear she's richer than Croesus.
L306679 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ HA!
L306678 +++$+++ u1529 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ WRIGLEY +++$+++ I'm sorry I'm late. I was having lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is divorced!
L306640 +++$+++ u1529 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ WRIGLEY +++$+++ Miles -- why so angry?
L306639 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Spoons! Honestly Wrigley, I'm surprised at you. What is this? Some Martha Stewart suggestion? Those are the most cockamamie things I've ever --
L306638 +++$+++ u1529 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ WRIGLEY +++$+++ Berry spoons.
L306637 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What are they?
L306636 +++$+++ u1529 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ WRIGLEY +++$+++ What do you think?
L306625 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Is she going through with it?
L306624 +++$+++ u1529 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ WRIGLEY +++$+++ I can't help it. Even with the business we're in, I -- it gets me every time. It's so -- optimistic.
L306623 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What the hell is wrong with you?
L306289 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I could be mentoring Kramer. Kramer clerked for Scalia.
L306288 +++$+++ u1529 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ WRIGLEY +++$+++ No. You're not.
L306287 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
L306286 +++$+++ u1529 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ WRIGLEY +++$+++ I am very sorry.
L306285 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Sometimes I have serious doubts about you.
L306284 +++$+++ u1529 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ WRIGLEY +++$+++ Sorry.
L306283 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Wrigley!
L306282 +++$+++ u1529 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ WRIGLEY +++$+++ What the fuck...?
L306281 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Video.
L306280 +++$+++ u1529 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ WRIGLEY +++$+++ And she has...?
L306279 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Nothing.
L306278 +++$+++ u1529 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ WRIGLEY +++$+++ Wait... He wants to give her...?
L306484 +++$+++ u1521 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ PATRICIA +++$+++ Well, not just divorce. She used to say "I want to be divorced from some big dumb rich guy..." And I guess her dream is coming true.  I'm happy for you Patty
L306483 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Divorce was her childhood aspiration?
L306482 +++$+++ u1521 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ PATRICIA +++$+++ When she was a tiny girl? And people asked her what she wanted to be when she grew up? She never said the usual things little girls say -- like -- nurse -- ballerina -- anchorwoman? She always said --  "When I grow up, I want to be divorced."
L306481 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
L306480 +++$+++ u1521 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ PATRICIA +++$+++ Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe.
L306479 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Who's "Patty."
L306478 +++$+++ u1521 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ PATRICIA +++$+++ Let me tell you something about Patty.
L306477 +++$+++ u1521 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ PATRICIA +++$+++ Of course. Of course she was married. What else would she be? Single? I don't think so.
L306476 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
L306473 +++$+++ u1521 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ PATRICIA +++$+++ No. Uh uh. I don't think so. Hmm? No. Well... no.
L306472 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?
L306471 +++$+++ u1521 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ PATRICIA +++$+++ No. I haven't. But I've been out of town.  Hello, Rex. Hello there.
L306468 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Hard to believe I know. I'm sure you are frequently mistaken for sisters.
L306467 +++$+++ u1521 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ PATRICIA +++$+++ Hi, Sweetie.
L306464 +++$+++ u1521 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ PATRICIA +++$+++ Mother?
L306463 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ And how would you define your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You know -- you are her...?
L306460 +++$+++ u1521 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ PATRICIA +++$+++ We don't have much of a relationship anymore. I haven't seen her since before she married Rex. We had some very nice times prior to that. We were quite close.
L306459 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Now, Mrs. Banderas. What is your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth.
L306492 +++$+++ u1525 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Well, you can live here as long as you want. Do you have any plans?
L306491 +++$+++ u1522 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ That doesn't make sense. It's like punishing you for being goal oriented.
L306269 +++$+++ u1522 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ And only two are hers.
L306268 +++$+++ u1525 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ She's keeping his name. And one of his planes. And all seven of his children
L306267 +++$+++ u1522 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ Thorstenson Gieselensen. He just separated from his third. He's in fish. He is fish.
L306264 +++$+++ u1522 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ Maybe next time.
