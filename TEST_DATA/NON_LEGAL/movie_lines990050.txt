L327022 +++$+++ u6137 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest.  Wait.  Use the frosted glasses.
L327021 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ No kidding.  I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.
L327020 +++$+++ u6137 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ I heard.
L326994 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Honey, he's engaged.  And for the first time in my professional life, I'm a part of something I believe in.
L326993 +++$+++ u6137 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This is a "syndrome."  It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.
L326992 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ He just lost his best client.  He called from the plane.  I invited the guy over.
L326991 +++$+++ u6137 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ At eleven at night? _ 70.
L326990 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ He's coming over.
L326764 +++$+++ u6137 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ He's in the living room asleep.
L326763 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Wait. Where is he?
L326760 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Of course I know --
L326759 +++$+++ u6137 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ You know how much those Well Child exams cost --
L326758 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ If you'd read what he wrote, you would have left with him too.
L326757 +++$+++ u6137 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ You are a single mother.  You have given up the right to be frivolous.
L326756 +++$+++ u6134 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ DOROTHY +++$+++ Of course, medical! _ 42.
L326755 +++$+++ u6137 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ LAUREL +++$+++ What about medical?
L327467 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ And I love my fans, of which he is one. Wanna thank them for all my Sundays, and of course my Monday nights too.  That about says it...
L327466 +++$+++ u6135 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ FIRESTONE +++$+++ Ten seconds, Rod.
L327465 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ Oh yes.  Jerry Maguire!  My agent! This is a fierce, loving individual, I love this man, he is love, he is about love -- my ambassador of kwan.
L327462 +++$+++ u6135 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ FIRESTONE +++$+++ It's only a half-hour show, Rod.
L327461 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ I... I love everybody, man.  I love my wife.  My kids.  Little Tyson. My new baby Kaydee.  My brother Tee Pee. I love my friends, my teammates, who am I leaving out?
L327460 +++$+++ u6135 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ FIRESTONE +++$+++ -- well, Rod, your agent passed me a note before the show. He says that your deal memo has been signed by the Arizona Cardinals. Four years for ten-point-two million dollars.  Playing in the state where you grew up.
L327459 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ No, Roy.  I'm not gonna cry.
L326928 +++$+++ u6139 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ We signed an hour ago.  You were in the lobby with the black fella.
L326927 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Now.  Wait.  You didn't actually sign with Sugar, did you? Tell me you didn't sign.  Because I'm still sort of moved by your "my word is stronger'n oak" thing --
L326922 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I brought Denver to twenty million. Denver deals with me all the time. You listened to Sugar? You let that snake in the door.
L326921 +++$+++ u6139 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ I'm sorry, I --
L326920 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back?
L326919 +++$+++ u6139 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Hey, I'm learning as I go.
L326918 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Said who?  Sugar?
L326917 +++$+++ u6139 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Apparently, Denver wanted to deal with him instead of you.
L326916 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Do I know everything there is to know here?  You fellas aren't talking with Bob Sugar, are you?
L326915 +++$+++ u6139 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Not right now, Jerry.
L326903 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Denver got very silent about a day ago.  San Diego's got a fever for Cush.  This stuff tends to happen the night before a draft.  People get crazy.  And San Diego, you should know, is crazy to the tune of seven years for thirty. Signing bonus of eight.  Million.
L326902 +++$+++ u6139 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ What happened to Denver?
L326804 +++$+++ u6139 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ You know I don't do "contracts." But'cha do have my word, and it's stronger than oak.
L326803 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I'll give it everything.
L326802 +++$+++ u6139 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Denver is where he should be.
L326800 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ It's either going to be Denver or San Diego trading up to take him.
L326799 +++$+++ u6139 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ I want him to go number one in the draft, and I want him to play.
L326797 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You know, I'm not a hugger and yet... I can't let go.
L326796 +++$+++ u6139 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him.
L326795 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Oh, thank you.
L326794 +++$+++ u6139 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ MATT +++$+++ We decided to stay with you.
L326793 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Matt, I came here because in all honesty your son is just another piece of cattle to SMI.  But to me --
L327411 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I missed ya.  What can I say?
L327410 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ Thanks for coming.
L327409 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Go.  Flee.
L327408 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ Jerry!  You made it --
L327354 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ Only 'cause my wife likes your wife!
L327353 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ We still having dinner in L.A.?
L327352 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ Beautiful.
L327351 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Fine.
L327350 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ I don't want to be friends anymore.
L327349 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Airight.  Here's why you don't have your ten million dollars yet. You are a paycheck player.  You play with your head.  Not your heart.  In your personal life?  Heart. But when you get on the field --  _ 113.
L327348 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ I think so.
L327347 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our "friends" hats on --
L327346 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ Why not --
L327345 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Look.  I'm happy to entertain you, as always, but I have a question for you.  Are we really "friends?"
L327344 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ For loyalty, you buy a dog.  For love, you get married.
L327343 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Damn right.
L327342 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ That's an answer.
L327341 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ No, I'm going to answer you.  You want an answer?  I'll give it to you.  Loyalty.  She was loyal.  Everything grew from there.
L327340 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ I'm sorry I asked.
L327339 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You're jabbing at me. _ 112.
L327338 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ Then why'd you get married?  I'm asking you as a friend.
L327337 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Not everyone has what you have.
L327336 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ I'm trying to talk to you.  How's your marriage?
L327335 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ No, you're --
L327334 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ I'm asking you a question --
L327333 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Why are you doing this to me, Rod?
L327332 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ You don't want to go home, do you?
L327331 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I don't know -- how's "dedication" for an answer?
L327330 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ Why are you even here, man? You could have told me all this over the phone.
L327329 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ What's that supposed to mean?
L327328 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ Don't I know.  Now go home to your wife.
L327327 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Take care, okay? You're my entire client roster.
L327326 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ I'm gonna have the game of my life on Monday Night Football, and show all these motherfuckers.
L327324 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ Hey, that's my word, okay?
L327323 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Well, just stay healthy. I will show you the kwan.
L327322 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ No.
L327321 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ We can still take the offer, Rod.
L327318 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ I'm worried too.  I'm worried that the only reason I'm here getting my brains blown loose is that you weren't asshole enough to get my ten million three months ago.
L327317 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I'm a little worried --
L327316 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ Tidwell moves to a tan in a wheelchair, signs an autograph and moves on.  Jerry alongside. The quarterback sucks, man.  He's gonna get me killed.
L327309 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ Well, this was another way to go.
L327308 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ No.
L327307 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ You never had The Talk, did you?
L327270 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ Shame on you.  SHAME on you.
L327269 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I didn't "shoplift the pooty."  We were thrown together and -- I mean it's two mutual people who --  Alright, I shoplifted the pooty.
L327268 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ No.  A real man does not shoplift the "pooty" from a single mom.
L327267 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ The kid is amazing.
L327266 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ Well, that ain't fair to her.  A single mother, that's a sacred thing, man. _ 103.
L327265 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ But I sure don't like that she's leaving.
L327264 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ Then you gotta have The Talk.
L327263 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ No, I don't know.
L327262 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ You know when you know.  It makes you shivver, it eats at your insides. You know?
L327261 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ How do I know?
L327260 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ First, single mothers don't "date." They have been to the circus, you know what I'm saying? They have been to the puppet show and they have seen the strings. You love her?
L327259 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Tell me, because it's been a month, and she's about to take another job in San Diego.
L327258 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ Oh I know plenty.  I was raised by a single mother.
L327257 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ What do you know about dating a single mother?
L327256 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ Oh, we gonna be friends now?
L327255 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Can I ask you a question totally unrelated to your career?
L327249 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Rod, get on the camel.
L327248 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ Dude, know your art form.  If you put the camera down here, looking up, I look more powerful.  There's no need for a camel... you got ME.
L327239 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ Good deal, man.
L327238 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I'll get you some quick work --
L327236 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ It's a risk.
L327235 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ Won't happen.  I'm strong in my mind.
L327234 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ If you get injured, you get nothing.
L327113 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ You're hanging by a very thin thread, dude.  And I dig that about you.
L327112 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I'm out here for you!  You don't know what it's like to be me out here for you. It is an up-at-dawn pride-swallowing seige that I will never fully tell you about! Okay?! Help me help you help me help you.
L327111 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ No tell me. _ 84.
L327110 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Forget it.  Forget it.
L327109 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ What's wrong.
L327107 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Fine.
L327106 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ Do your job, man, don't tell me to dance.
L327105 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Rod, I'm not a rascist.  I'm telling you to be the best version of you, to get back to the guy who first started playing this game. Way back when you were a kid.  It wasn't just about the money, was it?
L327104 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ "Love me love me love me... put me on t.v."  That's the iconography of rascism, man!
L327103 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ No, I'm saying to be --
L327102 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ You're telling me to dance.
L327098 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You.
L327097 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ Is that your porty or mine?
L327096 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Rod, I say this with great respect, but those players you mentioned are marquee players and --
L327095 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ No, I air-dry.
L327094 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Great word.  Towel?
L327093 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ I got there from "coin," dude. Coin, coin... kwaaaan.
L327092 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ But how did you get "kwan?" _ 82.
L327091 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package.  The kwan.
L327090 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ That's your word?
L327089 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ --  the kwan.
L327088 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ Maybe you don't.  Because it's not just the money I deserve.  It's not just the "coin."  It's the...
L327087 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I understand your anxiety.
L327086 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ John Taylor.  J.J. Stokes.  Andre Rison.  I SMOKE all these fools, and yet they're making the big sweet dollars. They're making the money, and I got an agent that ain't even put the number on the table.
L327085 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Uh, not today, but --
L327084 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ Did you tell him about the "ten million for four years?"
L326989 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Oh my God.
L326988 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ Anybody else would have left you by now, but I'm sticking with you. I said I would. And if I got to ride your ass like Zorro, you're gonna show me the money.
L326987 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Another drink please.
L326986 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ Man, I got a shelf life of ten years, tops!  My next contract's gotta bring me the dollars that'11 last me and mine a very long time. I'm out of this sport in five years.  What's my family gonna live on? What you get me.  So I don't want to hear about ya shit, your "nya nya nya."
L326985 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Why not?
L326984 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ You are not allowed to act this way.
L326983 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ It's a quality that might come in handy for a commercial sometime. _ 69.
L326982 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ No.
L326981 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ The least you could do is nod and act sympathetic --
L326980 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ Well, boo-fucking-hoo.
L326979 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ See this jacket I'm wearing?  You like it?  I don't really need it, because I'm CLOAKED IN FAILURE. I lost the number one draft pick the night before the draft. They will teach my story to other agents on "do not do this" day in agent school. Why? Let's recap. Because a hockey player's kid made me feel like a superficial jerk, I had two slices of bad pizza, went to bed, grew a conscience and wrote a 25-page Manifesto of Doom!
L326978 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Don't you even see -- I'm finished. I'm fucked. Twenty-four hours ago, I was hot. Now... I'm a cautionary tale!
L326977 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ Huh?
L326976 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ What are you doing with me, Rod?
L326975 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ You feel bad you tested positive? Quit doing blow!  You feel bad about your baby girl? Why did you leave the mother?
L326974 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Rod --
L326972 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Very much.
L326971 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ You love me now, don't you?
L326889 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ I might call you later!
L326888 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Call me tomorrow.
L326887 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ Sure you don't want to go out and find some karoake?  I'm a very good singer, man --
L326886 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Get some sleep.  See you tomorrow.
L326885 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ Good.  I was just testing ya.  But just you saying that? Makes me love ya.
L326884 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I'm not about love -- I'm about "showing you the money."
L326883 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ You're loving me now, aren't ya?
L326881 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ Okay, I understand.  I'll boil it down for ya.  Fuck Nike.  All they do is ignore me...
L326880 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I gotta get back to Cushman.
L326879 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ You believe they're shooting a Nike ad down there?  Did I ever tell you my Nike story?
L326878 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ Let's do it again.
L326877 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.
L326876 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby?
L326868 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ Why the fuck am I here?  I feel like I'm five years late for the Prom.
L326867 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ At last I find you.
L326723 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ Congratulations.  You're still my agent.
L326722 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Show.  Me.  The.  Money.
L326721 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ Now doesn't that just make you feel good to say it?  Say it with me.
L326720 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I got it.
L326719 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ Here it is.  "Show me the money."  Show.  Me.  The.  Money. _ 36.
L326718 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Yes.
L326717 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ It's a very personal, very important thing.  It's a family motto.  So I want to share it with you.  You ready?
L326716 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Mmm.  Hmm.
L326715 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ --  now to recap, I want to stay in Arizona, I want my new contract, I like you, you're nice to my wife, I will stay with you, that's what I'm doing for you, but here's what you're gonna do for me. You listening?
L326710 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ Exactly.  And I'm sitting here with an ant problem, look!  And my brother Tee Pee's room is flooded with water.  Say hello to Jerry Maguire --
L326709 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Now you want Arizona dollars.
L326708 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ Good, 'cause see, I am a valuable commodity.  I go across the middle. I see the ball and a dude coming right at me, wanting to kill me, I tell my brain "get killed, catch the ball." That's New York Steak, baby.  Rare. And yet, nobody's giving me LOVE. Nobody's giving me PROPS.  Nobody. I went to Arizona State, I'm from Arizona, I break Arizona records, I'm a Sun Devil, man!!!
L326707 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Okay.
L326706 +++$+++ u6143 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TIDWELL +++$+++ Alright, we're just getting started on my list of things you need to know. Take notes if you want to.
L326572 +++$+++ u6144 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Jerry.  You two will be together forever.
L326571 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Which they do.  And we're standing there. All the football guys are in the lobby, watching, there's even an ESPN crew.  So I turn to her and sort of grandly say, "Well, this is me, Klutz, asking you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to marry me." And I took out the ring, and I don't much like big scenes, but she said "yes" right there in the lobby and some of the toughest men in football wept like babies.  We're getting married in February.
L326567 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ But wait...
L326566 +++$+++ u6144 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ How sad --
L326565 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Well, it bothered me somewhat. And I got quiet.  And now she's quiet and we're both pouting a little, you know.  And I decide I'm not going to propose.  The mood is not right. Why be impulsive? Now at this point I know she knows that I was going to propose and didn't.  And she knows I know.  So the entire sixty mile ride back to the airport, we don't speak. And we're both good at that.  We fly to Honolulu in silence.  We check into the Pro Bowl hotel --
L326564 +++$+++ u6144 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Oh no -- _ 14.
L326563 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ To the pools.  Now she's Miss Rock Climber, and I'm more the Non-Rock Climber, but we're hiking up through the pools and there's a fine mist in the air, and I have the ring in my pocket, and I'm a little nervous, I'm lagging behind, and she says to me, get this -- "Hurry up, klutz."
L326562 +++$+++ u6144 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ To the pools?
L326561 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Exactly.  And the world does not need another 35 year-old bachelor. I knew I wanted to propose, so I took her there.
L326560 +++$+++ u6144 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ That's when you need to cement, and define define define.
L326559 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ A year-and-a-half later, we were both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Now I've always hit a wall at 18 months.  Every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months.  It's like --ka- boom.  The curse of 18 months.
L326558 +++$+++ u6144 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Gorgeous.
L326557 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ --so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui...
L326556 +++$+++ u6144 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Oh, tell the story.
L326552 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ She's an NFL publicist... amazing sense of style... former athlete... volleyball... world class... really knows how to live every moment of her life, which is why I should take a nap now...
L326551 +++$+++ u6144 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Tell me, and then you can sleep.
