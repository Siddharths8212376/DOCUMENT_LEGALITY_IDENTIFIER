L648235 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ It's her!  I'm telling you.  She whispered and turned on the music.  She's trying to contact me!
L648234 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ From the sun.  It's a reflection on the glass.
L648233 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ A flare?
L648232 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ It's a flare.
L648231 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No.  Look!  In the window.
L648230 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Our house.
L648229 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No, no, no, no.  The soil on the shovel, his shovel...that's clay.  It's not from here, believe me, I...  All right, look at this.
L648228 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ And that means he murdered his wife? This is getting ridic--
L648227 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ He did.  She's in the picture.  I went over to look and she's gone.  The table was set for one.
L648226 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What?
L648225 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ He killed her.
L648223 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Shhhh.
L648222 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What's going on, Claire?
L648221 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Get down!  He'll see.
L648178 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Huh.
L648177 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Oh, right.  Yes.  Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart.  Wouldn't hurt a fly.
L648176 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Did you call about the Feurs?
L648175 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Sorry.  You understand.
L648172 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Norman, you are so funny about that.  No, I didn't.
L648171 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You didn't?
L648170 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What?  No.  No.
L648169 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Did you tell her?
L648168 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
L648167 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
L648166 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I'm so sorry.
L648165 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ "...for my father."
L648164 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ That's...
L648163 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ "...of Perpetual Distances."  Everybody's checking their shoelaces. Pins drop.  "I'm afraid you've mistaken me,"  I say...
L648162 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Oh, no...
L648161 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ "...especially Spencer's Theorem..."
L648160 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Well, that's nice.
L648159 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ And he says...you'll fucking love this, he says, "Doctor Spencer, I am a great admirer of your work..."
L648158 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Wow.
L648157 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ He's here giving some arcane spiel for the physics department, so Bob Shine introduces us...
L648156 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ You're kidding.
L648155 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Ohmigod.  You'll never believe...I saw Schumway...
L648154 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You know what that does to me.
L648153 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...
L648152 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Yep.
L648151 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ You are so brilliant.
L648150 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I think so.  Maybe.
L648149 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Really?
L648148 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Think I may have cracked it.
L648147 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I do, I do.  I'm sure I'm just...how was your day?
L648146 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I've got the conference next week.  I want you to feel safe.
L648141 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I don't know.  Just...whispering.
L648140 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What kind of whispering?
L648139 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ It was there.  This angry music all by itself.  And I heard whispering.
L648138 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Of course.
L648137 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you back in the morning.
L648136 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Did you call the police?
L648135 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ In the house.  I was scared.
L648134 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What do you mean?  Some noises where?
L648133 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ There were some noises.  I didn't want to disturb you.
L648132 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L648113 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Huh?  Absolutely.  Take your time.
L648112 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Claire?
L648110 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No, no.  It's fine.
L648109 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Unless you need me to come home...
L648108 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Oh.
L648107 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I'm stuck here for another couple of hours.
L648106 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Hi.
L648075 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Is it gone?
L648074 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Nothing.  There was...I thought I saw something.
L648071 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Hurry...
L648070 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Mmnph.
L648069 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Norman, you have to look at this!
L648066 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Promise?
L648065 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Look, I'll call Harvey Tomes in the Psych department, see what I can find out.
L648064 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I just wish you could have heard her.
L648063 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ It's what I've been working for.
L648062 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I know.
L648061 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Nothing's going to happen.  Besides, I have to work tonight.  The conference is in less than two weeks. I've got to stay focused on that for just a little longer.  This is...
L648060 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I'd never be able to live with mysel--
L648059 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Claire...
L648058 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ But what if something happens?
L648057 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ ...when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake.
L648056 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ That's not what I'm sug--
L648055 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Claire, honey, we are not going to march next door and accuse our new neighbor of--
L648054 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ To make sure she's all right.
L648053 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Why?
L648052 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Not like this.  We were never like this.  I want to go over there.  After dinner, we can--
L648051 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Remember how we were?
L648050 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I'm telling you.  There was something in her voice...
L648049 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Honey, they're young.  They're probably newlyweds.
L648048 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ More or less.
L648047 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Did she say that?
L648046 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Of him I think.
L648045 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Of what?
L648014 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I'll be there.
L648013 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ After that.
L648012 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I'm finished at three.  No.  Squash with Stan.
L648011 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Tomorrow.
L648010 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Maybe we should just...
L648009 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Mmm.
L648008 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ And we moved out here for the quiet.
L648004 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Shhh.
L648003 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Did you...
L648002 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Yup.
L648001 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Wanna fool around?
L648000 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Nope.
L647999 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Tired?
L647998 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I know.
L647997 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ It's just us now.
L647996 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ We did.
L647995 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You did a great job.  She's a good kid.
L647994 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ To get my life back.  To have some time for myself.  Some time for us.
L647993 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You are...
L647992 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ To tell you the truth...I'm excited.
L647991 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You know what I mean.
L647990 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Not the focus.
L647989 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ It's just she's been the focus for a while.
L647988 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I am, really.
L647987 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ It's okay if you're not.
L647986 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Fine.
L647985 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ How are you?
L647984 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ No, no.  I'm just about...  There.
L647983 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ If you have to work...
L647982 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Nice.  Almost done.
L647981 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Excellent.  Couple of Swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell.
L647980 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ How is it?
L647979 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
L647978 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Whatcha reading?
L647957 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Three o'clock.
L647956 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Claire?
L647954 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Yep.
L647953 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ It's today?
L647951 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ It's Saturday.
L647950 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Claire, I have to show up for the--
L647949 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Don't.
L647948 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Alright.  I can't take the rejection.  I'm going to class.
L647947 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Norman Spencer.
L647946 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ When's she out of here?
L647944 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ We'll be quiet.  Quick and quiet.
L647943 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ She's awake.
L647942 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Feur, I think.  Psych department.  Figures. They're all psychotic.
L647941 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What's their name?
L647940 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Three weeks.
L647939 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I think three...
L647938 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Christ, that's twice in...When did they move in?
L649089 +++$+++ u8869 +++$+++ m602 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ :Oh, I wish. A woman wouldn't have screwed over the woman she loved. No, they don't think that way.
L649088 +++$+++ u8868 +++$+++ m602 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ :What do you mean "They" are? Are you officially a woman now?
L649087 +++$+++ u8869 +++$+++ m602 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ :Well, they are.
L649086 +++$+++ u8868 +++$+++ m602 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ :Would you stop it!
L649085 +++$+++ u8869 +++$+++ m602 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ :No, I said, I hate what I'm doing to Darcy. Oh, boy, men are stupider, it's true.
L649084 +++$+++ u8868 +++$+++ m602 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ :What, you're doing Darcy? Since when?
L650059 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Who can say the hope of redemption dies with our last breath...? They must see what the legacy has wrought - Diedre, withered inside herself Carlotta, killing and stunting her own flesh and blood...  surely they sense the child you carry - and the life it might lead in Lashers grasp...   Maybe, in death, they feel remorse for the evil they embraced in life...?!
L650058 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ But it doesn't make sense.  They - they used Lasher...  they conspired with him.
L650057 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ You've always said you felt goodness in them - that the witches brought you and Rowan together.  Isn't that right...?  They're reaching out to you, Rowan!
L650055 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ But why would they do that...?
L650054 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ With his hands!
L649960 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Two heartbeats.
L649959 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Two what...?
L649958 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ There are two.
L649957 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I wish everyone would stop commenting on my health.  I'm the doctor.
L649956 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Are you alright...?  You look pale.
L649818 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Lasher is my legacy - not Michael's.   Aaron, I've seen the pain in Michael.  I can't bear to see anymore.   He's not to know.  Swear to me.
L649817 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Lasher will act, Rowan.  Whatever it is he wants - he's waited three hundred years to have it.   facing him alone...  I don't like -
L649815 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ But you've not told Michael.
L649814 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I have seen him again.  Last night.
L649794 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ I've grown very fond of you you and Michael both.
L649793 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ You've been shadowing the family for thirty years.  It's only fitting you give one af us away.
L649792 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Thank you for this honor, my dear.
L649661 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Michael - you loved that house as a child.  You could work again! You could make it ours. We'll sweep out the horror.  And Lasher with it!
L649660 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Going away doesn't mean you leave Lasher behind. He was on Rowan's deck - and the plane...  geography seems irrelevant now.
L649651 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ A spacial entity.  An organized energy.  something that precedes our definition of existence.
L649650 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Then what is he...?
L649649 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Many times over the past thirty years. Why he shows himself to me, I don't know but Lasher's not some mindless wraith.
L650156 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You have to warn her - this second! I'm catching the next flight back!
L650155 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Rowan...
L650152 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ He chose ME for ROWAN --- when I was a child!
L650151 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ What are you talk---
L650150 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Aaron - lieten to me...  It's been Lasher - from the start!
L650141 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Every day  twice.
L650140 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I'll probably be back in a week...but I can't spend Christmas in that house.   you'll check on her - every day...?
L650138 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Then tell me.  Is it Lasher....
L650137 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Nothing was ever more false.
L650136 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ on't know what else to do.  Maybe I just don't belong in her life.  well - I'm already out of her life.
L650053 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Yes - and you have.  Do you see...?  He was passing over into death - but the witches sent him back - to the one person they knew had the power to save him... and they gave him the power to show you what no one else could...
L650052 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ "Go back, Michael.  Do what you can..."
L650051 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ What have the witches always asked of you...?
L650004 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ NO!  she's pregnant, Aaron.  she's got that to deal with - and the clinic.. she is not to hear about this.   don't you think I know she spends half her lite worrying about me...  Listening to my heart, aren't you...?  The Timex still ticking...?
L650003 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Michael, Rowan should -
L650002 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Don't tell Rowan about this.
L649752 +++$+++ u8870 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Then focus on how you feel about her. Because your feelings define you.   Take off your gloves, Michael.
L649751 +++$+++ u8879 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Rowan.
