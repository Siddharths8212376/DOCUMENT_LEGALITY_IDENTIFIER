L628274 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ I'm gonna hop in the tub and get all wet, and slippery, and soapy. Then I'm gonna lie in the waterbed, not even both to dry off, and watch X-rated movies till you get your ass back to my lovin' arms.
L628273 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner.
L628272 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
L628271 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.
L628270 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ You did it, Quickdraw. I'm so proud of you. You were like a ninja. Did I do my part OK?
L628172 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ Nope. I'm not really a wine gal.
L628171 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Do you want some wine, sweetheart?
L628162 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ ... was so romantic.
L628161 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ What?
L628160 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ I think what you did...
L628159 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ What?
L628158 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ I think what you did was...
L628155 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good.
L628154 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ Is this a joke?
L628153 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Yeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there I said to myself, "If I can kill 'em and get away with it, I'll do it." I could. So I did.
L628152 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ Was it him or you?
L628103 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ You don't know me. Not when it comes to shit like this. I have to do this. I need for you to know you can count on me to protect you. Now write down the address.
L628102 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ You don't know him -
L628101 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Look, sweetheart, he scares you. But I'm not scared of that motherfucker. He can't touch you now. You're completely out of his reach. He poses absolutely no threat to us. So, if he doesn't matter, which he doesn't, it would be stupid to lose your things, now wouldn't it?
L628100 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ No, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there.
L628099 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ So I can go over there and pick up your things.
L628098 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ Why?
L628097 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Write down Drexl's address.
L628096 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ What?
L628095 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Sweetheart, write down your former address.
L628076 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ I just gotta get somethin'.
L628075 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ Where you goin', honey?
L628070 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes...
L628069 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ No no no no no no no no no...
L628067 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ Of course. Are there others, Mr. Worley?
L628066 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.
L628065 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ Bottom of the ninth . Mr. Worley. Oh, by the by, Mr. Worley, have you seen your lovely wife today?
L628064 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Top o' the morning, Mrs. Worley.
L628063 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ How do you do, Mr. Worley?
L628062 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Hello, Mrs. Worley.
L628061 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Thank you.
L628060 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ I do.
L628057 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Well, that's the one that explains how Jimmy Wang Yu became the Incredible One-Armed Boxer.
L628056 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ I don't believe so.
L628055 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Did ya ever see "The Chinese Professionals"?
L628054 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ You better not be fuckin' teasin' me.
L628053 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ You better not be fucking teasing me.
L628052 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ You will?
L628051 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ Yes.
L628050 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Will you be my wife?
L628049 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ What?
L628048 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Thank you. I wanna see you again too. And again, and again, and again. Bama, I know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went together all throughout high school, and they still got a divorce. So, fuck it, you wanna marry me?
L628047 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ At the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an agency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They have a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white-collar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least five hundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry beepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in "Dressed to Kill". And when I was ready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says he makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one's gonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or wind her watch. So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the ropes. It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don't really like it much, till last night. You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick. Since it was a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I want a second date.
L628046 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Goddamn it, Alabama, you gotta get the fuck outta there! How much longer before he's slappin' you around? Punchin' you in the stomach? How the fuck did you get hooked up with a douche-bag like this in the first place?
L628045 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ This motherfucker sounds charming!
L628044 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ Slapped her around a little. Punched her in the stomch. It was pretty scary.
L628043 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ What did he do to Arlene?
L628042 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty decent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with Arlene the other day.
L628041 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Is he nice?
L628040 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ He thinks he is. He says his mother was Apache, but I suspect he's lying.
L628039 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Is he black?
L628038 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L628037 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ A real live pimp?
L628036 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L628035 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ You have a pimp?
L628034 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ My pimp.
L628033 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Who and what is a Drexl?
L628032 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ It's over on the TV. All it says is: "Dear Clarence." I couldn't write anymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to ever see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had that much fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, "Alabama, come clean, Let him know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to Drexl and fuck yourself."
L628031 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ That dazzling imagination.
L628030 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ I don't know. I didn't talk with them. The plan was for me to bump into you, pick you up, spend the night, and skip out after you fell asleep. I was gonna write you a note and say that this was my last day in America. That I was leaving on a plane this morning up to Ukraine to marry a rich millionaire, and thank you for making my last day in America my best day.
L628029 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Who?
L628028 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ Yeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.
L628027 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ "Heroes For Sale"?
L628026 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ I'm a call girl. There's a difference, ya know.  I don't know. Maybe there's not. That place you took me to last night, that comic book place.
L628025 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ You're a whore?
L628024 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ I'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl.
L628023 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls. Make sure they're not rippin' the place off.
L628022 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ Clarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the theater. I was paid to be there.
L628021 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Did you hurt yourself?  Whatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack?
L628020 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ You didn't do nothing.
L628019 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ What's wrong, sweetheart? Did I do something? What did I do?
L628018 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L628017 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ So he really loved her?
L628016 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ That's what happened. In fact, when she died, it was considered to be the happiest time of her life. She'd been fucked over so much by men she didn't trust them. She was havin' this relationship with this guy and he asked her to marry him. Now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she couldn't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money. So, she said no. And the guy says, "Look, I really love you, and I wanna prove it. So have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter what happens, I can never get any of your money, and I'll sign it." So she did, and he asked her, and she said yes. And once they were engaged he told her a secret about himself that she never knew: he was a millionaire.
L628015 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ You mean she got a bad batch?
L628014 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what she took.
L628013 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ She OD'd, didn't she?
L628012 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ You know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died.
L628011 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ I love Janis.
L628010 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ You're not stupid. Just wrong.
L628009 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.
L628008 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ What would make you think that?
L628007 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Uh-huh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, she doesn't want me bothering her.
L628006 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ At the movies?
L628005 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ You know when you sat behind me?
L628004 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ I finally knew what I wanted when I grew up.
L628003 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ Oh, you look so cute as little Elvis.
L628002 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Five.
L628001 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ Oooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you then?
L627996 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ He was just born, remember? This is the first one. You know that guy, Dr. Gene Scott? He said that the story of Spiderman is the story of Christ, just disguised. Well, I thought about that even before I heard him say it. Hold on, let me show you my favorite comic book cover of all time.
L627995 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ God, Spiderman looks different.
L627993 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ That's a "Rookies" doll. George Sanford Brown. We gotta lotta dolls. They're real cool. Did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors in "The Black Hole"? I always found it funny somewhere there's a kid playin' with a little figure of Earnest Borgnine.
L627992 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ What's that?
L627991 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Well, we sell other things too. Cool stuff. "Man from U.N.C.L.E." Lunch boxes. "Green Hornet" board games. Shit like that. But comic books are main business. There's a lot of collectors around here.
L627990 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.
L627989 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Four hundred bucks.
L627988 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ You bet. How much is that worth?
L627987 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ That's where trouble comes into paradise. But the boss let's you borrow some money if you need it. Wanna see what "Spiderman" number one looks like?
L627986 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ Do you get paid a lot?
L627985 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ I'm hip. But you know, I'm comfortable here. It's easy work. I know what I'm doing. Everybody who works here is my buddy. I'm friendly with most of the customers. I just hang around and talk about comic books all day.
L627984 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ That's a long time.
L627983 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Almost four years.
L627982 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ How long have you worked here?
L627981 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Yeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books, play music.
L627980 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ Wow. What a swell place to work.
L627978 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ Because you looked like a nice guy, and I was a little scared. And I sure couldda used a nice guy about that time, so I spilled my popcorn on you.
L627977 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ And in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
L627976 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ Apparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a form of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or where I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even know my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a Tallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they told me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on me, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar. For some reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told him to stop and I got out.
L627975 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?
L627974 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ I'm not sure yet. Ask me again later.
L627973 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Do you have a fella?
L627972 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only thing that comes to mind are Persians.
L627971 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Turn-offs?
L627970 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.
L627969 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ What are your turn-ons?
L627968 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like "He's a Rebel".
L627967 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ What kinda music do you like?
L627966 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ Very much. Now, where were we?
L627965 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Like it?
L627964 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ Yes, I would.
L627963 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Would you like a bite of my pie?
L627962 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ Burt Reynolds.
L627961 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ What's your favorite movie star?
L627960 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ I don't remember. But off the top of my head, I'd say black.
L627959 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ What's your favorite color?
L627958 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ Might be from Tallahassee. But I'm not sure yet.
L627957 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Where are you from.
L627956 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ I don't remember.
L627955 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ What do you do?
L627954 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ Ask me them again. One by one.
L627953 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Well, for starters, what do you do? Where're ya from? What's your favorite color? Who's your favorite movie star? What kinda music do you like? What are your turn-ons and turn-offs? Do you have a fella? What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone? And, in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
L627952 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ What do you want to know?
L627951 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?
L627950 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ There's nothing to tell.
L627949 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Tell me about yourself.
L627948 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ How 'bout me what?
L627947 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Well, enough about the King. How about you?
L627946 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ I'd love some pie.
L627945 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ Would you like to get some pie?
L627944 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ I love to get pie after a movie.
L627943 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ Well, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get some pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after you've seen a good movie?
L627942 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ No. Not particularly.  How come?
L627941 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ I suppose you gotta get up early, huh?
L627940 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ 'Bout twelve.
L627939 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ What time is it?
L627938 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.
L627937 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ Sure. Why not?
L627936 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?
L627935 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ I took a cab.

L627928 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.
L627927 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ You shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the "Streetfighter". It was the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the R.
L627926 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ Sonny kicks ass.
L627925 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?
L627924 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ Great movie. Action-packed!
L627923 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ He ain't so much good guy as he's just a bad motherfucker. Sonny don't be bullshittin'. He fucks dudes up for life. Hold on, a fight scene's coming up.
L627922 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ I thought Sonny was the good guy.
L627921 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Thanks a lot.

L627919 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ The oriental in black. He's an assasin. Now, at the beginning he was hired to kill this guy the cops had. So he got himself arrested. They take him into the police station. And he starts kickin' all the cops' asses. Now, while keepin' them at bay, he finds the guy he was supposed to kill. Does a number on him. Kicks the cops' asses some more. Kicks the bars out of the window. And jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him.
L627918 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ The oriental.
L627917 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Not at all. I, this guy here, he's Sonny Chiba.
L627915 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ What a wonderful philosophy. Thanks for being such a sweetheart. You could have been a real dick.
L627914 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ It's OK. Don't worry about it. Accidents happen.
L627913 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ I'm the clumsiest person in the world.
L627912 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.
L627911 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ Oh, look what happened. Oh god, I'm so sorry. Are you OK?
L627885 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ And here we are.
L627884 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ ... when my mom went into labor, my dad panicked. He never had a kid before, and crashed the car. Now, picture this: their car's demolished, crowd is starting to gather, my mom is yelling, going into contractions, and my dad, who was losing it before, is now completely screaming yellow zonkers. Then, out of nowhere, as if from thin air, this big giant bus appears, and the bus-driver says, "Get her in here.". He forgot all about his route and just drove straight to the hospital. So, because he was such a nice guy, they wanted to name the baby after him, as a sign of gratitude. Well, his name was Waldo, and no matter how grateful they were, even if I'da been a boy, they would't call me Waldo. So they asked Waldo where he was from. And, so there you go.
L627847 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Now hang up.
L627846 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ Bye-bye.
L627843 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ He can't. We gotta go, but he wants you to read the letter. The letter explains it all. He wants you to know he loves you. And he wants you to know that as of tomorrow, all of your money problems are over.
L627842 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ No time. Gotta go. Just tell him to read the letter, the letter explains all. Tell him I love him. And tell him, as of tomorrow, all his money problems are over.
L627839 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ Get it.
L627838 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Tell him to look through it.

L627834 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Has he looked through it yet?
L627828 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ The letter he sent.
L627827 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ The letter I sent.
L627821 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ Don't eat anything.
L627820 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Tell him not to eat anything. We're gonna scarf when we get there.
L627815 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it.
L627814 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Tell him we gotta go.
L627792 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ Oh, hush up.
L627791 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?
L627790 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ Bye, Daddy! Hope to see you again real soon.
L627760 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ It's nine o'clock in the morning. Nothing's open.
L627759 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ How come?
L627758 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ I didn't get any chicken.
L627757 +++$+++ u8633 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Thank God. I could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it.
L627756 +++$+++ u8631 +++$+++ m586 +++$+++ ALABAMA +++$+++ The forager's back.
