L572168 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ Fun?
L572167 +++$+++ u8104 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ CONRAD +++$+++ They make your life fun.  Their only guarantee is you will not be bored.
L572166 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ Why?
L572165 +++$+++ u8104 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ CONRAD +++$+++ Trust me.  Call that number.
L572164 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ "Consumer Recrreation Services." What, do they make golf clubs?
L572163 +++$+++ u8104 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ CONRAD +++$+++ Call that number.
L572161 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ You shouldn't have.
L572160 +++$+++ u8104 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ CONRAD +++$+++ For you.
L572159 +++$+++ u8104 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ CONRAD +++$+++ I don't need anything from you.  I was laying on a beach somewhere in Spain, naked, and, it hit me -- Nickie's birthday.  So, here I am, four layovers, twenty-seven hours flying and one donkey ride later. Not necessarily in that order.
L572158 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ Really?
L572157 +++$+++ u8104 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ CONRAD +++$+++ No.
L572156 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ You need anything?
L572155 +++$+++ u8104 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ CONRAD +++$+++ Yeah.
L572154 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ Connie... what brings you here?  Is everything alright?
L572153 +++$+++ u8104 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ CONRAD +++$+++ Nowhere in particular.  Don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore?
L572152 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ I redecorated.  What about you?
L572151 +++$+++ u8104 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ CONRAD +++$+++ Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
L572150 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ Divorced.  Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito.
L572149 +++$+++ u8104 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ CONRAD +++$+++ Elizabeth?
L572148 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ Never better.
L572147 +++$+++ u8104 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ CONRAD +++$+++ How long's it been?  Since mom died... four years?  How are you?
L572146 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ About me?
L572145 +++$+++ u8104 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ CONRAD +++$+++ So do you.  And to think I was worried...
L572144 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ You look good.
L572143 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ Which grad-school?
L572142 +++$+++ u8104 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ CONRAD +++$+++ Not after I'm done with it.  Actually, I've been here.  In grad-school I bought crystal-meth from the maitre d'.
L572141 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ They'll be wanting it back.
L572140 +++$+++ u8104 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ CONRAD +++$+++ They gave me a free jacket at the door.
L572139 +++$+++ u8104 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ CONRAD +++$+++ That's why it's a classic.  Come on, man... how 'bout a hug... ?
L572138 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ "Seymour Butts."  I never get tired of that one.
L572137 +++$+++ u8104 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ CONRAD +++$+++ Happy Birthday, man.
L572136 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
L572135 +++$+++ u8104 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ CONRAD +++$+++ Hey there, Nickie.
L572841 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ Yes, very lucky.
L572840 +++$+++ u8105 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ COUNSELOR +++$+++ How much is it?  A few thousand, at least.  A Rolex like that... lucky for you they missed it.
L572839 +++$+++ u8105 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ COUNSELOR +++$+++ And, they didn't take that watch?
L572838 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ Yes.
L572837 +++$+++ u8105 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ COUNSELOR +++$+++ We'll help with the police, if you want to bother.  As far as money goes... can I make a suggestion?  You say you were mugged?
L572836 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ I don't speak Spanish.  All I need is to get back... just enough for that.
L572835 +++$+++ u8105 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ COUNSELOR +++$+++ Have you gone to the police?
L572834 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ Yes.
L572833 +++$+++ u8105 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ COUNSELOR +++$+++ Robbed?
L572832 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ What happened was, I'm on vacation, alone... I was robbed, at gunpoint. They hit me and ran.  Two men, a few blocks away.  They took my wallet, money... all of it.  So...
L572831 +++$+++ u8105 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ COUNSELOR +++$+++ It always is.
L572830 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ Well, where to begin.  It's complicated...
L572829 +++$+++ u8105 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ COUNSELOR +++$+++ No money, no identification or passport.  You are in a fix.  What did happen to you?
L573026 +++$+++ u8106 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ I know.
L573025 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ I'll call.  I really will.
L573024 +++$+++ u8106 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Happy Birthday, Nicholas.
L573023 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ You're going?  Well, thanks again.  Good to see you, Rachel...  Thanks for coming, Mel.  I'll get your car back.  Right now it's, uh... at the zoo.  Sorry.
L573022 +++$+++ u8106 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ We have to head out... just wanted to say goodbye.
L572888 +++$+++ u8106 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ I hope.
L572887 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ I'll explain someday.
L572886 +++$+++ u8106 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Yes.
L572885 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ It's just a t.v.  He's just an actor.
L572879 +++$+++ u8106 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Of course, Nick...
L572878 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ It would mean a lot to me... if you and I could be friends.  If I could have you back in my life... in some small way.  It would be important.
L572877 +++$+++ u8106 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ There's nothing to forgive.
L572876 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ The last few days, um... I've been thinking... had a lot of spare time.  I want to tell you... I'm starting to understand why you left me.  I've been resenting you for it, maybe, but ... I want to apologize, for all of it.  For shutting you out, for not being there.  I...  Anyway, I hope you can forgive me.
L572868 +++$+++ u8106 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Of course you can have it if you need it.  Can I get you something to eat?
L572867 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ I know, look at me, well...  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't even really know.  I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while.
L572866 +++$+++ u8106 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ What happened to you, Nick?  I mean, look at yourself...
L572865 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ I need your car, Elizabeth.
L572938 +++$+++ u8107 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ FEINGOLD +++$+++ Like, this way... sort of...
L572937 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ Guess!
L572936 +++$+++ u8107 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ FEINGOLD +++$+++ It was a different floor then...
L572935 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ Where'd you pick up your checks?
L572934 +++$+++ u8107 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ FEINGOLD +++$+++ I told you, they hired me over the phone.  I never met anyone.
L572933 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ Where?
L572928 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ Shut up.  Cuff him to the rail.
L572927 +++$+++ u8107 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ FEINGOLD +++$+++ You don't need me...
L572922 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ I don't want money.  I'm pulling back the curtain.  I'm here to meet the wizard.
L572921 +++$+++ u8107 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ FEINGOLD +++$+++ What are you gonna do anyway?  You won't get your money back.
L572920 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ Drive in.
L572917 +++$+++ u8107 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ FEINGOLD +++$+++ What whistle?  There's no fucking whistle.  This is fucking dangerous.
L572916 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ Tell them the cops are after you... tell them you've got to talk to someone, I'm threatening to blow the whistle.
L572915 +++$+++ u8107 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ FEINGOLD +++$+++ No, I can't.  I'm sorry and all, but...
L572914 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ They know you... you worked for them. You can get me in.
L572913 +++$+++ u8107 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ FEINGOLD +++$+++ They own the whole building.  They just move from floor to floor.
L572912 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ How do I find them?  Their offices are empty.
L572911 +++$+++ u8107 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ FEINGOLD +++$+++ Goddamnit, why do they do that?
L572910 +++$+++ u8107 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ FEINGOLD +++$+++ Nobody knows, pal.  Nobody gets the big picture...  Jason, Tommy, cut it out!
L572909 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ I'm tired of dealing with peons.  I need to get to whoever's in charge.
L572908 +++$+++ u8107 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ FEINGOLD +++$+++ Look, it was just a job.  Nothing personal, ya know?  I play my part, improvise a little.  That's what I'm good at.
L572907 +++$+++ u8107 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ FEINGOLD +++$+++ Hey, everyone -- snack time!  Here... here you go...
L572906 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ Get rid of them.
L572266 +++$+++ u8107 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ FEINGOLD +++$+++ That's right -- you're a left-brain word fetishist.
L572265 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ You mean, <u>dis</u>satisfied.
L572264 +++$+++ u8107 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ FEINGOLD +++$+++ It's never happened.  We've never had an unsatisfied customer.
L572263 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ You mean, I don't like it, he doesn't pay?
L572262 +++$+++ u8107 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ FEINGOLD +++$+++ One guarantee.  Payment's entirely at your brother's discretion and, as a gift, dependent on your satisfaction.
L572260 +++$+++ u8107 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ FEINGOLD +++$+++ It's all down to this...
L572259 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ Don't worry.  It's been terrific spending the entire day with your "crack team".
L572258 +++$+++ u8107 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ FEINGOLD +++$+++ Sorry to keep you waiting.
L572252 +++$+++ u8107 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ FEINGOLD +++$+++ Cursory examination.  Turn-your-head- and-cough sort of thing.  You'll be out of here in no time.
L572251 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ Physical?
L572250 +++$+++ u8107 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ FEINGOLD +++$+++ An hour for those... maybe another for the physical.
L572249 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ How long will these take?
L572248 +++$+++ u8107 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ FEINGOLD +++$+++ First, admit to yourself that it sounds intriguing.  Second, you don't have to decide today.  Take the silly tests, fill out the forms.  One day, the game begins.  You either love it or hate it.  Decide then.  We're like an experimental Book-of-the-Month- Club; drop out at any time with no further obligation.  That was my sales pitch.
L572247 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ Do you really expect me to participate without knowing a single thing?
L572246 +++$+++ u8107 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ FEINGOLD +++$+++ May I make two suggestions... ?
L572245 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ And if nothing's lacking?
L572244 +++$+++ u8107 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ FEINGOLD +++$+++ We provide whatever's lacking.
L572243 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ Humor me with specifics.
L572242 +++$+++ u8107 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ FEINGOLD +++$+++ It's different every time.
L572241 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ What kind of vacation?
L572240 +++$+++ u8107 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ FEINGOLD +++$+++ Tailored specifically to each participant.  Think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you.
L572239 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ A game?
L572238 +++$+++ u8107 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ FEINGOLD +++$+++ Oh... it's a game.
L572237 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ No, I mean, what is it FOR?  What are you selling?
L572236 +++$+++ u8107 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ FEINGOLD +++$+++ We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...
L572235 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ What's all this for?
L572234 +++$+++ u8107 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ FEINGOLD +++$+++ I don't write the questions.  I just review them.
L572232 +++$+++ u8107 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ FEINGOLD +++$+++ You need to fill out those forms. Application, psych-tests: M.M.P.I. and T.A.T.  For the financial questionnaire, don't answer anything you don't feel like.  We'll run a T.R.W....
L572231 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ No, thank you.
L572230 +++$+++ u8107 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ FEINGOLD +++$+++ Your brother was a client with our London branch.  We do a sort of informal scoring.  His numbers were outstanding.  Sure you're not hungry at all... ? Tung Hoy, best in Chinatown...
L572229 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ What is?
L572228 +++$+++ u8107 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ FEINGOLD +++$+++ V-A-N... O-R-T-O-N...  A gift from Conrad Van Orton. Interesting...
L572224 +++$+++ u8107 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ FEINGOLD +++$+++ Oh, here we go...
L572223 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ I'm not quite sure how this works. My brother...
L572222 +++$+++ u8107 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ FEINGOLD +++$+++ Jim Feingold, V.P., E.D.A. Engineering and Data Analysis.
L572683 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ First they try to kill me, now you?  Put your damn clothes back on.
L572682 +++$+++ u8108 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ Isn't this what you like?  They told me you had a thing for boats.
L572681 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ Don't take another step.
L572680 +++$+++ u8108 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ Don't be nervous.  They said you'd be nervous.
L572679 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am.
L572678 +++$+++ u8108 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ I've been so lonely.
L572677 +++$+++ u8108 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ They were my husband's.  My late husband... may he rest in peace.
L572676 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ You know, these fit... perfectly.
L572675 +++$+++ u8108 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ GIRL +++$+++ Let's get you dried off first.  I might have some clothes below.
L572674 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ I need the police.
L572554 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ No, you didn't...
L572553 +++$+++ u8109 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ HOTEL MANAGER +++$+++ Didn't I give you two?
L572552 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ Is there a room key?
L572551 +++$+++ u8109 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ HOTEL MANAGER +++$+++ Hm?
L572550 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ The key?
L572549 +++$+++ u8109 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ HOTEL MANAGER +++$+++ Show Mr. Van Orton to his room.
L572547 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ Have we met?
L572546 +++$+++ u8109 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ HOTEL MANAGER +++$+++ Ah, Mr. Van Orton.  Here you go...
L573014 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ Goodnight.  Where was she?
L573013 +++$+++ u8110 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Goodnight.  See you home.
L572709 +++$+++ u8110 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Nobody worried about your father.
L572708 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ Did you worry about him?
L572707 +++$+++ u8110 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ You're not like him at all.  I don't know exactly what's going on around here lately, but don't make me start worrying about you.
L572706 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ I'm just like him.
L572705 +++$+++ u8110 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Not much, I think.
L572704 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
L572703 +++$+++ u8110 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ No.  What happened... no one expected it.
L572702 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ Was he morose, or...?  I mean...
L572701 +++$+++ u8110 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Your mother thought he was a good man.  He worked very hard.  What I remember most was his manner was so... slight.  It was easy to spend time in a room, and not realize he'd been there the whole time.
L572700 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ He came to my mind recently, that's all.
L572699 +++$+++ u8110 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ All the time I've known you, you've never once asked about him.
L572698 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ I'm not sure.
L572697 +++$+++ u8110 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ What makes you ask?
L572617 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ There's been a break in.  Lock this door and stay here.  Don't move a muscle.
L572616 +++$+++ u8110 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about.  What's happened?
L572615 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ Did the alarm go off?  The house... they... you didn't see... ?
L572614 +++$+++ u8110 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Yes. What do you mean?  What's wrong?
L572613 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ Ilsa... you're alright?
L572612 +++$+++ u8110 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Mr. Van Orton... ?
L572314 +++$+++ u8110 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Goodnight then.
L572313 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ No, thank you.  Goodnight.
L572312 +++$+++ u8110 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ I've finished for the evening.  Will you be needing anything else?
L572311 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ Fine.
L572310 +++$+++ u8110 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Is everything alright?
L572201 +++$+++ u8110 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Well... send my love, if you see him again.
L572200 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ Okay.  I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
L572199 +++$+++ u8110 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ You did?  How is he?
L572197 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ Thank you.  Goodnight.
L572196 +++$+++ u8110 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Dinner's in the oven.
L572103 +++$+++ u8110 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Have a nice day.
L572102 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ Thank you.
L572863 +++$+++ u8112 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ There was an incident a few days ago... a nervous breakdown, they said.  The police took him.  They left this address, in case anyone...
L572862 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ Look, where is he?!
L572861 +++$+++ u8112 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ He couldn't, or refused to pay.  We extended credit...
L572860 +++$+++ u8114 +++$+++ m550 +++$+++ NICHOLAS +++$+++ His behavior... ?
