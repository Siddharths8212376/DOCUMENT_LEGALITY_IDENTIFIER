L78631 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Has anything been simple so far? From the look of the shovel, we dig.
L78629 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Bet... el... geuse.  What an awful name.  I thought it was like -- you know.  The <u>juice</u> of <u>beetles</u>.
L78628 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Three times.  Powerful number.
L78627 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ What happened?
L78626 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ <u>Betelgeuse</u>!
L78625 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Go ahead... third time's a charm.
L78624 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ ... Yes this must be him.  Look... Betelgeuse... Betelgeuse...
L78623 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
L78622 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Here's something.
L78620 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Then it should be here.
L78619 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Of course I did.
L78618 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Did you copy these gravestones right, Adam?
L78617 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ This is different.  Eventually she'll take someone to the attic. And then what?  We've got to try to contact this guy Betelmyer. We gotta get some help, hon.
L78616 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!
L78615 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.
L78614 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Lydia's trying, but they don't believe her.
L78588 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ You know you're really a pretty girl.
L78587 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Where are your skulls and bones?
L78586 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Well, I don't know... We don't get many visitors.
L78551 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ It's <u>not</u> stupid.  We're ghosts. Do you want this woman for breakfast for 125 years?  Moan louder!
L78550 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ I feel really stupid.
L78547 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Think of them as death shrouds. And the moaning is important. Really <u>moan</u>!  Practice, practice, practice.
L78546 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ God, this is so corny.  Have we been reduced to this?  Sheets?
L78528 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Look, she's right.  We'll just start simple, honey, be tougher. I feel... confident.  C'mon.
L78527 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ That guy is in our cemetery.  Oh, Adam.
L78503 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ We probably wouldn't mind sharing the house with people who were --
L78502 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ We'd like some help in getting rid of the people who moved in here.  Barbara and I worked very hard on this house.
L78492 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ How long do you suppose we were waiting?
L78491 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Look at this, everything is different down here.  All our furniture is gone.
L78490 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ My God, we're back where we started.
L78457 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ No.  But it's somewhere without big worms.
L78456 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ ... Not what I expected when we walked through that door.
L78442 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Wait.
L78441 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Yet another triumph for Adam and Barbara in the afterlife.
L78439 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Draw door?  I don't know why we keep looking in that stupid book.
L78438 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ We need some help.  I found something this morning.  Here. Emergencies.  'In case of emergency, draw door.'
L78437 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ I don't know... what are you looking up?
L78436 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Are you crazy?  She can't hear you.
L78435 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ We don't know who he is...  ... I'm going to talk to that little girl.
L78434 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ What about this Beetle guy?
L78433 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ We're not going to wait here like cornered animals.  I can tell you that.  We need help.  I'm going to talk to that little girl.
L78432 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ There's nothing we can do.  It's just a matter of time before they unlock this room.  There goes my model.  There goes our last refuge.
L78411 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ That's all we need.
L78410 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ But she <u>saw</u> us.  I could feel it.
L78409 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ She couldn't have.  We can't <u>make</u> them see us.
L78408 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ That little girl saw us.
L78391 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Nothing.  The bio buster?  I don't get it...
L78390 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ That's it?  No number, or instructions?
L78388 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Not really...  what's this?
L78387 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Look in the index... maybe there's, like an emergency number or something.
L78372 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Death didn't improve your sense of humor.
L78371 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ You can't say that for sure.  It could be a transitional thing. Like a post-life crisis.  We just have to be tougher with them. Come on.  Have some brandy. Spirits, get it?
L78370 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ We're trapped in this house forever... with those... people.
L78368 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ I know.  I'm sorry.
L78367 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ <u>You</u> left me.
L78366 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me alone.
L78362 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Whatever it is it can't be worse than this.
L78361 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Barbara, honey!  Don't go out there.  You don't know --
L78360 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ No, I'm not putting up with this.
L78359 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Oh, honey, we may need that.
L78312 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ We're not completely helpless. I've been reading the book. There's a word for people in our predicament, honey.
L78311 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I don't know if there's anything we can do.
L78310 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Is this a punishment for something we did in life?  What can we do?
L78309 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ They make gypsies look good.
L78308 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Adam, we <u>are</u> in hell.  I hate these people.
L78279 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ That's my girl!
L78278 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ I guess... if I'm going to be dead, I'll just have to be the best dead person ever!
L78276 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ At least we won't have to worry about her.
L78275 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Arrogant.  That's Jane Butterfield all right...
L78274 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Just says 'won't.'  Wait a minute. Here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.'
L78273 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Won't?  Or can't?
L78272 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ She can't see you, right?  In the book, Rule Number Two: the living usually won't see the dead.
L78271 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I don't know.  <u>Jane, Jane, up here</u>!
L78270 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ What's she doing here?
L78269 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ God, it's Jane Butterfield!
L78267 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ But I'm not hungry, are you?
L78266 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Dishes?  We haven't eaten in three weeks!  Adam, I'm not like you, I really need to be around <u>people</u>, get out to the church and go grocery shopping.
L78265 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Hon... I didn't want to die, but really, this is fine with me.  As long as I never have to wash dishes again.
L78264 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ In heaven there wouldn't be dust on the wallpaper.
L78263 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Maybe this is heaven.
L78262 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ I can't clean anything.  The vacuum is out in the garage.  I can't leave the house.  Why don't they tell us something?  Where are all the other dead people in the world?  Why is it just you and me?
L78261 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Cabin fever, hon?
L78253 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I don't see anything about 'Rewards and Punishments' or 'Heaven and Hell.'  This book reads like stereo instructions!  Listen to this... 'Geographical and Temporal Perimeters... Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.'  This is going to take some time.
L78252 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?
L78251 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ This book isn't arranged that way. What do you want to know?
L78250 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ I don't like situations like this. I hate it when I'm not in control. So just tell me the basics.
L78249 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ This is going to take some time.
L78248 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ I don't think we survived the crash.
L78247 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Look at the publisher.  Handbook for the Recently Deceased Press.
L78246 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ De<u>ceased</u>.  I don't know where it came from.
L78245 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Handbook for the recently diseased.
L78243 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Yes it did.  Yes it did.  I made a couple of small discoveries. Here's one.
L78242 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Anything happen while I was away?
L78241 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ ... Hmmm?
L78240 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ That's how long you were gone.
L78239 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ What?
L78238 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Two hours.
L78237 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ You saved my -- uh -- life... or whatever... something.
L78229 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Oh, Adam.  We're home.  In our own house.  Nonsense.  I'll make some coffee.  You get some more firewood.
L78228 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I'll tell you what, Barbara.  I don't think we survived that crash.
L78227 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ I am sitting.
L78226 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ You'd better sit down, hon.
L78224 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ I'm not sure.  It feels... frozen.
L78223 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ How's your arm?
L78222 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ This fire wasn't burning when we left the house.
L78219 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Oh... I'm sorry...
L78218 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Slow down there, honey... I don't want the vibration to weaken the model.
L78217 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ You're doing it, Adam.  You're saving this town.
L78216 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Yeah it turned out okay.  We applied for a National Historical plaque for it.  That'll be the third one on Main Street.
L78215 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Adam, your Bozman Building is a beauty.
L78200 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Adam!
L78199 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Don't forget the balls, Ernie.
L78198 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Wave at the lion.
L78196 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Let's not think about it.  We'll have a nice romantic, quiet, vacation.  Here comes the bridge chorus.
L78195 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ I know... I just wish she'd leave us alone.
L78194 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ We should be flattered that she wants to sell our house.
L78193 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Ah, the ever-tactful Jane.  Let's just relax about having children.
L78192 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family.
L78165 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ It's <u>your</u> turn, darling.
L78164 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Oh no.
L78163 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ God, how I have looked forward to this, honey.
L78162 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Oh, honey, I'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home.
L78161 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Yeah, I want to get one coat on the wardrobe and then I'll help you.
L78156 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ God... Manchurian Tung oil? There's enough to refinish the gateleg table <u>and</u> the cherry wardrobe!
L78155 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Helen got it for me in Oslo.
L78154 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Manchurian Tung oil?  Where did you get it?
L78152 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Almost.
L78151 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Oh, Adam, the model looks so good. The Historical Society will love it.  You've finished the streets?
L78150 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ She's ready.
L79035 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Oh puh-leeze!
L79034 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Uh-uh.  Only if you got <u>above</u> a C on science.
L79033 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ So can I?
L79032 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ I got an A!
L79031 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ We studied all day yesterday. Don't tell me...
L79027 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ I got it.  And I took pictures of the new church for you, too.
L79026 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Did you get the paint?
L78895 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Really.  I don't know.
L78894 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ What is going on?
L78593 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Wait a minute.  I had some licorice ice cream earlier.  You guys could be gas.  What if... I'm dreaming. Can you do any neat tricks to prove you're not gas?
L78592 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ You tell them that we are desperate horrible ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing to get back our house.
L78585 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ God, if this is true this is like, amazing!  I kinda like it up here. Can I visit you sometimes?
L78584 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ We weren't there.  The handbook says funerals aren't for the dead.
L78581 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ You don't know the Deetzes very well, do you?  My father bought this place.  He never walks away from equity.  Why don't <u>you</u> leave?
L78580 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ We want to frighten you away.  So that you'll move out.
L78579 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ And this used to be your house, I bet.  Why do you want to scare everybody?
L78578 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I certainly did.  I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much.
L78577 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ <u>You</u> did this?  You carved all these little figures and houses and things?
L78574 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Stepmother.  I'm very sensitive about being related to reptiles.
L78573 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ We were trying to scare your mother.
L78572 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Why are you creeping around Delia's bedroom?
L78569 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ I'm wearing contacts... Also I read through <u>Handbook for the</u> <u>Recently Deceased</u>.  It says that live people ignore the strange and unusual... not me... <u>I am</u> strange and unusual.
L78568 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Nobody else can.
L78565 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Is this like a trick question?
L78564 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ You can actually see us?  Without the sheets?
L78560 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ <u>Night of the Living Dead</u>?  It's this gross movie.
L78559 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ What?
L78558 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ I'm not scared of Ralph Lauren. Those are <u>sheets</u>.  Are you gross under there?  Are you <u>Night of the</u> <u>Living Dead</u> under there?  Like all bloody veins and pus?
L78557 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Aren't you scared?
L78555 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ We're ghosts.
L78554 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ A... Are you the guys who're hiding out in the attic?
L78472 +++$+++ u3989 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ RECEPTIONIST +++$+++ For Juno, your caseworker.  Not that it matters to your type.  But there <u>are</u> all these other people here ahead of you.  I'd say three hours.
L78471 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Wait for who?
L78467 +++$+++ u3989 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ RECEPTIONIST +++$+++ D-90's.  You spend a hundred and twenty-five years on earth, actually, in that house, during which you get only three class- one D-90 intercessions with Juno. You probably haven't even read through the manual completely yet.
L78466 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Help vouchers?
L78465 +++$+++ u3989 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ RECEPTIONIST +++$+++ Good luck.  You're going to use up all your help vouchers.
L78464 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Nine months?  What difference does that make?
L78459 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ W... We didn't know how to make one.
L78458 +++$+++ u3989 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ RECEPTIONIST +++$+++ You don't have an appointment, do you?
L79001 +++$+++ u3981 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BETELGEUSE +++$+++ Now, let's get rolling!
L79000 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ <u>Barbara</u>?!!
L78781 +++$+++ u3981 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BETELGEUSE +++$+++ You wish!  I nearly scored with that little blonde.  I need me a short little queen.
L78780 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ This is <u>my</u> town.
L78666 +++$+++ u3981 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BETELGEUSE +++$+++ Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work I go!
L78665 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Okay.  But that Betelgeuse sure seemed mad.
L78652 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Can you scare them off?
L78651 +++$+++ u3981 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BETELGEUSE +++$+++ You Maitlands are the backbone of the afterlife.  So what's my cut?
L78650 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ But... the Deetzes are <u>destroying</u> our house.
L78649 +++$+++ u3981 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BETELGEUSE +++$+++ <u>So</u> you, the dead, want me, <u>the</u> <u>undead</u>, to throw the live guys -- Mommie, Daddy and Lolita, who might not mind a tumble with an older guy, out into the cold? Even though they have paid hard casharoonie for your dump?
L78641 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ You don't kill anyone.
L78640 +++$+++ u3981 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BETELGEUSE +++$+++ Hell no!  I'm rolling.  I'm a businessman.  I'm the man what <u>am</u>. <u>Beee</u>tel <u>Jooose</u>!  <u>Who</u> do I gotta kill?
L78639 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Aren't you dead?
L78863 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ <u>Out</u>.
L78862 +++$+++ u3985 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Yes... or no?  Do you want the Deetzes out or in?
L78793 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Well, we didn't know --
L78792 +++$+++ u3985 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ <u>Never trust the living</u>!  We <u>cannot</u> have a routine haunting like yours provide incontrovertible visual proof of existence beyond death.
L78791 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Handbook?  When...?
L78526 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ And if we need <u>you</u> again, how do we...?
L78525 +++$+++ u3985 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ <u>Don't say his name</u>!  Just practice. Do it <u>yourself</u>!
L78513 +++$+++ u3985 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Start simply.  Do what you know. Use your talents.  Practice.  We only help those who help themselves. Just do a little at a time.  And of course, practice, practice, practice.  It's tricky but -- you weren't murderers by any chance, were you?
L78512 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ We have to start simpler, is that it?
L78511 +++$+++ u3985 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ I heard.  Tore your face right off!  Bad news.  It obviously doesn't do any good to pull your heads off in front of people if they can't see you.
L78509 +++$+++ u3985 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ The Intermediate Interface chapter on Haunting says it all.  Get 'em out yourself.  It's your house. Haunted houses don't come easy.
L78508 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ We tried.
L78507 +++$+++ u3985 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ Hell is other people.  You obviously don't read much. Besides things seem pretty quiet here.  You should thank God you didn't die in Italy.  The Deetzes.  Okay.  Have you been studying the manual?
L78499 +++$+++ u3985 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ JUNO +++$+++ No.  What's wrong?
L78498 +++$+++ u3979 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Are you available?
L78883 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ I'm so sorry we frightened you. What were you doing?
L78882 +++$+++ u3981 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BETELGEUSE +++$+++ You lilly-livered bleeding hearts!
L78779 +++$+++ u3981 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BETELGEUSE +++$+++ Hey, I've been in a frigging bottle for six hundred years.  I was out.  Every dog has his day. This is my town.  I need a night to howl.
L78778 +++$+++ u3980 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ I don't like Charles Deetz particularly, but you could have <u>killed</u> him.
