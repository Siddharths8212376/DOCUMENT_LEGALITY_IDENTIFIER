L460387 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I don't want to. When I was lyin' there in that hospital bed at death's door I says to myself, I ain't goin' out no more. If I ever get outta this, I'll just stay home.
L460386 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Well, there's no reason you shouldn't go out, Rose... in moderation.

L460383 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yeah, it's kinda nice.
L460382 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ You see, Rose? Now that's the kind of dress you ought to wear.
L460323 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ What? Wha-at? Mrs. Hillyer?

L460216 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I don't think we ought to discuss this in front of the children.
L460167 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I had better call Daddy.
L460166 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he is, I really don't.
L460165 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Rose, that scruffy-looking man is out in the yard again.

L460081 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Oh, no, that's the style. It's meant to be clinging.
L460080 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Well, I think it's charming, Rose.  But don't you think... ah, the skirt is a little tight?
L459888 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ You look sick if you ask me. I hate to leave you with the dishes and all, but I'm supposed to go to a meeting of the Garden Club this evening.  I'll need the car keys.
L459887 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ No, ma'am, I'm just fine.
L459886 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Rose, you're in an awful dither tonight. What's the matter with you, honey, are you sick or something?
L459834 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yes, Ma'am.
L459833 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Well, you run on now.
L459832 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I like to work. I don't mind work. It's the least I can do after all you and Mr. Hillyer have done for me.  You're so sweet. There never was nobody like you.
L459831 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Really, why don't you go sit down somewhere?
L459830 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You're so sweet.
L459829 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Rose, you work too hard. Why don't you go sit down somewhere and drink a Co-Cola?
L459828 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ It must be wonderful to be so smart. I don't see how you do it, reading all those books, learning all that stuff.
L459827 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Well, I am working on my thesis.
L459826 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Are you going to get your degree soon?

L459824 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ What are you studying now, Mrs. Hillyer?
L459793 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Well, it's rather interesting about Brother, actually. I realized the remarkable thing he had when he was six weeks old. He looked at me and understood me, he knew exactly who I was. I know it sounds crazy but it's true. He's very remarkable, he was born for the ministry and could move millions, but he doesn't know that yet. I have to warn you about him, he can be very dangerous, there is an evil streak in him, a streak of pure sheer meanness. But at heart Brother is saintly and that is why he was born for the ministry even if he doesn't know it.
L459792 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Oh, no, ma'am.
L463269 +++$+++ u7230 +++$+++ m488 +++$+++ "SCHOOL-MARM" +++$+++ ... okay... you made your point.
L463268 +++$+++ u7237 +++$+++ m488 +++$+++ KITTLE +++$+++ Hasn't he got enough problems, or didn't you notice that's not cream soda on his breath?
L463267 +++$+++ u7237 +++$+++ m488 +++$+++ KITTLE +++$+++ Maybe I'm not making myself clear. You're probably the first girl Billy-Boy's ever fallen in love with, and I know for sure you're the first he's slept with.  So, how's he gonna feel...  ... when he finds out that the only first he is for you is the first guy who didn't have to pull out at the last second to get his close-up?
L463266 +++$+++ u7230 +++$+++ m488 +++$+++ "SCHOOL-MARM" +++$+++ What... what makes you think you can order me around?!
L463265 +++$+++ u7237 +++$+++ m488 +++$+++ KITTLE +++$+++ You're not gonna see him again.
L463264 +++$+++ u7230 +++$+++ m488 +++$+++ "SCHOOL-MARM" +++$+++ Let me tell him.  Let him decide.
L463262 +++$+++ u7230 +++$+++ m488 +++$+++ "SCHOOL-MARM" +++$+++ But... I love him.  I do...
L463261 +++$+++ u7237 +++$+++ m488 +++$+++ KITTLE +++$+++ What were you gonna say?  Exactly how did you think he was gonna make the leap from dating a sweet, innocent school teacher to an ass-fucking porn star?
L463260 +++$+++ u7230 +++$+++ m488 +++$+++ "SCHOOL-MARM" +++$+++ I was going to tell him.
L463259 +++$+++ u7237 +++$+++ m488 +++$+++ KITTLE +++$+++ I'm looking at this poster, and I'm thinkin', I don't remember seeing films like this when I was in school.

L463392 +++$+++ u7237 +++$+++ m488 +++$+++ KITTLE +++$+++ Take her down to the car, and for Christ's sake be careful this time.  Last suspect he took in, butter-fingers dropped her down the stairs.  What a mess.  Why is it we don't appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
L463390 +++$+++ u7237 +++$+++ m488 +++$+++ KITTLE +++$+++ Cuff'em.  Let's see what these two love birds say once they're sitting in separate cages.

L463378 +++$+++ u7237 +++$+++ m488 +++$+++ KITTLE +++$+++ Well... what can I do?  You've created a dilemma...  And, look at the that. Time's running out.  I wonder... how can I impress upon you just exactly how frustrating this situation is for me?
L463377 +++$+++ u7231 +++$+++ m488 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got.

L463370 +++$+++ u7231 +++$+++ m488 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Every person's got their own kinks, beef-cake.  What's wrong, Kittle?  You don't swing?
L463369 +++$+++ u7237 +++$+++ m488 +++$+++ KITTLE +++$+++ Incestuous.

L462895 +++$+++ u7237 +++$+++ m488 +++$+++ KITTLE +++$+++ Last time Billy-Boy did this, the guy's neck broke...  ... just like that.  Sad in a way. Why is it we don't truly appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
L462893 +++$+++ u7237 +++$+++ m488 +++$+++ KITTLE +++$+++ This scag is enough to keep every junkie from here to the Mexican border high as a kite for the next two years.  You think we're gonna let Zimmermann haul it onto <U>our</U> streets on the Fourth-of-fucking-July!?
