L448687 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Everyone describes the same process. At first it is exciting.  You're at the centre of the world.  As soon as anything happens, you're the first to know about it.  And there are deadlines a dozen times a day, even more, and that's intimidating and exciting.  Then you get the hang of it and the excitement wears off.  Your a clerk in a rather dowdy Office.  There's none of the glamour of television, or the penetration of serious journalism.  You're a processor of semi-official news.  Some people leave at this stage.  Then, if you hang on, and especially if you're promoted, you discover a new kind of pleasure.  You're pleased by the ease with which you can write summaries and bulletins from news agency printouts, by the way you ca judge length.  Ending a broadcast on the dot, having everything run smoothly, selecting a running order that makes sense, knowing instinctively what you can and cannot do.  Professionalism.
L448686 +++$+++ u7116 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ My real father?  Well, he was a flashback.
L448685 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Too bad.  What did your father do?
L448684 +++$+++ u7116 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Good theory.  But I like my mother. I have no aversions to what she does.
L448683 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ You don't like flashbacks because your mother's a historian.
L448682 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Really?  I thought those long flashbacks were extremely good.
L448681 +++$+++ u7116 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ And the shape of it all.  It was sort of...shapeless.
L448680 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Oh, but he was terrific.
L448679 +++$+++ u7116 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ And I didn't like that man.
L448678 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ I couldn't bear for it to end.
L448677 +++$+++ u7116 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I think it went on rather too long.
L448676 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ I thought it was tremendous.
L448675 +++$+++ u7116 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
L448674 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ What did you think of that Wadja film?
L448616 +++$+++ u7116 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ No, it's all right.  I can get a cab.  Night night.
L448615 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Can I give you a lift?
L448613 +++$+++ u7116 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Yes, that's right.  I'm being terribly rude.  Bob?  Oh, Bob. This is Bob Tuckett.  Bon was at Oxford too.
L448612 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Thank you.  We met last week, at the Wajda film.  You won't remember. We didn't actually speak.
L448611 +++$+++ u7116 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Was that your chapter, then?  It was very good.
L448601 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ That's her.
L448600 +++$+++ u7116 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ So it's all worked out perfectly...
L449115 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ I've known Susan for more than fifteen years.  James, we're old allies.
L449114 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ You're a piece of shit
L449113 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ It might have worked.  Really.  I would have been delighted for you if it had.  But she wasn't interested.  Not my fault.
L449112 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ My God.  You even cooked up that Norfolk trip.
L449111 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ And you were obviously getting nowhere with her.  I was waiting for the right moment to tell you that.
L449110 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Fuck off.
L449109 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ Susan and I are very old friends, James.
L449100 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Are you up to something?
L449099 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ Big mistake, I think.  You might have learned a lot.
L449098 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Yes, finally.
L449097 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ Six onion bajees!  Great girl.  Did you shake the mother off?
L449060 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ I'm not sure.
L449059 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ Still in love?
L448923 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ I'll ring you.
L448922 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ I'm off.  Let's meet.  You promised to tell me about Norfolk.
L448921 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Perhaps I will, then.
L448918 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Will it be fun?
L448917 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ Delivering gossip and goodwill. It seems we'll both be doing Brighton.  Perhaps you should come too.
L448916 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Sorry.  Got held up.  What are you doing here?
L448915 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ Fortunate that I was here to keep Susan entertained.
L448799 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ Tame those rights...you know, we're even freighting in a couple of exiled Argie trade unionists from Paris for a TV tie in.  One of them had his balls tap-danced on by the secret police.  The other one had to be hosed off the wall of his cell after the police-- yes my good man?
L448798 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Hold those rights.
L448797 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ On the torture of very small children, but don't start telling them about their rights--
L448796 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ The torture of small children--
L448795 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ Well, everyone's desperate for a new Falkland's angle.  Purdy's come up with a real dog.  Worker's rights in Argentina.  So I've been running round getting people to do things.  But no one's keen.  Workers rights.  When did anyone on that paper give a damn about workers rights?  I said to Purdy, "Look, tits, bingo, jingo, horoscope, sport, celebs, gossip and the occasional firm stand on--"
L448794 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ What have you been up to?
L448793 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ Far too long.
L448792 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.
L448791 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ That's enough of that.
L448751 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ No need to thank me, if you don't want to.  Just pay for these drinks.
L448750 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ You've really got it all worked out, haven't you?
L448749 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ According to this, the daughter goes up to stay quiet often.  You'll need to get yourself invited for the right weekend.
L448748 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Ha ha...
L448747 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ She's very nice, apparently.  Lives in Norfolk.  And very left-wing. You'll have to watch yourself there.
L448746 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ You're so gross.
L448745 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ It's obvious what you have to do. Your way into the daughter's pants is through the mother, up the Suez canal...
L448744 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Mmm...
L448743 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ She's never written a book in it, but she clearly knew a lot.
L448742 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ Ah, ah.  There's more.  The piece celebrates the undying affection between eminent left-wing historian and he dazzling daughter.  Then the news editor, who happened to be in the room, said that years ago, when he worked on The Guardian, Anne Barrington had written a very good piece on...guess...Suez.  It was 1966, the tenth anniversary.
L448741 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Let me see.
L448740 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ ...an innocent interest, and found out that last year Vogue ran a series called 'Mothers and Daughters' Number seven, Anne and Susan Barrington.  Being a decent loving friend I went to the files and made a copy for you.
L448739 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Oh yes.
L448738 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ You're so hard.  All right then. I was chatting to some people from the diary page, and the name of Barrington came up.  I expressed an interest...
L448737 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Jeremy, just let me see what you've got.
L448736 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ Get way.  You'll see when I'm ready. First I want you to reflect on my noble behaviour, on how your interests are closest to my heart, how I lay awake at night worrying--
L448735 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Let me see.
L448734 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ You approve!
L448733 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ It's shit.
L448732 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ Uh-huh.  Tell me what you think of this first.
L448731 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Come on.  Hand over.
L448730 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ Now, top secret file.
L448729 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ The Argies.
L448728 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ And the Argies.
L448727 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ To the Fleet.
L448726 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ To the Fleet.
L448713 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ Name so Susie Barrington.  Daughter of the eminent historian, Anne Barrington, step-daughter of the scandalous Matthew Byrd the acclaimed sack-artist...
L448712 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Bastard.
L448709 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ No jokes.  James is in love.
L448708 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ C'mon.  I don't want any Jones about this.
L448703 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ We were just chortling over that. Blasé and epicene.  It perfectly describes the new Foreign Secretary. So--I hope you don't mind, Edward, I pinched it for my piece today.
L448702 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Blasé and epicene.
L448597 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Nonsense.
L448596 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ One or two.  A grey lot.  Some social democrats.  Some diligent anti-communists.  A political section man from the US Embassy. And this exquisite Californian wine, courtesy of the CIA.
L448595 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Not yet you know any of these people?
L448594 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ Any sign of the goddess Barrington?
L448593 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ To the airlift.
L448592 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ To the airlift.
L448591 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Not here.
L448828 +++$+++ u7117 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ They don't count.
L448827 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ What about the Cromwells?
L448826 +++$+++ u7117 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ It goes from Henry VIII.  Henry VIII, Edward IV, Mary, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles I, Charles II, James II, William and Mary, Ann, George I, II, III and IV, Victoria, Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII, George IV, Elizabeth II.
L448825 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ All right.
L448824 +++$+++ u7117 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Do you want to hear my list of English Kings and Queens?
L448823 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Suez.  1956.
L448822 +++$+++ u7117 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ What period?
L448821 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Not at all.  History.
L448820 +++$+++ u7117 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Have you come to talk about me?
L448819 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Oh, I see.
L448818 +++$+++ u7117 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ She's not my mother, anyway.  My mother's in Italy.
L448817 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Okay, I will.
L448816 +++$+++ u7117 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Why not sit down and wait?
L448815 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Thanks.
L448814 +++$+++ u7117 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ She said awfully sorry, make yourself comfortable, she won't be long. .
L448813 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ I'm waiting for your mother.
L448812 +++$+++ u7117 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Hello.
L448811 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Hello.
L449033 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Next time tell her I've gone away.
L449032 +++$+++ u7115 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ PHILIP +++$+++ I'm terribly sorry.  He doesn't seem to be here ... No ... Yes, if I see him, I will. .. Goodbye. She's going to phone back.
L449031 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ I'm not here.
L449030 +++$+++ u7115 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ PHILIP +++$+++ It's that lady from Norfolk again.
L448775 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Terrific.
L448774 +++$+++ u7115 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ PHILIP +++$+++ Fifteen news items.  I got exactly the same running order as the bulletin desk.  They're all old pros.
L448773 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Not bad.
L448772 +++$+++ u7115 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ PHILIP +++$+++ Take a look at these.
L448771 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Wait...and with talks at the United Nations still making little progress, tension and anxiety settled on MPs of all parties in Westminster.  Speaking on the Jimmy Young Show earlier today, Mrs Thatcher said the prospects of a peaceful solution did not look encouraging.  What is it?
L448673 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ I'll ring you in the next couple of days.
L448672 +++$+++ u7114 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ MR. PENFIELD +++$+++ The bed's all made up if you want to stay.
L448671 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ I've got to be going.  I've got a meeting tonight.
L448670 +++$+++ u7114 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ MR. PENFIELD +++$+++ Or a beer.  I've got some in.
L448669 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ No, thanks Dad.
L448668 +++$+++ u7114 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ MR. PENFIELD +++$+++ Now, are you going to have some more tea?
L448667 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Yes, you said.
L448666 +++$+++ u7114 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ MR. PENFIELD +++$+++ And Joe Ramage - do you remember him?  He comes and helps out in the shop.
L448665 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ That's good.
L448664 +++$+++ u7114 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ MR. PENFIELD +++$+++ Everyone's been marvellous really, Jimmy.  The neighbours come and sit with her while I'm at work.
L448658 +++$+++ u7114 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ MR. PENFIELD +++$+++ Oh she knows you're very busy, especially now, with everything going on...the doctor said to try her on solids, but she's been right off her food...You take this up to her.  Tell her you made it.  She'll like that.
L448657 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ I'm sorry about Saturday, Dad.  It was just impossible to get away.
L448656 +++$+++ u7114 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ MR. PENFIELD +++$+++ Well, she doesn't complain much. You know what she's like.  She keeps asking when you're coming...
L448655 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ So how is she?
L448654 +++$+++ u7114 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ MR. PENFIELD +++$+++ Come into the kitchen.  I'm just making your mother's tea.
L448653 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Dad.
L448652 +++$+++ u7114 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ MR. PENFIELD +++$+++ Hello, Jimmy.
L449058 +++$+++ u7113 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ No, no, let me go on before you get the wrong idea.  Ann and I have kept to our separate bedrooms for the last three years.  And I can't imagine that Susan hasn't hinted at the kind of life I lead in London.  I'm not telling you how to run your affairs.  I'm just saying ... I don't mind.  I'm giving you permission.
L449057 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Now listen...
L449056 +++$+++ u7113 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ You weren't really interested in Suez at all.  Incredibly enough, you were interested in my wife.
L449055 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ She said that?
L449054 +++$+++ u7113 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Susan told me that your visits to Norfolk had ... well, an ulterior motive.
L449051 +++$+++ u7113 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ In fact it's the invention of an advertising campaign they ran in the early sixties to encourage people to eat in pubs.  A completely successful fabrication of the past, the Ploughman's Lunch was.
L449050 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ U-huh.
L449049 +++$+++ u7113 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Ploughman's Lunch.  Traditional English fare.
L449048 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ I dunno.  Ploughman's Lunch.
L449047 +++$+++ u7113 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ What would you call it?
L449046 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ Yes.
L449045 +++$+++ u7113 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ I'll tell you another thing.  We might have led the world once into the Industrial Revolution, now we lead with television commercials. We're the best, it's as simple as that.  Even the Americans will admit it now ... the camera work, the acting, the scripts, special effects.  We've got the lot.  Nearly all the good directors here have ambitions to make serious films.  That food you're eating.
L449023 +++$+++ u7113 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Well, it's worth seeing.
L449022 +++$+++ u7111 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JAMES +++$+++ No.
L449021 +++$+++ u7113 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ I just might give you a ring when we get back to London.  There's one or two things I'd like to... Will you let me have your number before you leave?  Have you ever watched a commercial being made?
L449095 +++$+++ u7116 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ No, he wasn't.  He just lowered himself into a bar stool and said...  'Oo I do feel bad.  I 'ad three pints of lager and six onion bajees!'
L449094 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ Then one of them was sick all over your new dress.
L449093 +++$+++ u7116 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ It's true!  I was here last year doing a piece, remember?  I was in the bar with all these Northern trade unionists and their sponsored MPs.  They were all incredibly fat and beery, huge trousers and braces. And so sweet.  They all stood round me like children saying 'You! Working for television?  You're just a young thing.'  They wouldn't let me buy drinks even when I told them the programme was paying. They kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying  'Oo, can I?'
L449092 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ It's because he desires you.  The women get all the breaks at these conferences.
L449091 +++$+++ u7116 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ It was incredible.  He came back, made a pompous little bow and said, 'My dear girl you may film me all afternoon if you wish.' And he's promised not to talk to the Press.
L449076 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ Promise.
L449075 +++$+++ u7116 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Promise?
L449074 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ We'll see what we can do.
L449072 +++$+++ u7116 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Oh, yes!  Where's mine?  I want to look like you.
L449071 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ You'd look naked without one.
L449070 +++$+++ u7116 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ What have you got there?
L449066 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ Voila!
L449065 +++$+++ u7116 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Don't point it at James!
L449063 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ They won't let you in without one.
L449062 +++$+++ u7116 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Oh no!
L449061 +++$+++ u7112 +++$+++ m476 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ Darling Susan.  You look like an angel.  But where's your hat?
