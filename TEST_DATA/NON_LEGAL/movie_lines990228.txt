L460427 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ He's a nice boy, you'd like him. He wants to be a fireman.
L460426 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Well, it was a silly question.
L460425 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Well, Mr. Hillyer, Billy's very poor, he don't have no money and there wasn't no place else to go.
L460424 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ And what, may I ask, was Billy doing here?
L460423 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Well, it's Billy.
L460422 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ And who, Rose, may I ask, is that?
L460421 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Where is he? Where have you got him hid?  Ah, ha!
L460420 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ There ain't nobody here, Mr. Hillyer! Honest, there ain't!
L460406 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L460405 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I mean a human investment, Rose, we care about you, you matter to us. But we have innocent and unformed children in this house and the monkey and dog show has got to stop. Do you hear me?
L460295 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yes, air.
L460294 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
L460293 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I didn't mean to bite him, I really didn't.
L460292 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I have to go back to the hotel. I'm on duty at the desk and who knows a quest might arrive. I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
L460291 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I didn't mean to bite him. He was hitting Horton with a blackjack in the meanest way and... and I bit him accidental.
L460287 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Well, I don't know what happened. They were arguin' about baseball, then all of 'em started fightin'. As for that policeman, I didn't bite him, I don't think I bit him.
L460286 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ That's all you've got to say, you've got a bad cold?
L460285 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I got an awful bad cold.
L460273 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Oh, no, sir.
L460272 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange voices in the night, Rose.
L460271 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Boy, for four or five days there I didn't think I'd live. But I'm my old self again!
L460270 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Well, I know it, I just got the bill for it.
L460269 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Wonderful. Except I can touch the place back there with my tongue, I wouldn't even know I had that tooth pulled.
L460268 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Good morning, Rose. And how do you feel today?
L460244 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L460243 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance.  But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?
L460242 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L460241 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Darlin', I'll take a taxi to the hotel. You and Brother can handle the girl's epizootics. I'll just say one more thing.  Rose, I told you you had a friend in Mrs. Hillyer, didn't I, that she would fight for you like a tiger?
L460232 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I'm not hungry.
L460231 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your cornflakes!
L460230 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Ohhh-hh, ohhh...
L460215 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Now Rose, stop behaving as if you're Bo Peep. Those men had a flight last night because of some female in this house, and it wasn't Dolly or Mrs. Hillyer.
L460214 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L460213 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Strange voices, Rose?
L460212 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yes, Mr. Hillyer, it was. I... I heard strange voices in the night.
L460211 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Well, Rose, my sleep was a little disturbed last night, and so was Mrs. Hillyer's, and so was the children's. How about you? Was your sleep disturbed, too?
L460146 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ It'll do just fine.  Bye-bye, see you later.
L460145 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Is this ill right?
L460144 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Oh, I'll just mosey around here and there.
L460143 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ You don't know where you're going?
L460142 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Oh, anywhere downtown.
L460141 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Where do you want me to let you out, Rose?
L460136 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yes, sir. I had to go to the bathroom.
L460135 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ You were up late last night, too, Rose.
L460130 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ My rose. It's kind of like a motto. People will say, there comes Rose with her rose.
L460129 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ What have you got in your hair, girl?
L460104 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ There are more on the other side.
L460103 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ How can the buttons stand the pressure?
L460102 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Well, it has buttons.
L460101 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ That's a pretty stylish skirt, Rose. The only thing I don't understand is how did you ever get it on.
L460091 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Um-hmmuhh. I never drink a whole cup, my nerves can't stand the caffeine. Ehh-hh, Lord awful insomnia in reverse last night. Lay there and sweated blood for hours.
L460090 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens.
L460089 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ If you've got time before you go "out," get me a half-a-cup of coffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a half-a-cup.
L460088 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You're so sweet.
L460085 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yeah. I'm goin' out.
L460084 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Got yourself up?
L460083 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Nothin'. I got myself up, that's all.
L460027 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Well, good night.
L460026 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ No, sir.
L460025 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Is anything wrong?
L460024 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
L460023 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Rose, what are you doing up?
L459935 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Do you know what a friend you have got there? Do you know she would fight for you like a tiger, that she would fly to your defense in an instant with all the courage in her soul if anyone tried to hurt you? Is this any way to repay her trust and love? Are you ashamed as I am ashamed?  Don't cry, honey, don't cry. But let me warn you, damn your hide, this is Thermopylae and I am standing here. Do you hear me, damn you. I am standing at Thermopylae and the Persians shall not pass! Now get your tail out of here and go wash those dishes, and stop crying!
L459934 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Oh, I know. She's so sweet, she's been so good to me...
L459933 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Rose, Rose, Rose, you poor miserable little child, don't you know I love you? Do I have to put my hand on your body or kiss your pretty lips to prove it? You are beautiful to me, Rose, I've loved you since you first came here, darlin'. And don't you know Mrs. Hillyer loves you, too, that she's already taken you into her heart, and that that woman's heart is as wide as the blue sky itself and as deep as the stars?
L459930 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Oh-h, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mr. Hillyer... I just... couldn't help myself. I'm sorry...
L459929 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Goddamn you, girl! You've made me make a fool out of myself, damn your hide, but let me tell you I am standing at the pass of Thermopylae and I won't budge! The very idea, my own home with children in the house, to say nothing of my wife -- oh-h, you had better believe I am standing at Thermopylae, you little nut, you had better believe it! What are you, crazy? A man is supposed to be a fool like this, but a woman is supposed to have some control and sense! Are you a nitwit? What's the matter with you?
L459907 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Calm down, Rose, let's calm down and discuss it ...
L459906 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Don't make me... me... me... get up!
L459905 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ All right, all right. Now calm down, Rose, the children will hear you. Calm down, let's talk... about this thing, let's discuss it.
L459904 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ No, no! You don't understand, I love you! It's real love and I can't help it! Please kiss me, Mr. Hillyer, I love you, I love you so much...
L459903 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Why, I'm not going to kiss you, you crazy girl. Now I'm telling you again, get off my lap. Come on, Rose, get up. Now you get up, I say, and stop this!
L459902 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yes, crazy about you! Kiss me, Mr. Hillyer!
L459901 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Ahh-hem! Now, Rose, get off my lap. What are you doing, girl? Are you crazy?
L459884 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I... I'll get the grits.
L459883 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Rosebird Baby, you are the light of my life, darlin'. How did we ever get by without you?
L459882 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Oh, I don't know, I... I...
L459881 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Rosebaby Blossom, these are the most delicious candied yams I ever ate! Why, they just melt in my mouth. And this fried chicken is fit for a king. How do you do it, Peachbird? What is the secret of your art, Plum Blossom, huh?
L459800 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L459799 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ All right. Now as head of this household I have a couple of remarks to make. It is my dear wife's belief, which I accept although I do not totally grasp it, that to hire a person to do household work is a criminal practice. Therefore, you are here not as a servant, you are here as a friend, as a guest and hopefully as a member of this family. You will eat your meals with us, you will share life itself with us -- in love and harmony, dear Rosebud, in love and harmony. Do you understand me?
L459798 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L459766 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ Oh, to hell with it, never mind. Don't tell her anything. Don't even tell her you saw me.  Got to run, Buddy, I'll miss my plane.
L459765 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ What do you want me to tell her, Dave?
L459764 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ You might see her. She writes your Daddy, and she and that doctor came to see him, didn't they? I wish you'd tell her something... I never could write letters.
L459762 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Dave, I haven't seen Rose for years.
L459761 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ Ah-h, if you happen to run into Rose sometime... do me a favor, give her a message for me, will you?
L459760 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Yeah, I'll do that, Dave.
L459759 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ Well, got to get a plane to Savannah. Great running into you, Buddy. Give my best to your Daddy.
L459757 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Yeah, I remember it.
L459756 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ She used to call me Mr. Right. Remember that, Buddy?
L459755 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Yeah, it took her a while to grow up and find Mr. Right, but she did it. She found him.
L459754 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ You loved her, didn't you. Well, so did I.  You'll have to admit she had four husbands.
L459753 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Dave Schapiro is no horse doctor and Rose has been a good wife to him for a long time. To call her a nymphomaniac is the most stupid thing I ever heard in my life.
L459752 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ I don't want to start no fight with you, Buddy. Why do you say I'm full of shit?
L459751 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Dave, you are as full of shit as a Christmas turkey and you know it. Now if you want to start a fight on this plane and get yourself in jail, go right ahead. But I am telling you, you are full of shit right up to your eyeballs.
L459750 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ She didn't marry him, though, later she married another guy and went to Winston-Salem. It didn't last That girl couldn't have no lastin' marriage, she left him and married another dumb sucker and went out west. Little bitch left him, too, and you know what she's married to right now?  A kike. That's right, some kind of kike horse doctor named Schapiro out in Seattle, who's got the nerve to have the same first name I got. Wouldn't you know it, Rose would wind up married to a goddamn kike? She was always out of her friggin' head and I'll tell you why.  Buddy, she was sick in her mind and between her legs, too. She was a nymphomaniac.
L459749 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ She's te reason -- cured me of women once and for all. Oh, I got rid of her, Buddy, I didn't waste no time kickin' that bitch out. Hell, she was screwin' everybody in Savannah. I caught her in a motel with this long tall son of a bitch and boy did I beat the everlastin' piss out of him!
L459748 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Well, no, I didn't actually.
L459747 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ Doubted my ability all along, the little bitch. I never remarried, Buddy, you know that, don't you?
L459746 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Um-m, well...
L459745 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ That's correct -- outside it, not in it. As for the job, well, the Jewboy suppliers give me a lot of grief and we use a pile of niggers to haul and tote and they ain't worth a sorry-ass damn.  But I can build anything, Buddy. Give me the plans and I can build a goddamn staircase to the moon. It's a fact, I can build anything...  ... but she never believed that. Oh, hell, no, she never believed in me.
L459744 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ I see. Outside it.
L459743 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ Near Alexandria. It isn't in Alexandria, it is outside it.
L459742 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Tell me about that job in Alexandria, Dave, the big motel you're building.
L459740 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ She has other things to do, Dave.
L459739 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ Took your time gettin' here.
L459737 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ Hey, girl! Hey, you, give us another drink!  Dumb little bitch, supposed to give us two in the first place.
L459736 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ That's right, Dave, I'm headed for Glenville on a whisperin' jet.
L459735 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy, always jokin' around. Almost as much of a joker as your Daddy.  I saw your Daddy a coupla years ago, I was up in Glenville lookin' at a motel site. I guess that's where you're headed, huh, to see him?
L459734 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Well, actually, we have a little black boy named Her---t who lives in the garage. He does it for me.
L459733 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ I don't mean that the way it sounds.  Imagine it, a book. And I used to know you personal way back when.  Tell me something, Buddy, how do you dream up all that stuff?
L459732 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Oh, yeah?
L459731 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ How about that. Well, you always were a screwball.
L459730 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Page proof of a book I'm working on.
L459729 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ Galley what?
L459728 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Galley proof.
L459727 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ Ha ha, course you make a lot more.  What's that you got there, Buddy?
L459725 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ Oh, it's all right, beats Jew York. But the niggers have took it over, just like every other city we got, only worse.
L459724 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Well, that's interesting, Dave. I always liked Washington, it's a pretty town.
L459723 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ Well, I am in the construction business, Buddy, and without braggin' I have done real good at it.  There are those who wouldn't have expected that out of me.  Right now I'm buildin' a giant motel unit near Alexandria, outside Washington, D.C. Not fi-nance, I'm on the construction side.
L459722 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Oh. Oh, God. Of course, Dave, how are you?
L459721 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie, don't you remember me?
L459720 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see...
L459719 +++$+++ u7222 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DAVE WILKIE +++$+++ Awww-rr, Buddy, come on, you know me!
L459718 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Excuse me... your voice is familiar and I'm sure I know you from somewhere...
L460629 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ I don't know. I think he's cryin'!
L460628 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ What's the matter with him?
L460094 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ I'm only trying to help him, Mother.
L460093 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ You mustn't be a tattletale, dear. You mustn't be Delilah-ish and Jezebel-ish toward your brother, dear.
L460092 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ Daddy, Buddy was up late last night reading little dirty comic books. Mother gave him a dose of castor oil and he cursed it, he took the Lords name in vain, then claimed he hadn't said it. He lied, Daddy.
L460032 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ Mother, Buddy says Rose got in his bed last night and he fiddled with her and she snorted and had a fit -- and he says I would too if I was grown-up. Is it true, Mother -- would I sweat and snort and froth at the mouth and have a horrible fit like he says?
L460031 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Yes, dear, what is it?
L459791 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Daddy wouldn't hear that. Now the redhaired boy you see sitting there, of course you have met him, he is my oldest son and my most brilliant child. All children have great creative powers, but I don't want to rattle on about my children, they say I brag too much about them, especially about Brother. Am I boring you, Rose?
L459790 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ I don't like that, either, it's worse than Waski. I want to be called Fran.
L460560 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Let him be guided not by my wishes and not by Rose's wishes, although I am sure they are identical. Let him be guided by the wishes of the creative power of life itself, because that is what has spoken through me tonight.
L460559 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ Actually of course I won't operate, I don't do major surgery. Dr. Hardy will operate and of course he'll be guided by your wishes in this respect.
L460558 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I understand you perfectly. You leave that girl alone, you wretched man, or you will be sorry.
L460557 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.
L460556 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I will not cry like a woman. If I'm upset it's because of what my husband said, not because of you. You can't make me cry like a woman, a woman has got just as much intelligence and self-control as a man. And you get this in your head. If you hurt that girl, I'll hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got, I'll do my level best to ruin you. Do you understand me?
L460545 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ You'd go so far as to mutilate a helpless girl who has no means to defend herself, you'd go that far? Don't you think I know what you've just said and don't you think I understand the dreadful and revolting crime you've just conspired to commit?
L460544 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ Illusions, Madam?
L460543 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Are you human beings or are you some kind of male monsters? Is there no limit to which you won't go to keep your illusions about yourselves?
L460540 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ Mrs. Hillyer, this girl is sick in more ways than one. She is an extreme psychoneurotic with uncontrollable sexual impulses. It would be a mercy to spare her the suffering she causes herself and others. Therefore I recommend as a therapeutic measure the removal of her second ovary. It is ethically and medically the only proper decision in this case and I suspect your husband agrees with me.
L460539 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ What are you talking about? I don't understand all this mumbo jumbo and the funny looks on your faces.
L460531 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ I am thinking particularly of the other ovary. As a rule I don't believe in removing it. The woman's hormonal system is profoundly disturbed, she is subject to possibly serious depression, she loses many of her secondary sexual characteristics for example, her breasts might shrink and become flabby, facial hair might appear along with a coarsening of the features, and of course her sexual drive is greatly diminished, especially in a girl or young woman. For these reasons I am opposed to removing the other ovary, as a rule. Do you follow me?
L460530 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Yes, go on.
L460526 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ What do you mean, what kind of gobbledygook talk is that?
L460525 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ I'm sorry the truth nauseates you, Mrs. Hillyer, because before you leave there's a bit more of it I'd like to put to you. This operation provides a therapeutic opportunity that I feel is quite important in regard to this particular girl, who suffers not only from an ovarian cyst but from a certain psychoneurotic condition as well.
L460516 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ She's an adult, Mrs. Hillyer, I was merely giving her the facts.
L460515 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ No, you shouldn't have, it was needlessly cruel. She thinks she has cancer and is going to die.
L460514 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ We make our own lives, Madam. As for malignancy, I don't think so, it's very unlikely. I probably shouldn't have even mentioned that possibility to her.
L460513 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Well, that's pathetic. Poor Rose, what a life she has had.
L460512 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ Don't worry, Madam, she can't infect your dear little kiddies. She long ago fully recovered, but the disease did irreparable damage. The girl is permanently barren.
L460511 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Gonorrhea?
L460510 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ I'm not surprised you thought she was pregnant. An ovarian cyst can look very much like pregnancy. But it was pure wishful thinking on her part. The girl can never have children, she had gonorrhea at fifteen and it was untreated.
L460364 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Yes. Well. She's upstairs.
L460363 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ Let me be the judge of that, Madam.
L460362 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Oh, good evening, Doctor. Rose is a lot better, I just gave her her supper. She's almost all well now.
L460344 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ I beg your pardon, epi-zoo-tics? Do you mean "epi-zoo-ot-tics," an animal epidemic?
L460343 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Yes, thank you, Doctor.
L460338 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ It is kind of amazing. The dentist says she has perfect teeth, there isn't a cavity in her mouth.
L460337 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ It's simply that I find it incredible, Mr. Hillyer. Aside from the girl's illness at the moment, she is very strong, a very healthy specimen of a young human female -- and a comely one, too. She must have gotten protein somewhere as a young child, if only sporadically.
L460334 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ Exactly, and that's why she couldn't possibly have come from such a farm.
L460333 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Well, her people were very poor. She says she was often hungry as a child, and I'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful, not a balanced diet at all.
L460332 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ A tenant farm? Are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt?
L460331 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Deathly afraid of it. Her people were poor tenant farmers and she doesn't know anything about doctors or medicine or hospitals.
L460330 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ Afraid of the hospital?
L460329 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ She hid it from us, Doctor. She's afraid of the hospital.
L460328 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ Of course she does and I must say I'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital. I should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill.
L460327 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ She looks terrible, just awful.
L460326 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ Well, Mrs. Hillyer, the girl is strong as an ox and that is what is keeping her alive. But not many people walk away from double pneumonia, Madam, not many.
L460263 +++$+++ u7225 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. WINTON +++$+++ I think you're right, it would be harder on her. But you'd better call Mr. Hillyer, she's going to need help to get home.
L460262 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ That would scare her to death. She's terrified of hospitals. To her, a hospital is where you go to die.
L460261 +++$+++ u7225 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. WINTON +++$+++ Yes, and it's very bad. It probably should be done at the hospital under general anesthesia.
L460260 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ But the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled?
L460259 +++$+++ u7225 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. WINTON +++$+++ Well, she has one mouth in ten thousand, I don't see teeth like that once in ten years. Her trouble is an impacted wisdom tooth, but there isn't a cavity in her head, not a single one. She has perfect teeth.
L460258 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ She was raised on a poor dirt farm. I'm sure she's never seen a dentist or hardly even a doctor.
L460257 +++$+++ u7225 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. WINTON +++$+++ Well, she finally let me look in her mouth. Is it true she's never been to a dentist?
L460562 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ No, Waski, she won't die, because we are praying for her.
L460561 +++$+++ u7228 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WASKI +++$+++ Mother... is Rose going to die?
L459789 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ There are plenty of girls who would give thousands of dollars to have your auburn hair. Beauty is beauty and that's all there is to it. Beauty is there and we have to recognize it. Now Rose, the little girl sitting across from you with the blue eyes is Doll Baby. She looks like an angel and she is an angel, but she can be a naughty angel sometimes, although her father won't believe it. Her real name is Frances, but we call her Dolly or Doll.
L459788 +++$+++ u7228 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WASKI +++$+++ Oh, Mother, cut it out.
L459787 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ When he was baby we called him "Wa Wa," a baby name, you know. You will find him a very good boy. His brother can be bad and so can his sister, but Waski is a very good boy. And as you can see he's beautiful.
L459786 +++$+++ u7228 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WASKI +++$+++ You can stop it right now.
L459785 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Rose, this is Waski. His real name is Warren but we call him Waski. He doesn't like it much and I suppose someday we'll have to stop calling him that.
L460610 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ And who do you suppose he is? That policeman who arrested me, the one I bit! He is Mr. Right!
L460609 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Well... well, that's wonderful, Rose.
L460608 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You'll never guess what happened!  I have met Mr. Right! I been with him all day and he loves me, I know he does, he loves me and he's going to marry met Be's practi'cly ast me already!
L460579 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Forget about it, I don't want you working in one of those honky tonks.
L460578 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I was offered that job as a waitress.
L460577 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Don't worry, honey, you'll find something.
L460498 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I don't mind.
L460497 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Rose, you don't have to.
L460482 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Oh, I know. But I didn't, really. Honestly, I didn't. There was only one, but he's out of town and leave no forwardin' address.
L460481 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Rose, really, you shouldn't act like that.
L460480 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Oh-h, Mrs. Hillyer, I... I can't think. I... I'm not really sure.
L460475 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I know it's embarrassing... but who were you exposed to, dear? ROSE Well, now, Mrs. Hillyer, I... ah-h, that's kinda hard to say.
L460474 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Well, I... I... I don't know... maybe it was... but no, you can't be sure about a thing like that. It wasn't Billy, I didn't know him.
L460440 +++$+++ u7227 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I'm not hungry. I can't eat nothin', I haven't been able to eat since I got fired. I think maybe I'm sick.
L460439 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Rose, you don't look well and you haven't eaten a bit of breakfast.
