L309222 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ We quarreled. She never dared get angry or frightened -- but I said things to her -- it was an attack, I know it was.
L309221 +++$+++ u6035 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ THEA +++$+++ It was, the plague
L309220 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ Suppose, she isn't dead. Suppose it was a cataleptic attack?
L309219 +++$+++ u6035 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ THEA +++$+++ She is dead — at peace.
L309218 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ When I close my eyes, I see Miss Wollsten. I can't think of anything else.
L309217 +++$+++ u6035 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ THEA +++$+++ You should sleep, Cathy. Lie down and close your eyes. Try to forget everything.
L308927 +++$+++ u6035 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ THEA +++$+++ I will let him go. He is dead to me as he is to all my mother's people. I turn my hand against him.
L308926 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ That should decide it or you --
L308925 +++$+++ u6035 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ THEA +++$+++ I felt he did not like me.
L308923 +++$+++ u6035 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ THEA +++$+++ I don't know. As a child. I longed for a father and now —- I don't know ——
L308922 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ Come, Thea, if you're going to claim him as your father you've got to make up your mind. They'll be leaving any minute.
L308921 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ The General — you don't even know him.
L308920 +++$+++ u6035 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ THEA +++$+++ But one must love a father.
L308919 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ Thea, your choice is a very simple one. Either you want to claim him as your father, or you do not.
L308907 +++$+++ u6035 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ THEA +++$+++ My last name is Pherides.
L308906 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ I have forgotten it, dear.
L308905 +++$+++ u6035 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ THEA +++$+++ You have forgotten my last name?
L308904 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ What is it -- what are you talking about?
L308903 +++$+++ u6035 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ THEA +++$+++ I do not know him, but I have seen him.
L308902 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ Thea -- you're hiding something. Why do you suddenly speak of your father? You told me once you had never seen him -- didn't know him --
L308901 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ Why, I love my father because - because I do. Of course, he's nice to me.
L308900 +++$+++ u6035 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ THEA +++$+++ I mean, does one love a father because he is good and kind -—or just because he is one's father?
L308899 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ What an odd question!
L308898 +++$+++ u6035 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ THEA +++$+++ Cathy —- how does it feel to have a father?
L308864 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ Thea is an orphan.
L308863 +++$+++ u6035 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ THEA +++$+++ You are fortunate in your father.
L308842 +++$+++ u6035 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ THEA +++$+++ And the soldier -- He looked at me so strangely -- who is he?
L308841 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ The young man, Mr. Davis, seems to be some kind of an unofficial observer —— a correspondent of some sort ——
L309173 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ Wouldn't I?
L309172 +++$+++ u6032 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ MISS WOLLSTEN +++$+++ You wouldn't tell that ——
L309171 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ When I tell him that you're unfit to live a normal life with normal people —- a cataleptic!
L309169 +++$+++ u6032 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ MISS WOLLSTEN +++$+++ You'd do anything to get Oliver away from Thea. But I'm going to stop you. I'm going to tell Mr. Davis exactly what you are.
L309168 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ Really, this is idiotic!
L309167 +++$+++ u6032 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ MISS WOLLSTEN +++$+++ You've been playing on the superstitions of that poor old man — — working at him — — turning him against Thea.
L309166 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ Would you care to explain what you're talking about?
L309165 +++$+++ u6032 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ MISS WOLLSTEN +++$+++ I've always known what an evil mind lay behind that pretty weak face of yours —— but this, Cathy -- even I would never have believed it is of you.
L309031 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ No. I mean your other secret -—	the one you kept bidden even from my father. That old doctor in London -- he told me.
L309030 +++$+++ u6032 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ MISS WOLLSTEN +++$+++ That your father and I ——
L309029 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ You will not say one single word. I know your secret.
L309028 +++$+++ u6032 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ MISS WOLLSTEN +++$+++ You're planing something, Cathy.. But I won't let you —- I'll warn them against you.
L309027 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ Why, I'm fond of Thea.
L309026 +++$+++ u6032 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ MISS WOLLSTEN +++$+++ ) But Thea -- She stands in your way. I know you. I know your little hints —— the way you can turn the truth into a lie --
L309025 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ What if he is?
L309024 +++$+++ u6032 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ MISS WOLLSTEN +++$+++ Mr. Davis seems a good prospect ——young handsome, sympathetic -- ready to listen to you and feel sorry for you - -
L309023 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ What would I be thinking?
L309022 +++$+++ u6032 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ MISS WOLLSTEN +++$+++ Didn't you? But now -- what are you thinking now?
L309021 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ You were father's secretary -— I never thought - -
L309020 +++$+++ u6032 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ MISS WOLLSTEN +++$+++ Your father loved me.  He wanted to marry me. But he was afraid of hurting the gentle, delicate Cathy. You spoiled his life ——you've ruined mine ——
L309019 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ How do you know what my father thought - -
L309018 +++$+++ u6032 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ MISS WOLLSTEN +++$+++ Your father knew it too. But he was never sure how much was pretense.
L309017 +++$+++ u6032 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ MISS WOLLSTEN +++$+++ You and your mysterious illness. A new attack everytime you are crossed — everytime you can't get your own way.
L309016 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ Miss Wollsten!
L309015 +++$+++ u6032 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ MISS WOLLSTEN +++$+++ They were talking about the Vrykolakas this morning. Cathy, that's what you are —— a weak, pale, half-dead thing that drains all the life and joy from those who want to live.
L309014 +++$+++ u6029 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ CATHY +++$+++ Whet do you mean?
L309013 +++$+++ u6032 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ MISS WOLLSTEN +++$+++ I wish I didn't have such bitter knowledge of you, Cathy.
L309155 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ Never fear -- when you are dead you will remain dead. I will see to it that you do not walk about again. I promise you that. There is another one here who can not die. I will watch you both. Never fear.
L309154 +++$+++ u6032 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ MISS WOLLSTEN +++$+++ That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live —- I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
L309153 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ You ask that of me? You're afraid to live in your coffin. You know what that means?
L309152 +++$+++ u6032 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ MISS WOLLSTEN +++$+++ No, I want more than that. I beg you General, make sure --drive a knife through my heart -- anything.
L309151 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.
L309150 +++$+++ u6032 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ MISS WOLLSTEN +++$+++ I don't want to be buried alive. If I die I want to be sure —- quite sure.
L309149 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ I don't understand you.
L309148 +++$+++ u6032 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ MISS WOLLSTEN +++$+++ I have not had a happy life --but that one thing - - that terror which brings me awake out of deep sleep —- I want to avoid it.
L309147 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ Yes?
L309146 +++$+++ u6032 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ MISS WOLLSTEN +++$+++ I'm a woman -- a lonely woman. I have few friends.
L309144 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ He's dead enough. God rest his soul.
L309143 +++$+++ u6032 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ MISS WOLLSTEN +++$+++ Because he was a brave man - because I liked him -- I came here to be sure.
L309142 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ He sleeps quietly. He died with a wine glass in his hand -- he died laughing -- a brave man, Drossos, like his father before him.
L309141 +++$+++ u6032 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ MISS WOLLSTEN +++$+++ I wanted to be sure of something, General -- something that has always preyed on my mind. I have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in —- entombed —— imprisoned..
L309140 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ Woman, what are you doing here?
L308982 +++$+++ u6032 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ MISS WOLLSTEN +++$+++ I don't care who he is. He doesn't know.	He can't tell ——
L308981 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ This is Dr. Drossos, chief medical officer of my division.
L308980 +++$+++ u6032 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ MISS WOLLSTEN +++$+++ No. No. I won't believe it. He's not dead.
L308860 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ I will go with you.
L308859 +++$+++ u6034 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ ST. AUBYN +++$+++ This girl -- Thea —- is not a servant in my household, sir. She is my daughter's companion. Now, sir, if you'll excuse me, I'll go have a look at Mr. Jacks.
L308858 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ This girl --
L308856 +++$+++ u6034 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ ST. AUBYN +++$+++ Why -- no not before Thea came ——
L308855 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ Was she ill before that girl came into your household?
L308854 +++$+++ u6034 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ ST. AUBYN +++$+++ Nothing, really. She's been under a great strain -- the journey -- the battle --
L308853 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ What is her illness?
L308852 +++$+++ u6034 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ ST. AUBYN +++$+++ She's not too well.
L308851 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ Your daughter is ill.
L308850 +++$+++ u6034 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ ST. AUBYN +++$+++ Miss Wollsten -— my secretary, she'd know.
L308849 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ You do not know her last name -- you do not know from where she came?
L308847 +++$+++ u6034 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ ST. AUBYN +++$+++ Damn me, if I know. She's become so much a member of our household I never think of her by any name but Thea -- she has a last name --
L308846 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ Her family name?
L308845 +++$+++ u6034 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ ST. AUBYN +++$+++ Theodosia.
L308844 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ Her name is Thea?
L308843 +++$+++ u6034 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ ST. AUBYN +++$+++ I don't really know where Thea comes from. The Vice—Consul at Adrianople brought her to me..
L309239 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ She was born before your wife returned here to die. You never knew.
L309238 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ Daughter -- my daughter --
L309237 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Not Theodosia. Theodosia's daughter -- your daughter.
L309236 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ Theodosia --
L309199 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ I shall not leave the island ——
L309198 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Come —- you'll feel yourself again as soon as we get off this dismal island.
L309197 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ I have had command for the last time —-
L309055 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ When you make sense I'll listen.
L309054 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ Listen to what I say --
L309053 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ That's ridiculous -- Thea's lovely, gentle —-
L309052 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ If I told you —— you wouldn't believe me -- but this much I can tell you —— the girl is dangerous to you. Take a friend's advice -- an old man' s advice -- leave her alone -—
L309051 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ And I'm your friend —— but that doesn't explain why you are always trying to come between Thea and me?
L309050 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ You are my friend.
L309049 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ I had a notion you had become self—appointed chaperone lately — why?
L309048 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ In a way -- this girl, Thea. You must stay away from her.
L309047 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Is this what you wanted to speak to me about?
L309046 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ I don' t know. When I was gone the people from her village came to my home seeking vengeance. They bore her away with them. Months later she came back ——pale -- sick -- she died --
L309045 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ How did she die?
L309044 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ She was beautiful. There was blood between her family and my kin. But that did not stop me from taking her when I saw her beauty, nor did it stop her from loving me.
L309043 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ If she looked like Thea, she must have been beautiful.
L309042 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ Thea is so like her —— in every feature ——
L308972 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ Dr. Drossos will tell us. We will know what to do then.
L308971 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ We still don't know that it's the plague ——
L308970 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ Better no general than one carrying the plague.
L308969 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ But the war, the army —— they need you.
L308968 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ Until we know, what choice is there? We have to stay.
L308941 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ The rider on the pale horse is Pestilence. He follows the wars.
L308940 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?
L308939 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ I've seen men die drunk —- and I've seen men die of the plague.
L308929 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ We have no time for that.
L308928 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Well, at any rate, I would like to say goodbye to the girl.
L308918 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ It is not necessary to understand. We are leaving and I am thankful.
L308917 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ I can't understand that.
L308916 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ It makes me fear her.
L308915 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ But that should make you like her.
L308914 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ I know all you are going to say —-I have been saying it to myself, but the thought will not leave my mind. She resembles my wife -—there is something about her ——the way she moves —— the way she turns her head.
L308913 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Oh, now —— now look here ——
L308912 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ There is something evil about her.
L308911 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Thea?
L308910 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ I will be glad to leave this island. It has too much of that old dark world about it. I will be glad to leave it and that girl ——
L308909 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ It doesn't seem to bother you much, General.
L308908 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ You are a happy man Oliver. You have but one world to live in —- the world of today. I have two worlds. I have that old dark world of peasant ignorance and superstition in which I was brought up and a new world which the army gave me —— a world of mathematics, gun ranges,logistics, tactics, strategy.
L308792 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Maybe you've got the wrong crypt —— after all it's twenty years when you wore last here.
L308791 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ She is not there. The coffin is gone.
L308787 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ I'll only go as far as the shore and wait for you.
L308786 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ There's no one there -— nothing but the caves and the dead.
L308785 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Do you mind if I go with you?
L308783 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ You were at those battles as a spectator — — I wonder if you can think what that sound might mean to me —— those men out there —— dead or dying —— by my order -- because I willed it so.
L308782 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ I heard the same sound at Ladysmith, at Nukden, Port Arthur.  What do you expect after a battle?
L308781 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ You know that sound, Oliver?
L308779 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ In the New York Morning Globe, the man who wins victory is always a hero. -
L308778 +++$+++ u6031 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ GENERAL +++$+++ Hero?
L308777 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Why not Take the doctor's advice? You're the hero of the battle of Corphon.
L309138 +++$+++ u6035 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ THEA +++$+++ No -- you musn't. He thinks I've bewitched you. He won't believe it —- he'll hate me even more! My only chance is to stay away from him.
L309137 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Let me tell him. When he knows you are his child, he'll forget these insane notions -—
L309136 +++$+++ u6035 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ THEA +++$+++ For a moment, when he looked at me so sadly, I felt that I had wronged him. But then --
L309135 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Because she loved him.  I know him, Thea. Believe me, he is not a cruel man.
L309133 +++$+++ u6035 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ THEA +++$+++ Then why does he persecute me? My family told me what kind of man he is, how he stole my mother and then abandoned her --
L309132 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ I don't think so, Thea. He has spoken of your mother. I don't believe he knows you are his daughter.
L309131 +++$+++ u6035 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ THEA +++$+++ It is for that he hates me.
L309130 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Thea, what is this? What are you trying to tell me? "He stole your mother" —-
L309129 +++$+++ u6035 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ THEA +++$+++ It is more than a feud between two families. He stole my mother away from her people.
L309128 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ I knew that feuds still went on, but I didn't think people like you and the General would be involved.
L309127 +++$+++ u6035 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ THEA +++$+++ He hates all my race.
L309126 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Why in the world can't you?
L309125 +++$+++ u6035 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ THEA +++$+++ I can't.
L309124 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Well, tell, him.
L309123 +++$+++ u6035 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ THEA +++$+++ He keeps asking for the name of my father and mother.
L309122 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Oh, that Vrykolaka business. You mustn't be too angry with him, Thea. He's an old man and now with all this trouble —— the disappointment in not being able to lead his own army to victory -- cooped up here waiting for death - naturally his mind goes back to the things he believed when he was an ignorant lad in some mountain village.
L309121 +++$+++ u6035 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ THEA +++$+++ The General threatened me.
L309120 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Thea, what's wrong?
L309072 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ You see? Thea believes it, too!
L309071 +++$+++ u6035 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ THEA +++$+++ Please.. You shouldn't laugh --
L309038 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Don't let it trouble you. He's an old man and these last few days have been a terrible strain on him. He won't harm you.
L309037 +++$+++ u6035 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ THEA +++$+++ Sometimes when he looks at me in that strange way, I'm afraid of him.
L309036 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ What's bothering you, Thea? Is it the General?
L309035 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ Everything's so simple. I like you.
L309034 +++$+++ u6035 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ THEA +++$+++ I don't know. Everything's so mixed up --
L309033 +++$+++ u6033 +++$+++ m401 +++$+++ OLIVER +++$+++ You're crying. Why?
L311714 +++$+++ u6059 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ POTTER +++$+++ So I suppose I should give it to miserable failures like you and that idiot brother of yours to spend for me.
L311713 +++$+++ u6036 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ BAILEY +++$+++ Mr. Potter, what makes you such a hard-skulled character? You have no family –– no children. You can't begin to spend all the money you've got.
L311712 +++$+++ u6036 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ BAILEY +++$+++ Well, all right . . .
L311711 +++$+++ u6059 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ POTTER +++$+++ Are you running a business or a charity ward?
L311710 +++$+++ u6036 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ BAILEY +++$+++ But they're somebody's children.
L311707 +++$+++ u6036 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ BAILEY +++$+++ I can't do that. These families have children.
L311706 +++$+++ u6059 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ POTTER +++$+++ Then foreclose!
L311705 +++$+++ u6036 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ BAILEY +++$+++ Times are bad, Mr. Potter. A lot of these people are out of work.
L311701 +++$+++ u6036 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ BAILEY +++$+++ All I'm asking is thirty days more . . .
L311700 +++$+++ u6059 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ POTTER +++$+++ Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.
L311699 +++$+++ u6036 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ BAILEY +++$+++ I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.

L312721 +++$+++ u6037 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ BERT +++$+++ Know you? Are you kiddin'? I've been looking all over town trying to find you. I saw your car piled into that tree down there, and I thought maybe . . . Hey, your mouth's bleeding; are you sure you're all right?
L312720 +++$+++ u6045 +++$+++ m402 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Don't . . . George?
