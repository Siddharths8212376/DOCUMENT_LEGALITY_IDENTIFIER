L479604 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Sorry, no.  I just got one.
L479807 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Oh, sure.  That was a long time ago. See, she's not a man-hater at all. She's very supportive of men...
L479806 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ It's nice that they're still friends.
L479804 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ That must have made you proud.
L479803 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know.
L479802 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
L479801 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Have you listened to his morning show, "Wake up with ballplayer"?
L479626 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ No, she's talking about your hair.
L479625 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ I think you'd look good in red.
L479596 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Yep.  Maggie -- Someone to see you.
L479595 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Looking for Maggie.
L479594 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ And you are?
L479590 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Peggy Phleming.  Not the ice skater.
L479589 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ I am just such a reporter.  And you are?
L479588 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ No, about her getting that asshole from New York fired.
L479587 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ About her upcoming wedding and all.
L479586 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ It's been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview Maggie.
L479585 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ What?
L479584 +++$+++ u7370 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ PEGGY +++$+++ Are you a reporter?
L479583 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Hello.  I'm looking for Maggie Carpenter.  There was a sign at the hardware store across the street...
L480199 +++$+++ u7369 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MRS. TROUT +++$+++ Oh, come on.  You're practically family.
L480198 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Thank you.
L480197 +++$+++ u7369 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MRS. TROUT +++$+++ You should thank Lou and I for the wedding car -- a '63 Buick.
L479710 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Bye, Betty.  Thanks.
L479709 +++$+++ u7369 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MRS. TROUT +++$+++ Your two cinnamon rolls.
L479699 +++$+++ u7369 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MRS. TROUT +++$+++ -- The luau for Maggie.
L479698 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Oh, Betty.  I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing --
L479697 +++$+++ u7369 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MRS. TROUT +++$+++ Betty Trout.  Five dollars.
L479696 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Yes, I am.  And who are you?
L479666 +++$+++ u7371 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Gotta tell you this about my daughter. My daughter makes real good time, even in a long dress and heels.  Maggie may not be Hale's longest running joke, but she certainly is the fastest.
L479665 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Dad's fishing trip, Grandma's knee operation, Grandma's birthday...
L479661 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Ah, beautiful.  I just can't see her leaving multiple grooms in the dust like that.
L479660 +++$+++ u7371 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Like her mother.
L479657 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ You know, your daughter seems...
L479656 +++$+++ u7371 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Well, wedding cake freezes.  This we know.
L479655 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Gee, I hope they don't have a fight out there.  You don't think they'll call it off...?
L479649 +++$+++ u7371 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Oh, yeah.  Scared the hell out of Skipper.
L479648 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ They made me put my hat back on.
L480288 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I borrowed it from this guy I know. So?
L480287 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Pretty good speech, Maggie.
L480286 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ "I guarantee that we'll have tough times.  I guarantee  that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart -- you're the only one for me".
L480285 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ I'm listening.
L480284 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I was, because if you said "yes" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part.  And I've been practicing it.  Ready?
L480283 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ You were not.
L480277 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ This is getting serious.
L480276 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ They're mine.  I'm turning in my running shoes to you.
L480275 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Used?
L480270 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I didn't.  And you being the one at the end of the aisle didn't just fix that.
L480269 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Yes, I did.
L480268 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I think so... When I was walking down the aisle?  I was  walking toward somebody who didn't have any idea who I really was.  And it was only half the other person's fault, because I had done everything to convince him that I was exactly what he wanted.  So it was good that I didn't go through with it because it would have been a lie, but you -- you knew the real me.
L480267 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Does it matter?
L480266 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I wanted to talk to you about why I run or ride away from things.
L480265 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ You actually could make breaking and entering into a new career.  So, what are you doing here?
L480264 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ It's something I've always wanted to do.
L480263 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Livid is good.  So what is it, Maggie? You here on business?  I saw your lamps. They're terrific.
L480261 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ I don't have much choice in the matter now, do I?  But I can't speak for Italics.  Traitor!
L480260 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I've been making friends with your cat.  Is it okay that I'm here?
L480145 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ So, we'll...
L480144 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ So am I.
L480143 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I'm okay with that.
L480142 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ And the wedding date.  There's the two of us.  So, you think... maybe... You have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back.
L480141 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ And the church.
L480140 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Well, you do have the dress.
L480139 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Yes, you!
L480138 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Me?
L480137 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ To who?  Are you asking me?
L480135 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I love you, too.
L480134 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ I love you.  I love you.
L480133 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Me, either.
L480132 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ I don't know.  I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.
L480131 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Okay.  So... what, uh... What just happened?  Just now?  Jus then?  In there?
L480124 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Really?
L480123 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ A little longer for me.
L480122 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ About a minute...?
L480120 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I kissed him back.
L480119 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ I'm sorry, Bob.  She kissed me back.
L480100 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Come on, it'll give you a great view. It's perfect.  Hey.
L480099 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ I'd rather not.
L480098 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ No.  No -- Actually, let's make Ike the pastor.
L480089 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ No you don't.  You want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet. You want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem.  You want a man to wake you up at dawn because he's burning to talk to you and he can't wait another minute to find out what you'll say.  Am I right?
L480088 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Yes I do!
L480087 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ No, that's called not having a mind of your own.  What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon?  You don't want to climb Annapuma.
L480086 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ That's called changing your mind.
L480085 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ With the priest, you liked them scrambled.  With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached.  Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much.
L480084 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ What!?
L480083 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ That's right.  You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.
L480082 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Lost!
L480081 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Supportive?  You weren't being supportive.  You were being scared. Just like now.  You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on.
L480080 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand.
L480079 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress.
L480078 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Brian told you that?
L480077 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai?
L480076 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I already explained about that.
L480075 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?
L480074 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ That was very interesting research George was doing!
L480073 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Or the sexual habits of locusts?
L480072 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ It's fun!  It's high.
L480071 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Well, they should.  Because they're about to watch you hang yourself again.
L480070 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I had it under control.  Now they feel sorry for me.
L480069 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing.  It's the theme of this party.
L480068 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ You humiliated me!
L480067 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ I'm the only goddamn person in there pulling for you.
L480057 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ I don't and I don't think you should...
L480056 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Yes.
L480055 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Are you all right with this?  You think this is funny?
L480054 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Excuse me?
L480053 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ I don't know, give me a minute.  Are you all right with this?
L480044 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Missed me bad, huh?
L480043 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Where did you disappear to?
L479979 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Yes it is.  And it doesn't mean anything.
L479978 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ No.  But I think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness. Attraction is very misleading.  And if it's mutual, it's well, terribly distracting.
L479973 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Yeah.  It's kind of nice.
L479972 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Kind of isolated.
L479971 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Wrenches.  My dad's gonna love that one.
L479970 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Of what?
L479969 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ First I have to find some tools.  I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.
L479968 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Can you fix it?
L479967 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Your filter's clogged.  This takes unleaded.
L479962 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Why don't you let him sleep it off in the trunk. I'll take you for a ride. Then we'll come back for him.  Keep an eye on him.
L479961 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Watch your leg, Dad.  I'm so tired of this.
L479952 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ No -- I'm cleaning an attic.  I wouldn't attempt the impossible.
L479951 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Hmmm... Figuring out what kind of music I like and then finding me a rare album. You're not trying to soften me up, are you?
L479950 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ No.  You take it.
L479949 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ It's valuable.  Hang onto it.
L479948 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ It was in the attic.  It was jus sitting there gathering dust.
L479947 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Oh, my God -- It's Miles Davis.  This is "King of Blue"!  This is the original recording.  Hard to find in good condition.  Where did you find this?
L479940 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss.
L479939 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Ike... Hi, Grandma.
L479935 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ You know, there's no...
L479934 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Tell me.  When you get to the altar, will you spike the bouquet?
L479930 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ What was that?  I can't order  my eggs without sarcasm?
L479929 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Of course.
L479928 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I'll have the same.
L479923 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Bob will be very happy.
L479922 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Fine.  The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine.
L479921 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ You look... uh... You look fine.
L479898 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Agreed.
L479897 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Even with everything that's happened I've still never been married and I still deserve a beautiful dress.
L479893 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that?
L479892 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ No.
L479891 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ You don't know.
L479890 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ I don't know.
L479889 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Now that's romantic.  A proposal like that and you didn't find eternal bliss? What went wrong?
L479888 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ No.  I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?"
L479887 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ So?  Is that what you said to her?
L479886 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ I'm a work in progress.
L479884 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Maybe it's just me, but -- if you got to dress it up, it doesn't ring true.
L479883 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ What do you mean?  It was incredibly romantic!
L479882 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Highly suspect.
L479881 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ It was one of the most wonderful moments of my life.  Cal Ripken even applauded.
L479879 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ He's an entomologist!  I thought it was very unique.
L479878 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ It's a little "Silence of the Lambs" for me.  I can't believe you waited for the wedding to run.
L479877 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Still sweet.
L479876 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Always a mood killer.
L479874 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ What an incredible chauvinistic observation.
L479873 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Well, I'm impressed.  Absolutely incredible.  I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this isn't exactly a woman's room.
L479872 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.
L479871 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ You afraid to try?
L479870 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Maybe someday.
L479869 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ I like it.  This whole thing is pretty incredible.  I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.
L479868 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I think so.
L479865 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Cindy the manicurist.
L479864 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ It's a birthday present for my cousin. Put your finger in.
L479862 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Done.
L479861 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Six-fifty.
L479860 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Five hundred.
L479859 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Seven-fifty.
L479858 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Too much.
L479857 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.
L479856 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ You've seen the post-its.  I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?
L479855 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical?  Actually, I meant you.  You probably got severance or expenses or both.  I'll take your check. No credit cards.
L479854 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ My magazine doesn't pay because for stories.  It's not what you call ethical.
L479852 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Really.
L479851 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ My point is that one again, you're getting it all wrong.  That won't improve your reputation any, and it's not very flattering to me either.  So, I'm going to give you a chance to write the truth.
L479850 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ I'm not a boastful man.  What's your point?
L479849 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ You're welcome.  Your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction.  Your observations are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete. You must be very proud.
L479847 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ How do I do it?  I'm not that beautiful.
L479846 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ I take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers.
L479811 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Obviously, I'm not the only one who doesn't understand it.  The USS Maggie leaves quite a wake... Excuse me.
L479810 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ You misinterpret everything.  We've all been friends our whole lives.  But that's the types of relationship you wouldn't understand.
L479809 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ You can turn that finger around.
L479808 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her?
L479783 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ He is not!
L479782 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Look, look, man.  I think the man is heartbroken.
L479771 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ But the most interesting thing here is that I don't see the rose tattoo that I've heard about on your back.
L479770 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Give me that!
L479701 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ A pre-wedding luau?
L479700 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Grandma made me the cutest outfit.  I can't wait to show it to you.
L479684 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Nothing like sharing your nuptial bed with two Sherpas and a yak.
L479683 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ We think so.
L479682 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ How romantic.

L479677 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ Everest.  Is that right?
L479672 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose.  And I have no intention of doing it again.
L479671 +++$+++ u7366 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ IKE +++$+++ That's fair.
L479642 +++$+++ u7367 +++$+++ m498 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I'd love to stay and chat, but I've got to get back to work.  I still have my job.
