L459857 +++$+++ u7228 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WASKI +++$+++ I do, too.
L459856 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
L459855 +++$+++ u7228 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WASKI +++$+++ Neither do I.
L460602 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ No, she hasn't.  I think I hear a car.
L460601 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ I heard you talking. Hasn't Rose come in?
L460416 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ She's got somebody in there, Brother! His shoes are on the back porch -- there they were, naked and smiling at me!  Rose, open this door immediately!
L460415 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Daddy, what's the matter?
L460414 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Open that door, damn you!
L460401 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ And there's only one reason anybody would want this ladder -- to get up into Rose's bedroom in the dark of night! I am going to chain up this ladder and padlock it! -- and that is not all I am going to do!
L460400 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Well... maybe...
L460399 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ See, son? The paint is flaked off here, freshly. Look at it, Brother, there is no question about it. Some person or persons unknown have very recently tampered with this ladder.
L460398 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ True, but if you look sharply you can see that those marks are the marks of a ladder. Now let's go back to the garage and see if the ladder has been tampered with.
L460397 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Well, I don't know.  No, I don't know, Daddy, I think the rain has obscured it.
L460396 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Well. Well, what I mean is, you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him. But look this, Brother, it is even more interesting. Look at this mark here, and that mark over there. Now wouldn't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder?
L460395 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ But how would you find him?
L460394 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ That is because it rained recently, the rain has obscured the evidence. But you could still take plaster casts of these footprints, then match up the plaster casts with whosever shoes they are, and that way you could catch him -- understand?
L460393 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Well, it's not very plain.
L460392 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ See that, son? Now this is a heel, see, and there, that's the ball of a foot. Someone has been walking here.
L460381 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ He's not coming back again. We scared the rascal off, son.  Come on back to supper. Your mother has a theory about how to educate Rose.
L460380 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ I don't know. But you better watch him like a hawk, if he comes back again.
L460379 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ What do you think, Brother?
L460369 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ What's taking the rascal so long?
L460368 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Yeah, he's still up there.
L460367 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Is that Doctor still up there, Brother.
L460152 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ The girl strikes like a cobra.
L460151 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ I don't know.
L460150 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I never saw anything like it. How did she pick him up so fast?
L460139 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ No. Why should Rose be in my room?
L460138 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Son, was Rose in your room last night?
L460134 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Well, yeah.
L460133 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Reading dirty comic bocks.  And you admitted it?
L460132 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Well, a little.
L460131 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ You were up late last night, Brother.
L460375 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ I'll be right back.
L460374 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Now I have a plan about Rose, an educational plan. She's getting better and we don't want any more trouble --  Brother, you ought to hear this.
L460373 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Excuse me, gotta go to bathroom.
L460096 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I do wish you'd speak to Brother. It's true he's been looking at those horrible little books again.
L460095 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Heh, what a hypocrite.
L460075 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Oh, yes, it's Thursday.  Hello, Rose, dear...  ... my, you're... looking pretty...
L460074 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now.
L460073 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ What'd you say, Brother?
L460072 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ She's getting herself up to go out.
L460071 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Children, children! Be quiet, all of you!  The vibrations in this house are strange today. Where's Rose, anyhow?
L460066 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Yes, I did, mother. Your hearing aid isn't working right. I said ahhh-dam stuff.
L460065 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ No, you didn't say that, Brother.
L460064 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ I said ahhh-dam stuff.
L460063 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ What did you say, Brother?
L460062 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
L460061 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it.
L460060 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Geccch, yehh, guhhhh!
L460059 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ This is for your own good. When you look at negative, destructive things like those little filthy comic books, you are sick. Here, take this.
L460058 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Mother, cant you make it calomel instead of castor oil?
L460049 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Oh, Brother, I am so disappointed in you. You mustn't look at those horrible things, they degrade the human image.
L460048 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Mother, I have to tell the truth. I wasn't reading Huckleberry Finn, I was reading one of those Little Dirty Comic Books.
L460047 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Brother, when I have to wake you up at eleven o'clock in the morning you're either sick or you were up very late last night.  And you weren't reading Huckleberry Finn. I looked and its not in your room. Now what were you doing?
L459784 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Walked, in all that heat? It's a wonder she hasn't got sunstroke. I'll phone Daddy and you go get Doll Baby and Waski.
L459783 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ In the kitchen drinking all the ice water in Glenville. She walked out here, she didn't go by the hotel.
L459782 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ All right, all right. Doll and Waski are upstairs taking their nap, you go get them and bring them down to the living room. Where is the girl?
L459781 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ You mean confirmed, Mother. I didn't confirm it before. I would have had to confirm it previously, in order for it to be reconfirmed.
L459780 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Your impression is very reassuring, Brother. Of course she's had troubles, poor thing, but I sensed that was that the girl was like and I'm glad to have it reconfirmed.
L459779 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ She talks a great deal and smiles a lot. She's very pretty, she has a real good figure. She's very girlish or womanish, if you know what I mean. She wouldn't hurt anybody, this girl. She couldn't.
L459778 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Wonderful. What's she like, Brother? What is your impression of her?
L459777 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ The new girl is here.
L460564 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Here comes Daddy.
L460563 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ Why is it taking so long?
L460506 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ If it isn't a baby... what is it?
L460505 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ That's the least of her troubles. Rose had a rare tropic disease and the little tubes in her that babies swim down are all stopped up, she told me all about it.
L460504 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ A baby... and she isn't even married.
L460503 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Rose says she's goin' to have a baby and she sure looks it, but I don't think so.
L460502 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ What's goin' on?
L460411 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Sense doesn't mean anything to Rose. But I think we're on safe ground now. Daddy chained up the ladder, whoever it is can't get in the house.
L460410 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ Well, if she's got any sense at all, she'll listen to that.
L460319 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Doll, don't ask childish questions.
L460318 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ Buddy... does Rose really... "do it" with all those boys and men?
L460317 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Mother is struggling desperately. In fact she's fighting like a tiger. But I don't know, it's close, it's mighty close.
L460316 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ What's happening?
L460298 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ You better not snoop, Daddy'll kill you!
L460297 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ They've been in there the longest kind of time. I can't stand it, I gotta find out what's going on.
L460296 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ What is Rose going to do? Where can she go?
L460194 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Dumbness doesn't concern her, Doll. And neither does smartness. You see --
L460193 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ Then why does she act so dumb?
L460192 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ It isn't that she hasn't got any sense, Doll. Her basic intelligence is probably above average, maybe quite a bit above average.
L460191 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ She hasn't got any sense. In some ways, she's awful dumb.
L460190 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ So am I.
L460189 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.
L460188 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Chattanooga. I had St. Louis, Missouri.
L460068 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Shut up, Doll. I'll cut your guts
L460067 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ No, Mother, he's lying...
L459938 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ You know, Buddy, sometimes you make me sick.
L459937 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Wonderful? He kissed her and played with her titty, and I don't see anything so great about that. He was probably afraid Mother would come back early and catch him.
L459936 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ Wasn't Daddy wonderful? He wanted to kiss her some more and play with her, but he didn't, because he loves Mother and all of us, and he loves Rose, too. Isn't he wonderful, isn't he great?
L459932 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ You shouldn't watch such things, Doll.
L459931 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ Buddy, that was pretty snotty of you, pushing me away like that just when it was interesting.
L459928 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ Buddy, that was my place.
L459927 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ She's putting the titty back.
L459924 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Let me look.  Aww-rr...
L459923 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ He had his hand on her titty.
L459922 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Is that all?
L459921 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ He kissed her.
L459920 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ What are they doing, Doll?
L459919 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it.
L459918 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ What are they doing?
L459917 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ Wow! Brrrother!
L459916 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ Boy! Wow!
L459915 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Now I can't see. What are they doing?
L459914 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ Let me see!
L459913 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ He's trying to get up -- good God, one of her titties is out!
L459912 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?
L459911 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ This is my place and you can't have it.
L459910 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ I can't see, let me see...
L459909 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ They're discussing it.
L459908 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ I can't see. What are they doing, what's happening?
L459898 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ At least.
L459897 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ I think she's gonna kiss him.
L459896 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ Okay.
L459895 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Let's go peep from the living room.
L459894 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ Yeah.
L459893 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ There goes Mother.
L459873 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ I get so irritated with Daddy. He's so dumb sometimes.
L459872 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Yeah.
L459871 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ She's watching the car again?
L459870 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ It's really pitiful. She's in bad shape.
L459869 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ No, he doesn't. Not really.
L459868 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ I think Daddy suspects.
L459867 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ It's pitiful. Neither one of them know.
L459854 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ No.
L459853 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Daddy says Rose is calm as lettuce. Do you believe that, Doll?
L459822 +++$+++ u7223 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DOLL +++$+++ Oh, shut up, Buddy.
L459821 +++$+++ u7220 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Rose is almost as sentimental as Mother. If there's one thing I can't stand it's sentimentality. In Chattanooga this man committed an almost perfect murder. He killed his wife with a black widow spider.
L460685 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ I'm not blubbering.
L460684 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Now look, boy, get a grip on yourself. Rose had a good life. She found her. Right, didn't she? She triumphed over everything, what are you blubbering about?
L460683 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ That's a hell of a thing to say. Why, Rose?
L460682 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?
L460681 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Why Rose? Why Rose, Daddy?
L460678 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ It's true, son. The girl with the cornflower eyes is dead, she is no more,
L460677 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ I can't believe it, Daddy. I know it must be true, but I can't believe it.
L460676 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I know. You loved her. So did I. It was an awful shock to me, too. An awful shock. Rose was so alive it's hard to believe.
L460675 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Well, you have knocked me for a hell of a loop, old man. A hell of a loop.
L460674 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Excuse me, I'll be right back.
L460673 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ She was fifty-six, son. Of course she didn't look it, nowhere near it. The cancer came back, I'm afraid I fibbed about that. But it was very quick, son. She was in the hospital only two weeks, and the last week she didn't know anything.
L460672 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ But... but how? She was young! Rose wasn't old!
L460671 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I am afraid so, son. About a week ago. Her husband phoned me, she had asked him to call me if anything happened.
L460670 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Dead, Rose is dead? You mean... she died?
L460669 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ No, son, she is dead.
L460668 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ All right, Daddy. We have our drink, we're out on the patio, you have prepared me for it. Rose's cancer has come back, hasn't it?
L460667 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I'm older than hell, boy. But this Yankee whisky is mighty fine, I'll say that.
L460666 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ It's funny you would mention Rose, I was thinking about her all the way up in the car.  Or maybe it isn't so funny.
L460665 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Not for long, boy. I've outstayed my welcome already.
L460664 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ It always gives me a funny feeling to come home. Dear old Southland. Gone. It's all gone, Daddy --  -- except you, you're still here.
L460663 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ A wonderful woman, boy.
L460662 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ That's what she would say herself.
L460661 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ At rest in the creative universe with Mother, son.
L460660 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ You know, I don't know this town any more. All this traffic, new buildings, prosperity...  Where have the years gone, Daddy? Where is the little town I knew as a boy?
L460659 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Yes, I guess he did. He threw her away and it was the mistake of his life.
L460658 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ He didn't lose her, he threw her away.
L460657 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Yeah, I know, he was up here. It's pitiful like you say. When he lost Rose it ruined the man, it destroyed him totally when he lost Rose.
L460656 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ You're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. He also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over Washington. D.C.
L460655 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
L460654 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ The pitiful son of a bitch said Rose was a nymphomaniac.
L460653 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ No, it's another thing. I was going to write you about it, but since you were coming down anyway I thought I'd wait till you got here. What did Dave Wilkie have to say?
L460652 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Is her husband sick or something?
L460651 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Oh, no, no, she got all over that. Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son.
L460650 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ What sad news? Did her cancer come back?
L460649 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Oh, I heard from her, I got a letter from her, she's fine. But there is some sad news.
L460648 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ What's all this about Rose? What do you mean, you heard from her in a manner of speaking?
L460646 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Dave Wilkie of all people was sitting by me on the plane -- her first husband. It's funny you would mention Rose. Did you hear from her?
L460645 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ How could that be, son?
L460644 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Of course I recall Rose. In fact I've been thinking of no one else for the last hour and a half.
L460643 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Got another twenty years in it, boy.  By the way, son, do you recall Rose, that pretty blonde girl who came to our house way back in 1935 or 1936 and caused such a damnable commotion.
L460642 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Good God, the way you live here. This place hasn't been dusted since Mother died. Look at that goddamned refrigerator.
L460641 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Are they polar bears, too?
L460640 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Yeah, they're in the snow.
L460639 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Your wife and children are back in New Hampshire in the snow?
L460638 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ I can use a drink after the plane ride I had.
L460636 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ It's Yankee whisky to me.
L460635 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch.
L460634 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ About as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave. Good to see you, son.  Did you bring any of that Yankee whisky with you?
L460633 +++$+++ u7229 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ WILLCOX HILLYER +++$+++ Hello, Daddy. How are you?
L460632 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Well, you rascal, where'd you come from?
L460538 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Yes, we know her.
L460537 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ I think we both know her.
L460536 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Of course.
L460535 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ I have of course observed the girl in treating her.
L460534 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Please do.
L460533 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ Then... may I speak quite frankly with you, Mr. Hillyer?
L460532 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ I am ahead of you.
L460529 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Go on, Doctor.
L460528 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ First, about the girl's history. Evidently she's been very promiscuous since early childhood, she has no control over her sexual impulses. Furthermore, she is permanently barren, she can't have children.
L460527 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Go ahead, Doctor, I think I am following you.
L460520 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ Oh, it's definitely better, beyond question. A fatherless child, an ignorant girl with no job, no money, no home. It's fortunate, a blessing really, and a stroke of good luck for another reason I want to mention to you.
L460519 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Well, if it isn't malignant and she can get through the operation all right, it might be better than her really being pregnant. She doesn't even know who the father might have been.
L460518 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ Any major operation is dangerous. However, as we know from her previous illness, she's a very strong girl.
L460517 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Well, it's a disaster. I don't know what to say, Doctor, I am floored. How dangerous is the operation?
L460342 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ That's all I want to know.  Lets get out of here before I get the epizootics myself. Thank you, Doctor, for your discourse, it was fascinating, no doubt.
L460341 +++$+++ u7224 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DR. MARTINSON +++$+++ The point is you don't grow up like that on a diet of sorghum and hominy grits. She got protein somewhere, she's a very strong girl and I think she'll live... despite the delay in medical treatment.
L460626 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Yes, I think so. He adores her, it's almost pitiful the way he worships her. I just hope she isn't too much for him.
L460625 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Honey, he is Mr. Right.
L460624 +++$+++ u7226 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Well, yes, she's happy. Of course Dave doesn't have her life force, not at all. There isn't much furniture in his house, just a table and one or two chairs, whereas Rose has furniture coming out of the windows.
L460623 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ Well, thank God we are rid of her at last. And the best thing of all is that she's happy. The little nut is happy, she found Mr. Right in the nick of time!
L460607 +++$+++ u7221 +++$+++ m487 +++$+++ DADDY +++$+++ You know Dave, his wife used to do dressmaking for you before she died.
