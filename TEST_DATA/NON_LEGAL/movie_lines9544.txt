L43960 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ That for us?
L43936 +++$+++ u3704 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ GINA +++$+++ No, not anymore.  Happy anniversary, scout.
L43935 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Anymore.
L43934 +++$+++ u3704 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ GINA +++$+++ I never put myself in harm's way.
L43933 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Fuck you.
L43932 +++$+++ u3704 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ GINA +++$+++ I'm the hired help.
L44124 +++$+++ u3710 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ You have?
L44123 +++$+++ u3705 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ We've heard lots about you.
L44122 +++$+++ u3710 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Excuse me?
L44121 +++$+++ u3705 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Oh.  You're them.
L44120 +++$+++ u3710 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ We live next door.
L44119 +++$+++ u3705 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ And you know our friends, how?
L44118 +++$+++ u3710 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Monica.
L44117 +++$+++ u3705 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Let me.  I'm Jeffrey.
L44724 +++$+++ u3706 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ They didn't sign their goddamn tax returns!
L44723 +++$+++ u3708 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Not as a rule.
L44722 +++$+++ u3706 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Hm.  Do you like fucking out of doors?
L44721 +++$+++ u3708 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Hm.  You think we should ask them for their landscaper?
L44720 +++$+++ u3706 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Just every once in a blue moon, you know.
L44719 +++$+++ u3708 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Hm.  We should do it again.
L44718 +++$+++ u3706 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Damn near.  And a damn near perfect drug.
L44717 +++$+++ u3708 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ A perfect night.
L44716 +++$+++ u3706 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I call that a perfect day.
L44659 +++$+++ u3708 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Oh Jesus oh Jesus oh Jesus.
L44658 +++$+++ u3706 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Let me heal you, baby.
L44657 +++$+++ u3708 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Oh yeah?
L44656 +++$+++ u3706 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Oh yeah... I'm gonna save you.
L44655 +++$+++ u3708 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Oh yeah...
L44654 +++$+++ u3706 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Do you want me to save you?  Do you want me to save you?
L44653 +++$+++ u3708 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Are you my big hard hero?
L44652 +++$+++ u3706 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You're crazy baby.  I love you.
L44651 +++$+++ u3708 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Are you my big brave boy?  Are you my brave hero?
L44644 +++$+++ u3706 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Forget it, Judy.
L44643 +++$+++ u3708 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ There's a test, you know.
L44230 +++$+++ u3706 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Well it's fucking time.
L44229 +++$+++ u3708 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Ya Vhol.  What are you, a fucking Nazi?
L44228 +++$+++ u3706 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Time.  Hey!  Time.  Judy!  Time you guys. Hey!!
L43821 +++$+++ u3708 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Nice to meet you.
L43820 +++$+++ u3706 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Cal, my wife Judy.
L43732 +++$+++ u3706 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You have to sign your taxes anyway.
L43731 +++$+++ u3708 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I know we're early, we're so early. Sorry.
L44642 +++$+++ u3709 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ So, you've got lifeguard papers, or what?
L44641 +++$+++ u3706 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Probably not.
L44640 +++$+++ u3709 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ I'm fine, babe.  I'm gonna take a little walk.  I need a minute.  Let's forget it. My life didn't pass in front of my eyes. So, it probably wasn't that close.
L44638 +++$+++ u3709 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Yeah, thanks pal.
L44637 +++$+++ u3706 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Anytime, sport.
L44636 +++$+++ u3709 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Hey.  Thanks, buddy.
L44635 +++$+++ u3706 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Give him a minute, Clair.
L44634 +++$+++ u3709 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ I'm fine, babe.
L44632 +++$+++ u3709 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Man, I must really be stoned.  Thanks, buddy.
L44631 +++$+++ u3706 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ He's okay, Clair.  You wanna give him a little room?
L44209 +++$+++ u3709 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Are you always this much fun?
L44208 +++$+++ u3706 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I don't think so.
L44207 +++$+++ u3709 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ It was fifteen seconds.
L44206 +++$+++ u3706 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Hey!  Would you?
L44205 +++$+++ u3709 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Go.
L44242 +++$+++ u3706 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Ryan's novel?
L44241 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Ryan's novel.
L44240 +++$+++ u3706 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ What was it?  What the fuck was it?
L44211 +++$+++ u3706 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I'm ready.
L44210 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Take your time, Jer.
L43777 +++$+++ u3706 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Beats a lawsuit.
L43776 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ How much bowing and scraping do you want us to do?
L43775 +++$+++ u3706 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Just do what I say, alright?
L43774 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ You're out of your mind.
L43773 +++$+++ u3706 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Before I forget.  Put it on the bookshelf.
L43772 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Scout's honor.
L43771 +++$+++ u3706 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Did he promise?
L43770 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Yes.
L43769 +++$+++ u3706 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Did you tell Joe to behave?
L43768 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Whatever you say.
L43767 +++$+++ u3706 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ That was the plan.  And you're thrilled to have them.
L43766 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ The Roses?  And of course they said yes.
L43765 +++$+++ u3706 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Did you invite them?
L43764 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ We'll be fine.
L43763 +++$+++ u3706 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ There's still time to undo this.
L43762 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ He gets huge advances on his novels. He's going back to that.  You know how he hates it here.
L43761 +++$+++ u3706 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ They're paying him scale.
L43760 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ He's directing now.
L43759 +++$+++ u3706 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Not millions.
L43756 +++$+++ u3706 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Whatever you say.  Listen, I love you.
L43755 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ We couldn't be on more solid ground.
L43754 +++$+++ u3706 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I worry because you don't.  It's my job. I'm feeling guilty.  I would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground.
L43753 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Well, you're a tower of support.
L43752 +++$+++ u3706 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You only made half your quote this year.
L43751 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ We've only been over this how many times?
L43750 +++$+++ u3706 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ What you earn has to double in order to cover expenses in London, it's an outrageously expensive city.
L43749 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I know.  I know that.  Don't spoil it.
L43748 +++$+++ u3706 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning.  The house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the London flat.
L43747 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I adore him.
L43746 +++$+++ u3706 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I suppose.  Sally, that's quite a gift. I'm not sure it's in your best interest.
L43745 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I love you, you're a genius.
L43744 +++$+++ u3706 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Joe officially owns No. 4, Cheyenne Walk, Chelsea, London, England.  No small doing.
L43742 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Fantastic.  Out here.
L43741 +++$+++ u3706 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ We closed.
L44759 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Sure.
L44758 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Will you make love with me?
L44757 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I know.
L44756 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Oh, Sally Mae...
L44755 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ They're the keys to your grandad's flat. Happy anniversary, baby.
L44754 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Ah...
L44753 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I know.  It's for the baby's crib.
L44752 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ He's my favorite.
L44751 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I know.
L44750 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ It's a Calder.
L44749 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Happy anniversary.
L44748 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Me too.
L44747 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ That's under lock and key.
L44746 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Me too.
L44745 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Life gets messy.  Ugly messy.  But I don't understand you.  And I don't think I ever understood Lucy.  I don't understand throwing it away.  How do you throw all that away?  Any of it.  I want it all.  You guys want guarantees?  I want the possibilities.  And all kinds of crap comes with that.  A lot of bad shit. And I think that's okay with me because, because of the rest of the stuff.  All the good shit.  All the surprises.  It's a fucking miracle when you come down to it.  We'd have had amazing children, you and me.  We'd have had a ride.  You'd have surprised yourself.  I'll never love anybody else, you know.
L44744 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I guess.
L44743 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Pretty much a disaster, tonight, wasn't it?
L44742 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Okay.
L44741 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ No.
L44690 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ You don't have to.
L44689 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I don't want to go tonight.
L44688 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I'll be with you.
L44687 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I can't got tonight.  I don't want to be on a plane on my own tonight.
L44684 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Everybody hates the messenger.
L44683 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Alright, good.  Thanks for your trouble. So will you leave Sally and me alone right now?
L44629 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I have no idea who you are.
L44628 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I know.
L44627 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'll never forgive you.
L44626 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Yes.
L44625 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I wasn't part of that picture at all, was I?  I wasn't part of that decision.  Did I occur to you at all?  It's a fucking farce.  It's a fucking farce.  How long did you think you could keep it going. You're amazing.  Do you have any idea what you've done to us?
L44624 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Don't make allowances.  I'll never be ready.  Some people just shouldn't have children.  I'd be a terrible fucking mother, Joe.  I did want it for us.  But I couldn't do it.  I don't really think I can do it.
L44623 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You're not ready.
L44622 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I'm a monster.  Exactly.
L44621 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What?!  You aborted our child?!
L44620 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ You think this was to hurt you?!  My God, Joe.  It isn't about you.
L44619 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I wanted you back.
L44618 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You changed your mind.
L44617 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I told you when we met I never wanted children.  I don't want kids in my life. We talked about it.  You weren't listening.
L44616 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Don't do this!
L44615 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I found out I was pregnant and it scared the shit out of me.
L44614 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Don't do this.
L44613 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I had an abortion two weeks ago.
L44612 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Don't push me away.
L44611 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Don't.
L44610 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ This is insanity.  Sally...
L44609 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Anyone else?
L44608 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Sally, for Christ's sake.
L44607 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Cal, too?
L44606 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Mac?  Mac says it?  Cal?
L44605 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Your director and your co-star of your current movie.  Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally.
L44604 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Who?  Who?  Who thinks that?
L44603 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally.
L44602 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Not really.  I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all our friends think, anyway.
L44601 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Well there you go.  I let you off the hook.  You're one goddamn lucky actress.
L44600 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ It's a shit novel anyway.
L44599 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Sally, I have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently.
L44598 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I don't look my age, Joe.
L44597 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Hello?  Last birthday was?
L44596 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ What are you saying?
L44595 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Who the fuck do you think you are?  The part of Genna is not just about you. It's about every woman I've ever loved in my entire life.  Including my mother. The character is also clearly in her early twenties, Sally.
L44594 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ About me!
L44593 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ It's a novel.
L44592 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ And how fucking dare you cast Skye Davidson in that part?  Have you any idea how humiliating that is for me?  I'm an actress!  It's about our marriage for fuck's sake.  Everybody knows that...
L44591 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Right.  And when was the last time you spoke to her?
L44590 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.
L44589 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ It is true.  You know how you love, Joe? You dedicate a book to someone.
L44588 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ That is not true.
L44587 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ You want to talk about bullshit?  Lucy called you three times this week.  She's a fucking mess, Joe.  Your sister is a fucking mess.  She needs you.  I talk to her more than you do.
L44586 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Sally, first of all, you're talking bullshit.  And second...
L44585 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ You've been through it.  That's how you love people.  When it's easy for you, when it's convenient for you.
L44584 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Just stop right there, Sally.  We've been through this.
L44583 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ And how hard it hit?
L44582 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ DO I want anyone else?  No.  Do I want to be with you for the rest of my natural life?  I'm trying.
L44581 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ It's not like this all the time.
L44580 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ That hasn't the first fucking thing to do with love.  It's whether we can live together... like this!  All the time.
L44579 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ You walked out on a five year marriage.
L44578 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Love?
L44577 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I'm not sure we understand that word in the same way.
L44576 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Otis!
L44575 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Otis!  Come!  Good boy!  Come!
L44574 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Sally, so I took a few pills.  I went out dancing.  I tried to forget how upset I was about splitting up with you.  I haven't lied to you.  I told you about the people I've slept with.  I just didn't mention the few occasions I took drugs because you're so fucking judgmental I knew I'd never hear the end of it, and you have so little faith and so little trust in me.  Sally, we're back, I love you.  Trust that.  Please let's not do this.
L44573 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ What else don't I know about, Joe?  Let's get really clear here.
L44572 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Rave parties?!  That's so typical - you would think it was called rage.  Perfect!
L44571 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Yeah, let's talk about that.  You seem to be rather an expert.  I don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties.
L44570 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Jesus, Sally.  You are a medical miracle. The only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier.
L44569 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Oh fuck you, and fuck Monica while you're at it.  But I guess that's what I interrupted.
L44568 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Well someone clearly let him out before Monica opened the gate.
L44567 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ It was done.  When Sophia put the kids to bed, America brought Otis in the room and closed the door.  It was done.
L44566 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ This is a nightmare.  We should have kept him upstairs.
L44565 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Otis, good boy, come here.  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
L44564 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Otis!!!!
L44563 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Otis!!!!
L44522 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Or shitty!!  Otis!!
L44521 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Fuck you.
L44520 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Sally, calm down.  We're not going to find him any quicker by you being hysterical.
L44519 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ There are fucking coyotes out there.
L44518 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ He'll find his way back.
L44517 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Can't have gone far?  He's like a greyhound.  He could be miles away.
L44516 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Well he can't have gone far.
L44515 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ She left the fucking gate open.
L44514 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Listen to yourself...  Don't worry, it's alright.  We'll find him.  What's wrong with you?
L44513 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Don't be so sure.
L44503 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Oh for fuck's sake.  Nobody uses that gate.
L44502 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Someone left the goddamn gate open.  Otis got out.  Skye and I, well the... I came out of the house and the fucking gate was wide open.
