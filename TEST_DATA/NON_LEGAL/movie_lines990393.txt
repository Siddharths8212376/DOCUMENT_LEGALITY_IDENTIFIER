L576651 +++$+++ u8164 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ FROCK +++$+++ Quadrupedal!  The other name for Mbwun.  "He Who Walks on All Fours."
L576650 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ All right, assuming the program is accurate, this is a description of the animal with that claw.  "Species unidentified.  Genus: unidentified.  Phylum unknown.  Male, weight in excess of 240 kg.  Brain capacity, 900 centimeters." That means it's highly intelligent. "Quadrupedal."
L576635 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ But a virus normally codes for other viruses.  This one's making human and animal proteins.  Listen to this.  "Glycotetraglycine collagenoid. Weinstein's tropic hormone.  4- monoxytocin supressin hormone."
L576634 +++$+++ u8164 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ FROCK +++$+++ That's not so unusual.  Many plants carry viruses.  Like the burls on Maple trees.
L576633 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Look at this.  An ambyloid reovirus protein.  That explains why the computer's confused.  The plant's infected with a virus.
L576630 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Several problems with that theory. For one thing, this egg is intact. For another, according to Pendergast, the crates were shipped here on a boat.  Everyone on board was killed like Beauregard.  If the thing hatched in mid-ocean, where did it go?
L576629 +++$+++ u8164 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ FROCK +++$+++ Come on, Margo.  We're on the verge of something huge.  Let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room.  What if John was right.  I mean, what if?  And he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates.  When it got to the museum, it hatched.
L576628 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Let's not jump to conclusions.  This egg could belong to any number of reptiles, Dr. Frock.
L576627 +++$+++ u8164 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ FROCK +++$+++ Like the claw.
L576578 +++$+++ u8164 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ FROCK +++$+++ They're eggs.
L576577 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ What are they?
L576576 +++$+++ u8164 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ FROCK +++$+++ Margo, these aren't seed pods.
L576569 +++$+++ u8164 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ FROCK +++$+++ You're right.
L576568 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui.  John used it as packing material.
L576567 +++$+++ u8164 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ FROCK +++$+++ I'm not sure.  As you know, the Kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. Species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct.  This could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant.
L576566 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ What is it?
L576565 +++$+++ u8164 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ FROCK +++$+++ Let me see the plant press.
L576564 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ A blow dart.  Seed pods.  A plant press.  Pretty unimpressive stuff.
L576563 +++$+++ u8164 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ FROCK +++$+++ I can't help thinking there's something that Pendergast overlooked.  If the scratches were made by whatever killed Beauregard, it wants something that's in here.
L576311 +++$+++ u8164 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ FROCK +++$+++ Cuthbert's counting on the exhibition's success.  The museum is in debt.  Contributions and public funding have dried up.  Admissions no longer cover overhead.  The last big infusion of cash we had was the King Tut exhibit.  Cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red.  If the Superstition Exhibit isn't lucrative, he'll have to start auctioning off some of these gems.
L576310 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ That Cuthbert.  What a piece of work. Someone's dead and all he cares about is his Superstition Exhibit.
L576258 +++$+++ u8164 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ FROCK +++$+++ Everyone needs a change of scenery. I've been rolling down these halls for forty-odd years.  That's quite enough.
L576257 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ You are this museum.  It won't be the same without you.
L576256 +++$+++ u8164 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ FROCK +++$+++ This isn't a death sentence.  Greg has promised to teach me fly fishing.  I'll garden.  I'll write.
L576255 +++$+++ u8164 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ FROCK +++$+++ You must.
L576254 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I'm not giving up.
L576253 +++$+++ u8164 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ FROCK +++$+++ Come on.  I'll walk you back to the elevator.
L576252 +++$+++ u8164 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ FROCK +++$+++ Healing plant use among the Ki tribe of Bechuanaland has been cancelled to make room for Tibetan Erotic Art.
L576251 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Your work is highly relevant.  What about your display on Primitive Pharmacology?  Cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the Superstition Exhibit.
L576250 +++$+++ u8164 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ FROCK +++$+++ With all due respect, dear, that's bull.  You dance rings around me with your new technology.  You've left me in the dust.
L576249 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.
L576248 +++$+++ u8164 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ FROCK +++$+++ Yes it is.  I'm tired and I'm no longer needed --
L576247 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ How can you say that?  You know it's not true.
L576246 +++$+++ u8164 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ FROCK +++$+++ No, Margo.  This is one problem you can't solve.  You have to stay out of it.  The fact is, I want to retire.
L576245 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Let me help.  I can take care of everything.
L576244 +++$+++ u8164 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ FROCK +++$+++ Please.  Don't humiliate me further.
L576242 +++$+++ u8164 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ FROCK +++$+++ That, apparently, is the problem. I'm yesterday's news.  Who needs a Curator of Plant Biology in a museum with one exhibit on plants?  Monsters and dinosaurs, cannibals and shamans are the new currency of the realm.
L576241 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ We can't do without you.  You're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology.  You're practically an institution around here.
L576240 +++$+++ u8164 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ FROCK +++$+++ Now Margo, don't overreact.  Cuthbert has to cut costs somehow.  My leaving makes perfect sense.  This isn't exactly early retirement.  I've overstayed the party a bit.
L576239 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I don't believe it.
L576238 +++$+++ u8164 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ FROCK +++$+++ Yes.  Bit of a shock.  But as Cuthbert so tactfully put it, the museum needs new blood.  And since I've been here since the Mesozoic Era --
L576996 +++$+++ u8164 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ FROCK +++$+++ They were sent to the Center For Disease Control in Atlanta.
L576995 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ Dr. Frock, I was wondering.  What happened to the rest of Whittlesley's plants?
L576837 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ Footsteps!
L576836 +++$+++ u8164 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ FROCK +++$+++ What's that?
L576834 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ He's right.
L576833 +++$+++ u8164 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ FROCK +++$+++ Margo, this is too dangerous.  You always think you can solve everything.  This time you don't have enough information.  The animal might behave in unexpected ways.  Leave her here with me.  Don't put her in danger.
L576803 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ I don't believe it.
L576802 +++$+++ u8164 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ FROCK +++$+++ We think it may have something to do with the eggs we found in the crate.
L576546 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ You said you had plans of the museum.  Could we see them, please?
L576545 +++$+++ u8164 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ FROCK +++$+++ I don't know.  It was walled over.  No one's been down there in years.
L576544 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ Where is that?
L576543 +++$+++ u8164 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ FROCK +++$+++ Not really.  Just the sub-basement.
L576542 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ Are there any hidden rooms or staircases?  Places where someone could hide?
L576541 +++$+++ u8164 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ FROCK +++$+++ Yes.
L576540 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ You said John Whittlesley made a study of your blueprints of the museum.
L576535 +++$+++ u8164 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ FROCK +++$+++ "Dear Louis, Tomorrow we go to the south end of the tepui where we'll be in the greatest danger, so I'm sending Carlos back with the crates.  You always believed in me, Louis, even in the darkest days.  So it gives me great pleasure to tell you your faith has been rewarded.  We've made an incredible find.  I enclose a representation of Mbwun.  Note the exaggerated claws, the reptilian attributes, the hints of bipedalia. It's beyond belief, but this statue is accurate.  I know because I've seen the beast."
L576534 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ Read it out loud.
L576533 +++$+++ u8164 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ FROCK +++$+++ It's from John.  Those two arrows were his insignia.  It's addressed to Louis Moriarty, a patron who financed his expeditions.
L576528 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ I wouldn't be so sure.
L576527 +++$+++ u8164 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ FROCK +++$+++ This means there must be an animal loose in the museum!
L576526 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ And failed.  These doors are solid steel.
L576525 +++$+++ u8164 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ FROCK +++$+++ Something tried to get into this room!
L576511 +++$+++ u8164 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ FROCK +++$+++ Yes.  John made quite a study of the whole museum.  He had a copy of my original plans.
L576510 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ Do you mean Dr. Whittlesley?
L576507 +++$+++ u8164 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ FROCK +++$+++ They fill seven floors.  We have the largest collection of mammals and dinosaurs in the world.  Just to give you an idea, there are more than three million insects specimens.  Not to mention amphibians, reptiles, birds, anthropological artifacts, meteorites, minerals and gems.  Only about five percent of the museum collection is actually on display.
L576506 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ How many storage areas are there?
L576505 +++$+++ u8164 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ FROCK +++$+++ Happy to be useful.  It's rare enough these days.  According to security, Beauregard put the Whittlesley crates in storage area 1012.
L576504 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ Thank you for taking the time to help us with this, Dr. Frock.
L576208 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Fourth floor, West wing, but stay with your class.
L576207 +++$+++ u8165 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Way cool.  Then you know where the dinosaurs are.
L576206 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Evolutionary Biologist.  I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.
L576205 +++$+++ u8165 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Nothing.  I'm in third grade.  What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?
L576204 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I'm an Evolutionary Biologist.  What do you do?
L576203 +++$+++ u8165 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ What do you do?
L576202 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Yes, I do.
L576201 +++$+++ u8165 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ You work here?
L576355 +++$+++ u8165 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ You're color blind.
L576354 +++$+++ u8169 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ They were yellow!
L576353 +++$+++ u8165 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.
L576352 +++$+++ u8169 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ It had a long tongue, teeth this big and yellow eyes.
L576351 +++$+++ u8165 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Like this.
L576350 +++$+++ u8169 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ And it snuffled the ground like a dog.
L576349 +++$+++ u8169 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Well almost.  Depends which house.  It smelled like old hamburger, and it made this weird noise.
L576348 +++$+++ u8165 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Not that big.
L576347 +++$+++ u8169 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Big as a house.
L576346 +++$+++ u8165 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ We were just lost, okay?  And we went down this curvy staircase.  At the bottom was a big shadow.
L576280 +++$+++ u8165 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I don't know.  But I think it's bad.
L576279 +++$+++ u8169 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ What is it?
L576278 +++$+++ u8165 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Quiet!
L576270 +++$+++ u8165 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Don't be a wuss.  Come on.
L576269 +++$+++ u8169 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ I don't want to go this way.
L576268 +++$+++ u8165 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Chicken.  This is a great short cut.
L576267 +++$+++ u8169 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ We're not supposed to go back there.
L576264 +++$+++ u8169 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Let's ditch and find them ourselves.
L576263 +++$+++ u8165 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ She's never going to take us to see the dinosaurs.  That lady said they were on the fourth floor.
L576262 +++$+++ u8169 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ This room sucks.
L576715 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ Keep the animal quiet.
L576714 +++$+++ u8167 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ JONATHAN +++$+++ Oh no.  I smell it.
L576711 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ Another storage room.
L576710 +++$+++ u8167 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ JONATHAN +++$+++ Jesus, what is this?
L576617 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ Quiet.
L576616 +++$+++ u8167 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ JONATHAN +++$+++ Oh... my... God!
L576613 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ Not on the map.  Looks like it connects with the city sewer.
L576612 +++$+++ u8167 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ JONATHAN +++$+++ It's alright.  I can tell by the way the dog's acting that whatever was out there is gone.  What is this place?
L576611 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ Come on.  Let's get back to the others.  We can't leave them alone.
L576610 +++$+++ u8167 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ JONATHAN +++$+++ Look.  It's Hobbes!  He's all right.
L576606 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ He's right.  Follow me.
L576605 +++$+++ u8167 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ JONATHAN +++$+++ There's something out there!  Let's go get it now!  That's why we came down here, isn't it?
L576597 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ Get back!  Now!
L576596 +++$+++ u8167 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ JONATHAN +++$+++ Argo!  Hobbes!
L576590 +++$+++ u8167 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ JONATHAN +++$+++ Holy mother, what is that?
L576589 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ Stop!
L576586 +++$+++ u8167 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ JONATHAN +++$+++ Heel Argo!  Hobbes!  Heel!
L576585 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ Shut them up!
L576584 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ Keep the light up.  I can't see.
L576583 +++$+++ u8167 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ JONATHAN +++$+++ They've got something.
L576581 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ Not yet.  Let's try the fork to the left.
L576580 +++$+++ u8167 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ JONATHAN +++$+++ The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back.
L576579 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ Hard to read in this light.  The ink is so faded.
L576990 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Okay.
L576989 +++$+++ u8168 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ KAWAKITA +++$+++ Not today.  Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.
L576988 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ How about lunch?
L576987 +++$+++ u8168 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ KAWAKITA +++$+++ Got to finish this thesis sometime.
L576855 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Yes, he's fine.  Greg... take care of yourself!
L576854 +++$+++ u8168 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ KAWAKITA +++$+++ Is Dr. Frock safe!
L576645 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Yes.  Whatever killed Beauregard may have lived on this plant.  When the crates were put in secure storage, they were out of reach.  The killer couldn't get them, so it got the next best thing.
L576644 +++$+++ u8168 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ KAWAKITA +++$+++ Eats them?
L576643 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victim's brains!
L576642 +++$+++ u8168 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ KAWAKITA +++$+++ So what?
L576641 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ This is it.  This is what he, or it... is after!  The plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain!
L576639 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Try Weinstein's tropic hormone.
L576638 +++$+++ u8168 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ KAWAKITA +++$+++ 4-monoxytocin is... "A hormone secreted by the human hypothalamus gland."
L576637 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ What kind of hormones?
L576636 +++$+++ u8168 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ KAWAKITA +++$+++ These plant fibers are loaded with hormones!
L576626 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ It's reptilian.
L576625 +++$+++ u8168 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ KAWAKITA +++$+++ What kind of egg is it?
L576499 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ There's another possibility.  A lot of repeated base pairs could suggest a high level of genetic damage.
L576498 +++$+++ u8168 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ KAWAKITA +++$+++ Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand?  Impossible.  The sample must be contaminated.
L576497 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Turkish Gecko, I believe.  A lizard.
L576493 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ It's not mammalian, that's for sure. I think it's reptilian.
L576492 +++$+++ u8168 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ KAWAKITA +++$+++ What do you make of it, Margo?
L576316 +++$+++ u8168 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ KAWAKITA +++$+++ What's that?
L576315 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Mbwun.
L576304 +++$+++ u8168 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ KAWAKITA +++$+++ Someone's been murdered.  Not shot, strangled or stabbed, either.  Torn limb from limb.  There's talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal.
L576303 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ For once I'm glad you're rumor central.  What in the world is going on?
L576235 +++$+++ u8168 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ KAWAKITA +++$+++ I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings, but you know me.  Telegraph. Telephone.  Tell Kawakita.  I got the definitive word from Cuthbert's secretary.  This is Dr. Frock's last week.
L576234 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ That's impossible.
L576233 +++$+++ u8168 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ KAWAKITA +++$+++ Frock's been fired.
L576232 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ What?
L576231 +++$+++ u8168 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ KAWAKITA +++$+++ Margo, you haven't heard?
L576230 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I have the species identification on these teeth.  We can extract DNA and start running tests on the extrapolator program.  Call Dr. Frock.  He wanted a demonstration.
L576229 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ But at what a price.
L576228 +++$+++ u8168 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ KAWAKITA +++$+++ If I spent half the time on my Fractal Evolution thesis that I spend on this fly rod, I'd have my PhD.
L576994 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ I'm in town on a case.  Dropped by to see Vince and we thought we'd see the new display.
L576993 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I'm so glad to see you.  What's the occasion?
L576980 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ You have to.  Do it now!
L576979 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I can't!
L576978 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ He has to look here or I won't get a clear shot.  Call him, Margo.
L576977 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Do it, quickly.  Please.  Aim for the eye.
L576976 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ I have to shoot.
L576975 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Just like John.  He won't listen.
L576962 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ Whatever that thing is, we have to kill it!
L576961 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ You have to!  Listen!  All viruses pass on their own DNA.  Instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses!  This one was different.  It inserted a whole array of genes into John.  Reptile genes, sixty five million years old.  Those genes remade him!  It's not his fault!
L576960 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ I don't believe it.
L576959 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ That thing is John Whittlesley.  I should have seen it before!  The fibers are infected with a virus. You eat them, and the virus alters your DNA!  He became addicted to them in South America, followed the plants back to the states.  He probably entered the country as a man.  It would have taken several months for the change to take place. That's how he got from the boat to the museum!
L576958 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ What?
L576957 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ No!  Don't kill him!  Pendergast, you were right.  It's John!
L576947 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Listen to me, Pendergast.  Mbwun's DNA is part homo sapien.  In primates, the eye is a direct path to the brain!  If you get a clean shot, there's only one place you can kill it.  Shoot it in the eye!
L576946 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ We're not going to make the storage room!
L576931 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ It's coming.  Run.
L576930 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ You smell that?
L576929 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ Oh God!  Help!
L576928 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Help someone!
L576911 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ It's deceptively simple.  Like a Bruckner Symphony or a Matisse.
L576910 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ That's a ptarmigan, feigning a broken wing.  The bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest!
L576909 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ The answer's right in front of us.
L576908 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ How?
L576907 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ We have to try and draw it off!
L576883 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I think... for the pleasure of the kill.
L576882 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ For what?
L576881 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ No.  It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.
L576880 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ Then it won't go after the others?
L576879 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ I think... it means it's full.
L576878 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ It didn't want the fibers.  What does that mean?
L576877 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Its eyesight is worse than I thought.  It couldn't see us.  And it couldn't smell us through the glass.
L576876 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ What happened?
L576874 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ It's scared of me.
L576873 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ What is it doing?
L576869 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ What are you going to do?
L576868 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ Hide quickly!
L576857 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ No.  The planetarium is in the next cell.  This is one of the fire doors...
L576856 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Is there another way around?
L576848 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ Vince!
L576847 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ The planetarium!
L576846 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ That was D'Agosta.
L576832 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ Unlock one of the other storage rooms.  We're going upstairs.  We'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here.
L576831 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ You'd slow us down and put Margo in danger.
L576808 +++$+++ u8170 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ MARGO +++$+++ We have the fibers.  Don't you see? The creature is hungry.  It wants the hormones in these plants.  It would take hundreds of human brains to supply what's in these fibers.  We're just a poor substitute.  To make it stop hunting, we have to give it what it wants.
L576807 +++$+++ u8171 +++$+++ m554 +++$+++ PENDERGAST +++$+++ But what can we do?  Our guns are useless --
