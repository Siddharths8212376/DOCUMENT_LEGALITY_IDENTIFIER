L375827 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Just plain 'Joe'?
L375823 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Yeah, Bill, the suspense is killing me.
L375822 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Daddy!  Come on, a name.
L375740 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Unfortunately.  I sat between them at the Bronx Zoo benefit -- it was better than Seconal.
L375739 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ His wife?
L375738 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ He's coming.
L375737 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Did you speak to the Governor?
L376615 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Yes, it is.
L376614 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ You know, darling, this is going to be a wonderful party.
L376612 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ But that's what you were thinking. And that's okay.  Because I know you love me.  Not like it is with Susan, the way your eyes light up when she comes in the room and the way she always gets a laugh out of you, as opposed to me when I walk in a room and that look comes over your face, "What does she want now?"
L376611 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I wasn't going to say --
L376610 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ That you've been to Susan?
L376609 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I haven't been the father to you that --
L376608 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ They respect you.  Isn't that a kind of love?
L376607 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Yeah?  And what about my enemies?
L376606 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ I do it because I love you.  Because everybody I loved you.  Mommy -- wher- ever she is -- Susan, Quince, the people who work for you, everybody who's ever known you.
L376604 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ -- Plus we've got a baritone with a balalaika coming from The Russian Tea Room.  I've dressed him in a Cossack shirt and he'll sing Nelson Eddy songs.
L376603 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Do they, m'dear?
L376602 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ The fountain is the Caspian Sea and the Sea is serving up caviar.  The 'B's for Beluga, the 'P' for Petrossian.  Of course, they also stand for 'Bill' and for 'Parrish'.
L376601 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ It's starting to grow on me.  But what do the 'B' and 'P' mean?
L376600 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Hi, Daddy, what do you think?
L376355 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ 'Goddam party'!
L376354 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Oh, the goddam party --
L376353 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ It's for the party, Dad --
L376352 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I don't like cake.
L376351 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ From La Rosette, only the greatest pastry chef in America.  This is orange, from real Seville oranges.  Lemon, on a mille-feuille crust, a little on the fanciful. And a while, nothing like a good old white cake, vanilla, with Angel food but some maroons shavings thrown in.
L376350 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Who's Annie?
L376349 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Annie made them.
L376348 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ What is this?
L376200 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ That's okay, Daddy.
L376199 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I like it.  I like it.  I'm sorry I don't seem more appreciative.
L376198 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ You know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not.
L376197 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Of course.
L376196 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Whatever it was, they'll be here. We sent out invitations to everyone, plane tickets included -- the RSVP's are amazing.  A few of them we didn't hear from, and some of them are dead, of course --
L376195 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Conflict, honey.  Korean Conflict.
L376194 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ From the Korean War.
L376193 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Who?
L376192 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Did you know twenty-six members of your rifle company are coming?
L375882 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ We've got some things to discuss.
L375881 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Now, I'm getting interested.  I want to know more ---
L375836 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Whew, at last.  Nice to meet you, Mr. Black.
L375835 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ -- Black.
L375819 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ A name?
L375818 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Daddy.  Does your friend have a name?
L375730 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Good.  Songs.  What songs should Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we can forget about -- what songs do you think he should play?
L375729 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart.  I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it.
L375728 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ And you could care less --
L375727 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I know you do, darling.
L375726 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect --
L375725 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ What, honey?
L375529 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ No.
L375528 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it.
L375527 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.
L375526 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I hate parties --
L375518 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ But it's your birthday.
L375517 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Allison, I trust you.  This is your thing.
L375516 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Fireworks.  Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity... The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime bill for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...
L375515 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Not much more.  Big day in the big city.  What's on your mind?
L375514 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Have you got a minute?
L375513 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Hi, Allison --
L375512 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Daddy!
L376364 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ What will I tell Annie?
L376363 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ But what?
L376362 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Yeah, but --
L375845 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ You know what I'm saying, Joe?
L375844 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Honey --!
L375843 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen.
L375842 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Paillarde of veal.
L375749 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ No jocks?  A twenty-game winner or a Masters champion?  Someone I could talk to.  Or would talk to me.
L375748 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Please don't be negative, Drew, we have an acceptance list that would do The White House proud -- The Secretary-General of the UN, the Chairman of the FCC, nine Senators, I don't know how many Congressmen, and at least twelve of the Fortune '500'.
L375746 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ He said he would be there with bells on.
L375745 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ What about the Mayor?
L375567 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Remember everybody, tonight, dinner in the city at Daddy's.  You too, Drew.  We've still got some loose ends --
L375566 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ Okay.  All aboard - New York, New York!
L375565 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Honey, please.
L376620 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ Both.
L376619 +++$+++ u6545 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ Red or white?
L376618 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ Okay, give me a bottle of wine.
L376617 +++$+++ u6545 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ I'm afraid this is a wine bar, Mr. Quince.
L375545 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ 9:30's almost 10:30.  Where I come from, the sun's over the yardarm, m'boy, and the cocktail lamp is lit.
L375544 +++$+++ u6545 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ Well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning.
L375543 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ What do you do that for?
L375542 +++$+++ u6545 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ Pinot Grigio.  We're considering it for the appetizer.
L375541 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ And that?
L375540 +++$+++ u6545 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ AMBROSE +++$+++ -- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert.
L375539 +++$+++ u6553 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ QUINCE +++$+++ ...This shit's not bad.
L375640 +++$+++ u6546 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ BONTECOU +++$+++ Oh, Mr. Parrish, I could never buy Parrish Communications.  I could pay for it, of course, but it would always have your imprint.
L375639 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I thought you were buying my company.
L375638 +++$+++ u6546 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ BONTECOU +++$+++ Left field somewhere.  Well, Bill, I want to come in from the outfield, bat cleanup like you have, learn the plush ropes --
L375637 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I'm sorry, I don't recall --
L375636 +++$+++ u6546 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ BONTECOU +++$+++ We've met before, y'know, that White House function, the President had you on his right and you know where I was?
L375635 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Good, good.  Glad to hear it.
L375634 +++$+++ u6546 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ BONTECOU +++$+++ Bill, thanks for coming over...  And how're you doing today, Drew?  You've got a firecracker here, the kid's really set the table.
L376251 +++$+++ u6547 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ COYLE +++$+++ Right away.
L376250 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Toast?  No...just the butter.
L376249 +++$+++ u6547 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ COYLE +++$+++ How would you like that, sir?  On some kind of toast?
L376248 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I would prefer some peanut butter.
L375934 +++$+++ u6547 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ COYLE +++$+++ I would say, sir, it is right up there with Jif and Skippy.  But miles ahead of Peter Pan.  Like a taste?
L375933 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ 'Laura Scudder's Peanut Butter'.  You like it?
L375932 +++$+++ u6547 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ COYLE +++$+++ You mean this, sir?
L375931 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What are you eating.
L375930 +++$+++ u6547 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ COYLE +++$+++ Yes sir, Mr. Black, a pleasure.
L375929 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Hello.  I'm Joe Black.  Nice to meet you.
L375928 +++$+++ u6547 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ COYLE +++$+++ Yes, sir?
L376397 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ So I guess a blowjob's out of the question?
L376396 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ That's it.  It's over.  Get out.
L376395 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Oh, you're the great Joe's attorney now?  Are we going to go to court? Or are we going to go to bed?  And I don't mean you and me.  I mean you and him.
L376299 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Yeah.  Goodnight.
L376298 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Well... goodnight.
L376297 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ No, not okay.  I thought we had a good thing going here.  It shows you never know.
L376296 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me.  And vice versa. Okay?
L376295 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ That may be.  But I don't like the fucker.  I don't like the way he looks at you and talks to you.  And vice versa.
L376294 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Drew, you're out of line.
L376293 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Daddy'll do fine.  Besides, he's got Joe.  And so do you.
L376292 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ You don't mean that.  You wouldn't disappoint Daddy --
L376291 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Include me out.  I've had enough of the conversations.
L376290 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ ...See you tomorrow night.
L375884 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ What 'business'?
L375883 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ -- Did I hear 'business'?
L375548 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Hi.
L375547 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Hello, Beautiful.
L376446 +++$+++ u6554 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SLOANE +++$+++ He'll wait --
L376445 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Bontecou wants a speedier response than that.
L376444 +++$+++ u6554 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SLOANE +++$+++ We're not getting anywhere here. Why don't we take some of the best out of this thing, let's consider it coolly, let's take a week --
L376337 +++$+++ u6554 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SLOANE +++$+++ Hello, Quince.
L376336 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Thank you for coming.
L376334 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Am I not obligated to?
L376333 +++$+++ u6554 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SLOANE +++$+++ You're taking this too far, Drew.
L376332 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Bill's birthday is the day after tomorrow.  There is a provisory by- law in our charter.  Per the discre- tion of the Board, Corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five.
L376331 +++$+++ u6554 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SLOANE +++$+++ And what would that be?
L376770 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ The dagger --?
L376769 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I appreciate your gentlemanliness, Bill, but what we need to do here is drive the dagger home --
L376768 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ I'm not stepping anywhere --
L376764 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ -- And now you're going to pee some more.
L376763 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ So tell me, tell me, I'm peeing in my pants.
L376392 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Not good, not bad, you know what we got?  Nothing.  No credit, no cars, no mortgages -- no wives.  Nothing.
L376391 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ No, I don't --
L376273 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ I'll make a note of it.  Anything else?
L376272 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Perhaps you could remind me.
L376268 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Susan's patient is whom we are talking about.
L376267 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?
L376266 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.
L376265 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Who are we talking about?
L376231 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Well, I'm going to tell you anyway. I did cheat on that exam at Groton. But so did twenty-six other guys, and nobody ever mentioned it until today.  And I'm expecting you won't mention it again.  I don't know who you are and where you're getting your information, but I'm willing to pretend I did not hear it, and let bygones be bygones.  But can I tell you something else, it'd be nice to see the big guy without you next to him.  What are you, his shadow?  Do you hold his dick for him when he goes to take a leak?  You know some- times somebody would like a few min- utes alone with W.P.  That means without you.  Okay, pal?  Let's eat.
L376230 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ No.
L376155 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yes.
L376154 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ May I interrupting?
L376054 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Then why did you bring it up?
L376053 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ It doesn't matter.
L376052 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Of whom?
L376051 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ It's just a saying, Mr. Black,
L376050 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What an odd pairing.
L376049 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Yes.
L376048 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ "Death and Taxes"?
L376047 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Yes.
L376038 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ And a glass.
L376037 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Cold.
L376036 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Hot or cold.
L376035 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Why yes, thank you.
L376034 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Anything else, Mr. Black?  How about some water?
L376033 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Do you have any more of these deli- cious cookies?
L376032 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ The Board of Parrish Communications - is hereby called to order.  Our sole order of business is an acceptance of John Bontecou's generous offer and --
L376031 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Thank you.
L376030 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Nice to see you.  I didn't expect you, but certainly you can't get enough of a good thing.
L375873 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ 'Here'?
L375872 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Here...
L375871 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Incidentally, Joe, where're you staying?
L375858 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Joe sounds like a ringer, Bill.  I have the feeling you guys got the broad strokes already.  Need any help with the details?
L375857 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I didn't say.
L375856 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ What side of the industry did you say you were on?
L375855 +++$+++ u6551 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ We have an arrangement now.
L376788 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Proof?  We've got plenty of proof.
L376787 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ You're talking through your hat. You're offering a deal because you've got no proof.
L376786 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ You get not to go to jail.
L376785 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ And what do I get?
L376784 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ No lawyers, Drew.  We're going to offer you a deal.
L376783 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ I think I'd like to talk to my lawyer --
L376761 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Is this Mr. Black's fantasy?  Another one of his whoppers?  Aren't you sick of this asshole lurking around? No one knows who he is, but one thing everyone does know, he somehow got your ear and has been pouring poison into it ever since.
L376760 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ The Board didn't know you're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all.
L376759 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ I don't know where you get that idea -- the Board agreed --
L376452 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Mandatory retirement upon our Chairman's sixty-fifth birthday.
L376451 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ In English, please.
L376450 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ But who is he?  What are his creden- tials?  What is his relationship to you?
L376449 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I've already introduced Mr. Black to you all.
L376443 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Are you running this Board or am I?
L376442 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Certainly, Bill.
L376441 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ Yes, you are to understand that, and now may I ask you a question?
L376440 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ So I am to understand from your re- sponse that you do not want to hear the details of Bontecou's offer?
L376439 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either.  What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal.  No, thank you.
L376438 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Don't you want to hear the details?
L376437 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ The answer is no, quick enough for you?
L376436 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Bontecou wants a quick response and --
L376435 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ That's it?
L376433 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I don't think so.  Do you?
L376432 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Did you want to have a cup of coffee or something, Bill?
L376388 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Certainly.  Goodnight.
L376387 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I think it's time you went home, Drew.
L376386 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ I'm just giving you the truth.  There was a time when William Parrish liked the truth.
L376385 +++$+++ u6552 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ PARRISH +++$+++ I'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me.
L376384 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Yours.
