L66195 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Yeah. Spent half his time in the infirmary. Only reason he enlisted was his father. West didn't section him till last week.
L66194 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Epilepsy.
L66193 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?
L66187 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ There were six of us...
L66186 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.
L66185 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300.
L66183 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit. Making it through was kind of an honor. Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight, Command would consider you at the top of the class.
L66182 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?
L67009 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Your weapons, Sergeant.
L67008 +++$+++ u487 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ WEST +++$+++ What the fuck is going on?
L66172 +++$+++ u487 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ WEST +++$+++ The rest of you, fallout for physicals!
L66171 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Sir, yes, sir!
L66170 +++$+++ u487 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ WEST +++$+++ Dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty- four hours! He is not to be given food, water, or clothes! If he so much as moves, you are to blow his nigger brains out, is that clear?
L66169 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Sir, yes, sir!
L66168 +++$+++ u487 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ WEST +++$+++ You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
L66167 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Sir, Dunbar, sir!
L66166 +++$+++ u487 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ WEST +++$+++ Cadet, what's your name!
L66614 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ I...
L66613 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ So you killed him?
L66495 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ So did we. Why didn't you come?
L66494 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ Pike and I got separated... then I heard gunfire. Close.
L66490 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ West... he's dead.
L66489 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ Jesus, what happened?
L66373 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ We were each given three so whoever killed West will be missing one.
L66372 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ Why?
L66371 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Shut up.  Let me see your grenades.
L66365 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ I hated West, Childs hated West, everyone with a goddamn brain hated West but that doesn't mean we killed him!
L66364 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --
L66363 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ He wouldn't kill anybody...
L66604 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Put it down!
L66603 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ A test will no doubt link you to the killing --
L66575 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ We wait and I'm a dead man. I got a black face, a criminal record, and over a hundred other cadets who'll testify how much I hated West -- my court martial will take six minutes. It's either me or them, Ray, and you gotta decide right now.
L66574 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --
L66573 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ There's no time to think, Ray, we gotta get out of here! You untie me, we grab the guns, get Kendall and Nunez, and make a run for it --
L66572 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ This is a lot of information to be getting... I have to think --
L66571 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ What don't you know?
L66570 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ I... I don't know...
L66561 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Mueller and Childs. One of them must've taken the grenade from my pack on the chopper...
L66560 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ They?
L66559 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Way I figure it, West must have found out about their little business and was gonna bust them, so they decided to get rid of him first...
L66557 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ That's close range. You go full auto on a guy from close range, you're gonna be swimming in blood. Look at my uniform. Nothing.
L66556 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ His chest was hamburger --
L66555 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ From up close or far away?
L66554 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Full clip to the body --
L66553 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ You saw West, right? How was he killed?
L66552 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.
L66551 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Becoming a morphine addict during Basic ain't exactly something you want to broadcast. Only Mueller and Childs know.
L66550 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Why... why didn't you tell me?
L66545 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Pull up my sleeve. Right arm.
L66544 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ You're lying --
L66543 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Combat grade morphine. Mueller sold it to me.
L66542 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Just look. Little pocket.
L66541 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Why?
L66540 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Look in my pack.
L66539 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Bullshit.
L66538 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
L66537 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ You hated West, Mueller loved him --
L66536 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Who you gonna trust, Ray? Him or your friend?
L66535 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ That's exactly what he says about you.
L66534 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --
L66533 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Oh, come on --
L66532 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Mueller.
L66531 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ If not you, then who?
L66530 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Ray, this is my life here. I ain't gonna pretend I'm not happy West is gone, but you know I couldn't have done this. It's not in me.
L66529 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Which anyone coulda taken out of my gear on the chopper. Were you watching your pack on the ride in?
L66528 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ You're the only one missing a grenade.
L66527 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
L66526 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ You hated West more than any of us.
L66525 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ You gotta untie me.  I didn't do this thing, Ray.
L66524 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Yeah...
L66523 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Right?
L66517 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Do I?
L66516 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ You know it's not like that --
L66513 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Why?
L66512 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ We just want to check your pack --
L66511 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Roberto, what the fuck?
L66504 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Wandering through a hurricane trying to find this place. It's gettin' bad out there --  Where's West?
L66503 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Where have you been, Jay?
L66379 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ I mean I killed him.  Isn't that what we all wanted?
L66378 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ What do you mean, West's?
L66377 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ West's. Any kindling for afire?
L66376 +++$+++ u478 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Whose blood is that, Jay?
L66753 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Maybe he...
L66752 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ MAYBE WHAT --
L66751 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Maybe --
L66750 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Where are they!
L66749 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ I don't know --
L66748 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ You lied to us, Levi, you're going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them!
L66747 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ But you can't prove it! You can't prove anything until we find the bodies!
L66746 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ I didn't --
L66745 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Or you, Levi? When is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him?
L66727 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Because I was standing next to him.
L66726 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ How do you know?
L66722 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Because of what I saw.  Who really killed West.
L66721 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Why?
L66708 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ I didn't do anything --
L66707 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not --
L66702 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ I was just thinking of what's going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you.
L66701 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Something funny, Levi?
L66692 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Then we'll leave it up to the courts -- His word against mine. What does his father do again? Steelworker?  Doesn't matter, I'm sure justice will be served. In any case, my father will definitely want to talk to you about all these questions, these accusations on his son. He's quite protective.
L66691 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Dunbar will testify that you were.
L66689 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Sorry to disappoint. I'm on painkillers for the injury -- they cloud the mind. You're right, it was Nunez. Any more questions?
L66688 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Well?
L66687 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ I believe your next line is "What are you trying to hide?"
L66686 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Huh. You know, I really thought you said Nunez. I thought you said "Dunbar was gone," My fault, I gotta check the tape on that.  Oh, yeah we taped the last interview. This one too. Cause it'd be a real break for us to catch you in a lie.
L66685 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ No. I said Dunbar.
L66684 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
L66683 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
L66682 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Why did you tell us he shot everybody, Levi? You put him in for three murders, the man saved your life --
L66679 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ There's that word again.  As I told you, I wasn't in the room when everyone started shooting.
L66678 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Is it the truth?
L66675 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ My heart weeps.
L66674 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Epileptic attacks are murder on your system. Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer.
L66672 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Can I go to jail for punching a guy who's been shot?
L66671 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
L66670 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar --
L66486 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Stop.
L66485 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Somebody emptied a full clip into him --
L66404 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Mr. Hardy?
L66403 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Okay. I think that's it. He rises and walks to the door.
L66402 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ I honestly don't know. Maybe to have someone to cover for him. And I wish I could, but there's no doubt in my mind he killed those men.
L66401 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Why did he come back for you?
L66381 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Right in front of us. Mueller went after him but we held him back.
L66380 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ He admitted it.
L66311 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ No. Poetic justice, though.
L66310 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ But you didn't.
L66309 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Maybe I shouldn't tell you that. Maybe I should tell you I wasn't scared at all. But I was...  Enough to almost kill him.
L66294 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Then who did?
L66293 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ I didn't kill him --
L66292 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ What happened to "degrees"?
L66291 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.
L66290 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Levi, I don't know if you're familiar with investigative work, but we have this little thing called "motive" and you just gave yourself one.
L66262 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ The Sergeant discovered this relationship and wanted me expelled. My father interceded, so instead, West Sectioned me and made sure every other cadet knew that I was gay.
L66261 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ I think you just blew "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" out of the fucking water.
L66260 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him. However, in the last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What do you think of that?
L66259 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
L66258 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ My father is a powerful man. Over the years he's used that power to protect me, in one form or another, from certain... unpleasantries.  I am a homosexual.
L66244 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ My, my, my, how did things turn so hostile so quickly? If I didn't know better, I'd say you two were out to get me.
L66243 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ But not the only victim, right?
L66242 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ I've done nothing wrong.  I'm the victim here.
L66241 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Levi, you got about four hours before armed men show up here, put you on a plane to Washington, and lock you in a very small dark room. I suggest you talk to us.
L66240 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ That's it. You're that policeman with friends in low places. Tell me, how's Guissepe Torres doing these days? Those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer --
L66239 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Coast Guard, special detective detail. We feel this incident may have put the beaches of Florida at risk.
L66238 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ You... I've seen you around the Base. But you...  You're not Army, are you?
L66980 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Get your hands away from the desk!
L66979 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about --
L66978 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen.
L66977 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ You're crazy --
L66976 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ No more witnesses. West's a ghost. But it doesn't matter because we have your signature, the hospital log, and Kendall's toxicology report. And that'll be enough.
L66975 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Not for long.
L66974 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.
L66973 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it --
L66972 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ I'm not even going to dignify that --
L66971 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike.
L66970 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ I wanted to see if he was okay --
L66969 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Toxicology report came back. Kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine, maybe you've heard of it. It's for asthmatics. If an epileptic takes enough, it kills them. I checked with the nurses at the hospital -- you're the only other person who visited Kendall.
L66968 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ That's preposterous --
L66967 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too.
L66966 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ West had a partner. Someone who knew how to get things done.
L66965 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ Or what? You've gone round the bend --
L66964 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Stay where you are.
L66962 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ I'm not going to cover for you, Bill. Not for this.
L66961 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ You're drunk --
L66960 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.
L66959 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L66958 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ It was so good, I actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. The Base Commander. The one in control. You couldn't let him testify, could you?
L66789 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ I thought you said that wasn't a compliment.
L66788 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ You're a good soldier, Bill.
L66787 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world.
L66786 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ I'm sorry, Bill.
L66785 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ The Senator...
L66784 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ They're taking your command, aren't they?
L66781 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ I wouldn't know where to start.  I guess it was about one man framing another. He thought if the other guy got blamed, people would over look his own wrong doings.
L66780 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ You think you could explain all this to me?
L66778 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ Maybe. But it's my fault and I'll carry it.
L66777 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ That's horseshit and you know it.
L66776 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ It's over. Time of death was 4:42. JAG's been notified and I called the Senator myself. My report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable... you two had no culpability in the matter.
L66654 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ Does Osborne agree?
L66653 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Yeah.
L66652 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level?
L66651 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ What I said before --
L66455 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ I'm talking about West! We had him, Bill, we were there. You're the fucking Base Commander, you knew what he did to Cadets and you let him go on the way he always he has --
L66454 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ What the hell are you talking about --
L66453 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ You want a confession? Why don't you confess, Bill: people are dead and you don't give a shit about it! Only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job, you know this is your fault --
L66452 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ What about the confession?
L66451 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Home, I'm done.

L66429 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ JAG gets here in three hours. Try for the confession.

L66427 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ Not for me.
L66426 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.
L66425 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ Nevertheless --
L66424 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.
L66423 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.
L66422 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --
L66421 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.
L66420 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.
L66419 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ We've already been over the terrain twice. Nothing.
L66408 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Someone must have got a shot off. He wasn't exactly a moving target.
