L302806 +++$+++ u1479 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ RENE +++$+++ I am confused. Or maybe it's you.
L302805 +++$+++ u1475 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ No. No one to speak of.
L302804 +++$+++ u1479 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ RENE +++$+++ Is someone else here?
L302799 +++$+++ u1475 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ ...I'm looking for someone.
L302798 +++$+++ u1479 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ RENE +++$+++ What do you do about what?
L303260 +++$+++ u1480 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ RYUJI +++$+++ I don't know.
L303259 +++$+++ u1475 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What about the others.
L303258 +++$+++ u1480 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ RYUJI +++$+++ Someone is selling. You followed us. If it's not him, it must be you. If it's not you, it must be him... You scared him off.
L303257 +++$+++ u1475 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Why'd you invite me here?
L303256 +++$+++ u1480 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ RYUJI +++$+++ We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.
L303255 +++$+++ u1475 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Why are you on to him?
L303254 +++$+++ u1480 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ RYUJI +++$+++ I can't. He didn't do anything. Thanks to you.
L303201 +++$+++ u1475 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Could have been drunk a little sooner, but excellent...good character...What is it?
L303200 +++$+++ u1480 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ RYUJI +++$+++ Excuse me?

L303010 +++$+++ u1480 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ RYUJI +++$+++ What could you find in this place?
L302989 +++$+++ u1475 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ It keeps me busy. Everybody always wants something.
L302988 +++$+++ u1480 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ RYUJI +++$+++ Must be a fulfilling occupation.
L302188 +++$+++ u1475 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Thanks.

L302185 +++$+++ u1478 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ RECEPTIONIST. +++$+++ Is there anything else?

L302213 +++$+++ u1476 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ LEADER +++$+++ Yes.
L302212 +++$+++ u1482 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ TECH 3 +++$+++ Tear it apart?
L302211 +++$+++ u1476 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ LEADER +++$+++ That's alright. Just tear it apart.
L302210 +++$+++ u1482 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ TECH 3 +++$+++ I can't get it out. It would take hours.
L302209 +++$+++ u1476 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ LEADER +++$+++ Could I have it, please.
L302208 +++$+++ u1482 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ TECH 3 +++$+++ Just one. The back up.
L302207 +++$+++ u1476 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ LEADER +++$+++ It will be fine. You have another.
L302206 +++$+++ u1482 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ TECH 3 +++$+++ It is?
L302205 +++$+++ u1476 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ LEADER +++$+++ It's alright.
L302204 +++$+++ u1482 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ TECH 3 +++$+++ The experiment. The danger...
L302203 +++$+++ u1476 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ LEADER +++$+++ Why not?
L302202 +++$+++ u1482 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ TECH 3 +++$+++ You can't take that.
L302201 +++$+++ u1476 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ LEADER +++$+++ Why?
L302200 +++$+++ u1482 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ TECH 3 +++$+++ Wait.
L302228 +++$+++ u1481 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ TECH 2 +++$+++ No?
L302227 +++$+++ u1476 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ LEADER +++$+++ It doesn't hurt.
L302226 +++$+++ u1481 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ TECH 2 +++$+++ It will.

L302198 +++$+++ u1481 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ TECH 2 +++$+++ Right there.
L302574 +++$+++ u1482 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ TECH 3 +++$+++ What about Al...
L302573 +++$+++ u1481 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ TECH 2 +++$+++ So we better get started.
L302572 +++$+++ u1482 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ TECH 3 +++$+++ It'l take months.
L302564 +++$+++ u1481 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ TECH 2 +++$+++ Whoever took it does.
L302563 +++$+++ u1482 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ TECH 3 +++$+++ Look, nobody knows we did it.
L302561 +++$+++ u1481 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ TECH 2 +++$+++ Too much.
L302560 +++$+++ u1482 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ TECH 3 +++$+++ What does he know?
L302559 +++$+++ u1481 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ TECH 2 +++$+++ What'd he say, how's he know about Al?
L302258 +++$+++ u1481 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ TECH 2 +++$+++ Poor bastard.
L302257 +++$+++ u1482 +++$+++ m100 +++$+++ TECH 3 +++$+++ Screw the PEM...What about Al...
L303971 +++$+++ u1485 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ In the backyard.
L303970 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Where?
L303969 +++$+++ u1485 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ I heard them.
L303968 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Did you see somebody or did you hear them?
L303967 +++$+++ u1485 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ What's that outside, Daddy?
L303966 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Hey, baby. What's wrong?
L303715 +++$+++ u1485 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Can I go over to Janeane's house?
L303714 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Instant rice...?
L303713 +++$+++ u1485 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ I'll take some.
L303702 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Pooh's dusty, sweetheart... he's dusty, and you breathed him in, okay? So what's -- what's happening to you now is... cells called mast cells told your lungs "don't breathe any more of that dust in."  ...and the airways in your lungs are like branches. And when the branches close up, you get an asthmatic attack. And, we give you medicine, and you get better. Huh? Okay? You're better already, aren't you?
L303701 +++$+++ u1485 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ She was playing with the Pooh doll.
L303700 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Here we go. Deep breaths, deep breaths.
L303698 +++$+++ u1485 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ She was playing with my Pooh doll again...
L303697 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Sweetheart, c'mon. C'mon.
L303692 +++$+++ u1485 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Okay.
L303691 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ That's great... Little early for cartoons, isn't it?
L303690 +++$+++ u1485 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ For reading.
L303689 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Yeah? What for?
L303688 +++$+++ u1485 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.
L303687 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ What's new?
L303686 +++$+++ u1485 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Hi, Daddy.
L303685 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ Hi, honey.
L304485 +++$+++ u1485 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ There's Dad, on TV.
L304484 +++$+++ u1497 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LIANE +++$+++ Yes, baby?
L304483 +++$+++ u1485 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Mom.
L304482 +++$+++ u1497 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LIANE +++$+++ Alright, we'll do that tomorrow.
L304481 +++$+++ u1485 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ Yeah.
L304480 +++$+++ u1497 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LIANE +++$+++ That remote control thing?
L304479 +++$+++ u1485 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ BARBARA +++$+++ He's into kind of little cars, that...
L304571 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ You got a deal. 
L304570 +++$+++ u1486 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ BILL ROBERTSON'S VOICE +++$+++ Three hours.
L304569 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ How long?
L304568 +++$+++ u1486 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ BILL ROBERTSON'S VOICE +++$+++ We'll give you a heads up before we launch.
L304565 +++$+++ u1486 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ BILL ROBERTSON'S VOICE +++$+++ Lowell?
L304564 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Just ran into two of your "geologists." Geologists whose hands aren't all chewed up...?
L304130 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ You better take a good look! Because I'm getting two things: pissed off and curious! Now, any of these guys been offered jobs in corporate security after they retire? Either one of those guys have ex-agent pals already in those jobs? Like, for instance, their ex-supervisor, who's already at Brown & Williamson as we fucking speak?
L304129 +++$+++ u1486 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ BILL ROBERTSON'S VOICE +++$+++ Let me tell you something, Lowell. Look, look, look. You're talking about two agents in a regional office in Louisville. I got the goddamn Unabomber threatening to blow up LAX! I gotta move 45 agents from all over the country into L.A.  Alright? When I get a chance, I'll give it a look...
L304476 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Have them make their own calls. They'll find that these sources have a different story than the one that's in the dossier...  Push the deadline, Charlie...
L304475 +++$+++ u1487 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ CHARLIE PHILLIPS +++$+++ Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin.
L304474 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ These are their leads, their sources. I want you to have your reporters...
L304446 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Yeah. Catch you later.
L304445 +++$+++ u1487 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ CHARLIE PHILLIPS +++$+++ Are you all right?
L304444 +++$+++ u1487 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ CHARLIE PHILLIPS +++$+++ I'll take a look at what you got. But I'm not moving any deadlines 'cause you say so.
L304443 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ And it's bullshit. And if I'm right, are you going to put the Journal's reputation behind a story that's going to blow up in your face?
L304442 +++$+++ u1487 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ CHARLIE PHILLIPS +++$+++ Well, it's authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented.
L304441 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Oh, it's real selective... about as hard to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone book.
L304440 +++$+++ u1487 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ CHARLIE PHILLIPS +++$+++ It's drawn from a selectively circulated...
L304439 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
L304438 +++$+++ u1487 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ CHARLIE PHILLIPS +++$+++ What? Forget it.
L304437 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Push it.
L304436 +++$+++ u1487 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ CHARLIE PHILLIPS +++$+++ Monday.
L304435 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ When's your deadline?
L304420 +++$+++ u1487 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ CHARLIE PHILLIPS +++$+++ I'll be there.
L304419 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ P.J.'s.
L304418 +++$+++ u1487 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ CHARLIE PHILLIPS +++$+++ Sure. Where?
L304417 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ We gotta hook up.
L304416 +++$+++ u1487 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ CHARLIE PHILLIPS +++$+++ You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
L304415 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?
L304632 +++$+++ u1488 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ DEBBIE DELUCA +++$+++ The sub-heading is, "Brown & Williamson Has a 500-Page Dossier Attacking Chief Critic." It quotes Richard Scruggs calling it "the worst kind of an organized smear campaign against a whistle-blower."
L304631 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Good.
L304630 +++$+++ u1488 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ DEBBIE DELUCA +++$+++ Yeah. Yeah, sure. I'll see if I can find him. Hold on...  Yeah, Don's looking for you...
L304592 +++$+++ u1488 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ DEBBIE DELUCA +++$+++ Okay. Hold on a second... What is it?
L304591 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ I can't get out of here til mid- morning. I'll be in tomorrow night...  Listen, could you call a number for me, it's in Mississippi...
L304382 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ ...fuck is this? Fuck!
L304381 +++$+++ u1488 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ DEBBIE DELUCA +++$+++ Sure.
L304380 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Get me Wigand.
L304379 +++$+++ u1488 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ DEBBIE DELUCA +++$+++ What was that about?
L304263 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Tell her I'll call her back in ten.
L304262 +++$+++ u1488 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ DEBBIE DELUCA +++$+++ Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon's on line 3.
L304261 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ When's the air date?
L304079 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Get me to New Orleans this afternoon. I'll shoot the fucking thing myself!
L304078 +++$+++ u1488 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ DEBBIE DELUCA +++$+++ Alright, alright.
L304077 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Oh, for God's sake, what has this guy got, a horse fetish?
L304076 +++$+++ u1488 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ DEBBIE DELUCA +++$+++ I don't know what he was thinking.
L304075 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Oh, we need cops on the street. We don't need them on horses.
L304074 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Shit...
L303951 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Because he has to reveal it in a court of law. It's on record, it's out. It's no secret anymore. So how can they restrain his speech or retaliate? It's out in the world...
L303950 +++$+++ u1488 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ DEBBIE DELUCA +++$+++ What I mean is, like, how does it cut through the confidentiality agreement?
L303949 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ What do you mean, what's it do?
L303948 +++$+++ u1488 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ DEBBIE DELUCA +++$+++ What does that do?
L303844 +++$+++ u1488 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ DEBBIE DELUCA +++$+++ Okay.
L303843 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ I want you to get legal onto CORPORATE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS. Boundaries of their constraint. Kentucky state law about. I want you to drop everything.
L304082 +++$+++ u1489 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Oh, I love that stuff.
L304081 +++$+++ u1497 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LIANE +++$+++ I'm cooking pasta primavera.
L304080 +++$+++ u1489 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ What are you cooking?
L303712 +++$+++ u1497 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LIANE +++$+++ How about you?
L303711 +++$+++ u1489 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Maybe later.
L303710 +++$+++ u1497 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LIANE +++$+++ Do you want more rice?
L303705 +++$+++ u1497 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LIANE +++$+++ ...if you are, then I'll take Barbara to soccer and take you to dance after...
L303704 +++$+++ u1489 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Can I go to dance tomorrow? I'm better...
L304636 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ No, you fucked you! Don't invert stuff! Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand; you bought it. The Wall Street Journal, here, not exactly a bastion of anti-capitalist sentiment, refutes Big Tobacco's smear campaign as the lowest form of character assassination! And now, even now, when every word of what Wigand has said on our show is printed, the entire deposition of his testimony in a court of law in the State of Mississippi, the cat totally out of the bag, you're still standing here debating! Don, what the hell else... do you need?
L304635 +++$+++ u1490 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ DON HEWITT +++$+++ The New York Times ran a blow by blow of what we talked about behind closed doors! You fucked us!
L304458 +++$+++ u1490 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ DON HEWITT +++$+++ Hey! I'm not going to fire you, okay? Take a vacation. Now!
L304457 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ No. I should have. I told them I disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that this segment is as good as the original. I'm not lying for you. I'm not gonna shut up for you. Not on any of it.
L304456 +++$+++ u1490 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ DON HEWITT +++$+++ No, not that. I'm talking about the Associated Press. They got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to Mike and I. Did you tell them that we were lying?
L304455 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.
L304454 +++$+++ u1490 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ DON HEWITT +++$+++ What the hell are you doing?
L304376 +++$+++ u1490 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ DON HEWITT +++$+++ End up in a high-profile lawsuit with Lowell, the First Amendment martyr? I don't think so.  Take a look at this... This is a summary of a dossier that's being prepared.
L304375 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ I'm staying right here. Doing my job. Fighting to get my show on the air. You don't like it? Hey, I'll tell you what... fire my ass...
L304374 +++$+++ u1490 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ DON HEWITT +++$+++ Then what are you going to do?
L304373 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ No. I'm not going to take "no" for an answer. No.
L304372 +++$+++ u1490 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ DON HEWITT +++$+++ You're taking "no" for an answer?
L304371 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Well, what do you think I'm going to do? Quit in protest? I'm not going to do that.
L304370 +++$+++ u1490 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ DON HEWITT +++$+++ So, what are you going to do?
L304326 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ C'mon, what are you? And are you a businessman? Or are you a newsman?! Because that happens to be what Mike and I do for a living...
L304325 +++$+++ u1490 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ DON HEWITT +++$+++ You are a fanatic. An anarchist. You know that? If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show. But oh, no, not you. You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk!
L304324 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ I am? You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out. To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets!
L304323 +++$+++ u1490 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ DON HEWITT +++$+++ You're exaggerating!
L304322 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ No, I'm questioning your hearing! You hear "reasonable" and "tortious interference." I hear... "Potential Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of CBS to Westinghouse." I hear... "Shut the segment down. Cut Wigand loose. Obey orders. And fuck off...!" That's what I hear.
L304321 +++$+++ u1490 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ DON HEWITT +++$+++ CBS does not do that. And, you're questioning our journalistic integrity?!
L304320 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money. They work for free. And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer.
L304319 +++$+++ u1490 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ DON HEWITT +++$+++ Are you suggesting that she and Eric are influenced by money?
L304316 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ It's not a rumor. It's a sale.  If Tisch can unload CBS for $81 a share to Westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit from Brown & Williamson, that could screw up the sale, could it not?
L304315 +++$+++ u1490 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ DON HEWITT +++$+++ Yeah, I heard rumors.
L304310 +++$+++ u1490 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ DON HEWITT +++$+++ It's an alternate version. So what if we have an alternate version? And I don't think her being cautious is so damned unreasonable.
L304309 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Since when has the paragon of investigative journalism allowed lawyers to determine the news content on "60 Minutes"?
L304295 +++$+++ u1490 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ DON HEWITT +++$+++ Lunch?
L304294 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ "Tortious interference"? Sounds like a disease caught by a radio.
L304258 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Yeah, they argued he was going to reveal the secret formula of "Kools" to the world.  "Sealed" doesn't hurt Scruggs' litigation, and since we're the only ones with the story, I believe we're sitting on an exclusive.
L304257 +++$+++ u1490 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ DON HEWITT +++$+++ I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.
L304318 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ I'm not implying. I'm quoting. More vested interests...  "Persons Who Will Profit From This Merger...  Ms. Helen Caperelli, General Counsel of CBS News, 3.9 million. Mr. Eric Kluster, President of CBS News, 1.4 million..."
L304317 +++$+++ u1491 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ ERIC KLUSTER +++$+++ And what are you implying?
L304312 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ Before you go...
L304311 +++$+++ u1491 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ ERIC KLUSTER +++$+++ So, now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen, Mr. Rather's been complaining about his chair again.  As they start to leave...
L304308 +++$+++ u1491 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ ERIC KLUSTER +++$+++ We're doing this with or without you, Lowell. If you like, I can assign another producer to edit your show...
L304307 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ No, I'm not...
L304306 +++$+++ u1491 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ ERIC KLUSTER +++$+++ I'm afraid you are.
L304305 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ I'm not touching my film...
L304304 +++$+++ u1491 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ ERIC KLUSTER +++$+++ That's happening. And, hopefully we won't have to use the alternate, but we should have it in the can.
L304303 +++$+++ u1499 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ LOWELL +++$+++ So, what happened to Ms. Caperelli's checking with outside counsel first, all that crap?
L304302 +++$+++ u1491 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ ERIC KLUSTER +++$+++ There has been so much soul searching about this Wigand, I've decided we should cut an alternate version of the show without his interview.
L304126 +++$+++ u1492 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ FBI AGENT #2 +++$+++ You alright, Mr. Wigand?
L304125 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ That computer has everything...
L304123 +++$+++ u1510 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ WIGAND +++$+++ ...my files! Personal correspondence...
L304122 +++$+++ u1492 +++$+++ m101 +++$+++ FBI AGENT #2 +++$+++ We have a search warrant, Mr. Wigand. There's been a death threat.
