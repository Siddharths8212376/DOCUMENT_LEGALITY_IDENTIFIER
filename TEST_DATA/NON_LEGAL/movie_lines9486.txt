L630825 +++$+++ u3396 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
L630824 +++$+++ u3391 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Did you get this from your lover?
L630822 +++$+++ u3391 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Laura didn't wash her hands before dinner.  And look at this.
L630821 +++$+++ u3396 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Leland...
L630820 +++$+++ u3391 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Look at this finger here.
L630819 +++$+++ u3396 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Leland, what are you doing?
L630720 +++$+++ u3391 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ This is serious. Mr. Benjamin Horne's got a delegation of Norwegians coming in next week and I want both of you to learn to introduce yourself. Sarah, you first.
L630719 +++$+++ u3396 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Neither is mine. And can't we talk about something serious for a change.
L630714 +++$+++ u3396 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Oh, Leland.
L630713 +++$+++ u3391 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Hello, Laura. Hello Sarah. Where's my axe?  "I'm hungry".
L631015 +++$+++ u3391 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Nothing, I chickened out.
L631014 +++$+++ u3399 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ What's wrong?
L631007 +++$+++ u3391 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ That's right.
L631006 +++$+++ u3399 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ I don't know.
L631005 +++$+++ u3391 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Who am I?
L631004 +++$+++ u3399 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ What are you doing?
L631003 +++$+++ u3399 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ I can arrange that. I like that.
L631002 +++$+++ u3391 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Soon. How about next time we party with the girlfriends you told me about?
L631001 +++$+++ u3399 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ When's the next business trip, big fella?
L630872 +++$+++ u3392 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ What did you say?
L630871 +++$+++ u3397 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ Come off it, Leo. I'm late for work...
L630870 +++$+++ u3392 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ I'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it.
L630869 +++$+++ u3397 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ As if I didn't know.
L630868 +++$+++ u3392 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ That's one thing you are going to learn, Shelly, -- HOW TO CLEAN. It takes scrubbing, Shelly. There is no easy way. THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE, SHELLY.
L630867 +++$+++ u3392 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ Anybody can clean the surface of an object, but dirt can find its way anywhere. To really clean, you have to scrub below the surface.  WHERE THE DIRT IS, SHELLY.
L630866 +++$+++ u3397 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ Lay off the bennies, Leo.
L630865 +++$+++ u3392 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ Someone who knows how to clean knows where the object was before she started cleaning and then that object goes back to its exact same spot. Shelly, I know where everything in this house is. Sometimes on the road I mentally go through this whole house and picture where every item is.
L630764 +++$+++ u3394 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Don't worry, Shelly, I'll handle Leo.
L630763 +++$+++ u3397 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ If Leo comes here, he won't believe that I am out doing the "Meals on Wheels".
L630762 +++$+++ u3394 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Come back as soon as you can.
L630761 +++$+++ u3397 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ Norma, are you alright?
L630760 +++$+++ u3394 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ There's no one here.
L630759 +++$+++ u3397 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ You're right. There's no one here.
L630758 +++$+++ u3394 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ What's with that Laura? Yeah, sure, take a look around. There's no one here anyway.
L630757 +++$+++ u3397 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ Laura just took off. She asked me to do the run today. Should I do it?
L630746 +++$+++ u3394 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ You're not busy, sweetheart, now go.
L630745 +++$+++ u3397 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ SHELLY +++$+++ I'm kind of busy, Norma.
L630744 +++$+++ u3394 +++$+++ m224 +++$+++ NORMA +++$+++ Shelly, would you give Laura a quick hand with the "Meals on Wheels"?
L636926 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Ah. How did they treat you?
L636925 +++$+++ u3401 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ ABRAMS +++$+++ Yes.
L636924 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Good.  You ever been inside a hospital?
L636923 +++$+++ u3401 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ ABRAMS +++$+++ I'm fine.
L636922 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Abrams. Yes. How are you today?
L636921 +++$+++ u3401 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ ABRAMS +++$+++ Abrams...
L636920 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Mr. Abraham...
L637199 +++$+++ u3422 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ YOUNG LAWYER +++$+++ As far as we know, nothing.
L637198 +++$+++ u3402 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
L637197 +++$+++ u3422 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ YOUNG LAWYER +++$+++ Very good.
L637196 +++$+++ u3402 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ How good's your intelligence?
L637195 +++$+++ u3422 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ YOUNG LAWYER +++$+++ Nothing.
L637194 +++$+++ u3402 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ What did he find?
L637193 +++$+++ u3422 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ YOUNG LAWYER +++$+++ She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
L637192 +++$+++ u3402 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
L636719 +++$+++ u3402 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ Yes.
L636718 +++$+++ u3403 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?
L636717 +++$+++ u3402 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ Well, of course, it's always dangerous...
L636716 +++$+++ u3403 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
L636715 +++$+++ u3402 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ All right. But let's keep the price down. I've called Ed Concannon. He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
L636714 +++$+++ u3403 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ So what I want to do is stop it here. I'm going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself. I want it to come from me.
L636713 +++$+++ u3402 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ No. Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
L636712 +++$+++ u3403 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ I want to settle this thing and be done with it. I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
L636711 +++$+++ u3402 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ Neither does he. That's where he loses. This man's scared to death to go to court. We only have to call his bluff.
L636710 +++$+++ u3403 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ No -- we don't want this case in court.
L636709 +++$+++ u3402 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ This is a nuisance suit. He's looking for small change. He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
L636708 +++$+++ u3403 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ ...tell me about this case.
L636707 +++$+++ u3402 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ The man's an ambulance chaser...
L636706 +++$+++ u3403 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ Four cases in three years...
L636705 +++$+++ u3402 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ ALITO +++$+++ Accused. Not indicted. He resigned the firm. Divorced nineteen seventy. Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy- eight. Since then he's been on his own. Four cases before the Circuit Court. He lost them all. He drinks.
L636704 +++$+++ u3403 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ He was accused of jury tampering.
L636814 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone. She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends -- and the people who should care for her: her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way. We have been paid to look the other way. I came in here to take your money.  I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money.  I can't take it. If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser.  I can't do it. I can't take it.
L636813 +++$+++ u3403 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ What is the truth?
L636812 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ And no one will know the truth.
L636811 +++$+++ u3403 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.
L636810 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Yes. It would be.
L636809 +++$+++ u3403 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ That was our insurance company's recommendation.
L636808 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount. Two Hundred Ten Thousand. That would mean I keep seventy.
L636807 +++$+++ u3403 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ Yes.
L636806 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ You thought it was just.
L636805 +++$+++ u3403 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ We thought it was just.
L636804 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ How did you settle on the amount?
L636803 +++$+++ u3403 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin...  ...nothing can make the woman well... but we try to compensate... to make a gesture...
L636740 +++$+++ u3404 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Does that mean I'm back for awhile?
L636739 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ They want to settle.  It means a lot of money.
L636738 +++$+++ u3404 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What does it mean?
L636737 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ That's the call that I'm waiting for.
L636734 +++$+++ u3404 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Frank Galvin's... who's calling please? Bishop Brophy's office...
L636733 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ This is going to drive the ante up.
L636732 +++$+++ u3404 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ ...a Mrs. Doneghy called... I told you that.
L636731 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
L636730 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ You know what that would mean?
L636729 +++$+++ u3404 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ It looks that way.
L636728 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...he wants to testify...?
L636727 +++$+++ u3404 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Mickey told him to call.  'He's some very hotshot surgeon at Mass. Commonwealth. He wants to meet with you at seven tonight re testimony in the case of Deborah Ann Kaye. You meet him at the hospital.'
L636726 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Gruber...
L636725 +++$+++ u3404 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ ...that was a Dr. David Gruber's office...
L636724 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...yes. Get her on the phone...
L636723 +++$+++ u3404 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ ...here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy...
L636722 +++$+++ u3404 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Mickey told me to come back to work.
L636721 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L637501 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in. He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.  And he told me to change the form. He told me to change the one to a nine.  Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me. He said I'd never work again... Who were these men...? Who were these men...? I wanted to be a nurse...
L637500 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ And why, please tell us, would you think that?
L637499 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I thought I would need it.
L637498 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ ...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it four years? This is a... why? Why would you do that?
L637494 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Because I kept a copy. I have it right here.
L637493 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ You didn't write that figure. And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
L637492 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
L637491 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ You've just said you signed it.
L637490 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ That's not my handwriting.
L637489 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
L637488 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I do. Yes.
L637487 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ 'They lied.' Indeed! When did they lie? And do you know what a lie is?
L637486 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ They lied.
L637483 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ You know these doctors could have settled out of court. They wanted a trial. They wanted to clear their names.
L637482 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I...
L637481 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago. Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie. When were you lying?
L637480 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I... yes.
L637479 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ And wasn't that an oath...? These are your initials here: K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath. No less important than that which you took today.  Isn't that right?  Isn't that right...?
L637478 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I...
L637477 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Now. I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed...?
L637476 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Yes.
L637475 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ ...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
L637474 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Yes.
L637473 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Just now...
L637472 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ Yes.
L637471 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that. Isn't that right?
L637470 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ No.
L637469 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ You would not...?
L637468 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ I wouldn't do it.
L637467 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Yes.  It is a crime. A serious crime.
L637466 +++$+++ u3413 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ KATHY +++$+++ It's a crime.
L637465 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
L637232 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Objection.
L637231 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ I did.
L637228 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Do you, indeed. I'll bet you do. Fine. Fine. We'll save the court the time. We will admit the Doctor as an 'expert witness,' fine.
L637227 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
L637226 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ Sir. Yes. When a thing is wrong... as in this case, I am available. I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.
L637225 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Yes, we've heard that. Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians? Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
L637224 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ I'm on the staff of...
L637223 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Uh-huh. Still practice a lot of medicine?
L637222 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ I am seventy-four years old.
L637221 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ How old are you?
L637220 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ 'Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes.
L637219 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ ...of Anesthesiology?
L637218 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ Meth... Methodology and Technique...
L637217 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ What book is that?
L637216 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ Through, through his book.
L637215 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ How is that?
L637214 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ I know of him.
L637213 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
L637212 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ I'm just an M.D.
L637211 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Orthopedics?
L637210 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ No.
L637209 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Neurology?
L637208 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ No.
L637207 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ ...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor. Certified in Internal Medicine?
L637206 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State...
L637205 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
L637204 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ Just as you are, Sir...
L637203 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Engaged to render an opinion. For a price. Is that correct? You're being paid to be here today?
L637202 +++$+++ u3407 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. THOMPSON +++$+++ That is correct. I was engaged to render an opinion.
L637201 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye. Is that correct?
L637485 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
L637484 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Objection!
L637292 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Your Honor...! Your Honor...
L637291 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...almost nine minutes... causing brain damage.
L637290 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
L637289 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ ...to get her heartbeat back...?
L637288 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Objection, we've...
L636901 +++$+++ u3409 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ GALVIN +++$+++ Frank Galvin. We've met before.
L636900 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Ed Concannon.
L637512 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ I'm going to uphold that.
L637511 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Thank you, your Honor. Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a 'Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony. As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
L637510 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.  It's unsubstantiated and we can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
L637509 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ ...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
L637508 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Thank you, your Honor. We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetent and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code: 'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.' And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now: we object to the admission of the Xerox form.
L637503 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ You may step down.
L637502 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ No further questions.
L637496 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ I'll rule on that presently.  Proceed.
L637495 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Objection! This is ri... expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...
L637437 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Mr. Galvin, rebuttal?
L637436 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Nothing further, your Honor.
L637435 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Mr. Concannon...?
L636911 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ My doctors didn't want a settlement at any price. They wanted this cleared up in court. They want their vindication. I agree with them. But for today the offer stands. Before we begin the publicity of a trial. For today only.  When I walk out that door the offer is withdrawn.  As long as you understand that.  It's got to be that way.
L636910 +++$+++ u3412 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Huh!
L636909 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.
L637077 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ Tell us.
L637076 +++$+++ u3408 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ My God, we tried to save her... You can't know... You can't know...
L637075 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ You reached down into death. Now, isn't that right?
L637074 +++$+++ u3408 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ Yes!
L637073 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ ...to save her and to save the baby. Is that...
L637072 +++$+++ u3408 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ ...We did everything we could...
L637071 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ ...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
L637070 +++$+++ u3408 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ Yes.
L637069 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ ...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear. Isn't that what you did?
L637068 +++$+++ u3408 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ Well, we...
L637067 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ And what did your team do...
L637066 +++$+++ u3408 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ That's right.
L637065 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ ...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen.
L637063 +++$+++ u3405 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ CONCANNON +++$+++ She THREW UP IN HER MASK. Let's cut the bullshit. Say it: She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
L637062 +++$+++ u3408 +++$+++ m225 +++$+++ DR. TOWLER +++$+++ She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
