L508600 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ The Dixie Cups?  Oh my.  I was just a girl.  Of course.  SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE
L508599 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Mary Patrick -- do you remember the Dixie Cups?
L508598 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ It's a rhythm section.  The beat.
L508597 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ I know.  It's ancient.
L508596 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ That machine.
L508586 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ No way.  We're a choir, right? Headliners.  The big room.  Two days a week won't cut it.  Every day.
L508585 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ Two days.  An hour or so.
L508575 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ The goods.  The sound.  The sale.  Let's rearrange a few things.  Mary Patrick, you re not a natural soprano, you're an alto.  Get over here.  Mary Robert --with the sopranos.
L508574 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ Chops?
L508573 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ You see?  We've got the voices.  They're just allover the place. I've heard all of you, in the shower --you're decent. Better than me.  We just need charts -- harmony -- chops.
L508555 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ Mary Clarence, could you?  Mary Lazarus, you're terrific, but...  Could you help us?
L508554 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Hold on.
L508527 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ Sure is!  Come on in, and sing a spell.
L508526 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Is this... choir practice?
L508396 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ I love my heddles.  Show me again.
L508395 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ Shuttle, beat, shed.  And watch your heddles.
L508394 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ You betcha.
L508393 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Just about.  Show me again.
L508392 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ Isn't it lovely?  Now I'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in.  You just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed.  Then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed.  Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed.  Keep tension on the warp.  Is that clear?
L508391 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Oh, right.  At my old place, we used to... wash cars.  Groom dogs.  So... nice loom.
L508390 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ Mary Clarence.  Goose.  We're completely self-supporting.  Like all convents. Like yours.
L508389 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ But don't you get money?  From the Vatican?
L508388 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
L508387 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Why?
L508386 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy.  I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.
L508385 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Not in years.
L508384 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ The minute I saw you. I said to myself, she's a weaver.  Have you ever used a loom?
L508312 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ No. HEY -- HE KNOWS THAT YOU BEEN CREATING NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET A BEATING
L508311 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ 1961?  '62?  Mary Clarence, that's when many of us took final vows.  It's the last secular music we recall.
L508308 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ I haven't heard that song in ages.  The Ronettes?
L508307 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Where did that come from?
L508292 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Right.
L508291 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ Isn't it a glorious morning?  Good morning, Mary Clarence.  sleep well?
L509098 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Sing!
L509097 +++$+++ u7632 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY LAZARUS +++$+++ JUST SING!
L509060 +++$+++ u7632 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY LAZARUS +++$+++ You re okay -- for a civilian.
L509059 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Hey -- you re supposed to be the cheerful one.  Why do I suddenly feel like Snow White?
L509040 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ You know?  About me?  About everything?
L509039 +++$+++ u7632 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY LAZARUS +++$+++ Van Cartier.
L508799 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ That's true, wouldn't that be great.  Of course, we never know when things are going to change.  Any one of us could be transferred to another convent, tomorrow.
L508798 +++$+++ u7632 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY LAZARUS +++$+++ We could cut a demo.  Look for a label.
L508795 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Well... see, at my old convent, I wasn't always... real popular.  I was sort of selfish and... not real helpful.  Okay, I'll say it -- I wasn't much of a nun. But now, thanks to all of you... maybe I'm shaping up.
L508794 +++$+++ u7632 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY LAZARUS +++$+++ Is there any syrup?
L508762 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ What?
L508761 +++$+++ u7632 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY LAZARUS +++$+++ She's a pro.
L508670 +++$+++ u7632 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY LAZARUS +++$+++ Again!
L508669 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Babies
L508668 +++$+++ u7632 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY LAZARUS +++$+++ Amateurs 2
L508667 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Hopeless I
L508666 +++$+++ u7632 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY LAZARUS +++$+++ Right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn!
L508665 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Don't look at your feet, and I don't want to see anybody counting.  Make it look easy.  Again!
L508594 +++$+++ u7632 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY LAZARUS +++$+++ Tell me about it.
L508593 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ It'll be hell.
L508591 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ A bunch of real mama's girls.
L508590 +++$+++ u7632 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY LAZARUS +++$+++ Wet behind the ears.
L508589 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ I don't know.  Mary Lazarus, what do you think?  They're pretty raw.
L508584 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ I hear you.  How many days a week do you rehearse?
L508583 +++$+++ u7632 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY LAZARUS +++$+++ Of course.  I'm a nun.  Four Popes now. The Lord hates a loafer.
L508582 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Mary Lazarus, I get the feeling that you like discipline.  Hard work.
L508581 +++$+++ u7632 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY LAZARUS +++$+++ I knew that.
L508580 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Yeah, for one second.  That was the blend -- you've got to listen to each other.  Be a group.
L508564 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Mary Robert.
L508563 +++$+++ u7632 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY LAZARUS +++$+++ Very nice.  Sisters, have we learned our lesson?  I won't hold this little episode against anyone.  I'll try not to.
L508553 +++$+++ u7632 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY LAZARUS +++$+++ You're a ringer.  She brought you in to replace me.  Out with the old.
L508552 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ What?
L508551 +++$+++ u7632 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY LAZARUS +++$+++ Free-lance?  Oh really?  You think I don't see?  You think I took vows yesterday?  I know what you're up to. You and Reverend Mother.
L508550 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Sure.  Kind of... free-lance.
L508547 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Um, I don't really know this one...
L508546 +++$+++ u7632 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY LAZARUS +++$+++ Mary Clarence, are you with us?
L508531 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Whatever.
L508530 +++$+++ u7632 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY LAZARUS +++$+++ Soprano or alto?
L508310 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ You know that song?
L508309 +++$+++ u7632 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY LAZARUS +++$+++ Shirelles.
L508300 +++$+++ u7632 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY LAZARUS +++$+++ I like my old convent, in Vancouver. Out in the woods.  It wasn't all modern, like here.  No electricity.  Cold water. Bare feet.  Those were nuns.  It was Hell on earth, but I loved it.  This place is a Hilton.
L508299 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Like this place?
L508298 +++$+++ u7632 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY LAZARUS +++$+++ Progressive convents.  Vanity.  It sounds awful.  It sounds just like this place.
L508297 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ What?
L508296 +++$+++ u7632 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY LAZARUS +++$+++ Enough jabber.
L508295 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Which convent?  It was, um, the Little Sisters... of the Moonlight.  In Vegas. Everybody used to come to Mass.  Frank. Dean.  Sammy.  Right at ringside.
L509076 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ HE SAID, SING THE DEVIL AWAY!
L509075 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ What did He say?
L509074 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME
L509073 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Don't you know it!
L509072 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ I WAS HELL-BOUND, YES THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY SATAN WAS WAITING
L509071 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ It's true!
L509070 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ I WAS DOWNHEARTED
L509057 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Bless you.
L509056 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ Mary Clarence!
L508873 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ She's got nothing to do with this.  Let her go.
L508872 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ But what do they want?  Where are we going?
L508870 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ Again?
L508869 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Run!  Take off!
L508868 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ They're from my old convent.
L508867 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ Wait, this isn't the way.  Who are you?
L508816 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Right to Hell.  Just kidding. Where is that bus?
L508815 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ The Council of Cardinals!  I'm so nervous!  What if I forget the words?
L508801 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Oh no.  We'll always be together.
L508800 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ Are you leaving us?
L508793 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ A thank-you?  For what?  You're the one we should be thanking.
L508792 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ It's contraband.  Don't ask.  But I wanted to give you a treat.  A sort of... thank-you gift.
L508678 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ We're nuns!
L508677 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Yes, prayer is the answer, and prayers free  We're going to give free prayers to everyone who drives up to this house.
L508662 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ HONOR THY MOTHER AND THY FATHER TOO DON'T KILL, DON'T STEAL, IT'S BAD FOR YOU
L508661 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ WE'RE THE SISTERS OF THE SACRED HEART WE DO OUR BIT, NOW DO YOUR PART
L508568 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Give me a C.  A C!
L508567 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ I don't want to mess anyone up...
L508566 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Mary Robert, I've watched you.  You never really sing.  You whisper. Nothing comes out.
L508565 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ What?
L508529 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ Now stop that.  You didn't shoot at me. You were only trying to help, to give me experience.  I tried to explain that to Reverend Mother, but -- I don't know if she understood.
L508528 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Mary Robert, I am so sorry about last night...
L508499 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ We could have been killed!  But you saved me!  Thank you, Mary Clarence!
L508498 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ I don't know, some people just don't like nuns.  I wish I had a ruler.
L508497 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ What was all that?  Who was that man? Why would he shoot at us?
L508496 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Experience!
L508495 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ Oh my Lord!
L508494 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ Mary Clarence!
L508493 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Goddamn it!
L508491 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Keep moving!
L508490 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ Mary Clarence!
L508488 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Well, you know, you don't have to tell her everything.  I mean, nothing really happened.  We just... took a walk.
L508487 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ I can't wait to tell Reverend Mother about all my experiences.  I've learned so much.
L508486 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Honey.
L508485 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ Mary Clarence!  You're so... different from the other sisters.  Sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.
L508484 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Good point.  Especially that dude you were with.  I'd like to see him down front.
L508483 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ Those people are wonderful!  Why don't we ever see them in church?
L508480 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ You watch yourself!
L508479 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ I'm getting experience.
L508471 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ This is your neighborhood.  Your turf. You should get to know 'em.
L508470 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ Who are all these people?
L508468 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ Really?
L508467 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Initiation.  You understand.  Later on, we make her wear her underwear on her head.
L508466 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ I have to do this.  So I can become a nun.
L508464 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Right.
L508463 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ Experience!  Right?
L508462 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Bobs
L508460 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ It's part of St. Katherine's new community outreach program.  How old are you?  You shouldn't be smoking.  Have you ever seen a diseased lung?  Hand 'em over.
L508459 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ We need experience.
L508454 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Now you.
L508453 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ Mary Clarence!
L508449 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ Are you sure?
L508448 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ We must... get you some experience.  We must... leave this place.
L508447 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ Of course!  We must do it!  It's the will of God!  What is it?
L508446 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ We must do this sacred thing, Mary Robert.
L508444 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Reverend Mother says you need experience, right, in life.  In order to make a responsible decision.  This is going to be very painful for me.  You know how much I love this little room. This whole convent.  Wait.
L508443 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ What?
L508442 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Well, then there's only one thing to do.
L508441 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ She said that?  Reverend Mother?
L508440 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ She says I should wait.  She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life.  She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet.  In a mature manner.
L508439 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ She won't?  Why not?
L508438 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy.  I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me!
L508437 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Excuse me?
L508436 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out!  I want to get in?
L508435 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you?  Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents?  We can call the Enquirer.
L508434 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ You have to help me
L508432 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Yeah, like a learner's permit, right? When do you hit the big time?  You know, when do you take the final vows?
L508431 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ A novice.
L508430 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Three years.  A rookie.
L508429 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ Three years.  Sister.
L508428 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ So, Bob, how long have you been in? St. K's?
L508427 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Right.  Okay.  Bob.  Nice to know you.
L508426 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ Mary Robert.  I'm... Mary Robert.
L508425 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Thanks.  So which one are you? Sister Bruce?  Sister Doug?
L508424 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ An extra heel of bread.  Please take it, you need your strength.  You've been working so hard.
L508423 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ A cigarette?
L508422 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ I... I brought you something.
L508421 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ What?
L508420 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ I... I...
L508419 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ What?  What does she want now?  I did the dishes.  I oiled the pews.  I dusted the hymnals.  Two hundred hymnals.  Why can't people share?
L508290 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Five a.m.?
L508289 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ It's after five.  We have to bathe.
L508288 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ What?  What time is it?
L508287 +++$+++ u7635 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY ROBERT +++$+++ Come on, we're late.
L509069 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Don't push it.
L509068 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Really?  And maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late?
L509067 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
L509066 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ What about me, Reverend Mother?  I think you were right.  I'm just a bad influence.  Sister show biz.
L509065 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert.  We shall have a serious discussion.
L509064 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ I don't think so.  What about skydiving? A crank call to Billy Graham?
L509050 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Very well.  I hold you responsible for all of this, For introducing a lounge act into my convent.  For utterly disrupting our way of life.  And for placing all of us in mortal danger.  Thank-you.
L509049 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Then I guess you're stuck.  Life sentence.  No parole.
L509044 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ I'm a Christian.
L509043 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ You saved my life.
L509042 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Oh?
L509041 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Reverend Mother -- Thank-you.
L509007 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Saving you.  Move!
L509006 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L508787 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Good day.
L508786 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ But...
L508785 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ I am sorry, Mary Clarence.  I seem to have misplaced my tambourine.  Good day, Mary Clarence.
L508784 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Okay, so I just got things started.  But you could build on that.  You could keep it going.
L508783 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ You and I know that life is not so simple.  There will be disappointments. Rude shocks.  And you will have vanished. How... fortunate.
L508782 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ A part of what?  Mary Clarence, it is one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday.  You have raised the Sisters' expectations, you have excited and confused them.  They imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party.
L508781 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ But everything that's happening is good! You can be a part of it!
L508780 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Indeed.  After how long?  A few weeks? I have been here thirty years.  And yet, it would seem, I know nothing.
L508779 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ But -- there's so much more to do right here.  And look, if it's about me, I mean, I'm gone.
L508778 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ I must go where I can be of use.
L508777 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ But -- why?
L508776 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ I have submitted my resignation to Bishop O'Hara.  Privately.  I have asked to be relocated as soon as possible.
L508775 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ What?
L508774 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Really.  Well, that makes two of us.
