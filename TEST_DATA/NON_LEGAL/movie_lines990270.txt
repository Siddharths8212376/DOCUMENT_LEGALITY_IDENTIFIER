L488960 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Jesus Christ Dewey help me! They tried to kill me in the bathroom! The killers!
L488959 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Don't worry, I've got a permit for it.
L488952 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ No I'll be ok. I've got my mace. My knife.  These two lethal weapons.
L488951 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Do you want me to come with you Sid? I mean, remember what Randy said?
L488950 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Listen Dewey I have to go to the bathroom.
L488908 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ No.
L488907 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I can see nothing's changed.
L488893 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ She was Randy's only girlfriend . . . ever.
L488892 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Karen Colcheck. From Woodsboro.
L488889 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Mm, what a waste of Silicone.  What does my mother have to do with this all Dewey? We're a long way from Woodsboro.
L488888 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Alright Sid, over there is the STAB 3 Production offices. That's where Sarah Darling was murdered last night.
L488885 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio where all this shit's going down.
L488884 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ I was afraid they were bait, something to, ya know,  trick you out of hiding.
L488861 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Follow me.
L488860 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I figured I'd be safe If I was at least up here with the people I care about.  Now where's this Kincaid guy the news is talking about? I found this place from a FOX 5 TV NEWS REPORT. Heh.
L488859 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ What?
L488858 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Well it's not safe for me up there either. The killer found me Dewey. He called me last night.
L488857 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ What are you doing here? I told you to stay hidden! It's not safe for you up here.
L489170 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Sure, why not. You did Save my life,Mr. Rielly.
L489169 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Gale, I know this is a bad time and all but what if we try it out again. The whole relationship thing.
L489058 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Who is it?
L489057 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Paternity test results. Christ Dewey, you're never going to believe who Milton's kid is.
L488967 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Nevermind, what'd you two find?
L488966 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Sidney, what happened?
L488906 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ I work better alone.  Why don't you do some snooping around the set?
L488905 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Do you want us to come with you?
L488904 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ I've got an idea, I'll hook up with you guys later.
L488880 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Just Jennifer.  And you.
L488879 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Has anyone else every used your phone?
L488878 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Oh.  Yeah, I guess I do.
L488877 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Do you have her number stored in your memory?  Phone memory!
L488868 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Sid, this is detective Kincaid.
L488867 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Thank you.
L488825 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ GALE BEHIND YOU!
L488824 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ What?
L488823 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ OH. OH GOD. GALE --
L488805 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!
L488804 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything.
L488774 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Fuck!
L488773 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Gale, your engine's still running.
L488772 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Neither are you, Magnum P.I.
L488771 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ You're not a detective.
L488770 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ I happen to work for the police god dammit!
L488769 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Stop following me.
L488768 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ I'm on duty.
L488767 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?
L488766 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Jennifer needs me.
L488765 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ And who is that?
L488764 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ I've got my suspicions but still, nothing  you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person.
L488763 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Right. Sorry.  Do you think he did it? 
L488762 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?
L488761 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ I'm sorry, this is too good!
L488760 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ I already removed it.  I think someone on the film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only reason I came here. To make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything.
L488759 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Someone stole Sid's file?
L488758 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ The boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked.
L488757 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ And?
L488756 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'.  She wanted to see the file on Sid, for research.
L488755 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Always.
L488754 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Off the record.
L488753 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ All of what Dewey?  You do know something, don't you?
L488752 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.
L488751 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?
L488750 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ You used to say that was our strength.
L488749 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.
L488748 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers? I liked her!
L488747 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ It was fucking '60 Minutes II'!  I couldn't say no!  I could've been the next Diane Sawyer!
L488746 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ So it's off to London for a week?  New York for a month? L.A Forever?
L488745 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real!'  But now you're here. Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else.
L488744 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ What about me?
L488743 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Again, I am the author of the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders.!  What about you?
L488742 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Why would the police come to you?
L488741 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Yes. Look, let's get something straight Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.
L488740 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Do you really mean it this time Gale?
L488739 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.
L488738 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has nothing to do with you Gale.
L488737 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it  or not it looks like we're going to have to  go back into our past.
L488736 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ They found another note?
L488611 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Show him.
L488610 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ What so you can just exploit her again with another book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.
L488609 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside, this is about Sidney. We need to know where she is.
L488999 +++$+++ u7494 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ When we did the first 'Stab" I realized I'd known Maureen Prescott before, I mean as Rina. I couldn't tell anyone.  Can you imagine the press?
L488998 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ But you know who she was.
L488997 +++$+++ u7494 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ What the hell are you guys getting at?  I make horror films, that's what I do.  The Studio came to me with 'Stab'.  They came to me, check it out.
L488994 +++$+++ u7494 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ I remember her!  She was a bit player in a couple of my movies. A nobody! So what does it matter?
L488993 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call.
L488992 +++$+++ u7494 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ What's your point?
L488985 +++$+++ u7494 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ Just what the hell do you people think you're doing, barging in here like this? I've got important calls to make. I run this studio.
L488984 +++$+++ u7491 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ So you knew Sidney Prescott's mother.
L488567 +++$+++ u7495 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ ROMAN +++$+++ Sure.
L488566 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Would you excuse me for a moment?
L488565 +++$+++ u7495 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ ROMAN +++$+++ Well if you were in my shoes, dealing with those big Time Sunrise Studio producers like I do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick your life goes from a Walt Disney picture to a Tobe Hooper flick.
L488564 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Your life?
L488563 +++$+++ u7495 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ ROMAN +++$+++ Honestly, my life.
L488562 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?
L488561 +++$+++ u7495 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ ROMAN +++$+++ Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.
L488560 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.
L488559 +++$+++ u7495 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ ROMAN +++$+++ Good morning Gale. Pleasure to be here.
L489042 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean, you did play me for three movies.  His two hands, dingus.
L489041 +++$+++ u7493 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?
L489040 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends.
L489039 +++$+++ u7493 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I think Milton's the killer. I think he just went out to kill another cast member.
L488996 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Settle down Beavis.  Why don't you tell us the truth?
L488995 +++$+++ u7493 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Oh, Come on!  You have made millions off the story of her murder.  You're obsessed with HER and you're obsessed with her DAUGHTER!
L488991 +++$+++ u7493 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Good twist.
L488990 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Nobody said she was an actor.
L488928 +++$+++ u7493 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Bitch.
L488927 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
L488926 +++$+++ u7493 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do.
L488925 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Really, you know you'd make a fascinating interview. Lifestyles of the Rich and Psychotic.
L488924 +++$+++ u7493 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Basements creep me out.
L488923 +++$+++ u7493 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Gale Weathers would find a way. 
L488922 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Possibly.
L488921 +++$+++ u7493 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ There a story in that building?
L488920 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ No really?
L488919 +++$+++ u7493 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Need to get in that building?
L488918 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Ha. Maybe I should join SNL.
L488917 +++$+++ u7493 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ That's funny.
L488916 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ And as a sane person.  For you that must be quite a stretch.
L488915 +++$+++ u7493 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter.
L488914 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ None.
L488913 +++$+++ u7493 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Here's how I see it.  I've got no house, no movie, no gun, and I'm being stalked.  Because someone wants to kill me?  No, because someone wants to kill you. So now, starting now, I go where you go.  That way, if someone wants to kill me, I'll be with you, and since they really want to kill you, they won't kill me, they'll kill you.  Make sense?
L488912 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ I am Gale Weathers!
L488911 +++$+++ u7493 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?
L488910 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ What the hell are you doing?
L488909 +++$+++ u7493 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Geez.
L488821 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ No! He's not dead! He's still breathing! Look!
L488820 +++$+++ u7493 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ God damn it you two! Run! Hurry! He's dead!
L488818 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ I dunno but I can tell you that your's will be the home video footage of me sticking my foot up your ass! Now come out and fight like a real man you pussy!
L488817 +++$+++ u7493 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ What's your favorite scary movie Gale?
L488816 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Listen you sick bastard, what the fuck do you want?
L488811 +++$+++ u7493 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Oh shit it's my cell!
L488810 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Who's phone?
L488798 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ I don't know. Screw them. Look, what's important is that we stick together. No matter what. If anyone is next it's you or me Jen.
L488797 +++$+++ u7493 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Shit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina?
L488788 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Still that was a much better movie, I saw it at the premiere last week. God, what the hell am I getting sidetracked with this shit for?! We've gotta get down to business.
L488787 +++$+++ u7493 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I know right. It was kinda weak. That's cause Will Kennison only wrote a rough treatment of it. The script was written by some new guy. He wrote Arlington Street.
L488786 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ AND I DIE NAKED?!  UGH! This is complete bullshit. Who wrote this piece of crap?
L488785 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Wait a second, whoa! Calm down! Number one there were five different versions of the script given out. Ben Damon was given a fake script because he was only being offered the role. It only had fragments of real scenes from the actual script. And what, I die in STAB 3?
L488784 +++$+++ u7493 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ God damn you Gale Weathers! Don't you see? The killer is choosing  his victims as they die in the script! Ben Damon's character was the first one to get offed. So was his girlfriend - but she wasn't cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed - then Sarah Darling's Candy, and now me!
L488783 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?
L488782 +++$+++ u7493 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ You! How can I ever get any fame playing you!
L489009 +++$+++ u7494 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ I'm saying things got out of hand.  Maybe they did take advantage of her!.  Maybe the sad truth is, this is not the city for innocence.  No charges were brought.  And the bottom line is, Rina Reynolds wouldn't play by the rules.  You wanna get ahead in Hollywood, you gotta play the game, or go home.
L489008 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Are you saying she was-
L489007 +++$+++ u7494 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ It was in the 70's, everything was different. I was well known for my parties, Rina knew what they were. It was for girls like her to meet men, men who could get them parts, if they made the right impression.  Nothing happened to her that she didn't invite, in one way or another, no matter what she said afterwards.
L489006 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over National TV? Why don't you start talking.
L489005 +++$+++ u7494 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ Now you listen to me, Lois Lane, let it go. It's dead and buried. Daddy took ol' Yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago.
L489004 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ I don't think so!  Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood?
L489003 +++$+++ u7494 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ Yeah.
L489002 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Just because you knew her?

L488630 +++$+++ u7494 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions.
L488629 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Oh come on! Why the hostility?
L488628 +++$+++ u7494 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ MILTON +++$+++ Well then, I guess I'll be leaving then.

L488779 +++$+++ u7498 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Really, cause that stunt lost me the lead role in Roman Polanski's latest picture. Huh, what a coincide I was picked up by Roman Bridger.

L488777 +++$+++ u7498 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.
L488776 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.

L488968 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ We did some researching in the archives. Sid, something dawned on me when I wrote the book on your mother's murder. For two years of her life, 1969 up until 1971 she basically disappeared off the face of the Earth.
L488891 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Who's this.
L488890 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Oh my God Karen you scared the shit out of me! What are you doing here?
L488873 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Oh, you know, the usual small talk, "What's new, how ya been, how do you want to die?"

L488866 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Hi, Gale. I'm glad you're all right.
L488865 +++$+++ u7492 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Oh my God! Sidney, you ran fast or what?  Hey.
L489156 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Roman knock it off! Do you people even know why you kill people? You kill people cause you choose to and not because of any other fucking reason!
L489155 +++$+++ u7495 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ ROMAN +++$+++ See Sid, now comes the part where we get away with it! The part where we win! Cause face it Sidney, in this world, the bad guys win!
L489152 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I can't take it anymore. This Hollywood exploitation of the nightmare I lived has to be stopped. I did this to make you all repent for your sins, and now I'm pleased I've got my message across. Good-bye.
L489151 +++$+++ u7495 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ ROMAN +++$+++ Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part.  With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice.  Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.
L489150 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit before! So lets get on with it!
L489147 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Oh my God, Angie Crick? From English class?
L489146 +++$+++ u7495 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ ROMAN +++$+++ I'm a director Sid, I direct. For example, Angelina over there,  She's my partner. I can convince her to do anything.  We've been dating since I met her in Woodsboro.
L489145 +++$+++ u7497 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard!
L489144 +++$+++ u7495 +++$+++ m506 +++$+++ ROMAN +++$+++ Roman Bridger, director. And brother.  She slammed the door in my face, Sid. Said I was Rina's child and Rina was dead. And it struck me, what a good idea! So I watched her, made a little home movie, a little family film. Seems Maureen, mom, really got around. I mean, Cotton Weary was one thing, everybody knew about that, but Billy's father, that was the key! Your boyfriend didn't like seeing his daddy in my movies. Didn't like it at all. And once I supplied the motive, all the kid needed was a few pointers. Have a partner to sell out in case you get caught, find someone to frame, it was like her was making a movie.
