L391027 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Let me come and talk to you.
L391026 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ What's wrong can never be made right. 
L391025 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ He's in Palermo.
L391024 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ Why didn't he call himself?
L391023 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ I'm calling for your brother Johnny. He's getting married and he wants you to come.
L391022 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ Yeah, this is Ronny.
L391610 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Johnny.
L391609 +++$+++ u6658 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ It's Johnny Cammareri.
L391591 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ You? No.
L391590 +++$+++ u6658 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ Is there anything you want to tell us, honey?
L391587 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Hi.
L391586 +++$+++ u6658 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ Hi Loretta.
L391309 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Yeah, I'll be in.
L391308 +++$+++ u6658 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
L391307 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Bye, Aunt Rita.
L391292 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ I got a lot on my mind, Aunt Rita.
L391291 +++$+++ u6658 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ What's the matter? You look crazy.
L391288 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Right.
L391287 +++$+++ u6658 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ Sure you do. You got all that wedding stuff.
L391286 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ I got things to do.
L391645 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Where's the ring?
L391644 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ What?
L391640 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ In time, you will drop dead, and I will come to your funeral in a red dress.
L391639 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ In time, you will see that this is the best thing.
L391637 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ I must ask for that back.
L391636 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ And you're a big liar! I've got your ring here!
L391629 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ If I marry you my mother will die.
L391628 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ WHAT?
L391627 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ Loretta, I can't marry you.
L391626 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ I have no secrets from my family.
L391625 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ I have something to tell you. But I must talk to you alone.
L391624 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Johnny, I have something to tell you.
L391621 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ Well. I told my mother that we were to be married. And she got well. Right away.
L391620 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ I can't. I need my family around me now.
L391619 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ We should talk alone.
L391618 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ I don't know. But Johnny, how did your mother recover? She was dying.
L391008 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful.
L391007 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Have you told her we're getting married?
L391004 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ The waitresses were very nice.  My mother is slipping away.
L391003 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ How was your plane ride?
L391002 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ Ssh, it's me. I'm calling from the deathbed of my mother.
L390886 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Sure.
L390885 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ We haven't spoken in five years. There was some bad blood. I want you to call him and invite him to the wedding. Will you do it?
L390884 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ You have a brother?
L390883 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ He's my younger brother.
L390882 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Who is he?
L390881 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ There's one thing about this wedding I want you to do. Call this number. It's a business number. Ask for Ronny. Invite him to the wedding.
L390880 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ You've made me very happy, Johnny.
L390879 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ I'll call you when I get to Mama's house.
L390870 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ I'll take care of it, Johnny. I'll take care of the whole thing. All you have to do is show up.
L390869 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ Yeah.
L390868 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ A month from today?
L390867 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ Alright. A month. In a month.
L390866 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
L390865 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back?
L390864 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ How about a month from today?
L390863 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Then let's set the date.
L390862 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ A week. Two weeks. No more.
L390861 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ How near is she to death?
L390860 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ My mother is dying. When she is dead, I'll come back and we'll be married.
L390859 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ What about the wedding?
L390855 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ So we'll pick up the car, we'll make the plane in plenty of time.
L390854 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ Seven-thirty.
L390853 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ What time is it?
L390845 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ You propose to a woman you should offer her a ring of engagement.
L390844 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ I like this ring.
L390834 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ Alright.
L390833 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ I helped you buy it. It came with two pairs of pants. It's for luck, Johnny. When you propose marriage to a woman, you should kneel down.
L390832 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ This is a good suit.
L390831 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Yes, on the floor.
L390830 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ On the floor?
L390829 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Right from the start we didn't do it right. Could you kneel down?
L390828 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ I don't understand.
L390827 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.
L390826 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ What do you mean?
L390825 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ You know I was married and that my husband died. But what you don't know is I think he and I had Bad Luck.
L390824 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ Yes?
L390823 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Are you proposing marriage to me?
L390822 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Bobo, take the cart away.
L390821 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ Will you marry me?
L390820 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ What?
L390819 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ Will you marry me?
L390818 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ I shouldn't.
L390817 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ Have Something.
L390816 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ My scalp is not getting enough blood sometimes.
L390815 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ What's the matter?
L390814 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ Never is a long time.
L390813 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ You never have dessert.
L390796 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ She was too young for him.
L390795 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ A man who can't control his woman is funny.
L390783 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Give him the manicotta, Bobo. Me, too.
L390782 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ Maybe you're right.
L390781 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ It's the oily fish tonight. Not before the plane ride.
L390780 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ No?
L390779 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ You don't want the fish.
L391652 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Oh God, that's too bad.
L391651 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Yeah, Ma, I love him awful.
L391650 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Do you love him, Loretta?
L391552 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I guess it ain't modern times in Sicily. He came right from the airport. He wanted to talk to you. You got a love bite on your neck. He's coming back this morning.
L391551 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ A miracle? This is modern times! There ain't supposed to be miracles any more!
L391550 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ It was a miracle.
L391549 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ WHAT!! She was dying!
L391548 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ She recovered.
L391547 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ He's with his dying mother!
L391546 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ No more he's not.
L391545 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ What? He's in Sicily!
L391544 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Upstairs. Johnny Cammareri showed up last night.
L391543 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Where's pop?
L391542 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ No. But I have a hangover.
L391541 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ No. Are you drunk?
L391540 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Are you drunk?
L391539 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Everything's different.
L391538 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Your hair's different.
L391537 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Well. I don't really know where to start.
L391536 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ What the hell happened to you?
L391253 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Then you don't know. You're just imagining it. He's too old.
L391252 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ A wife knows.
L391251 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ What! How do you know?
L391250 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Cosmo's cheating on me.
L391249 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Thanks. What's the matter with you?
L391248 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Just like your father. I lied to him. He thinks you came home last night.
L391247 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ I don't wanna talk about it.
L391246 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Where you been?
L391245 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Hi.
L391017 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Not yet. That old lady makes him sweat.  Where's that card?
L391016 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Did he tell her?
L391015 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.
L391014 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ How's the mother?
L391000 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ No. He don't.
L390999 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ I'd like to stay, Ma. I love the house. But Pop don't like Johnny.
L390998 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ And we'll sell the house.
L390997 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Johnny has a big apartment. We'll live there.
L390996 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ What's thirty-seven? I had Chiro after I was thirty-seven. It ain't over till it's over.
L390995 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ I'm thirty-seven years old.
L390994 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Grandma was still alive. Chiro was still home going to school. Now he's married and gone to Florida. If you and Johnny moved in, had a baby...
L390993 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ I got married before, you didn't sell.
L390992 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ So we'll sell the house.
L390991 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Pop don't like Johnny.
L390990 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Why not?
L390989 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ No.
L390988 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Will you live here?
L390961 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Pop.
L390960 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ And who's gonna pay for that?
L390959 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Oh yeah. He's a sweet man. I wanna have a big church wedding, Ma. And a reception.
L390958 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Good. When you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can. But you like him?
L390957 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ No.
L391593 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ The bank. OH MY GOD, I FORGOT TO MAKE THE DEPOSIT!
L391592 +++$+++ u6657 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ We just come from the bank.
L391589 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Hi. Why ain't you at the store?
L391588 +++$+++ u6657 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Hi, Loretta.
L391283 +++$+++ u6657 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ You gotta date?
L391282 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go.
L391281 +++$+++ u6657 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Oh.
L391280 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ No.
L391279 +++$+++ u6657 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Did you see it?
L391278 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ What about the moon?
L391275 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ What's the matter with him?
L391274 +++$+++ u6657 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Hey there  ...YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES...
L391273 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Hi.
L391244 +++$+++ u6656 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ PRIEST +++$+++ I absolve you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.
L391243 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Alright.
L391242 +++$+++ u6656 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ PRIEST +++$+++ Alright. This is your penance. Say two rosaries and... be careful, Loretta. Reflect on your life.
L391241 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ I know.
L391240 +++$+++ u6656 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ PRIEST +++$+++ You should think about this.
L391239 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ I know.
L391238 +++$+++ u6656 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ PRIEST +++$+++ That's a pretty big sin.
L391237 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ I... a... slept with my fiancé's brother.
L391236 +++$+++ u6656 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ PRIEST +++$+++ Then it was not a sin. But what was that second thing you said, Loretta?
L391235 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Twice I took the name of God in vain, once I slept with the brother of my fiancé, and once I bounced a check at the liquor store -- but that was really an accident.
L391234 +++$+++ u6656 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ PRIEST +++$+++ What sins have you to confess?
L391233 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been two months since my last confession.
L391304 +++$+++ u6650 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ Did you see the moon last night?
L391303 +++$+++ u6653 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ I will. But I must find the right moment.
L391302 +++$+++ u6650 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ Talk to him.
L391301 +++$+++ u6653 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ Cosmo drank five glasses of wine at dinner.
L391300 +++$+++ u6650 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ Don't make yourself sick.
L391297 +++$+++ u6653 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ If I hit the stick too hard, the apple will split. If I am too timid, the apple will fall off the stick.
L391296 +++$+++ u6650 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ Don't fight.
L390985 +++$+++ u6653 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ Maybe. I don't know. He has not asked my advice. If he asks my advice, I don't know what I will say.
L390984 +++$+++ u6650 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ He owes her a wedding from the first time when there was none.
L390983 +++$+++ u6653 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ I don't know.
L390982 +++$+++ u6650 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ He should pay.
L390981 +++$+++ u6653 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ My granddaughter wants my son to pay for the wedding. But he does not want to pay.
L390980 +++$+++ u6650 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ Don't fight.
L390978 +++$+++ u6653 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ My son does not like this Johnny Cammareri. He says he is a big baby.
L390977 +++$+++ u6650 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LUCY +++$+++ I have heard that Johnny Cammareri got down on his knees in The Grand Ticino and proposed to her.
L390976 +++$+++ u6653 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ Lucy. There are big things going on in my house. My granddaughter Loretta, the only daughter of my son Cosmo, has engaged herself to be married a second time.
L391535 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Okay, I'll tell her.
L391534 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk.
L391533 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ No idea.
L391532 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ You don't know where Loretta is?
L391531 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ He doesn't like you. Thank you for answering my question.
L391512 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ No, that's really it. Thank you for answering my question.
L391511 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ I don't know.
L391510 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ That's it! That's the reason!
L391509 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ I don't know. Maybe because he fears death.
L391508 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ But why would a man need more than one woman?
L391507 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ Well. There's the Bible story. God took a rib from Adam and made Eve. Maybe men chase women to get the rib back. When God took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to be something. and the women have that. Maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman.
L391506 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women?
L391505 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ Who was that?
