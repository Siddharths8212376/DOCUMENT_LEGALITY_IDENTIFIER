L587333 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Then, tell me a story.
L587332 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ ... It's hard you know.  You're so far away and I don't know what else to say.
L587331 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Well, then, talk to me some more.
L587330 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ I'm still here.
L587329 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ So have I.  ... Hello?
L587324 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ ... That's funny... I had this job with Enzo... we got fired too.
L587323 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ I got fired.
L587322 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ How are you?
L587321 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ It's me... Johana.
L587320 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Hello?
L587237 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ But it's not true, I feel good with you... It feels right...
L587236 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Yes you do.  You know exactly what I'm talking about.  You're afraid I want to hold onto you, and I do, but you're not ready... at least not for me.
L587235 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.
L587234 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
L587233 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Why?
L587232 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ I'm going back home.
L587211 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Aren't you happy?  Don't you feel proud...?  I feel proud and all I did was watch.
L587210 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ I did?
L587209 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Jacques, you set a world record.
L587192 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Uh... Yes, of course!
L587191 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?
L587131 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ I don't know, I just feel it.
L587130 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ How do you know that?
L587129 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ She's not like the others.  She can't stand to be away from the sea.
L587122 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ ... The way she moves.
L587121 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ How can you tell it's a female?
L587116 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ No?  Huh?  Yes, of course!!
L587115 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ ... No?
L587114 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ You... You wouldn't want to spend the day with me?
L587113 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ I'd better get back now.
L587112 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ I'm glad you stayed.  Thank you.
L587111 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Just checking up on your family.  I guess I was drunker than I thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress... Well...
L587098 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Give it to me.
L587097 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins...
L587096 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ No.  I want to show you.  Is it ruined?
L587094 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ My wallet.
L587093 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Only to help the medics, I assure you.
L587092 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ You jumped in?
L587091 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Lucky I was there to save you.
L587090 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Please move slowly, you're rocking the boat.
L587033 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ ... Especially the sneakers.
L587032 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Thank you...
L587031 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ You look adorable.
L587030 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ It's too loud for me.
L587029 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ I thought you'd be at the dinner.
L587018 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Maybe on earth there is one... but not when you dive... You see, to dive deep into the sea, for no reason... just to do it.  It's a feeling... I don't know how to say this... Voluptuous?
L587017 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best?
L587016 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Yes... Maybe... I don't know.  I don't like competitions... It ruins the fun.  Don't you think?
L587015 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Just because... I would have liked to visit the town... See the coast... I don't know anybody... Expect for you.
L587014 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ I don't know... why?
L587013 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ You're going to be very busy these days aren't you?
L587012 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ I'm being a pain in the ass.  It's beautiful here.
L587011 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ I thought it was a nice place.  Isn't it?
L587010 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Thanks for helping with the bag.  It looks great!
L586988 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ ... Okay.  I'll try.
L586987 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ No, no.  You'll like it.  It's superb.
L586983 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ I was doing an insurance investigation in Palermo.  I work for an insurance company.  So, I decided to take a few days off.  I don't know this island at all. It really is gorgeous.
L586982 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ But what brought you to Sicily?
L586976 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Thank you.  I wouldn't want to interrupt anything.
L586975 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Please, have a seat.
L586834 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ No... in the hut.
L586833 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ In the lake?
L586832 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ We saw each other a little while ago.
L586831 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ I recognize you.
L586931 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Ah?!
L586930 +++$+++ u8266 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ RECEPTIONIST +++$+++ No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.
L586929 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
L586928 +++$+++ u8266 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ RECEPTIONIST +++$+++ Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
L586927 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ This is the hotel San Domenico?
L586926 +++$+++ u8266 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ RECEPTIONIST +++$+++ Positive, Sir.
L586925 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ ... Are you sure?
L586924 +++$+++ u8266 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ RECEPTIONIST +++$+++ Mayol... Mayol... No reservation.
L587425 +++$+++ u8270 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ UNCLE LOUIS +++$+++ That's different!  What's the matter with you?
L587424 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Louis, we were French!
L587423 +++$+++ u8270 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ UNCLE LOUIS +++$+++ What were Italians doing living in Greece anyway?
L587422 +++$+++ u8270 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ UNCLE LOUIS +++$+++ The whale!  How could I forget? Always was something fishy about that woman!
L587421 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Uncle Louis, you remember Enzo's mother Signora Molinari from Amorgos?
L587378 +++$+++ u8270 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ UNCLE LOUIS +++$+++ I'm going to put a lock on the telephone.  Did you bring the cassettes?
L587377 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Uncle Louis, we have a guest!
L587376 +++$+++ u8270 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ UNCLE LOUIS +++$+++ Liar!  Thief!  Torturer!  When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast.
L587375 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ It's my apartment.
L587374 +++$+++ u8270 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ UNCLE LOUIS +++$+++ In my apartment?
L587373 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Well... here.
L587372 +++$+++ u8270 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ UNCLE LOUIS +++$+++ Good.  That way I'll see more of you... Where are you going to stay?
L587370 +++$+++ u8270 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ UNCLE LOUIS +++$+++ No, no.  It's true.  When I was in New York, oh boy!  Before my accident, you understand? 
L587369 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Uncle Louis!
L587366 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ He doesn't hear too well.
L587365 +++$+++ u8270 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ UNCLE LOUIS +++$+++ What kind of name is that?  To be named after a city?
L587364 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Johana... New York.
L587363 +++$+++ u8270 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ UNCLE LOUIS +++$+++ Where are you from, Henrietta?
L587358 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ No, no.  Johana is visiting me.
L587357 +++$+++ u8270 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ UNCLE LOUIS +++$+++ Are you crazy?  I have no use for a woman!  Since my accident.
L587356 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ I brought Johana to meet you.
L587355 +++$+++ u8270 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ UNCLE LOUIS +++$+++ Did you buy the cassettes?  The Wagner, the Berlioz?
L587354 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ Uncle Louis, this is my friend Johana.
L587353 +++$+++ u8270 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ UNCLE LOUIS +++$+++ Assassin!
L586755 +++$+++ u8270 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ UNCLE LOUIS +++$+++ Where I saw the mermaids?!  Why don't you ever ask any question? I'm always the one asking the question!  We're sitting here like two stones and I'm taking to myself. Ask me something, Goddamnit!
L586754 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ What?
L586753 +++$+++ u8270 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ UNCLE LOUIS +++$+++ Why don't you ask me?
L586750 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ No.
L586749 +++$+++ u8270 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ UNCLE LOUIS +++$+++ Hey!  Have you ever seen a mermaid?
L586747 +++$+++ u8270 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ UNCLE LOUIS +++$+++ Then you shouldn't eat everyday, Jacques.
L586746 +++$+++ u8261 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JACQUES +++$+++ You shouldn't dive everyday, Papa.
L587303 +++$+++ u8268 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Vitamins, exercise, herb tea... and see a doctor, will ya?
L587302 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Do you think I should have stayed? Don't you think maybe I should have stayed?  I've been a jerk, right?  I should have stayed!  I was supposed to be in love... I was in love!  I am in love, why did I act like a bitch?  He went swimming. All the man did was go swimming! I must be crazy.  It was too good to be true.
L587301 +++$+++ u8268 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ What is it honey... the frenchy?
L587300 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ I know, I know!  I'm a terrible person...  It's... I'm so damn, damn sad.
L587299 +++$+++ u8268 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ You look it too.  You haven't been working out, you haven't been taking your vitamins!  You haven't been drinking your herbs, you haven't been...
L587298 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ No.  I'm just depressed.
L587297 +++$+++ u8268 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Does that have a hidden meaning?
L587296 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Way past it.
L587295 +++$+++ u8268 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ ... And if we repaint the walls, we'll need new curtains, you put the painters on you Visa and I'll do the curtains on American Express... for the couch there's Bloomingdales...  or are you still over your limit?
L586873 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Don't be a jerk.  There's no such thing as love at first sight.
L586872 +++$+++ u8268 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ ... Since eight o'clock last night...!  You're in love.
L586871 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Haven't you been listening?
L586870 +++$+++ u8268 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I thought you said he was Peruvian?
L586868 +++$+++ u8268 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Oh Jesus...!  I'll make some coffee.  They left the stove.
L586867 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ It's his heartbeat.
L586865 +++$+++ u8268 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Okay... Who'd you meet?
L586864 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Nice... Very interesting... Great!  ... I guess.
L586863 +++$+++ u8268 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ How was your trip?
L586862 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ What?
L586861 +++$+++ u8268 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Well?
L586859 +++$+++ u8268 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ They're going to send detectives.
L586858 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ You called the police?
L586857 +++$+++ u8268 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Yep.  How was your trip...?  Help me clean up, okay?
L586856 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
L586855 +++$+++ u8268 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ ... And the new stereo.
L586854 +++$+++ u8268 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ They got the new T.V.
L586853 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Again?
L586852 +++$+++ u8268 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ You're back!  Hello.  We were burgled.
L586851 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ ... Sally?
L586850 +++$+++ u8268 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I changed the lock you son of a bitch!
L587203 +++$+++ u8265 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ NOVELLI +++$+++ Yes... It's magic.
L587202 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ But doesn't Jacques dive without anything?
L587201 +++$+++ u8265 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ NOVELLI +++$+++ That isn't for the divers actually. It's for the balloon.  It blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator.  Without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed.
L587200 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ What's that little air bottle on the machine?
L587199 +++$+++ u8265 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ NOVELLI +++$+++ Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet.  They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture.  At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.
L587198 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ ... And those?
L587197 +++$+++ u8265 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ NOVELLI +++$+++ Of course, that's what they're for.
L587196 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ If there was a problem, they could do something right?
L587195 +++$+++ u8265 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ NOVELLI +++$+++ They're paramedics.  They wait at 180 feet.
L587194 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ What are they for?
L587550 +++$+++ u8263 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ LAWRENCE +++$+++ Let him sleep.
L587549 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ I'll go see how he's doing.
L586907 +++$+++ u8263 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ LAWRENCE +++$+++ ... Yes?
L586906 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Wait!  Professor...?
L586905 +++$+++ u8263 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ LAWRENCE +++$+++ Then, goodbye.
L586904 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ You've made me a happy insurance person.
L586903 +++$+++ u8263 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ LAWRENCE +++$+++ Okay, okay.  You'll have it by the end of the week, how's that?
L586902 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Okay, listen, just get the custom's office to send me a copy as fast as possible.  We can't send you new equipment until our file is complete.  Okay?
L586830 +++$+++ u8263 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ LAWRENCE +++$+++ His mother's an American.  He spent half of his life in the states. I'd try English if I were you.
L586829 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Will he understand Spanish?
L586828 +++$+++ u8263 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ LAWRENCE +++$+++ Coffee might be nice.
L586827 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Shouldn't somebody take him a blanket or something?
L586826 +++$+++ u8263 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ LAWRENCE +++$+++ For one thing, it's his job... as for the rest of it, I wish I knew.
L586825 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Why is he doing this?
L586824 +++$+++ u8263 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ LAWRENCE +++$+++ It depends.  He should come up soon.  Unless he's decided to stay for the night.
L586823 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ How long can he stay down?  Without breathing?
L586822 +++$+++ u8263 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ LAWRENCE +++$+++ He's in the fluoroscope now.  Listen to his heart.  Impressive, huh? The flow of blood is concentrated in the brain and doesn't even feed the limbs anymore.  It's a phenomena that has only been observed with dolphins... until now.
L586819 +++$+++ u8263 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ LAWRENCE +++$+++ He isn't going to breathe.
L586818 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ But... how is he going to breathe?
L586817 +++$+++ u8263 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ LAWRENCE +++$+++ My dear, science is a cruel mistress.
L586815 +++$+++ u8263 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ LAWRENCE +++$+++ In the spring when he melts!
L586814 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ I'll have to talk to the driver.
L586813 +++$+++ u8263 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ LAWRENCE +++$+++ ... The truck fell into a very deep crevasse.  We weren't able to save the equipment.
L586812 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ That's the experiment?  Dumping a guy into a frozen lake?
L586811 +++$+++ u8263 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ LAWRENCE +++$+++ Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
L586810 +++$+++ u8262 +++$+++ m561 +++$+++ JOHANA +++$+++ Who... Who is that?
L594219 +++$+++ u8273 +++$+++ m562 +++$+++ HAMMER +++$+++ I know sir. I won't let you down.
L594218 +++$+++ u8271 +++$+++ m562 +++$+++ CHIEF +++$+++ Hammer, the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands.
L594217 +++$+++ u8273 +++$+++ m562 +++$+++ HAMMER +++$+++ There won't be any need for that sir.
L594214 +++$+++ u8273 +++$+++ m562 +++$+++ HAMMER +++$+++ I love her sir. If I don't help you, I won't be able to make her my wife. Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim has agreed to come with me to the North Pole on a rescue mission.
L594213 +++$+++ u8271 +++$+++ m562 +++$+++ CHIEF +++$+++ Please. Will you help me?
L594212 +++$+++ u8271 +++$+++ m562 +++$+++ CHIEF +++$+++ My Esther! Oh Mordechai.
L594211 +++$+++ u8273 +++$+++ m562 +++$+++ HAMMER +++$+++ It's Esther. Santa's got her.
L594210 +++$+++ u8271 +++$+++ m562 +++$+++ CHIEF +++$+++ So why the long face?
L594147 +++$+++ u8273 +++$+++ m562 +++$+++ HAMMER +++$+++ No way, it's too dangerous. Besides, my days of hooking are over.

L594003 +++$+++ u8273 +++$+++ m562 +++$+++ HAMMER +++$+++ Good thinking. We'll disguise ourselves as a Gentile couple to pass undetected. Now that he thinks I'm dead, this should be a piece of homentashen.
L594002 +++$+++ u8271 +++$+++ m562 +++$+++ CHIEF +++$+++ Well, then I've got good news for you. We just got word that he'll be making an appearance at the Mall Of America today. I'm sending Esther to meet you there at once.

L594000 +++$+++ u8273 +++$+++ m562 +++$+++ HAMMER +++$+++ That'll work. Get them out to the Jewish community stat. We got an epidemic on our hands.

L593998 +++$+++ u8273 +++$+++ m562 +++$+++ HAMMER +++$+++ Chief, it's me. Listen carefully. I need for the Worldwide Jewish Media Conspiracy to mass produce video copies of every Hollywood movie ever made featuring a positive Jewish protagonist as its lead.

L593920 +++$+++ u8273 +++$+++ m562 +++$+++ HAMMER +++$+++ I guess I could be chalant about it, but then again I'm not even sure if that's a word. Listen Chief, we could stand around arguing all day, but I gotta case to crack.
L593919 +++$+++ u8273 +++$+++ m562 +++$+++ HAMMER +++$+++ Hey, it's your Bar Mitzvah. I'm just readin' the Torah portion.

L593916 +++$+++ u8271 +++$+++ m562 +++$+++ CHIEF +++$+++ Alright Mordechai, now that we're alone I just want to say that I'm not happy about this. I don't want a repeat of that incident in the West Bank.

L594324 +++$+++ u8272 +++$+++ m562 +++$+++ ESTHER +++$+++ Well, for starters, we're going to honeymoon in Boca for a week. And then, when we get back, Morty's been talking about taking a stable, good paying job as a consultant for the JDL.
L593870 +++$+++ u8275 +++$+++ m562 +++$+++ MRS. CARVER +++$+++ He works too much. God forbid he should have a nice Jewish girl come eat by him once in a while. Take his mind off his work. Maybe a blowjob here and there.
