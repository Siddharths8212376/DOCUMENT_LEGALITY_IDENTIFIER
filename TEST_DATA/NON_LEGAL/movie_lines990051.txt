L326550 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I uh... don't think we're quite at your pitch yet.
L326549 +++$+++ u6144 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ It's the death rattle of my singlehood, right? Because I finally see the white picket fence looming and I love it/hate it/love it/hate it/ love it... you're right, I'll know when I see him. Why is it so easy to talk with you?!  Tell me about your fiancee.
L326548 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I think you'll know when you see him at the gate.
L326547 +++$+++ u6144 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ And I can't say his name without laughing I want to eat him up. I want to say goodbye to every bad thought I ever had about relationships.  I mean, I crave this guy... and yet... why... why did I have that affair this weekend?  Does that mean I'm not in love with my boyfriend?
L326544 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Well.  Good luck with that --
L326543 +++$+++ u6144 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Bobbi Fallon.  BPI.  I'm producing the Coke commercials for the playoffs.
L326542 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Jerry Maguire.  SMI.
L326541 +++$+++ u6144 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ You're with the sports people on the plane, right?
L326535 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Where'd you find the perfect white shirt?
L326534 +++$+++ u6144 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ What --
L326533 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I have to ask.
L327432 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Alright, I'm freaking too.  But they need you to stay calm.  I'll call back. _ 124.
L327431 +++$+++ u6138 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ MARCEE +++$+++ "Stay calm?"  I'm freakin...
L327430 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Keep the phone open.  I'll call back. Stay calm. He's got some good doctors out there.
L327429 +++$+++ u6138 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ MARCEE +++$+++ I'm freakin out.  Oh God I'm --
L327428 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ He took a shot.  He's unconscious.
L327242 +++$+++ u6138 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ MARCEE +++$+++ My husband believes in you.  We're gonna make it.  Bye bye Dorothy.
L327241 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Don't be silly.
L327240 +++$+++ u6138 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ MARCEE +++$+++ I'm sorry what I said back there.
L327220 +++$+++ u6138 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ MARCEE +++$+++ What DO you stand for???
L327219 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Marcee --
L327218 +++$+++ u6138 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ MARCEE +++$+++ What are you talking about -- "don't get emotional." If you ask me, you haven't gotten emotional ENOUGH about this man. _ 98.
L327217 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Okay, we don't take this emotionally. We roll with this problem.
L327214 +++$+++ u6138 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ MARCEE +++$+++ And say what?  "Please remove your dick from my ass?!"
L327213 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I'll go back to them.
L326654 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Damn right.
L326653 +++$+++ u6138 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ MARCEE +++$+++ Damn right, and you can start by taking Rod's poster and putting it where people can see it!
L326652 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Marcee, things are changing around here.  You and Rod will have my total personal attention.
L326651 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Not a chance.
L326650 +++$+++ u6138 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ MARCEE +++$+++ You gonna get that --
L326643 +++$+++ u6138 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ MARCEE +++$+++ I know you say to take the Arizona offer, but my husband needs more recognition.  _ 25.
L326642 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ How can I make your life better?
L326640 +++$+++ u6138 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ MARCEE +++$+++ Jerry, Rod is very very upset. Tyson, no!
L326639 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Marcee.  How's my favorite player's wife?
L326684 +++$+++ u6141 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ I've got the clients.  I've got the juice.
L326683 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ SMI represents all three quarterbacks on your team, where's their loyalty going to be?  You stay with me, I'd fight for YOU alone.  You'd be my only client on that team...
L326677 +++$+++ u6141 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ You'll always be my hero, Jerry. Always always always.  We're bringing other elements in, we're focusing on endorsements -- it's not about handholding anymore. We're no longer babysitters --
L326676 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ -- and I'll get 'em.
L326675 +++$+++ u6141 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Jerry --
L326674 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I'm over it.  Now I want all my clients and yours too.
L326673 +++$+++ u6141 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ You wanted smaller.
L326672 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You'll lose.
L326671 +++$+++ u6141 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Give me a little credit for doing this face-to-face!  What I went through knowing I was going to do this to my mentor!  Can you get past yourself for a second?
L326670 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Dick.
L326669 +++$+++ u6141 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ ... dick?
L326666 +++$+++ u6141 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ You did this to yourself.  You said "fewer clients."  You put it all on paper.  Scully was very upset.  Heart attacks make some people sweeter, but not him.  You did this to yourself --
L326665 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You...
L326664 +++$+++ u6141 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ I know.  It sucks.  I suck.
L326663 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Aw shit...the crowded restaurant... so there's no scene...
L326661 +++$+++ u6141 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Came here to fire you, Jerry.
L326660 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Pardon me?
L326659 +++$+++ u6141 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ I came here to let you go. _ 27.
L326658 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I'm fine.  What's up?
L326657 +++$+++ u6141 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ You okay?
L326656 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Gimme a second here... Tidwell... Arizona contract... new glass cabinet...
L326646 +++$+++ u6141 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Pleasure.
L326645 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Marcee -- this is one of our agents. This is Bob Sugar, who needs to learn to knock.
L326644 +++$+++ u6141 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Cronin's okay for lunch?
L326631 +++$+++ u6141 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ The best commercial director in the business.  I hail you.
L326630 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Dooler, you know Bob Sugar.
L327276 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ It's in a cage.  Do not be scared of...
L327275 +++$+++ u6140 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I'm scared.  What is it?
L327274 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ -- I give you my favorite animal in the zoo.  Are you ready for the weirdness, the strange perfection and truth of...
L327273 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Right up ahead, buddy --
L327272 +++$+++ u6140 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Show me the animal, Jerry!
L327207 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ A lot.  We got a big fax today... we need this commission, buddy.
L327206 +++$+++ u6140 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What's going on, Jerry?
L327048 +++$+++ u6140 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Funny...   I better go to bed.
L327047 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Funny.
L327046 +++$+++ u6140 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I don't see any.
L327045 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ We'll go to the zoo sometime. Okay? I think I might have some time on my hands.
L327044 +++$+++ u6140 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I won't tell.
L327043 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Yeah I know.  I did.
L327042 +++$+++ u6140 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You said "fuck".
L327041 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed.
L327040 +++$+++ u6140 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Let's go right now.  Let's go to the zoo.
L327039 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Okay.  I've been hogging it. You're right.  _ 76.
L327038 +++$+++ u6140 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Let's go the zoo.
L327037 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Wait.  I want to tell you more about my dad.
L327036 +++$+++ u6140 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ And then my dad died and my mom took me to the zoo and I love the zoo. Do you hate the zoo or do you love the zoo?
L327030 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Hi Ray.
L327029 +++$+++ u6140 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Hi.
L326843 +++$+++ u6140 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I'm not your brother!
L326842 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ They do, my brother.
L326841 +++$+++ u6140 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ No.
L326840 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Hey, man, you know they have big balloons built into cars?
L326604 +++$+++ u6136 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Thanks.  May I offer you both a ride?
L326603 +++$+++ u6140 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ One-two-three, swing.
L327425 +++$+++ u6142 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TEE PEE +++$+++ I'm not putting him down, I just have a commitment to the truth.
L327424 +++$+++ u6138 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ MARCEE +++$+++ Shut up!!!
L327423 +++$+++ u6142 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TEE PEE +++$+++ He should have kept his head tucked down.
L327421 +++$+++ u6142 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TEE PEE +++$+++ What'd I say?
L327420 +++$+++ u6138 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ MARCEE +++$+++ Can you be quiet?
L327419 +++$+++ u6142 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TEE PEE +++$+++ He's gonna have nothing left for next season.  They're letting him kill himself.
L327314 +++$+++ u6142 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ TEE PEE +++$+++ That's why they cheer, you know. The white man sending the black man into battle...
L327313 +++$+++ u6138 +++$+++ m408 +++$+++ MARCEE +++$+++ Now go kiss your daddy, quick.
L329192 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ A bird cage.
L329191 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ What is it?
L329190 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Oh, my God.
L329179 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ One way to find out.
L329178 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Do you think it goes all the way across?
L329079 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ This is how you play God.
L329078 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ This is how you make dinosaurs?
L329015 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Quiet!
L329014 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Eric!
L328983 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much about dinosaurs.
L328982 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ After what you've seen today, you really think your son could be alive?
L328980 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we were better prepared and better armed.  How many days have they been missing?
L328979 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You saved those kids.
L328931 +++$+++ u6149 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ And tell your wife to stop making so much noise! We're food to these damn animals.
L328930 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ ERRR-IIIC!
L329293 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ I would completely support that.
L329292 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Either that, or the government will firebomb it back to the Stone Age.
L329272 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ I do. It's worth another shot. And who knows? Things might turn out differently.
L329271 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You mean it?
L329270 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ We should try fishing again.
L329216 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm glad about that.
L329215 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ He could have died.
L329214 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ How would you have helped Eric?  He needs you, Paul. He needs us.
L329213 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy.
L329212 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ You couldn't have made that jump.
L329211 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ My own kid was right in front of me and I didn't do a damn thing.
L329197 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I'm trying! That thing took him down this way!
L329196 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?
L329184 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ We're not going anywhere, I promise.
L329183 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.
L329163 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Never had a doubt. Never did. Us Kirby men, we stick around, huh?
L329162 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Sweetheart, you're okay.  You're okay.  You're okay.
L329160 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on him when he...
L329159 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ What?...WHAT!?
L329157 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Think.
L329156 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I don't remember
L329155 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ When did you have it last?
L329154 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I don't know. I don't have it with me.
L329134 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ He would have been, safe. Completely, entirely, suffocatingly safe.  I would have him to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. I wanted to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. And so yes, it's my fault that this happened. I'm sorry that you have to be here.
L329133 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ That one time was just the bumper.
L329132 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ This wouldn't happen if he was with you. I mean, you drive five miles below the speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives years.
L329131 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead. What I'm trying to say is, it’s was just a crazy accident. The exact same thing could have happened if he was with me. You can't go beating yourself up about it.
L329130 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Well what?
L329124 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit of good right now. For every scary thing we saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times more of 'em at night.  Am I right?
L329123 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr. Grant are out there somewhere.
L329092 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ We have to help him.
L329091 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It's not safe.
L329090 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ He's this way.
L329089 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Udesky.
L329074 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Eric!
L329073 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Eric! Are you here?
L329056 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ It’s not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out here somewhere. Our baby is all alone.
L329055 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...
L329054 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ No, it's...
L329053 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for the things I said about him.
L329042 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ I filmed this the morning they left.
L329041 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ That's him. That’s Eric!
L329032 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Eric...
L329031 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Young adult.
L329029 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Just drop it Paul!
L329028 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What did you say!
L329027 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Nothing.
L329026 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What did you say?
L329025 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Nothing.
L329024 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What?
L329023 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Oh, don't worry about that.
L329022 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after you, don't come crying to me.
L329021 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Because "Dr. Grant" isn't looking for Eric. Dr. Grant is looking for the coast.
L329020 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Well what's the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him?
L329019 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that...
L329018 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ No, Dr. Grant says...
L329017 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area.
L329016 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Stop that. Dr. Grant says this is dangerous territory.
L328997 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ So do you.
L328996 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You look good.
L328995 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ People change.
L328994 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ You hate to swim.
L328993 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
L328992 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ How much weight have you lost?
L328991 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ Nothing you haven't seen before.
L328990 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Sorry.
L328970 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ We called everyone, did everything we could. Because of all the controversy over this island, no one will step in. Costa Rica says it's a no-fly zone, it's their own damn fault. Guys at the U.S Embassy -- our U.S. Embassy -- said we should "accept the inevitable." You believe that?
L328969 +++$+++ u6145 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ AMANDA +++$+++ A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. They never came back.
L328968 +++$+++ u6150 +++$+++ m409 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Her new boyfriend.
