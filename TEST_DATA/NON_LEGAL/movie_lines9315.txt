L427118 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ Ashamed? No -- I love you, Lynette. I mean that. After I leave them, I'll meet you at the motel, okay?
L427117 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ Sid Worley, I think you're ashamed of me.
L426878 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ Or we could do that yeah.
L426877 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ Like pick up some booze and go to a motel?
L426876 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ What would you girls like to do? Want to stick around here for a little or... or could I suggest another plan...?
L426803 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ Don't worry. I'll respect you afterwards.
L426802 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ You're sure it's okay?
L426801 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ Now what on earth would give you an idea like that?
L426800 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ Something tells me you've been here before.
L426792 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ We don't have to talk at all.
L426791 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ I sure remember Tommy.  Mind if we talked about something else?
L426790 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ I had a big brother who died over there, too. He wasn't no flyer though. He was just your basic Marine Corps type. I was only twelve when it happened, so I don't remember much about him.
L426789 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ Yeah.
L426788 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ Vietnam?
L426787 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ He was. He died.
L426786 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ Is your brother a flyer?
L426785 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ Cake walk. Both my dad and my brother went through it and made it, so I know I can.
L426784 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ You been through the Dilbert Dunker yet?
L426763 +++$+++ u2414 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ SID +++$+++ Yes, ma'am. Four long, hard weeks of sacrifice for my country... for my people... for you. But I survived.
L426762 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ Is this you boys first night of liberty since you got here?
L427270 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ No! That's not true!
L427269 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ You're no better than me, Paula! You're just the same!
L427268 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ God help you, Lynette!
L427260 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ Already come and gone. Can you believe it? He DORed in the twelfth week. How can you win?
L427259 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Lynette, where's Sid?
L427060 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ I do.
L427059 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ No. I never feel like that.
L427058 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ No more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us.  Don't you ever feel used, Paula? Don't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...?
L427057 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward.
L427056 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ I never used to think I'd do something like that, but now I'm not so sure. You ask me, nine weeks just ain't long enough to get a guy to fall in love with you.
L427055 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ No way... Would you?
L427054 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ You know what I mean. Would you... let yourself get pregnant?
L427053 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ What do you mean?
L427052 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ Paula, how far would you go to catch Zack?
L427051 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ I haven't made up my mind.
L427050 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ You serious about having him over?
L426827 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ He'll show. I'd bet my paycheck on it.
L426826 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ You hope.
L426825 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ I told Zack about Saturday night, too. The fifth week's supposed to be the roughest. Come Wednesday, he'll be wishing he took my number.
L426824 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ No, but I told him I'd be at the Town Tavern next Saturday night, and he sounded like he might come.
L426823 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ He ask you out for next weekend?
L426821 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ Big Sid came in about two and a half seconds, then had the nerve to ask, 'Did you make it, too, sweetheart?'
L426820 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ How did it go with you guys?
L426818 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ But in what ways?
L426817 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Everything was different.
L426816 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ What did he do? Did he do anything that was different?
L426815 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Yeah... Mmmm...
L426814 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ Details, Pokrif. From what I saw he had an incredible body.
L426813 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Great.
L426812 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ Well, it you're not gonna ask, then I will. How was it?
L426811 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ I got my foot on the floor.
L426810 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Hurry, Lynette. It's almost midnight.
L426761 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ Come on. Let's go dance.
L426760 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ That was you guys, huh?
L426703 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Don't worry. It grows out about an inch by them.
L426702 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ See you in a month when you get liberty!
L426701 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys.
L426700 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ Paula, look at the new Poopies.
L426699 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Lynette, watch your mouth! Somebody might overhear.
L426698 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ Far fucking out! I've been wanting to meet one of the Blue Angels since I can remember.
L426665 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ One more minute.
L426664 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ Come on, guys. It's five o'clock.
L427266 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ Of course there was a baby. I'd never lie about something like that. Would I, Paula?
L427265 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ You little bitch! How could you? Was there ever a baby, Lynette? That's all I want to know! Did you make up that baby, Lynette? Did you??
L427264 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ Of course. I don't want no Okie from Muscogee. I can get that right here in Port Angeles.
L427263 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ And you turned him down??
L427262 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ That there isn't one, as of today. I had my period.  I couldn't believe it. He still wanted to marry me.
L427261 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ What did you tell him about the baby?
L426892 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ Well, excuse me for livin'!
L426891 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Lynette, just keep your mouth shut until we get to the motel. Will you do that for me, please.
L426890 +++$+++ u2411 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ LYNETTE +++$+++ God! I've never seen anything like that in my whole life! Did you see that guy's nose?
L427290 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Maybe not, but it is the truth. And Zack, you didn't kill him either.
L427289 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ That's brilliant.
L427288 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ However you got it figured, I didn't kill Sid and Lynette didn't kill him! He killed himself!
L427287 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ I bet you do!
L427286 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
L427285 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
L427284 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Yeah. You got the whole story just right.
L427283 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Come on, Paula! You were looking for a ticket out of here and you didn't care who it was, any more than you cared with the last class of candidates you and Lynette fucked your way through, looking for a husband! Or the class before that!
L427282 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Please stop it. None of that's true. Goddamnit, I love you. I loved you ever since I met you.
L427273 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Because he's my friend, too.
L427272 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Why?
L427271 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ I'd like to come with you.
L427237 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ I don't know where that is.
L427236 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ I'm not playing any games! Go look at Lynette's!
L427235 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Hey! You know goddamn well what happened so let's not play any games, okay?
L427234 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Why'd he do it?
L427233 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.
L427232 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ So?
L427231 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ I'm looking for Sid.
L427101 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ I know that.
L427100 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Sure.  Zack, I hope you know I didn't have to show you that picture.
L427099 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ I'll try, but this week we go into survival training, so I can't make any promises.  Well, thanks again for dinner. Thank your mom again for me, will you?
L427098 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Call me during the week if you get the chance.
L427096 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ No wonder he was looking at me like that.
L427095 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Twenty-two years ago.
L427094 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Your real father was an Officer candidate like me?
L427092 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Your real father?
L427091 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Because my real father wouldn't marry her.
L427090 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Why'd your mom marry that guy if she didn't love him?
L427089 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ For a start, I wouldn't marry a man I wasn't in love with.
L427088 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ What would you do differently?
L427087 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Some day. When I'm sure I can do a better job of it than my folks.
L427086 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ No. Is that what you want?
L427085 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Zack, do you ever think about what it'd be like to have kids... a family.
L427084 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Yeah, then if I get jets, it's on to Beeville, Texas.
L427083 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ So, after you graduate you go on to basic flight, right? Is that in Pensacola?
L427082 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ That's okay. I'm used to it.
L427081 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ No, it's okay. It was a great free meal. Everybody was so uptight I felt sorry for you.
L427080 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ I'm so embarrassed. I knew I shouldn't have brought you here.
L427068 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ No, they're for your mom.
L427067 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Are those for me?
L427066 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Hi.
L427048 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ When I'm good and ready.
L427047 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Hey, what about Sunday dinner? When're you gonna let me know?
L427045 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Zack, I don't know if I want to do that...
L427044 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Come on. Invite me. All day the idea of a family Sunday dinner's been coming into my head. Since you're the only one I know around here with family...
L427041 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Hey, will you just leave me alone?
L427040 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ I've seen all that a hundred times.
L427039 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Nothing. Go back to the show, Paula.
L427038 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ What's the matter?
L427016 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ I understand. Maybe we'll see each other after the show...
L427015 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ I'm sorry. I can't sit with you.
L427013 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Naw. You're alone in this world no matter what kinda folks or background you had. Nothing hurts, pard, once you got that one down.
L427012 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Does it still hurt?
L427011 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ The thing that really got to me... she didn't leave a note. Nothing. I've always hated her for that.
L427010 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ God.
L427009 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ My old lady swallowed a bottle of pills one day while I was at school.
L427008 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Who says I'm not going after what I want? My mother's thirty-nine years old and she still works in that factory. Every time I see her, I know exactly what I don't want.
L427007 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ That's no excuse for not going after what you want.
L427006 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ I don't care what the magazines say... it's just not as easy being a girl, especially from a Catholic family. You don't know the junk I grew up listening to, 'bout the way women are supposed to think and act.
L427005 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ What's stopping you?
L427004 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ You know, sometimes I wish I was one of those girls they're letting in the flight program these days. God, I'd love to fly.
L427001 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ They found them like that, shriveled up from weeks without food or water...
L427000 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ I don't want to move. But somebody has to move sometime. Eventually.
L426999 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ I don't want you to move.
L426998 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ I'll get it if you want.
L426997 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Want me to get a towel?
L426996 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ It sure was.
L426995 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ That was great.
L426924 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Any time, sailor.
L426923 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ I forgot to thank you for breakfast.
L426922 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ I've never had a girl.
L426921 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Zack, when you're through with a girl, what do you do? Do you say something or do you just... disappear?
L426919 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ I'm serious. It's gonna be hard to get enough.
L426918 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ You're better than candy.
L426917 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Zack, I dare you not to fall in love with me. I ain't gonna get serious with you, no way. But how can you resist me? I'm like candy.
L426914 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ That's it?
L426913 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ To have a good time with you until you have to go.
L426912 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ What do you want, Paula? What do you really want?
L426911 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ I know who you are and what you want.
L426910 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Paula, I never try to fool anybody about who I am, what I want... so if even in the back of your --
L426909 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ I'm starving.
L426908 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Wrong. I've driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty Hail Mary's since I saw you. Hungry?
L426907 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ You stayed after all.
L426905 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ You got no manners and you never tell the truth! You're nothin' special. And if you ask me, you got no chance at all of being an officer!
L426904 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Be a friend. Leave.
L426903 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ I don't know who you think you're talking to! I ain't some whore you brought here! I've been trying to be your friend and you treat me like shit!
L426902 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Forget it. Just get out of here.
L426901 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Where's that coming from? I wouldn't fuck now if my life depended on it!
L426900 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ You want me to fuck you? Is that it? Okay, come here. Take your clothes off. Get into bed.
L426899 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Opening up just a little wouldn't kill you, ya know.
L426898 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind.
L426897 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Where'd you learn to fight like that?
L426896 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ There's always a choice.
L426895 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ He didn't give you much choice.
L426894 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ I shouldn't have done that. I should've walked.
L426880 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ My kinda group!
L426879 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ I vote for the motel.
L426875 +++$+++ u2415 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ ZACK +++$+++ Me, too.
L426874 +++$+++ u2412 +++$+++ m154 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Who cares?  Mmmm. Now I remember. Mayo the Wop. Gee, I'm glad you're here. I've been looking forward to this all week.
