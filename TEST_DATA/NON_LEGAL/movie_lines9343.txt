L469669 +++$+++ u2554 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ What do you want me to do, Orson? Radio City won't premiere the picture. Louella threatened them with some bullshit about
L469473 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ The ad..
L469472 +++$+++ u2554 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ And this is the evening edition. Notice anything?
L469425 +++$+++ u2554 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ When Hedda says "I'm coming" you mix a lot of martinis and you pray.
L469424 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ The magazines are one thing -- but Hedda! Why did we have to let her come?!
L469423 +++$+++ u2554 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ They've all seen a rough cut
L469422 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ This is an abomination There's no music and--
L469318 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Ah, it's a grand title.
L469317 +++$+++ u2554 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ For the title
L469312 +++$+++ u2554 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ It's the safe bet, Orson. There's nothing wrong with that.
L469311 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Please don't ask me to do this.
L469310 +++$+++ u2554 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ Do WAR OF THE WORLDS as a feature and everyone's happy. You make some money and New York's happy and you have a track record and then we'll move on to KANE.
L469309 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Jesus
L469308 +++$+++ u2554 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ Now don't have a fit -- but I want you to think again about doing WAR OF THE WORLDS-
L469307 +++$+++ u2554 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ Listen, get off your horse with me. You know I've stuck by you since the beginning of time it seems like, while the stockholders in New York were ready to cut and run and everyone else in Hollywood was set to toss me in a rubber room. But your contract stipulates a max budget of 500 thousand. This one's gonna come in at 750 thousand. What do we do about that?
L469306 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I know, I know! But what more can you expect of me?! I have pared this story down to the marrow to save money but to cut more would be to--!
L469305 +++$+++ u2554 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ Now look, Orson, let's not get ahead of ourselves. The budget projections on this--
L469304 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ A "Z" and a "K" in the title. That would draw the eye. For the poster. I like that THE PRISONER OF ZENDA had a "Z" and a "P" and that worked--
L469303 +++$+++ u2554 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ CITIZEN KANE There's your title.
L469302 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Pardon?
L469301 +++$+++ u2554 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ CITIZEN KANE
L469300 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ It's an awful title, of course, but I can't think of anything better. Someone came up with A SEA OF UPTURNED FACES -- which has a nice, grand ring to it -- and I thought of JOHN CITIZEN, USA but that strikes me as a bit Warner Brothers. Or, God forbid, Capraesque. I suppose AMERICAN will do for now but--
L469531 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Yes! Vibrant and modern and stark like a Picasso sketch drawn to flashes of lightning I We shoot the whole thing in the gallant American West--
L469530 +++$+++ u2556 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ TOLAND +++$+++ You want to do the life of Jesus?
L469529 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I'm Christ
L469528 +++$+++ u2556 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ TOLAND +++$+++ He's Christ?

L469415 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ How 'bout a real drink?
L469397 +++$+++ u2556 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ TOLAND +++$+++ Orson -- we can't get the fucking camera any fucking lower so find another fucking shot!
L469396 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Take apart the fucking camera rig -- we could get a few more inches down and then tilt up--
L469395 +++$+++ u2556 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ TOLAND +++$+++ I know what you want but it can't be done!
L469394 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I need my shoes in total focus right here and also Joe back there--!
L469393 +++$+++ u2556 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ TOLAND +++$+++ Spare me the aria, I know what you want--
L469392 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ It's just not low enough. This is the scene. We have to look up at these two man as pillars soaring to the sky. As towering virtues in combat--
L469359 +++$+++ u2557 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Five...? Yes. No. We're done today
L469358 +++$+++ u2556 +++$+++ m165 +++$+++ TOLAND +++$+++ Orson, you wanna take five?
L458974 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ For what?
L458973 +++$+++ u2558 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ 1ST DEPUTY +++$+++ I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in.
L458972 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ About what?
L458971 +++$+++ u2558 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ 1ST DEPUTY +++$+++ They wanna talk to you.
L458970 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I know where you're from. You guys look the same every place.
L458969 +++$+++ u2558 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ 1ST DEPUTY +++$+++ We're from...
L458968 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Huh? Whadda ya mean, get up?
L458967 +++$+++ u2558 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ 1ST DEPUTY +++$+++ Let's go, Jake, wake up!
L458750 +++$+++ u2559 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ COMO +++$+++ Ok, champ.
L458749 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ No, we're all right. Thanks anyway, Tommy.
L458748 +++$+++ u2559 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ COMO +++$+++ Just come by to wish you luck.  Need anything?
L458747 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I'm Ok.
L458746 +++$+++ u2559 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ COMO +++$+++ You just take it easy, now. You'll do all right. Feelin' Ok?
L458745 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Tommy, thanks for coming over.
L458744 +++$+++ u2559 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ COMO +++$+++ Hey champ!
L458683 +++$+++ u2559 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ COMO +++$+++ Make it on his own? Does he know the kind of money involved? I mean the real money. He thinks he's gonna become champ on his own? We're gonna sit by and see some nut come in there and hold one of the most important titles in the world? A nut who don't listen to nobody or respect nobody? Is he really crazy? Listen, Joey, you understand, you tell him. I don't care how great he is or how colorful. He could beat all the Sugar Ray Robinsons and all the Janiros he wants to. He ain't gonna get a shot at the title without us. I'm not askin' you to do another thing except get that message into that thick head!
L458682 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Tommy, Jake respects you. He won't even say hello to anybody else -- you know that. But you know when Jake gets set on somethin', Jesus Christ Almighty could get off the fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna talk him out of it. I'm his kid brother. I got no say with Jake on this. He thinks he can buck everybody and make it on his own.
L458681 +++$+++ u2559 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ COMO +++$+++ He's an embarrassment because Frankie and the other guys are expectin' me to do something about it, and I'm lookin' very bad. I can't deliver a kid from my own neighborhood. Why's he make it so hard on himself? He comes to me, I can make it easier for him.
L458680 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ How can he embarrass you?
L458679 +++$+++ u2559 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ COMO +++$+++ Look Joey, I wanna tell you something. Your brother ain't gonna get nowhere without us -- nowhere. And I'm tellin' you between the two of us, it's gettin' to the point where it's gettin' to be a real embarrassment to me, a real embarrassment.
L458678 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Aw, Tommy, c'mon, it ain't that.
L458677 +++$+++ u2559 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ COMO +++$+++ What is it with you? Can't you talk? You got like a funny attitude. I can't figure you out, Joey. What's with you and the quick answers? You wanna get outa here fast?
L458676 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Yeah, they're good. They're good, Tommy.
L458675 +++$+++ u2559 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ COMO +++$+++ Aside from everything else, your family all right?
L458673 +++$+++ u2559 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ COMO +++$+++ All right, you guys, shake hands.
L458672 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Yeah, I understand, Tommy.
L458671 +++$+++ u2559 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ COMO +++$+++ All right. I don't have to hear any more. I think I understand what happened. I understand it was your brother's wife and there was probably a misunderstanding. I'm not sayin' Salvy shouldn't have acted the way he did. But, Joey, you don't raise your hands. You don't do that kind of thing. This time we forget about it but no more after this. You understand?
L458710 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You got any money you want to bet on Billy Fox, you can put it right here...  'cause Jake LaMotta don't go down for nobody.
L458709 +++$+++ u2560 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ EAGAN +++$+++ What?
L458708 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I'm gonna kill him. That fuckin' jig's gonna wish he never came outa the jungle. You got any money?
L458707 +++$+++ u2560 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ EAGAN +++$+++ I want to believe you, LaMotta.
L458706 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Believe what you want.
L458705 +++$+++ u2560 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ EAGAN +++$+++ Now the fight's off the books altogether. Meyer Lansky couldn't get a bet down on this fight. Some people are saying you're going into the tank.
L458704 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I don't follow no gamblin' Commissioner. I'm just a fighter.
L458703 +++$+++ u2560 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ EAGAN +++$+++ You were a big favorite in this fight. Then two days ago the odds start jumping all over the place until you're a 12-5 underdog.
L458702 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ What who's been sayin'?
L458699 +++$+++ u2560 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ EAGAN +++$+++ I'd like to talk to Jake a minute.
L458698 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ What's up, Colonel?
L458447 +++$+++ u2561 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ IRMA +++$+++ None of your fuckin' business.
L458446 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ And where you goin'?
L458445 +++$+++ u2561 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ IRMA +++$+++ You fuckin' worm, if you're going out, I'm going out.
L458444 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.
L458443 +++$+++ u2561 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ IRMA +++$+++ Where you going at this hour?
L458361 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ No, I can't wait. You know when I wait? When it's important to wait. It's not important to wait for no steak. It's important to wait for Reeves to leave the ring. It ain't important to wait for no steak! I won that fight. So, I stayed in the ring, and that way I made sure everybody knew it. I shoulda knocked him out earlier, sonofabitch.
L458360 +++$+++ u2561 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ IRMA +++$+++ Here's your carrots. You're in such a hurry. You can't wait.
L458359 +++$+++ u2561 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ IRMA +++$+++ Here's your steak. You can't wait for it to be done. Here.
L458358 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ It looks done. I'll take it the way it is.
L458357 +++$+++ u2561 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ IRMA +++$+++ It's not done.
L458356 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ This looks done.
L458948 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Do you think I'd let her in a place like this with guys like you hangin' around?
L458947 +++$+++ u2562 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ J.R. +++$+++ Where's your wife, Jake?
L458946 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Yeah, I really cleaned up on him.
L458945 +++$+++ u2562 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ J.R. +++$+++ I saw you fight Bob Satterfield in '46, Jake. In Chicago. You were great.
L458944 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You're a good sport, lady.
L458942 +++$+++ u2562 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ J.R. +++$+++ You were great, Jake. Just like old times. Good thing Sugar Ray wasn't here tonight. Oh Jake, this is State's Attorney Bronson and his wife.
L458941 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ J.R., glad you could make it.
L458872 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Stop it. What're you, crazy?
L458871 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Was Vickie part of the deal with Tommy? Was my wife part of the deal? Tell me, was that it?
L458840 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ I gotta go. I gotta get outta here. I can't take this shit. Lenore is waitin' for me. I gotta go. You're a definite wacko. You're fuckin' crazy, you know that, crazy.
L458839 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You're very smart, Joey, very smart. Nobody gives me a straight answer around here. You're givin' me these answers, but you still didn't answer my question. Did you fuck Vickie?
L458838 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Whatsa matter with you?
L458837 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Did you ever fuck my wife?
L458836 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Whadda ya mean?
L458835 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I don't mean now. I mean before -- before we met.
L458834 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ What?
L458833 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Did you ever fuck my wife?
L458832 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ You're worried about this girl, you're gonna let this girl ruin you're life for you... You wanna worry, worry about your fuckin' stomach that you can't bend over -- that you gotta step in the ring in a month.
L458831 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Eh, Joey, even you don't know what you meant. You mentioned Salvy, Tommy Como, you -- that means somethin'. Why'd you say them? You coulda said anybody.
L458830 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ So what?
L458829 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ But you said "you."
L458828 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head.
L458827 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ What do you mean, "you"?
L458826 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ What?
L458825 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ What do you mean, "you"?
L458824 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ So, go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill Salvy, kill Vickie, kill Tommy Como, kill me while you're at it. What do I care? You're killing yourself the way you're eating, the way you worry about things you don't have to worry about.
L458823 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You givin' me that look. I gotta accept your word, but if I find out anythin', I'm gonna kill somebody...
L458822 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Well, you're wrong Jack. I'm tellin" you what happened. He got outta line, we had a fight, and it's straightened out now.
L458821 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ When it comes to her, I don't trust nobody. I'm askin' you somethin'.
L458820 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ What bullshit? Hey, I'm your brother. You wanna believe me -- you trust me?
L458819 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Don't bullshit me, Joey. You ain't tellin' me the truth.
L458818 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Some things changed between us. Now, he thinks who the fuck he is. He's been passing certain remarks that I don't like.
L458817 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Then why did you give him a beatin' if he didn't do anything? You and him been friends a long time.
L458816 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ I did keep an eye...
L458815 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'...
L458814 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ What?
L458813 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
L458812 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Whatever you touched, that's good now.
L458810 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Well, I heard some things.
L458809 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Jack, no. I just explained the whole thing to you. It was just between me and Salvy, if it had anything to do with you and Vickie, I woulda told you about it.
L458808 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Who did it have anything to do with... Vickie?
L458807 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ No, I just told you what happened.
L458806 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
L458805 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
L458804 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Why didn't you tell me about it?
L458803 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Nothin'. Salvy was out of line. He was drunk or somethin', I dunno. Anyway, the windup was I gave him a beatin'. Tommy called me down, and we straightened it out. It's all forgotten about.
L458802 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You know, when you gave him a beatin'.
L458801 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ When?
L458800 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Answer me somethin'. What happened at the Copa with Salvy when I was out of town?
L458798 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ I can't tell. You're stomach's in the way.
L458797 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ How's that?
L458796 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Well, that's what I mean.
L458795 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Well, you're not supposed to kiss your mother on the mouth.
L458794 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Ain't a cheek ever good enough for you? I never even kissed Mama on the mouth.
L458793 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ What? I just said hello. Since when I can't kiss my sister-in-law?
L458790 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Where you been?
L458789 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Screw you, Jack.
L458738 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ What am I gonna do for 24 hours? I can't even eat!
L458737 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ So eat just a little. You gotta eat something.
L458736 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I can't eat a steak. If I eat a steak, I'm gonna have trouble making the weigh-in.
L458735 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ I'm gonna order up some stuff. Have a steak.
L458731 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ We did what we had to do. Tommy don't forget. Sooner or later you'll get your shot -- if Tommy don't die.
L458730 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Jesus Christ! Seven months! What am I gonna do for seven months? I'm gonna go crazy. How do I keep my strength? By that time I'll be too weak to win the title. And my weight? Forget about it -- I'm gonna blow up like a balloon. I ain't never gonna hold my weight down. Seven months! I don't know...
L458729 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ All right, you don't wanna fall down, so now you gotta take a rest. So, you enjoy the suspension. 'Cause there's nothin' you can do about it. Let the Commissioner and the D.A. jerk you around. So you wait.
L458728 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Yeah, except fall down. That's right.
L458727 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Except fall down like a normal person.
L458726 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ What the fuck they want? I took the dive. They want me to fall down too? I don't fall down for nobody. I never went down in my life. Joey, what do I gotta do? Crawl on my hands and knees? I made an asshole of myself in the fuckin' Garden! All the newspaper writers make fun of me. I'm the bum of the year. All I want is a shot. Just a fuckin' shot. What do I gotta do? I'll do anything.
L458725 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ See? That's all there was to it.
L458724 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ G'wan, do it.  Protect yourself, rummy.
L458723 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ C'mon, Joey.
L458722 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Stick out your hands, Jake.
L458695 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Yeah, I know.
L458694 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ I got good news, and I got bad news. The good news is you got your shot at the title. The bad news is...
L458693 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ What did Tommy say?
L458692 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.
L458691 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I want you to keep an eye on her when I'm not here. Understand?
L458690 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Jack, if there was anything funny, I would tell you.
L458689 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ When I'm away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her? Tell me the truth.
L458688 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.
L458687 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ What do you mean?
L458686 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to.
L458685 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...
L458684 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Whatcha doin'?
L458587 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Don't be long. I'm afraid with all these tough guys here.
L458586 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Excuse me for a minute. Be right back.
L458583 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ C'mon, Jake. You know she's crazy about you.
L458582 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Didn't you just see her lookin' at him? She told me no, but I don't believe her.
L458581 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Nah, she would never...
L458556 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ This Janiro's an up-and-coming fighter, this kid you gotta knock out. Knockout this fuckin' kid! I'm telling you, this is your step towards getting a shot at the title. Listen to me: I'm telling you. You been killin' yourself for three years. There's nobody left -- they're afraid to fight you. This Janiro's up-and- coming. He don't know. Fuckin' tear him apart, wipe him out! What are you worried about? Your weight? Look, even if you lose they're gonna think you're weak; they're gonna think you're not the fighter you used to be. They'll match you with guys they were afraid to match you with before, and then you'll kill them and you'll get your title shot. And if you beat this kid Janiro, they gotta give you a shot at the title because there's nobody else. Either way you win and you do it on your own -- just like you want it. All right?
L458555 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Say what you gotta say. Don't be a smart ass.
L458554 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ You want the title shot or not?
L458553 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Say what you're gonna say.
L458552 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ You want the title shot?
L458551 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me! Now I don't know if I can make it down to 155. I'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if I don't make 155, I forfeit $15,000! You're supposed to know what you're doin'. You're supposed to be a manager!
L458550 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Jake, you're the one who said you could get down to 155! What did I do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat?
L458549 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I just weighed myself -- I'm 161. No more deals like this Janiro bullshit. I didn't tell you to do it in the first place.
L458548 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ No, take her home. I wanna be alone for a while. Everybody go.
L458547 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ You want us to wait for you?
L458543 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I dunno. Maybe I don't deserve to win. I've done a lot of bad things. I dunno...
L458542 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ You won and was robbed! You didn't do nothin' wrong.
L458541 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked him down. What did I do wrong? I don't understand.
L458540 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ They robbed us! Those fuckin' judges -- What the fuck fight were they watching? If I see them on the street, I'll break their heads. Decision Robinson, my fuckin' ass! Those judges give him the decision 'cause he's goin in the army next week! How else could this have happened?... What do you think they gave him the decision for, that's why.
L458520 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I'm the only guy ever to beat Sugar Ray, and I still don't have a shot at the title.
L458519 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ He fights the toughest guys around that everybody else is afraid to fight...
L458462 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Give me a chance. Let me look.
L458461 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Do you see her yet?
L458454 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ How many times do I have to hit her? I hit her enough.
L458453 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ No, but Jake... how much abuse can you take.
L458452 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Hey, watch your mouth. Don't talk like that. She's still my wife.
L458442 +++$+++ u2564 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ C'mon, hurry up. We're never gonna get outa here tonight.
L458441 +++$+++ u2563 +++$+++ m166 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
