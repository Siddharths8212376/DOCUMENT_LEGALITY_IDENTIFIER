L514572 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ So your mother grew up in Shanghai?
L514551 +++$+++ u7675 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ APRIL +++$+++ I keep waiting for the next novel to come out. Anything in the works?
L514550 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I confess.
L514549 +++$+++ u7675 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ APRIL +++$+++ I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?
L514548 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Better make it charge. 
L514547 +++$+++ u7675 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ APRIL +++$+++ Will that be cash or charge?
L514869 +++$+++ u7687 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ Thanks. I knew you'd understand.
L514868 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying, "One corned beef sandwich," and then, "Another corned beef sandwich," I'll say, "Two corned beef sandwiches."
L514867 +++$+++ u7687 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.
L514866 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ What's the difference?
L514865 +++$+++ u7687 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ Next time, when you want two corned beef sandwiches, say, "Two corned beef sandwiches." When you want two ginger ales, say, "Two ginger ales."
L514864 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ What's that, Sol?
L514863 +++$+++ u7687 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ Do me a favor, will you?
L514862 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ For me?  I'll have the same thing. 
L514861 +++$+++ u7687 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ What about for you?
L514860 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Huh?
L514859 +++$+++ u7687 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ And what about for you?
L514858 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Uh...  My friend over here would like a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale.
L514857 +++$+++ u7687 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ What'll it be, Auggie?
L514909 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Exactly. Life just wouldn't be worth living, would it?
L514908 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Shit. If you can't share your secrets with your friends, what kind of friend are you?
L514907 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I mean, it's a good story.
L514906 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ What do you mean?
L514905 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Yes, I suppose I do.
L514904 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ And now you've got your Christmas story, don't you?
L514903 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I wouldn't say that. But at least you've put the camera to good use.
L514902 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Anything for art, eh, Paul?
L514901 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You made her happy. And the camera was stolen anyway. It's not as if the person you took it from really owned it.
L514900 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ I lied to her, and then I stole from her. I don't see how you can call that a good deed.
L514899 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It was a good deed, Auggie. It was a nice thing you did for her.
L514898 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ I guess so. I never thought of it that way.
L514897 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you.
L514896 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Yeah, probably.
L514895 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ She probably died.
L514894 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Once, about three or four months later. I felt so bad about stealing the camera, I hadn't even used it yet. I finally made up my mind to return it, but Granny Ethel wasn't there anymore. Someone else had moved into the apartment, and he couldn't tell me where she was.
L514893 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Did you ever go back to see her?
L514875 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Okay.  So this is the story of how it happened.  Okay.  It was the summer of 'seventy-six, back when I first started working for Vinnie. The summer of the bicentennial.  A kid came in one morning and started stealing things from the store. He's standing by the rack of paperbacks near the front window stuffing skin magazines under his shirt. It was crowded around the counter just then, so I didn't see him at first....
L514874 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Every word.
L514873 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Okay.  You remember how you once asked me how I started taking pictures? Well, this is the story of how I got my first camera. As a matter of fact, it's the only camera I've ever had. Are you following me so far?
L514872 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I'm all ears.
L514871 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Ready. Any time you are.
L514870 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ So. Are we ready?
L514856 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ You got it.
L514855 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I have to pee.  If the waiter comes, order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale, okay?
L514851 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Take over the register while I'm gone, okay, Jimmy? 
L514850 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be good.
L514849 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Good? Of course. Are you kidding?  I'll tell you what. Buy me lunch, my friend, and I'll tell you the best Christmas story you ever heard. How's that? And I guarantee every word of it is true.
L514848 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Anything good?
L514847 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of 'em.
L514846 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Yeah, great. The problem is, I have four days to come up with something, and I don't have a single idea.  You know anything about Christmas stories?
L514845 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ That's a feather in your cap, man. The paper of record.
L514844 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Fine.  Or it was until a couple of days ago. A guy from The New York Times called and asked me to write a Christmas story. They want to publish it on Christmas Day.
L514843 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Ah-hah.
L514842 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to cut down.  Somebody's worried about my health.
L514841 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ You usually get two.
L514840 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Uh, better make it one.
L514839 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Two, right?
L514838 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Hi, Auggie.
L514837 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Hey, man, how's it going?
L514784 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ We'd better be. I haven't spent a night out of Brooklyn in fourteen years, and I'm not about to break my record now. Besides, I've got to be on my corner at eight sharp tomorrow morning.
L514783 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It's not a long drive. An hour, an hour and a half. We'll be back in time for dinner.
L514782 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ It's Tommy's. The sucker owed me a favor.
L514781 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Nice machine, Auggie. Where'd you find it?
L514780 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Nothing much. He said his socks and underpants were dirty, and would we mind driving up with his things.  Fucking kids, huh? They take you for granted every time.
L514779 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ So what did he say when he called?
L514727 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Or didn't.  There's no way of knowing, is there?
L514726 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ That could be a good sign, though. It could mean that he got away.
L514725 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I spoke to his aunt a couple of days ago, but she hasn't heard from him either. It's beginning to get a little scary.
L514724 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Not a peep.
L514723 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You haven't heard from Rashid, have you?
L514719 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ For once in my life I managed to keep my mouth shut. There's something to be said for that, I suppose.
L514718 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Fuckus my assus. They did some number on you.
L514717 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ No. The ... uh ... the Bobbsey Twins lit out when they heard the sirens. But at least they stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull.  Assaultus interruptus.
L514716 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Cops? You mean they nabbed those cruds?
L514715 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It could have been worse. If the cops hadn't come, I might not be standing here now.
L514687 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Fuck you, kid.
L514686 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It's written all over you like a neon sign. Now say something nice to Rashid to make him feel better.
L514685 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ You're right. I just wasn't sure you knew.
L514684 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ No, he's not. You are.
L514683 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ He's crazy.
L514682 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Don't be an ass, Auggie. He's trying to make it up to you, can't you see that?
L514669 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ If he's got something to tell me, why don't he tell it to me himself?
L514668 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ He's got something to tell you, Auggie.
L514667 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Yeah, well, I'm sorry too.  It took me three years to save up those five thousand bucks, and now I'm broke. I can't hardly pay for this beer. Not to speak of having my credibility destroyed. Do you understand what I'm saying? My credibility. So yeah, I'm sorry, too. About as sorry as I've ever been in my whole fucking life.
L514666 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ The kid's sorry, Auggie.
L514608 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Hey, kid. You interested in a job? I just got word from your employment agency that you're looking for a position in retail sales.
L514607 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.
L514606 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?
L514605 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Hey, Auggie, I've just been thinking. You wouldn't need some help around the store, would you? Some summer help while Vinnie's gone?
L514600 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ How old, kid?
L514599 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.
L514598 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ So, what brings you to a dive like this?
L514594 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ This is April Lee, Auggie. April, say hello to Auggie Wren.
L514593 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Hey, man, good to see you.
L514240 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It's Ellen. Look at her. Look at my sweet darling.
L514239 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Yeah. There she is. She's in quite a few from that year. She must have been on her way to work.
L514237 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Yeah, that's what I'd recommend. You know how it is. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, time creeps on its petty pace.
L514236 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Slow down, huh?
L514235 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ They're all the same, but each one is different from every other one. You've got your bright mornings and your dark mornings. You've got your summer light and your autumn light. You've got your weekdays and your weekends. You've got your people in overcoats and galoshes, and you've got your people in shorts and T-shirts. Sometimes the same people, sometimes different ones. And sometimes the different ones become the same, and the same ones disappear. The earth revolves around the sun, and every day the light from the sun hits the earth at a different angle.
L514234 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ But they're all the same.
L514233 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.
L514232 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What do you mean?
L514231 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ You'll never get it if you don't slow down, my friend.
L514230 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It's kind of overwhelming.
L514229 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ I don't know, it just came to me. It's my corner, after all. It's just one little part of the world, but things happen there, too, just like everywhere else. It's a record of my little spot.
L514228 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Amazing.  I'm not sure I get it, though. I mean, how did you ever come up with the idea to do this ... this project?
L514227 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ It's my project. What you'd call my life's work.
L514226 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I've never seen anything like it.
L514225 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ That's right. More than four thousand pictures of the same place. The corner of 3rd Street and Seventh Avenue at eight o'clock in the morning. Four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather.  That's why I can never take a vacation. I've got to be in my spot every morning. Every morning in the same spot at the same time.
L514224 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ They're all the same.
L514223 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ It can be arranged. Seeing as how I've read your books. I don't see why I shouldn't share my pictures with you.  It would be an honor.
L514222 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I'd like to see your pictures some day.
L514221 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Well, let's not exaggerate. I take pictures. You line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter. No need to mess around with all that artisto crap.
L514220 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ A photographer ...
L514219 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Taking pictures?  It's a long story. I'd need two or three drinks to get through that one.
L514218 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ How'd you get started?
L514217 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am.
L514216 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter.
L514215 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ I guess you could call it a hobby. It doesn't take me more than about five minutes a day to do it, but I do it every day. Rain or shine, sleet or snow. Sort of like the postman.  Sometimes it feels like my hobby is my real job, and my job is just a way to support my hobby.
L514214 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I didn't know you took pictures.
L514213 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ It's mine all right. I've owned that little sucker for a long time.
L514212 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It's yours?
L514211 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Yeah, I did.
L514210 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Looks like someone forgot a camera.
L514209 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ No problem. It's not as though I'm rushing off to the opera or anything.
L514208 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Do you think I could buy some before you leave?
L514207 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ You run out of Schimmelpennincks?
L514206 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Are you closed?
L514097 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I wouldn't think of it.  See you around, fellas.
L514096 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Seven eighty-five out of twenty.  Take care of yourself now, and don't do anything I wouldn't do.
L514086 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Not Elizabeth the Second, Elizabeth the First.  Did you ever hear of Sir Walter Raleigh?
L514085 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ The Queen of England?
L514084 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Definitely.  I suppose it all goes back to Queen Elizabeth.
L514083 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ The boys and I were just having a philosophical discussion about women and cigars. Some interesting connections there, don't you think?
L514082 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Two tins of Schimmelpennincks. And throw in a lighter while you're at it.
L514081 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Hey, man. Good to see you. What'll it be today?
L514080 +++$+++ u7682 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Hey, Auggie. How's it going?
L514756 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ Anything, Auggie. Just name it.
L514755 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ There's just one thing I want to know.
L514754 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ I'm sorry, baby. I can't help it.
L514753 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Fuck this angel shit. Just take the dough, Ruby. But no bawling, okay? I can't stand people who blubber.
L514752 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ I can't believe it. Oh God, I can't believe it.  You're an angel, Auggie. An angel from heaven.
L514751 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ For keeps.
L514750 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ For keeps?
L514749 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ It's all yours, baby.
L514748 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ And you're giving it to me?
L514747 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Five thousand bucks.
L514746 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here.
L514745 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Why don't you open it and find out?
L514744 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ What's this?
L514743 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ No, bully for you.
L514742 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ Bully for you.
L514741 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Remember that business venture I was telling you about? Well, my tugboat came in. I'm flush.
L514740 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ Are you calling me a liar? I'm telling you I'm broke. I don't even have insurance on my goddamned car.
L514739 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ No you're not.
L514738 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ I'd never be able to talk her into it. And even if I could, those things cost money. And that's just what I don't have. I'm flat out dead broke.
L514737 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs.
L514736 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ Dream on, Auggie. She'll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday.
L514735 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ She's just a kid. There's time for more babies later. After she grows up.
L514734 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.
L514733 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Still, you can't just write her off.
L514732 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ I don't have much choice, do I? It's pretty clear she doesn't want me around.
L514731 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ So you're just going to give up and go home?
L514503 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ You told me you wanted to meet him. Well,here he is.
L514502 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Jesus Christ. This is all I need.
L514492 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ When I told her I was going to bring her father, she kind of melted. It's the first time Felicity's talked nice to me since she left home. She's dying to meet you, Auggie.
L514491 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Cut it out. Just cut it out, okay? It's starting to get on my nerves.
L514490 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ She looks just like you.
L514489 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ And what's that supposed to mean?
L514488 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ Wait till you see her, Auggie.
L514487 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Look, I'm not saying you don't have a daughter. It's just that she's not my daughter.
L514486 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ That I wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. At least you'll know I've been telling the truth.
L514485 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Yeah, like what?
L514484 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ Relax, okay? You don't have to do anything. Just go in there and pretend. It won't kill you to do a little favor like that. Besides, you might even learn something.
L514483 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ I think you'd better stop the car and let me out.
L514482 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.
L514481 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ You what?
L514480 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ I told her she was going to meet her father.
L514479 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ Dammit, Auggie, don't ask so many questions. Just get in the car.
L514478 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Where to?
L514477 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ Just get in and shut up. I'm not asking you to do anything. I just need you to come with me.
L514476 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ You don't give up, do you?
L514475 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ Get in, Auggie. I've got something to show you.
L514421 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ I know you think I'm lying to you, but I'm not. Every word I told you is the God's honest truth.
L514420 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ You're a cold-hearted bastard, aren't you? How'd you ever get so mean, Auggie?
L514419 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Nice try, old girl. I'd like to help you out. You know, for old time's sake. But all my spare cash is tied up in a business venture, and I haven't collected my profits yet. Too bad. You caught me at the wrong time.
L514418 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ I thought I could handle it. I didn't want to bug you. I thought I could handle it on my own, but I couldn't. She's in real bad, Auggie.
L514417 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Fifteen years ago?  It won't wash, pumpkin. No mother waits fifteen years to tell a man he's a father. I wasn't born yesterday, you know.
L514416 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ Who the hell knows?  He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
L514415 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days?
L514414 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ Then why do you think I married Frank? I was already pregnant, and I didn't have much time. Say what you like, but at least he gave my kid a name.
L514413 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ You're conning me, sweetheart. I ain't responsible for no baby.
L514412 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.
L514411 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ A couple of moments, I'll grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity.
L514410 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ It fizzled, baby. That's the way it goes. But we had our times, didn't we? It wasn't all bad.
L514409 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ You weren't so lukewarm yourself. At least at first.
L514408 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ It was over with Bill before you ever came home. Maybe you don't remember it now, but you were pretty hot to see me back then.
L514407 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ Yeah, well, I lost my pen. By the time I got a new one, I was clean out of paper.
L514406 +++$+++ u7684 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ RUBY +++$+++ You didn't write to me for more than a year. What was I supposed to think?
L514405 +++$+++ u7676 +++$+++ m519 +++$+++ AUGGIE +++$+++ That's what you told me when I shoplifted that necklace for you. You remember, baby, don't you? The judge gave me a choice: either go to the can or enlist. So, instead of going to college, I wind up in the navy for four years, I watch men lose their arms and legs, I nearly get my head blown off, and you, sweet Ruby McNutt, you run off and marry that asshole, Bill.
