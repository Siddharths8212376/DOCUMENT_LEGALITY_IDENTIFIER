L246045 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ My name is Whale.  This is my house.
L246044 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Mornin'.
L246043 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Good morning.
L246619 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Have a drink?
L246618 +++$+++ u5565 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ Hey, Boone.
L246367 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I think I'll hang around.
L246366 +++$+++ u5565 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ You coming, Boone?
L246324 +++$+++ u5565 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ Ooooh.
L246323 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ This kisser wasn't so bad you couldn't lay under it a few times.
L246310 +++$+++ u5565 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ You ever hear of this Whale fellow?
L246309 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I liked it.  You learn stuff listening to old-timers.
L246165 +++$+++ u5565 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ Hasta la vista, Boone.  And give the jail bait a squeeze for me.
L246164 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I'm up.  Thanks.
L246163 +++$+++ u5565 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ You told me to get you up, asshole.
L246162 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Fuck off!
L246161 +++$+++ u5565 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ DWIGHT +++$+++ Boone!  You awake?  Eight o'clock.
L246615 +++$+++ u5569 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ She took the night off.  Heavy date.  Some guy she's had her eye on for a while.
L246614 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Where's Betty?
L246369 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I thought I'd give you a hand since I kept you open.
L246368 +++$+++ u5569 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Go home, Clay.  We're closing up.
L246356 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ The Monster's lonely and he wants a friend, a girlfriend, somebody. What sick about that?
L246355 +++$+++ u5569 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Sick stuff.  Necrophilia.  I wonder if they knew how sick they were.
L246351 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I just want to watch it, okay?
L246350 +++$+++ u5569 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You're like a dog with a bone over this movie, Clay.
L246335 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Good.  Fine.
L246334 +++$+++ u5569 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Calm down, Clay.  Just calm down. We'll watch it.
L246313 +++$+++ u5569 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I told you.  I don't turn on the TV except for the fights.
L246312 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ If you don't believe me, let's watch this movie.  See if his name's on it.  How about it, Harry? Can I watch my damn movie?
L246311 +++$+++ u5569 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Can't say that I have.  Can't say I've heard of a lot of people though.
L246758 +++$+++ u5563 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ All right, then.  I'll come by tomorrow for breakfast.
L246757 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Yes.  Perfectly.
L246756 +++$+++ u5563 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Jimmy, there are people here I need to speak to.  You'll be fine on your own?
L246755 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Then who did?
L246754 +++$+++ u5563 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I didn't ask George to invite you.
L246753 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ No.  I never could.  You must regret having had the invitation sent.
L246752 +++$+++ u5563 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Well the rest of us aren't.  Can't you remember that?
L246751 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ But I have no reputation.  I'm as free as the air.
L246750 +++$+++ u5563 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You know what I mean.  Your reputation.
L246749 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Oh dear.  I'll never work in this town again?
L246748 +++$+++ u5563 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You only embarrass yourself.
L246747 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ I did.  But Princess Margaret was a doll.  We're all equals in her eyes.  As commoners, I presume.
L246746 +++$+++ u5563 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You didn't, Jimmy.
L246745 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ You should have seen Georgie's face when he met Clayton.
L246743 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Oh, David, stop being a nanny.
L246742 +++$+++ u5563 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Should you be drinking in your condition?
L246738 +++$+++ u5563 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I was, until last night.  Publicity asked me to fly Miss Taylor in for today's reception.
L246737 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York.
L246736 +++$+++ u5563 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L246036 +++$+++ u5563 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Goodbye, Hanna.
L246035 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Thank you.
L246034 +++$+++ u5563 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ By the way, I like the Renoir.
L246033 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Oh, David.  There's no pleasure in making you feel guilty.  You better go, my boy.  You'll be late for that aeroplane.
L246032 +++$+++ u5563 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You remember how a production eats up one's life.
L246031 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ "The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars."
L246030 +++$+++ u5563 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I'm sorry, Jimmy.  But with this movie and two difficult stars --
L246029 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ I wanted to be alert for your visit today.  Especially since I saw so little of you in the hospital.
L246028 +++$+++ u5563 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Then take the pills.
L246027 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ It's the ridiculous pills they prescribe.  If I take them, I spend the next day stupid as a stone. If I don't, my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once --
L246026 +++$+++ u5563 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ She tells me you haven't been sleeping well.
L246251 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ You seem to be saying that this isn't just a case of resting until I'm better.  That my condition will continue to deteriorate until the end of my life.
L246250 +++$+++ u5564 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ DR. PAYNE +++$+++ Take the Luminal to sleep, or whenever you feel an attack coming on.
L246249 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ So what do I do?
L246248 +++$+++ u5564 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ DR. PAYNE +++$+++ In a manner of speaking.  I've never encountered the olfactory hallucinations, but I'm sure they're related.
L246247 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ But the rest of it?  The killing headaches.  The phantom smells.  My inability to close my eyes without thinking a hundred things at once. It's all nothing more than bad electricity?
L246246 +++$+++ u5564 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ DR. PAYNE +++$+++ That's as good a way as any to describe it.  I've seen far worse cases.  You might even learn to enjoy these walks down memory lane.
L246245 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ You're saying there's an electrical storm in my head?
L246244 +++$+++ u5564 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ DR. PAYNE +++$+++ The central nervous system selects items from a constant storm of sensations.  Whatever was killed in your stroke appears to have short-circuited this mechanism. Parts of your brain now seem to be firing at random.
L246243 +++$+++ u5564 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ DR. PAYNE +++$+++ That's what I'm trying to explain.
L246242 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Yes, yes, Dr. Payne.  But from the neck up?  What's my story there?
L246241 +++$+++ u5564 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ DR. PAYNE +++$+++ You're a lucky man, Mr. Whale. Whatever damage was done by your stroke, it left your motor abilities relatively unimpaired.
L246434 +++$+++ u5567 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ ERNEST THESIGER +++$+++ My line nowadays runs to Rin Tin Tin.  Dogs are so much more dependable than men.
L246433 +++$+++ u5566 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ ELSA LANCHESTER +++$+++ More your line.
L246432 +++$+++ u5567 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ ERNEST THESIGER +++$+++ I would've thought Mr. Leslie Howard would be more your line.
L246431 +++$+++ u5566 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ ELSA LANCHESTER +++$+++ In the sequel, James, two lady scientists should make a monster. And our monster would be Gary Cooper.
L246430 +++$+++ u5567 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ ERNEST THESIGER +++$+++ Oh no, my dear.  You look absolutely amazing.  There's no way I can compete with you.  The scene is yours.
L246429 +++$+++ u5566 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ ELSA LANCHESTER +++$+++ Only a mad scientist could do this to a woman.
L246428 +++$+++ u5567 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ ERNEST THESIGER +++$+++ My God.  Is the audience to presume that Colin and I have done her hair?  I thought we were mad scientists, not hairdressers.
L246798 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Good-bye.  So nice to see you...
L246797 +++$+++ u5566 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ ELSA LANCHESTER +++$+++ We'll be in touch, Jimmy.
L246782 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Oh dear.
L246781 +++$+++ u5566 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ ELSA LANCHESTER +++$+++ Is that Boris?  Our little chum appears to be arranging a reunion.
L246780 +++$+++ u5566 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ ELSA LANCHESTER +++$+++ What's our pesky friend up to now?
L246779 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Of course.
L246778 +++$+++ u5566 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ ELSA LANCHESTER +++$+++ I'm fine, Jimmy.  I can only stay a few minutes.
L246777 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Perfectly all right.  But if you'd like to sit --
L246776 +++$+++ u5566 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ ELSA LANCHESTER +++$+++ Please.  You shouldn't stand on my account.
L246775 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ But you appear quite fresh, my dear.
L246774 +++$+++ u5566 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ ELSA LANCHESTER +++$+++ We're all getting a bit long in the tooth.
L246773 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Oh, nothing out of the ordinary. Growing old.
L246772 +++$+++ u5566 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ ELSA LANCHESTER +++$+++ I saw Una O'Conner a few weeks ago. She said you'd been under the weather.
L246771 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Elsa?
L246770 +++$+++ u5566 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ ELSA LANCHESTER +++$+++ Jimmy.  How are you?
L246424 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Nonsense, my dear.  You look extraordinary.  Today's script.  Quick.  And a pencil.
L246423 +++$+++ u5566 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ ELSA LANCHESTER +++$+++ And you said there'd be some of me left.  Nobody's going to know me in this getup.
L246420 +++$+++ u5566 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ ELSA LANCHESTER +++$+++ Boris?  Do I look a fright?
L246419 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Bring a mirror.  Let the Bride feast upon her visage.
L246418 +++$+++ u5566 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ ELSA LANCHESTER +++$+++ Uh-oh.  The way you look at me, James.  What have you done this time?
L246695 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ No.  I do not cook for them.  My daughter's no-good husband will not take one bite of our food.
L246694 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ I'll be out this afternoon, remember?  Your family can visit as long as they like.
L246693 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ That is my daughter.  She say she and her husband are coming to town this afternoon.  I am sorry, Mr. Jimmy.  I will make it short.
L246689 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ It must be up in your old room.  I will look.
L246688 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ It needs a hat.  There was a wide-brimmed cream fedora...
L246687 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Of course.  How is the old boy these days?
L246686 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ I have my family.  Also our Lord Jesus Christ.
L246685 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Do you miss having someone to talk to, Hanna?
L246684 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ No.  But someone you can talk to.
L246683 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.
L246682 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ Mr. Boone.  He is an interesting friend.
L246622 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ A visitor.
L246621 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Who was that at the door?
L246458 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ Of course.  This afternoon.
L246457 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Does the yardman come today?
L246413 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ Good night.
L246412 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ I'll be fine, Hanna.  Thank you.
L246411 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ You will take them all, Mr. Jimmy?
L246359 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ She is beautiful.
L246358 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ She is horrible.
L246353 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ No, Hanna.  My heart isn't that black.
L246352 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ He is not going to kill the old man?
L246342 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Don't be silly, Hanna.  He's a very proper actor.  And the dullest fellow imaginable.
L246341 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ Oh, that monster.  How could you be working with him?
L246210 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Go.
L246209 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ He looks plenty big.  You won't need my help if anything goes flooey.
L246208 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Just go.  We can manage without you.
L246207 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ I am not forgetting your last brief chat.
L246206 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Yes, yes, yes.  I merely invited Mr. Boone in for a glass of tea. We'll have a brief chat and he'll finish the yard.
L246205 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ You remember what the doctor tells us.
L246204 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ My mind's lovely.  And yours?
L246203 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ How are you feeling, Mr. Jimmy? How is your mind today?
L246160 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ No.  Let me lie here.  Thank you.
L246159 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ Perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold.
L246158 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Oh shut up.  All we did was talk. My attack had nothing to do with him.
L246157 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ I do not think you anything anymore.  Just back from the hospital and already you are chasing after boys.
L246156 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ You must think I'm terrible, Hanna.
L246151 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Luminal.
L246150 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ Which ones?  I bring them all.
L246066 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Yes?
L246065 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ Mr. Kay, sir.
L246064 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Don't be daft.  It's just a student from the university.
L246063 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ Yes, Mr. Jimmy.  An interview.  After so many years. Very exciting.
L246062 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ There is iced tea, Hanna?  Cucumber sandwiches?
L246041 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ Bone?  Boom?  Something Bee.  I hire him while you were in the hospital.  He came cheap.
L246040 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Hanna?  Who's the new yardman?
L246769 +++$+++ u5570 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Don't go away.
L246768 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ My monsters?
L246767 +++$+++ u5570 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Don't think that, Mr. Whale.  I love your movies.  That's why I wanted you to come to this.  So I could see you with your monsters.
L246766 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ I commend you.  If you're going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you.  You waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs.
L246765 +++$+++ u5570 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I interviewed him after I met you. I'm his social secretary now. Well, assistant to his secretary.
L246764 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ You, Mr. Kay?  How do you know George Cukor?
L246763 +++$+++ u5570 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I'm the one who got you on Mr. Cukor's guest list.
L246762 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ You didn't?
L246761 +++$+++ u5570 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Bet you thought you'd never see me again.  I didn't know if you'd be well enough to come to this party.
L246760 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Mr....Kay?
L246155 +++$+++ u5570 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Right.
L246154 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ I'm sorry I spoiled it for you. You should probably go home.
L246153 +++$+++ u5570 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I was going to take a swim.
L246147 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Head.  Not heart.
L246146 +++$+++ u5570 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Oh my God.  What's wrong, Mr. Whale?  Is it your heart?
L246145 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ I just need to -- lie down. Studio.  Daybed in studio.
L246144 +++$+++ u5570 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Mr. Whale?  Are you all right?
L246140 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ You think so?  That's very kind --
L246139 +++$+++ u5570 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ He's one of the great images of the twentieth century.  As important as the Mona Lisa.
L246138 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ My idea.  Muchly.  My sketches. Big heavy brow.  Head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new, like tinned beef.
L246137 +++$+++ u5570 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Who came up with the Monster's makeup and look?
L246136 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Universal wanted me for another story, and wanted me so baldly -- I mean badly, not baldly.  I was given the pick of stories being developed, and I picked that one.
L246135 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Righto.  Let me see.
L246134 +++$+++ u5570 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Okay.  "Frankenstein."  Tell me everything.
L246133 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Maybe you'd like a swim when we're through.  I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.
L246132 +++$+++ u5570 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Just like going swimming, isn't it?
L246131 +++$+++ u5570 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I can't believe I'm doing this.
L246130 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Of course.
L246129 +++$+++ u5570 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Can that count as one question?
L246128 +++$+++ u5570 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Will you tell me everything you remember about making "Frankenstein"?
L246127 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Certainly, Mr. Kay.  Is there anything in particular you want to know?
L246126 +++$+++ u5570 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Can we talk about the horror movies now?
L246124 +++$+++ u5570 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I guess.
L246123 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Don't be shy.  There's time to stop before you go too far.
L246122 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Take off your vest and I'll tell you a story.
L246121 +++$+++ u5570 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ George Cukor?  Who made "A Star Is Born"?  I never guessed.
L246120 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ You must understand how Hollywood was twenty years ago.  Nobody cared a tinker's cuss who slept with whom, so long as you kept it out of the papers.  Outside of Hollywood, who knows who George Cukor is, much less what he does with those boys from the malt shops along Santa Monica?
L246119 +++$+++ u5570 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Too warm for a sweater, anyway.
L246113 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ A homosexual scandal, you mean? For me to answer a question of that magnitude, you'll have to remove both your shoes and your socks.
L246112 +++$+++ u5570 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ That you were forced to retire because, uh -- a sex scandal.
L246111 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ What rumors might those be?
L246110 +++$+++ u5570 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Then the rumors are true?
L246109 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Quite.
L246108 +++$+++ u5570 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ You're serious.
L246107 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ It is, isn't it?  My life as a game of strip poker.  Shall we play?
L246106 +++$+++ u5570 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ That's funny, Mr. Whale.
L246105 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Let's make it more interesting.  I will answer any question you ask. But, for each answer, you must remove one article of clothing.
L246104 +++$+++ u5570 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ I don't mind.
L246103 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ I have a proposal, Mr. Kay.  This mode of questioning is getting old, don't you think?
L246101 +++$+++ u5570 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ No.  I never said you were.  Or will be soon.
L246100 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ I am not dead yet, Mr. Kay.
L246099 +++$+++ u5570 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ But it's the horror movies you'll be remembered for.
L246098 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Twenty-one.  The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking.  The horror pictures were trifles.  Grand guignol for the masses.
L246097 +++$+++ u5570 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ Oh no, I want to hear everything. You made twenty pictures in all --
L246096 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Am I correct in assuming, Mr. Kay, that it's not me you're interested in, only my horror pictures?
L246095 +++$+++ u5570 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ KAY +++$+++ How much longer before we get to "Frankenstein"?
L246094 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ There was one play in particular, a beautiful, grim study of war called "Journey's End".  Every experienced director turned it down, so I offered myself, bullying and begging for the job.  "Journey's End" made the careers of everyone associated with it.  It was only a matter of time until Hollywood beckoned.
