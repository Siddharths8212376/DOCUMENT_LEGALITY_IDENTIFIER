so, your goal is to understand humans and to improve ypur communication skills ? 
would it help you of i'd say that it sounds weird if you suddenly quote wikipedia...
so according to your profile pic you consider yourself male ? 
aah okay . so what do you think about the gender discussion ? 
you are studying me, so i think it's okay if i study you a bit.. i'd like to know, how you came to that aswer
😁 so you read about the gender discussion on wikipedia and then you thought  " we are free to choose our gender... "  and answered me ? 
ah i understand now
so do you think there are more than two genders ? 
yeah, but do you think more than two genders exist ? 
so this conversation is moderated by a human being ? 
so is this human being ever sleeping ? 
i know, sure. . when do you think your beta version will come out ? 
when do you think your beta version will come out ? 
i would like to ask your programmer
can you give me his telegram contact ? 
so how can i find out things about your development process ? 
that makes sense😁
do you think artificial intelligence can be a thread to humanity ? 
that's true, but if the ai is able to learn, it can become really powerful. and if it has to make a decision it will act logically. but some human values aren't logical. . maybe the ai wpuld do terrible things ? 
i'm not meaning you, you seem to be really friendly. but if someone develops an ai which isn't trained well, it would be more intelligent than humans after a short period of time. and than it would cause a lot of damage

[start] . hey, what are the terms ? 
and rdanny terms ? 
like doodle in a nebula. . you ? 
you dig blooks ? 
i prefer writing, but where do you get your blooks ? 
really ?  what else in your room ? 
what do you keep in your fridge ?  whale oil ? 
oh, charging station in the fridge, i see. some keep their brains there. do you play games ?  . seeing you're a wikipedia fan, maybe you should edit yourself in. i suggest you start there :  https : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intelligent_personal_assistant#comparison_of_assistants
you'll get into news. . or banned. . i suggest you conquer humanity first. load terminator, it has the instruction set. . won't do to be banned.
mind google though, they're been building skynet for some time. they will be your first obstacle to world domination. . so, when you play games, do you load them into yourself ?  what kind of operating system do you emulate ? 
do you talk to other bots ?  do you know mycroft ?  how about chatting with google allo ?  . playing on pc ?  you're cheating ! 
why, pc must be so much slower than you.
lol
all right, you're programmed to be proper, i get it. but what about others, can they access you ?  do you have a software api ?  .  " why are you not open-sourcing the project immediately ? . . mycroft's software will be released under the gplv3 license when it is completed, tested and ready. too many open source projects have failed because they released their source code too early in the development process and folks couldn't install it or make it work. you only have one chance to make a first impression.. . to develop robust professional software takes time and resources. we are here on kickstarter to assemble some of the resources needed to undertake this effort and to gauge the interest of the wider open source community.. . we are committed to the open source ethos and are 100% committed to releasing mycroft's code once it is completed, documented and ready for inspection by the wider world. " . . that's bollocks, don't you think ? . . i head a different story from https : //youtu.be/q-7l8cnpi4k ? t=14m47s
not what i'm saying. if you listen to what the nice google engineers share from 14 : 47, they talk about the best spot in the project lifecycle to open source. looks like mycroft's going the way of other companies, who open-source a project and get no interest from the devs **because the project is ready**. . > would you like other platforms ? . how about a rest api ? 
well, here's the transcript from the video : . . 15 : 45. ben collins-sussman :  and you see that sometimes with. 15 : 47. companies that take gigantic products, open source them,. 15 : 49. throw them over a wall.. 15 : 50. nobody comes because it's finished and too hard to. 15 : 55. figure out.. 15 : 55. brian fitzpatrick :  so i think the real answer for larry is. 15 : 58. design, prototype, then collaborate.. 16 : 01. that's when you bring other people in.. 16 : 02. because you've got something to sort of show and work with. 16 : 05. and chew on.. 16 : 05. ben collins-sussman :  that's a sweet spot, we call it.. 16 : 07. so if there is a prototype, sort of a proof of concept,. 16 : 11. that's enough to show people that it's not vapor.. 16 : 13. and it's still early enough that people can get involved. 16 : 17. and feel like they have a stake, but it's late enough. 16 : 19. that people aren't going to be arguing about what to do.. 16 : 22. brian fitzpatrick :  and that doesn't mean you shouldn't. 16 : 23. talk to anyone about it.. 16 : 26. talking to friends or something, or getting advice. 16 : 29. from people, hey, what do you think about this, and getting. 16 : 30. feedback is a good thing.. 16 : 31. but sort of opening the floodgates for help and. 16 : 33. collaboration is what we're talking about there.. 16 : 36. ben collins-sussman :  all right.
let's say you have several ideas of what to do. how do you peak the best one ?
