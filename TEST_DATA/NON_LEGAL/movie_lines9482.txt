L626441 +++$+++ u3360 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ GANG EXPERT +++$+++ They're Chinamen who speak English. We call them informants.
L626437 +++$+++ u3360 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ GANG EXPERT +++$+++ Neither.
L626436 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Pardon... Which dialect do you speak?
L626435 +++$+++ u3360 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ GANG EXPERT +++$+++ -- Me? Neither.
L626434 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Do you speak Cantonese, Mandarin, or both?
L626433 +++$+++ u3360 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ GANG EXPERT +++$+++ ...For ten years, now.
L626432 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You're the police expert in Chinatown gangs?
L626596 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Screw you too, Kitty.
L626595 +++$+++ u3362 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ KITTY +++$+++ I need sleep. Some of us are mere mortals.
L626594 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I don't need sleep!
L626593 +++$+++ u3362 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ KITTY +++$+++ Eddie... go home. Get some sleep.
L626590 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ EXACTLY!
L626589 +++$+++ u3362 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ KITTY +++$+++ Eddie... A guilty client's not the end of the world...
L626387 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Nothing has. But that's all changing.
L626386 +++$+++ u3362 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ KITTY +++$+++ Eddie this is silly... are we supposed to pretend nothing's happened in the last ten years and --
L626385 +++$+++ u3362 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ KITTY +++$+++ Eddie, if I wanted to make love with you again, I'd do it sober.
L626384 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You do.
L626383 +++$+++ u3362 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ KITTY +++$+++ You don't drink "booze".
L626382 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Got any booze in the house?
L626381 +++$+++ u3362 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ KITTY +++$+++ Right.
L626380 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I haven't paid you.
L626379 +++$+++ u3362 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ KITTY +++$+++ I'm a professional, Eddie. Getting paid is all the thanks I require.
L626378 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I haven't thanked you for your work, Kitty. You're doing good work.
L626373 +++$+++ u3362 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ KITTY +++$+++ A number of them are dead, three are in prison, one's a waiter... Two -- you'll enjoy this -- two are actually members of the Chamber of Commerce.
L626372 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ The Joe Boys in 1980...!
L626370 +++$+++ u3362 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ KITTY +++$+++ Eddie, these things take time. Particularly at this hour...
L626369 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ -- Find him?
L626328 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I don't have time to read every word in every report, I'm too busy getting killed in court... Meantime my crackerjack investigator can't find the goddam art supplies store where Chuckie-fucking-Roeder works!
L626327 +++$+++ u3362 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ KITTY +++$+++ I didn't put him in a wheelchair. Reynard did. He can get around without one -- it's all in my report.
L626326 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ A fucking wheelchair?
L626270 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Have you considered that Chuckie Roeder's not calling himself Chuckie Roeder these days? Get his mugshot from one of the many law officers who've got hotpants for you... then canvass those art supplies places. We're gonna win this one, Kitty, but ya gotta believe...
L626269 +++$+++ u3362 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ KITTY +++$+++ I've phoned every art supply retailer and wholesaler in the Tri-state area. No one's heard of Chuckie Roeder.
L626267 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ But I like that theory. And since I'm not putting Twerp Professor on the stand, and since I don't have a better theory, I'm sticking with that theory. Meantime I want pictures of the Joes. What'll you bet there was a guy in the gang looked enough like Shu to fool the eyewitnesses!
L626266 +++$+++ u3362 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ KITTY +++$+++ So there goes your theory about the Joes giving up Shu to protect their trigger man.
L626155 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I lied.
L626154 +++$+++ u3362 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ KITTY +++$+++ "...are close to naming the man they believe actually killed Jimmy Chin"?
L626153 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I embroidered.
L626152 +++$+++ u3362 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ KITTY +++$+++ "Dowd also reports that his team of private investigators..."?
L626151 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I embellished.
L626107 +++$+++ u3362 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ KITTY +++$+++ I was never politically correct enough for Comrade Dowd.
L626106 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Start looking into the Joe Boys -- who assigned the hits in 1980, what rank generally did the hits...  Your extensive law enforcement contacts should be of some use.
L626043 +++$+++ u3362 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ KITTY +++$+++ I'm kicking myself, Eddie... Right out of here.
L626042 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Forget it. You've blown your chance to participate in this case, Kitty.
L626041 +++$+++ u3362 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ KITTY +++$+++ Just which Constitutional amendment protects our right to peddle PCP?
L626040 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Kitty, where exactly do you place the microphone to catch the most incriminating moans?
L626039 +++$+++ u3362 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ KITTY +++$+++ Beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors.
L626038 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Lemme guess. Some corporate V.P.'s banging his secretary over lunch and you have to focus your camera and plug in your little tape recorder.
L626036 +++$+++ u3362 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ KITTY +++$+++ Eddie, I'm not working on this case. You boys have fun.
L626035 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Stipe was just one of four eyewitnesses who came forward, Kitty. Y'oughta start looking for the others...
L626034 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ It hasn't been that long.
L626033 +++$+++ u3362 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ KITTY +++$+++ You're doing a murder case?
L626032 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Murder witness.
L626565 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ For awhile we had this dream we were innocent. That was our bond... but then we woke up. And now I'd like to hear everything.
L626564 +++$+++ u3368 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ SHU +++$+++ When you leave this place you're going out to dinner or a movie or get laid. Where's our bond? I'm going back to my cell and wait to die. So tell me: Where's our bond?
L626560 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ By trusting me. Shit, man...
L626559 +++$+++ u3368 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ SHU +++$+++ -- How could I help you?
L626557 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Jimmy Chin? Was that self-defense too?
L626556 +++$+++ u3368 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ SHU +++$+++ It was self-defense.
L626555 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I didn't need to know that a man I'm defending on a gang-murder rap is a prison soldier who kills over drugs?
L626554 +++$+++ u3368 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ SHU +++$+++ When I joined up I took an oath of secrecy. I told you what you needed to know.
L626553 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Quite a bit you didn't tell me.
L626314 +++$+++ u3368 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ SHU +++$+++ It's okay, Eddie.
L626313 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ ...I'm dying out there.
L626225 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ "No," what?
L626224 +++$+++ u3368 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ SHU +++$+++ No.
L626221 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Well I know that you're innocent, Shu -- even if you forgot.
L626220 +++$+++ u3368 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ SHU +++$+++ I don't know shit, man! Goddammit --
L626219 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You can't. So tell me what you do know -- say it!
L626218 +++$+++ u3368 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ SHU +++$+++ How can I tell you what I don't know!
L626217 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ No. You tell me, Shu.
L626216 +++$+++ u3368 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ SHU +++$+++ You tell me, man.
L626215 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What went down?
L626214 +++$+++ u3368 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ SHU +++$+++ About Chinatown. What went down.
L626213 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ -- About what?
L626212 +++$+++ u3368 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ SHU +++$+++ I don't know. The truth, maybe.
L626211 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Afraid of what?
L626210 +++$+++ u3368 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ SHU +++$+++ Maybe... because someone's afraid.
L626209 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ But why?
L626208 +++$+++ u3368 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ SHU +++$+++ I guess he... wanted you to think he was... somebody he wasn't.
L626207 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ But why would a guy would do that? Paint black teardrops on his face?
L626205 +++$+++ u3368 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ SHU +++$+++ "Painted"?
L626204 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ An Aryan Warrior with black teardrops painted on his face.
L625986 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ ...Okay...
L625985 +++$+++ u3368 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ SHU +++$+++ I killed the motherfucker.
L625984 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Exactly what happened then?
L625983 +++$+++ u3368 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ SHU +++$+++ Racist asshole came at me.
L625982 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Want to tell me what went down here?
L625981 +++$+++ u3368 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ SHU +++$+++ Figures.
L625980 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ That's right.
L625979 +++$+++ u3368 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ SHU +++$+++ My mother find you?
L626086 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Mr. Rabin has no right to --
L626085 +++$+++ u3370 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ STIPE +++$+++ I'd l-like to answer the question.
L626075 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Stipe.
L626074 +++$+++ u3370 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ STIPE +++$+++ No, s-sir.
L626073 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Did the police make any attempt to phone you, to follow up?
L626072 +++$+++ u3370 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ STIPE +++$+++ Y-yes, sir.
L626071 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ ...You told the Desk Sergeant you were certain Mr. Kim wasn't the killer?  You left your telephone number?
L626070 +++$+++ u3370 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ STIPE +++$+++ I always t-tell the truth.  That's why I'm here.
L626069 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ When the D.A. hears I filed the writ, he'll send someone here, maybe claiming to be a journalist. That person will ask you lots of questions. Just be truthful, Cecil, okay? To all of us?
L626068 +++$+++ u3370 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ STIPE +++$+++ They g-got the wrong g-guy.
L626067 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Are you willing to testify that the man you saw shoot Jimmy Chin was not the man the cops arrested?
L626066 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Good. Now we're going to take an affadavit from you, but only concerning the facts of the Chinatown shooting. We honestly don't give a shit about the Kennedy assassination.
L626065 +++$+++ u3370 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ STIPE +++$+++ I did two tours in 'Nam...
L626057 +++$+++ u3370 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ STIPE +++$+++ Hey, Chinese people have this energy field that vibrates at a particular frequency.
L626056 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Oh come on, Cecil.
L626049 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ See-cil. I'm Eddie Dowd, this is Roger Baron. We're lawyers.
L626048 +++$+++ u3370 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ STIPE +++$+++ See-cil.
L626047 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ 'lo, Cecil.
L626775 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ No? Then what did he say?
L626774 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ No.
L626772 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I hope so, Mr. Reynard.
L626771 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ I think you're a dangerous man, Mr. Dowd.
L626770 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Isn't it true that without Esparza, you had no investigation?
L626769 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ You're trespassing into the area of witness protection, Mr. Dowd. Such showboating puts lives at risk.
L626768 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I didn't say he was an informant. But since you mentioned it, wasn't Esparza your primary informant?
L626767 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ I can't be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact.
L626766 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ -- But you just said you were personally involved with all the principals of the investigation.
L626765 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ I don't think I know that name.
L626764 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ And who was Arturo Esparza?
L626763 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ In those days, they often worked as a team.
L626762 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ The same three detectives on the Jimmy Chin case.
L626761 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ Lou Sklaroff, Vin Badalato, Dave Montell.
L626760 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ And who were the detectives who assisted you, Mr. Reynard?
L626759 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ Mr. Dowd, I was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation.
L626758 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Did you do any hands-on work or did you just supervise, from on high?
L626757 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ If I were sitting where I normally sit, I would say "Calls for speculation."
L626756 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Didn't this investigation, with its attendant publicity, catapult you into the office you now hold?
L626755 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ Yes, Mr. Dowd.
L626748 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I'd need a continuance. Three weeks at least.
L626747 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ -- Can't Mr. Dowd find his own expert witness, your Honor?
L626494 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ -- in a context.
L626493 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ -- alleged crime --
L626492 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ Your Honor, I know as much about these gangs as anyone; I'm well aware of the secrecy in which their machinations are cloaked... I assure you this witness offers the court a rare opportunity to place the defendant's crime --
L626491 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ The great personal sacrifices endured by Mr. Reynard have no bearing on the legal issues, your Honor -- !
L626490 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ The witness is recalcitrant, your Honor -- I had to personally make a body attachment this morning -- it took two Marshalls to drag him here!
L626489 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ The witness will substantiate Mr. Kim's modus operandi. It's circumstantial evidence in the case at hand!
L626488 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ -- Objection, your Honor! This case has no connection with any subsequent act my client may be charged with!
L626487 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ We just discovered him, your Honor! His appearance is critical to a fair presentation of our case! He is an inmate at Ossining Correctional and --
L626486 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Your Honor, that's trial by ambush!
L626459 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ Objection.
L626458 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ To the best of your recollection, were you sober when you performed the tests?
L626440 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ Badgering.
L626439 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You don't speak any Chinese dialects? Then you get your intelligence from snitches?
L626305 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ Calls for speculation.
L626304 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Isn't it unusual for a man who's just committed a murder in plain sight to bring the weapon back to his apartment?
L626288 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ Argumentative.
L626287 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Isn't it a standard trick to pack a line-up with men who resemble each other but look different than the suspect, so the suspect will stand out for the eyewitnesses?
L626286 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ Objection. The witness is not an expert in racial classification.
L626285 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Isn't it a fact that the "six other Asian men" in the line-up were all of the classic Mongoloid type, whereas Shu has the distinct facial bone structure of a Korean?
L626256 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ That's big of you, Bob.
L626255 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ I'll prosecute anyone who fucks up. If that makes me look racist, it's a trade-off I'll live with, Ed.
L626252 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ No, Mr. Dowd, you'll see me in court. I'm prosecuting this case.
L626251 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ But I'm a quick study. Tell your Deputy D.A. -- Rabin? -- that I'll see him in court.
L626250 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ But now you've strayed from your area of expertise -- dope -- into street assassins. A subject on which you're dangerously ignorant.
L626142 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You know you're very tense, Mr. Reynard. Y'oughta take a week off, fly the wife and kids to Oahu.
L626141 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ You're pissing me off again, Ed.
L626140 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I never joke about waiving a client's Sixth Amendment right to trial.
L626139 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ We reconvict, your man's looking at 25 years on two counts, served consecutively. So what I'd like to ask, Ed, is: Are you joking?
L626138 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ That's right.
L626137 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ I see: He'd walk out next month.
L626135 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ You're my only problem, Ed. What does it take to make you go away?
L626134 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Please don't bullshit me, Mr. Reynard. You've got witness problems, you've got proof problems...
L626133 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ Friday's the drop-dead date on the offer.
L626132 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What am I looking for? You're the one talking deal.
L626131 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ Yes, but that's not the issue. What's on your wish list, Ed? Pleading Kim out to first degree man on both homicides, with an agreed sentence of 15 to life running concurrent? Come on... What're you looking for here?
L626130 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Are you implying that my motives are less than sincere?
L626129 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ Now maybe you got this case reopened because you see yourself as a thorn in society's side, or you want to walk into any restaurant in Chinatown and get free dumplings...
L626128 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I'd have that checked, Mr. Reynard.
L626127 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ Back in the Seventies I spent years putting away gangsters in a Colombian syndicate called "the Ochoa". These guys are very dangerous, Ed. When I hear that a small-time dope lawyer is conniving to spring one of these guys, I see red.

L626121 +++$+++ u3357 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ It's in the area of narcotics, Mr. Reynard, that the government tramples on the Fourth Amendment.

L626118 +++$+++ u3366 +++$+++ m223 +++$+++ REYNARD +++$+++ You won't remember this, but in '72 I was one of several prosecutors assigned to the Black Panther-Police Shootout.
