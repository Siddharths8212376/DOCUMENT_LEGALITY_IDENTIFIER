L371856 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I out-coached that General Hammond.
L371855 +++$+++ u2033 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ SPEARCHUCKER +++$+++ What's that, Henry?
L371854 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Well, there's one big satisfaction.
L371794 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ They can't do that to me!
L371793 +++$+++ u2033 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ SPEARCHUCKER +++$+++ Those two big guys were tackles on the Cleveland Browns, and the redhead played halfback with the Rams.
L371787 +++$+++ u2033 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ SPEARCHUCKER +++$+++ I used to throw the javelin.
L371786 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Thank you, Spearchucker. I'll certainly take a look at these. Where the hell did you ever get that name?
L371785 +++$+++ u2033 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ SPEARCHUCKER +++$+++ In that case, here are ten basic plays. I think that's about all this bunch can handle.
L371784 +++$+++ u2022 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
L371783 +++$+++ u2033 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ SPEARCHUCKER +++$+++ If I can make a suggestion, Coach.
L371616 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Listen, we get a deluge like this, just deciding priorities on a medical basis is hard enough. So never mind the side issues.
L371615 +++$+++ u2024 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HOT LIPS +++$+++ It's an American boy's rupture you're supposed to close.
L371614 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Yeah?
L371613 +++$+++ u2024 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HOT LIPS +++$+++ Captain...  'This kid' is a prisoner of war.
L371612 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ This one goes right to the OR. Tell Duke to do him ahead of the busted spleen.  And this kid can't wait. I'll take him myself, before I get to that ruptured diaphragm.
L371442 +++$+++ u2024 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ HOT LIPS +++$+++ Good morning.
L371441 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Morning, girls. Good morning Major.
L371583 +++$+++ u2028 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ ME LAY +++$+++ But it's ten-thirty at night. We can't get military personnel out for a civilian. A foreign civilian.
L371582 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ We don't have to see him. Call that halfassed Army hospital and tell them to be ready to put some lipiodol in this kid's esophagus and take X- rays.
L371575 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Now?
L371574 +++$+++ u2028 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ ME LAY +++$+++ Can you guys take one minute to look at a kid for me?
L371571 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ How can I taste it now? We've already had like twelve courses.
L371570 +++$+++ u2028 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ ME LAY +++$+++ No, we had a clear soup to start. This is a thick one and you ought to taste it. There's nothing like it back home.
L371569 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Soup? Rice? What are we doing, beginning all over again?
L371547 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Mine's already been struck, and it doesn't have to be very fancy.
L371546 +++$+++ u2028 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ ME LAY +++$+++ The address of the N.E.P.H. and W. Why don't you meet me there when you're through golf for drinks and dinner and whatever strikes the fancy?
L371545 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Never mind.
L371543 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ That bad?  But I guess you're right. We might as well see him.  Got any caddie carts?
L371542 +++$+++ u2028 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ ME LAY +++$+++ Colonel Merrill is a veteran of twenty- five years in the Regular Army, a soldier first and a doctor second. A member of several patriotic organizations, he believes it's America's God-given mission to maintain a foothold for freedom on the Asian mainland.
L371541 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ What's the bastard really like?
L371534 +++$+++ u2028 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ ME LAY +++$+++ I been out of action since I got over here five months ago.
L371533 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Planes mostly. May take a crack at rickshaws. How does the direct approach work over here?
L371524 +++$+++ u2028 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ ME LAY +++$+++ May I have the surgeon's name, please?
L371523 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Okay, I'm closing up. Everybody relax.
L371804 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ It's a technique Ugly John and I worked out in case something like this came up.
L371803 +++$+++ u2035 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ UGLY JOHN +++$+++ As long as there's a pile-up, we can do our bit to encourage his permanent withdrawal from the contest.
L371691 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Boys, we're home free.
L371690 +++$+++ u2035 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ UGLY JOHN +++$+++ Nice.
L371689 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Ease off on those tapes, and let's see how much it bleeds.  How is he?
L371688 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ Arterial silk.
L371687 +++$+++ u2035 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ UGLY JOHN +++$+++ Nice.
L371686 +++$+++ u2034 +++$+++ m131 +++$+++ TRAPPER +++$+++ How is he?
L374404 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Yeah. Lavender and old lace!
L374403 +++$+++ u2044 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Before you do, Ann, perhaps you'd better finish this column.
L374402 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
L374401 +++$+++ u2044 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Did you get it, too?
L374400 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ A big, rich slob like D. B. Norton buys a paper—and forty heads are chopped off!
L374399 +++$+++ u2044 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You're a couple o' sticks shy in your column, Ann.
L375334 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ John, please let me go with you! Please, John!
L375333 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Go ahead, driver! Ball park!
L375301 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You didn't?
L375300 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Yes, I did, John. But I—I had no idea what was going on.
L375299 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Did you write this?
L375139 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Yeah, I've heard them a million times, too, but—there you are. Maybe they're like me. Just beginning to get an idea what those things mean.
L375138 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Look, John—what we're handing them are platitudes. Things they've heard a million times: "Love thy neighbor," "Clouds have silver linings," "Turn the other cheek." It's just a—
L375137 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Three hundred thousand? What makes them do it, Ann? What makes them come and listen and, and get up their John Doe Clubs the way they do? I've been trying to figure it out.
L375136 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
L375135 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ How many people do you think we've talked to already, outside the radio, I mean?
L375128 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Well, I took you across my knee and I started spanking you.
L375127 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I guess so. Then what happened?
L375126 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Well, yes, I was. But I was your father then, see?  But the real me, John Doe, er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I was the fellow up there with the book. You know what I mean?
L375125 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ You were? I thought you were chasing me?
L375124 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ But here's the funniest part of it all. I was the fella up there doing the marrying. You know, the Justice of the Peace or something . . .
L375123 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Yeah, that's the one.
L375122 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Ted Sheldon.
L375121 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ No, not that bad. It was a fella that sends you flowers every day. Er, what's his name? Mr. Norton's nephew.
L375120 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Well, a tall handsome Ubangi, I suppose.
L375119 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Well, would you like to know who it was you were marrying?
L375113 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Sure was crazy. I dreamt I was your father.
L375112 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ About me?
L375111 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You know, I had a crazy dream last night. It was about you.
L375110 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ No.
L375109 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Do you care if I sit down out here?
L375108 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ No, thank you.
L375107 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Can I help you pack?
L374995 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L374994 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Me?
L374993 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Oh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it isn't any more. Mr. Norton wants to get back of it and sponsor John Doe Clubs all over the country. He wants to send you on a lecture tour.
L374992 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Well, you got your circulation. Now, why don't you let me alone?
L374991 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Uh-huh . . .
L374990 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Look, it started as a circulation stunt, didn't it?
L374989 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Oh, but you don't know how big this thing is. You should see the thousands of telegrams we've received and what they're saying about you.
L374988 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I don't care what they're forming. I'm on my way and I don't like the idea of being stopped either.
L374987 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Uh-huh. To carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech.
L374986 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ John Doe Clubs? What for?
L374985 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Look, John. Something terribly important's happened. They're forming John Doe Clubs. We know of eight already and they say that there's going—
L374975 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Hello.
L374974 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Hello, John.
L374892 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Never mind. Let him alone. He's all right. I'll be right over there pulling for you.
L374891 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Say, he's a friend of mine.
L374864 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ You know something? I've actually fallen in love with him.
L374863 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Oh. Yeah.
L374862 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ John Doe, the one in the speech.
L374861 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Who?
L374847 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ John Doe. The one in there. 
L374846 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Who?
L374845 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Of course not. He wouldn't be.
L374844 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ No.
L374843 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Now, look, John. Here's the speech. It's in caps and double-spaced. You won't have any trouble reading it. Not nervous, are you?
L374709 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Grab it, Eddie, grab it!
L374708 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Why can't you call right, you bone- headed, pig-eared, lop-eared, pot- bellied—
L374707 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Yes!
L374706 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Oh, yuh did, huh?
L374705 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Oh, look. I'm the umpire, and you just cut the heart of the plate with your fast one and I call it a ball. What would you do?
L374704 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You got me.
L374703 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Against anything. Just protest.
L374702 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Against what?
L374701 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
L374700 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Well, all those guys in the bleachers think—
L374699 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Yeah. No, no!  No! No, look. You don't have to smell the world! 
L374698 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Oh, crabby guy, huh?
L374697 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Yes, you're sore at the world. Come on, now.
L374696 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ With all of it?
L374695 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Oh, come on, now. This is serious. You're a man disgusted with all of civilization.
L374694 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Can't. I'm feeling too good.
L374693 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Here. Sit down!  Quiet, egghead!  All right, now, a serious expression.
L374686 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Um-hum.
L374685 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Action?
L374586 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Oh, that's 'cause we both play doohickies. I met him in a box car a couple o' years ago. I was foolin' around with my harmonica and he comes over and joins in. I haven't been able to shake him since.
L374585 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ He likes you well enough to stick around.
L374584 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Don't mind the Colonel. He hates people.
L374579 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Yeah, I'm all right.
L374578 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Are you all right?
L374577 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Huh?
L374569 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Oh, I get the idea. Yeah, maybe.
L374568 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Would you be willing to say you wrote that letter—and stick by it?
L374567 +++$+++ u2045 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Yeah, maybe.
L374566 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Er, would you, er, would you like to make some money?
L375298 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ John! I'm so glad to see you. I—I was terribly worried.
L375297 +++$+++ u2042 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ D. B. +++$+++ Hello?
L375161 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Mr. D. B. Norton!
L375160 +++$+++ u2042 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ D. B. +++$+++ Devoted entirely to the interests of all the John Does all over the country. Which practically means, ninety per cent of the voters. He will also announce the third party's candidate for the presidency. A man whom he, personally, recommends. A great humanitarian; the best friend the John Does have.
L375159 +++$+++ u2042 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ D. B. +++$+++ Yes. The John Doe Party.
L375158 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ A third party?
L375157 +++$+++ u2042 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ D. B. +++$+++ Tomorrow night, before a crowd of fifteen thousand people, and talking over a nation-wide radio hook-up, John Doe will announce the formation of a third party.
L375151 +++$+++ u2042 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ D. B. +++$+++ Go ahead, open it, open it.
L375150 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Oh!
L375149 +++$+++ u2042 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ D. B. +++$+++ Well, don't say anything at all. Just sit down.
L375148 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Oh! Oh, it's beautiful, D. B. Well—I don't quite know what to say . . .
L375144 +++$+++ u2042 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ D. B. +++$+++ No, no, no—that's your seat.
L375143 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Oh, somebody else sitting there?
L374968 +++$+++ u2042 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ D. B. +++$+++ All right, but present it to him as a great cause for the common man.
L374967 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Better let me talk to him.
L374750 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L374749 +++$+++ u2042 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ D. B. +++$+++ And, Miss Mitchell—I think from now on you'd better work directly with me.
L374748 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Thank you very much for everything.
L374744 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ How do you do.
L374743 +++$+++ u2042 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ D. B. +++$+++ Hello. Whenever there's a pretty woman around, er—  This is my nephew, Ted Sheldon, Miss Mitchell.
L374742 +++$+++ u2042 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ D. B. +++$+++ That's only the beginning. You play your cards right and you'll never have to worry about money again. Oh, I knew it.
L374741 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ A hundred dollars!
L374740 +++$+++ u2042 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ D. B. +++$+++ Do it, and I'll give you a hundred dollars a week.
L374739 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Oh, I'm sure I can.
L374738 +++$+++ u2042 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ D. B. +++$+++ Money?  Well, I'm glad to hear somebody admit it. Do you suppose you could write a radio speech that would put that fellow over?
L374737 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Money.
L374736 +++$+++ u2042 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ D. B. +++$+++ Thirty dollars? Well, er, what are you after? I mean, what do you want? A journalistic career?
L374735 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Thirty dollars.
L374734 +++$+++ u2042 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ D. B. +++$+++ How much money do you get?
L374733 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L374732 +++$+++ u2042 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ D. B. +++$+++ . . . Er, this John Doe idea is yours, huh?
L374690 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Here. Wait a minute. Let me comb your hair. Sit down. There. That's better.
L374689 +++$+++ u2043 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Oh.
L374688 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.
L374687 +++$+++ u2043 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ That's good.
L374684 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Huh? Oh, yes. Let's go.  Now, let's see. We want some action in these pictures.
L374683 +++$+++ u2043 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ All set, Ann?
L374682 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Hello there. Well, well! If it isn't the man about town!
L374785 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ You bet I will, Ma.
L374784 +++$+++ u2048 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear?  It's always helped keep your father alive for me.
L374783 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
L374782 +++$+++ u2048 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ That's your father's diary, Ann.
L374781 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Huh?
L374780 +++$+++ u2048 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Wait a minute . . .
L374779 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Oh, yes, Father certainly would.
L374778 +++$+++ u2048 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Darling, there are so many complaining political speeches. People are tired of hearing nothing but doom and despair on the radio. If you're going to have him say anything, why don't you let him say something simple and real, something with hope in it? If your father were alive, he'd know what to say.
L374777 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ What?
L374776 +++$+++ u2048 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Well, honey, of course I don't know what kind of a speech you're trying to write, but judging from the samples I've read, I don't think anybody'll listen.
L374775 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Yeah, I don't know. I simply can't get it to jell!  I created somebody who's gonna give up his life for a principle, hundreds of thousands of people are gonna listen to him over the radio and, unless he says something that's, well, that's sensational, it's just no good!
L374774 +++$+++ u2048 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Do you mean the speech you're writing?
L374773 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Oh, I'm sorry, Ma. Oh, don't pay any attention to me. I guess I'm just upset about all this. Gee whiz, here I am with a great opportunity to get somewhere, to give us security for once in our lives, and I'm stuck. If I could put this over, your Mrs. Burke can have six babies!
L374771 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ If you're thinking of that thousand dollars, forget it. It's practically gone. We owed everybody in town. Now, you've just gotta stop giving all your money away.
L374770 +++$+++ u2048 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
L374769 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?
L374768 +++$+++ u2048 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ You remember those lovely people your father used to take care of? I thought I'd buy them some groceries. Oh, Ann, dear, it's a shame, those poor—
L374767 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ The Websters!
L374766 +++$+++ u2048 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ The Websters.
L374765 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ And the fifty's all gone, huh? Who's the ten for?
L374764 +++$+++ u2048 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn't a thing in the house—and then this morning the Community Chest lady came around and—
L374763 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
L374762 +++$+++ u2048 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Your purse. I need ten dollars.
L374761 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?
L374760 +++$+++ u2048 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Oh, yes you will, Ann dear . . . you're very clever.
L374759 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Stick a fork through me! I'm done. I'll never get this speech right.
L375435 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Thank you.
L375434 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ Now listen, Ann—he can't possibly get in without our seeing him. I'm watching the side door and the Colonel's out front, so stop worrying.
L374871 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ That's fine, honey. Now, get out!
L374870 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ Listen. If that guy lays an egg. I want to get something out of it. I'm getting a Jane Doe ready!
L374867 +++$+++ u2041 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ CONNELL +++$+++ No, no, no. Now that's too much!
L374866 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ What's the idea?
L374724 +++$+++ u2036 +++$+++ m132 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Sure, it's a meal ticket for me. I admit it, but it's also a windfall for somebody like Mr. Norton who's trying to crash national politics.  That's what you bought the newspaper for, isn't it? You wanta reach a lotta people, don't you?  Well, put John Doe on the air and you can reach a hundred and fifty million of 'em. He can say anything he wants and they'll listen to him.
