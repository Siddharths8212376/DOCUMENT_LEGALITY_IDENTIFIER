L2897 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Or Czechoslovakia.  The Slavs have been fighting the Germans and the Russians for a thousand years.  These are very intense people and they take things personally.
L2896 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?
L2895 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.
L2893 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was visiting somebody here.  Who knows?
L2892 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What would you call her?
L2891 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Who says she's a suspect?
L2890 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
L2889 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Hmmmm.
L2888 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Pretty.
L2887 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.
L2886 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You were right, they were both dead before the fire.  The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.  That's usually an indicator of something personal.
L2885 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?
L2884 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?
L2883 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Did you get a report from the M.E.?
L2882 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Good.  Good.  Commendable.
L2881 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ I don't even watch TV.
L2880 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Nah, why should you?
L2879 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
L2878 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.
L2877 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Nah, I musta missed it.
L2876 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Watch the news?
L2875 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want.
L2748 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Why don't you explain it, Bobby.  Hey Camello!  You mind punching a hole in the floor?
L2747 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ No, what is it?
L2746 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ You know what that is, right?
L2731 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?
L2730 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do.
L3249 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?
L3248 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you?
L3244 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
L3243 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.
L3242 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Good - be tough to the end.  Actor who plays you will want to die like hero.
L3241 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Then do it, asshole.
L3240 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ I kill someone famous.
L3239 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What's your accomplishment.
L3238 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
L3237 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What do you want?
L3236 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ So...who's Nicky?
L3157 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Don't be late.
L3156 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Thank you.
L3155 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ See you later.  Good luck.
L3154 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Okay.
L3153 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.
L3152 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
L3151 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Yeah.  I promise.
L3150 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ You promise?
L3149 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Tonight.
L3148 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Okay, til tonight.
L3147 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ I love you.
L3146 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
L3145 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.
L3144 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.
L3143 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Promise?
L3142 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll talk.  We'll talk.
L3141 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ No.  No, listen to me here.  I want to know what you're talking about.  You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and...
L3140 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.
L3139 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here.
L3138 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Well, that's great.
L3137 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Yeah.
L3136 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ That's good.
L3135 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor.  They want me to anchor tonight!
L3130 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Okay.  Okay.  Hold that thought just for a second.  They only call me when it's an emergency.  Just hold that thought.  Can you call back?
L3129 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Answer it.
L3128 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ No.  Tell me what you want to say.
L3127 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Answer the phone.
L3126 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Don't worry about the damn phone.  I won't answer it.
L3121 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Jesus.  And last week you came over with blood on your shoes.  What am I going to do with you?
L3120 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Could be Leon's.
L3119 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Look at this.  You have blood on your shirt.  Whose is it?
L3117 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ You're not so bad yourself.
L3116 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You're ruthless.
L3115 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?
L3114 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
L3113 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ That was good.  You were holding the evidence.
L3112 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...
L3111 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.
L3110 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I'm not.
L3109 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
L3108 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
L3107 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Stop it.
L3106 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you, sweetheart?  Oh...
L3105 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something.
L3104 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
L3103 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at me?  I just wanted a statement.
L3102 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Hey.
L3101 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Hey, honey.
L3044 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Okay.
L3043 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Alright.
L3042 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Alright.
L3041 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Alright?
L3040 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Alright.
L3039 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
L3038 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Eddie, are you okay?
L3037 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Alright, cut, cut, cut.
L3036 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
L3035 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Do you have the suspect in custody?
L3034 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine.
L3033 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
L3032 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
L3031 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department?
L3030 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I can't talk right now.  We have some things to take care of.
L3029 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Detective - can you tell us what happened here?
L2765 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.
L2764 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Is it drug related?
L2763 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
L2762 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Can we go up to the crime scene?
L2761 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ There are two bodies found at this point.
L2760 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ How many victims are up there?
L2759 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.
L2758 +++$+++ u41 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ NICOLETTE +++$+++ Detective, does it look like a murder?
L2665 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first time.
L2664 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ Any chance we can do that again?
L2656 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.
L2655 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ Okay.  You ready?
L2654 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Keep them out of my way.
L2653 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ Ready?
L2652 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ You're worried for my safety.  I'm touched.
L2651 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I hope this prick doesn't run.  My knees are killing me.  Stay behind me.
L2648 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Yeah.  And he still went to the party.
L2647 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ That's unique.
L2646 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ He's from Antigua.  His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party.  Stabbed her with a beer bottle.
L2645 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Not what.  Who.
L2644 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ So what's unique?
L2612 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ My kids?  Let's see...Susan's 15. Aundrea's 9.  Don't tell me you're thinking about having a kid!  How old are you?  Never mind. Let me just tell you this: Every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life, they make you a better person, they make you whole...  It's all true!  Before I had kids when friends talked about their kids, I wanted to vomit.  Now -- I get it.  Am I right, Leon?
L2611 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ How old are your kids?
L2607 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I'm not moody.
L2606 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
L2605 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.
L2604 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ Sooner or later that's everybody.
L2596 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ Jesus Christ.
L2595 +++$+++ u29 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.
L2628 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ No.  Are you proposing?
L2627 +++$+++ u45 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ SECONDARY OFFICER +++$+++ Are you married?
L2626 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Dog food.

L2624 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ You stuff sausage in it.
L2623 +++$+++ u45 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ SECONDARY OFFICER +++$+++ You're a butcher?  What do you use pig intestines for?
L2622 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ I am butcher.
L2621 +++$+++ u45 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ SECONDARY OFFICER +++$+++ Okay.  You work in a vodka factory.  I understand that.  And what kind of work do you do?
L3286 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Come alone.  Bring cash.  And we'll talk about surrendering.
L3285 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
L3284 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
L3283 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ What?  It doesn't work that way.
L3282 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.
L3281 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
L3280 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
L3279 +++$+++ u31 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HAWKINS +++$+++ Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.
L3278 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Come to 45 Broadway.  Don't bring the Police.  Come alone or you'll be in my next film.
L3556 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking kill her.
L3555 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Let her go!  Let her go!!
L3554 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ Tell him to put his gun down!
L3436 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ The Sheraton!  On Broadway!  Room 210. Go get Oleg.  He'll kill you.
L3435 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Where's your partner?
L3434 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Get down on your knees.
L3433 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ C'mon.  Pull the trigger.  Do it.  Oh, look, you're sweating.  You don't have the balls.
L3432 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ You'll be my first.
L3431 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ You can't kill me.  You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun.  I bet you never shot anybody in your life.
L3421 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Tommy, take a walk.
L3420 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend.
L3419 +++$+++ u34 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ JORDY +++$+++ Were you a fireman?  That how you knew how to rig the apartment?
L2858 +++$+++ u32 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HONEY +++$+++ Alright, alright - don't hurt me! Please, it's in my book, in my purse!

L2854 +++$+++ u32 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HONEY +++$+++ Look.  Do we have a problem here? There's no reason to have a problem. I'm gonna make you feel real good.  You wanna Czech girl? After I'm done with you, you won't miss her.  Now why don't you pay me?
L2853 +++$+++ u30 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ EMIL +++$+++ I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?
L2852 +++$+++ u32 +++$+++ m2 +++$+++ HONEY +++$+++ That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?
