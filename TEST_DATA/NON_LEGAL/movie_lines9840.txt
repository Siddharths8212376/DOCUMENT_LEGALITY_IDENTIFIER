L226386 +++$+++ u5419 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ MEGAN +++$+++ You got it.  Just keep an eye out for roadblocks.
L226383 +++$+++ u5419 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ MEGAN +++$+++ Then let's get goin'.  We can argue on the way.  You tell me what you need...  ...I'll make sure you get in.
L226382 +++$+++ u5425 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Uh...yes.  But...
L226381 +++$+++ u5419 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ MEGAN +++$+++ Didn't you say you needed some supplies to do this?
L226379 +++$+++ u5419 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ MEGAN +++$+++ Hide it behind the gas station. Then we can get the hell out of here.
L226378 +++$+++ u5425 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ What?
L226354 +++$+++ u5425 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ I already have a very good idea what could've happened...  ...Megan, Jason is out there.  He has to be stopped.  I'm positive he's heading back to the lake area.  He'll keep killing until...
L226353 +++$+++ u5419 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ MEGAN +++$+++ Tommy, my father is out looking for you right now.  Something happened tonight and he's sure you're responsible.  If he finds you, he'll...
L226352 +++$+++ u5425 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Yeah, hi.  Listen, I've got to talk to your dad.  About Jason. I've got a plan.  I need to buy some things first but mainly need help to...
L226450 +++$+++ u5421 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Shhh...You know what I used to do when I was a little girl when I got scared?
L226449 +++$+++ u5420 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ But what I get scared again?
L226448 +++$+++ u5421 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ I'm sure Cort and Sissy are back in their cabins.  So you just go back to sleep and don't worry.
L226420 +++$+++ u5421 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ We'll scare 'em right back.
L226419 +++$+++ u5420 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ But what if they try and scare us?
L226417 +++$+++ u5420 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Who ya calling?
L226416 +++$+++ u5421 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ I can't believe no one called back.  I better...
L226414 +++$+++ u5420 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Huh?
L226413 +++$+++ u5421 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ That's debatable.
L226412 +++$+++ u5420 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Are they grown-ups?
L226411 +++$+++ u5421 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared.
L226410 +++$+++ u5420 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Why?
L226409 +++$+++ u5421 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ You know what?  Sissy and Cort are playing jokes.  You know, trying to scare each other.
L226408 +++$+++ u5420 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ I found it outside.
L226407 +++$+++ u5421 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Where'd you get this?
L226294 +++$+++ u5420 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ No more.
L226293 +++$+++ u5421 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ ...Good.  So no more bad dreams can come around here, huh?
L226292 +++$+++ u5421 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Well, Nancy, I'm Paula... remember?  This is Sissy, and we're gonna be right out there all night so nothing can hurt you. Okay?...
L226291 +++$+++ u5420 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Nancy.
L226290 +++$+++ u5421 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Okay, listen...what's your name, sweetie?
L226289 +++$+++ u5420 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ No, he was real.  Like on TV.
L226288 +++$+++ u5421 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ You mean you had a bad dream.
L226285 +++$+++ u5420 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ There was this monster.  He was after me.  He wanted to kill me.
L226284 +++$+++ u5421 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ So what happened?
L226373 +++$+++ u5423 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ SISSY +++$+++ I think somebody's messin' around out there.
L226372 +++$+++ u5421 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ What's goin' on?
L226300 +++$+++ u5423 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ SISSY +++$+++ Yeah, he was gonna check out "things that go bump in the night."
L226299 +++$+++ u5421 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ He didn't say anything?
L226298 +++$+++ u5423 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ SISSY +++$+++ I don't know.  He called somebody, then took off.
L226297 +++$+++ u5421 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ I just realized something. Where's Cort?  I haven't seen him for hours.
L226283 +++$+++ u5423 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ SISSY +++$+++ Yeah, we're here.
L226282 +++$+++ u5421 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Hi.  Everything's all right now. We're here.
L226276 +++$+++ u5423 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ SISSY +++$+++ Of course not.  She probably took him a loaf of bread with a saw hidden in it.  I still don't get it.  Why him?  I mean, he's cute alright, but...
L226275 +++$+++ u5421 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ No...Did Megan say when she's coming back from her...visit?
L226274 +++$+++ u5423 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ SISSY +++$+++ Why not?  I used to play it alone. I love murder games.  Have you ever played The Consulting Detective?
L226273 +++$+++ u5421 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Huh?  Oh, come on, Sis.  I'm tellin' ya, we can't play Clue with just two people.
L226272 +++$+++ u5423 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ SISSY +++$+++ Okay, okay.  I suggest that the crime was committed in the bedroom, by Colonel Mustard, with the knife.
L226264 +++$+++ u5421 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ You gotta be kidding!
L226263 +++$+++ u5423 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ SISSY +++$+++ Boy scouting.
L226262 +++$+++ u5421 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Which is?
L226261 +++$+++ u5423 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ SISSY +++$+++ Are you ready?  He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.
L226260 +++$+++ u5421 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ So where's Cort gone off to?
L226176 +++$+++ u5423 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ SISSY +++$+++ All the little kids arrive today. We're not ready to deal with that alone.
L226175 +++$+++ u5421 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ It's just that Darren and Lizbeth are in charge of organizing and setting up the new campgrounds.
L226429 +++$+++ u5422 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Yeah...They should've paid their bill.
L226428 +++$+++ u5425 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Doesn't that tell you something?!
L226425 +++$+++ u5422 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ If I had you where I really wanted you, they'd be pumping your ass full of formaldehyde.
L226424 +++$+++ u5425 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ You got me where you want me. There's no reason not...
L226397 +++$+++ u5425 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Please don't do anything crazy.
L226396 +++$+++ u5422 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ With extreme car, for God's sake. If that kid is with her, there's every good chance he'll do something crazy.
L226257 +++$+++ u5425 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Jason's not in his coffin!  Hawes is!  Dig it up!  You gotta dig it up!!
L226256 +++$+++ u5422 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Don't concern yourself, Martin. This boy needs treatment.  We're taking care of it.  Sorry for the disturbance.
L226247 +++$+++ u5425 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Please, Sheriff.  You'll see we dug it up.
L226246 +++$+++ u5422 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ I've seen it.
L226245 +++$+++ u5425 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ I gotta show you Jason's grave.
L226193 +++$+++ u5425 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ But they have to be warned, Sheriff.  Jason will return to the area that's familiar.  No matter what you call it, it's still Camp Crystal Lake to him.
L226192 +++$+++ u5422 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ I was going to call the clinic and have them collect your ass.  But I don't want you around here any longer poisoning my daughter, or anyone else, with your warped mind.
L226187 +++$+++ u5422 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ No!...  ... You kids better leave.  This boy here is not well and I need to talk to him in private.
L226186 +++$+++ u5425 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Yes!
L226178 +++$+++ u5425 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ I got a bad feeling of what might've happened to them.
L226177 +++$+++ u5422 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ I sympathize with you kids.  The best I can do is call the station in Carpenter and have them keep a lookout for them.
L226141 +++$+++ u5422 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ You're gonna be sorry if you don't shut the fuck up.
L226140 +++$+++ u5425 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ You're gonna be sorry you didn't listen to me.
L226139 +++$+++ u5422 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out.
L226138 +++$+++ u5425 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ If you'd just go to the cemetery, you'll see I'm not lying.
L226137 +++$+++ u5422 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ They were gonna!  But some asshole sent a lot of money to give Jason and his mother a decent burial. Now look, you just lie down and get some rest.  In the morning I'll call that clinic and see if they...
L226136 +++$+++ u5425 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Why didn't you cremate him?!
L226131 +++$+++ u5425 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ There's no time for this bullshit...
L226130 +++$+++ u5422 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ No problem, Rick.  Come over and meet a former resident here, Tommy Jarvis.  He's got some kinda prank going about...
L226127 +++$+++ u5425 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Yes, but they released me because...
L226126 +++$+++ u5422 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ And you've been at some psychiatric clinic ever since, haven't you?
L226125 +++$+++ u5425 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Yeah.  Jason murdered them and...
L226124 +++$+++ u5422 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Aren't you the kid whose mother and friends were....
L226123 +++$+++ u5425 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Tommy Jarvis.  We gotta do something.  He's even more powerful now that...
L226122 +++$+++ u5422 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Hold it.  Whoa... What's your name, son?
L226121 +++$+++ u5425 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Jason is alive.  We dug up his body.  I was gonna cremate it and...
L226120 +++$+++ u5422 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Don't piss me off, junior.  Or I will repaint this office with your brains.
L226119 +++$+++ u5425 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Will you listen, dammit!
L226118 +++$+++ u5422 +++$+++ m360 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Now you better cool out a minute, boy.  You already almost got your head blown to pieces.
L226583 +++$+++ u5428 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ -- yeah, yeah, yeah.  You just have your hundred grand ready.  For that you get the machete...the mask...the whole damn thing.
L226582 +++$+++ u5426 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ CAMPBELL +++$+++ Mr. Duke tonight I'm prepared to offer you your sum of one hundred thousand dollars, payable only after you provide American Casefile with incontrovertible proof of --
L226580 +++$+++ u5428 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Skin stretcher was human.
L226579 +++$+++ u5426 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ CAMPBELL +++$+++ I understand.  However, our audience should be aware that you only charged forty thousand dollars to catch the Idaho skin stretcher.
L226578 +++$+++ u5428 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ -- look, just shut up.  Let's cut through the shit.  You asked me here because you want me to catch and kill Jason Voorhees for ya'.  I'll do it, but it won't be easy...and it won't be cheap.  One hundred grand, non- negotiable.
L226577 +++$+++ u5426 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ CAMPBELL +++$+++ In the media, you've frequently been described as "salty" --
L226576 +++$+++ u5428 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Yeah, that'd be a big shame...
L226575 +++$+++ u5426 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ CAMPBELL +++$+++ Well, let's hope not!
L226574 +++$+++ u5428 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ They coulda danced a jig on it an' fed it to goats -- don't matter.  Ya' can't kill Jason by gettin' rid of his body.  He'll come back the way he always do, to drag the kiddies into the darkness and crush their little skulls -- maybe even your skull, Mr. Campbell.
L226573 +++$+++ u5426 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ CAMPBELL +++$+++ -- But this time they bombed him and then cremated the body.
L226572 +++$+++ u5428 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Eight times.  They've burned him, dipped him in nuclear waste --
L226571 +++$+++ u5426 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ CAMPBELL +++$+++ Eight times.
L226570 +++$+++ u5428 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ How many times has Jason been reported killed before, Mr. Campbell?
L226569 +++$+++ u5426 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ CAMPBELL +++$+++ Mr. Duke, how can you claim that Jason Voorhees is not truly dead?
L226753 +++$+++ u5427 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DIANA +++$+++ I'm scared.  I'm very scared.
L226752 +++$+++ u5433 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ I'm here.
L226751 +++$+++ u5427 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DIANA +++$+++ Steven...
L226750 +++$+++ u5427 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DIANA +++$+++ Save your...
L226749 +++$+++ u5433 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ The what?
L226748 +++$+++ u5427 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DIANA +++$+++ You have to...save...Jessica... Save Jessica and save the...
L226676 +++$+++ u5427 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DIANA +++$+++ No.  Not here.  Come by my house tonight at eleven.  Don't be late.
L226675 +++$+++ u5433 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ So let's talk.
L226674 +++$+++ u5427 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DIANA +++$+++ ...but there just may not be enough time.  If you still care about her, if you still want to try to make things better between you two...we should talk.
L226600 +++$+++ u5427 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DIANA +++$+++ Yes.
L226599 +++$+++ u5433 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ STEVEN +++$+++ Diana -- you heard from Jessica lately?
L226650 +++$+++ u5427 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DIANA +++$+++ That's it, we're done.
L226649 +++$+++ u5428 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ I know everything about you, Diana.
L226648 +++$+++ u5427 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DIANA +++$+++ You need to leave.
L226647 +++$+++ u5428 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ You know what I want.  You know why I need you.
L226646 +++$+++ u5427 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DIANA +++$+++ What do you want?
L226645 +++$+++ u5428 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Then maybe I should offer it to your daughter...
L226644 +++$+++ u5427 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DIANA +++$+++ Look, I don't want your money!
L226643 +++$+++ u5428 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Thirty.  Name your price.  Everyone has a price, what's yours?
L226642 +++$+++ u5427 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DIANA +++$+++ Look --
L226641 +++$+++ u5428 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Twenty.
L226640 +++$+++ u5427 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DIANA +++$+++ No, I --
L226638 +++$+++ u5427 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DIANA +++$+++ You food'll be right out.
L226637 +++$+++ u5428 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ You know he's not...and he's coming for you.
L226636 +++$+++ u5427 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DIANA +++$+++ Jason Voorhees is dead.
L226635 +++$+++ u5428 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ I'm going to kill Jason Voorhees -- and I need you to help me.
L226634 +++$+++ u5427 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DIANA +++$+++ I'm kind of busy right now...
L226633 +++$+++ u5428 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ I need to talk to you.
L226632 +++$+++ u5427 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DIANA +++$+++ I know who you are.
L226630 +++$+++ u5428 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Yes.
L226629 +++$+++ u5427 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DIANA +++$+++ Anything else?
L226740 +++$+++ u5432 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ June the 19th.
L226739 +++$+++ u5427 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DIANA +++$+++ Hello...
L226653 +++$+++ u5427 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DIANA +++$+++ N...nothing.
L226652 +++$+++ u5432 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ What's the problem here?
L226623 +++$+++ u5432 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Okay, I'll call you later.
L226622 +++$+++ u5427 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DIANA +++$+++ I gotta get back to work.
L226620 +++$+++ u5427 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DIANA +++$+++ Yeah, she's good, considering. That kid just takes everything in stride.
L226619 +++$+++ u5432 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Okay.  So how is Jessica?  You talked to her lately?
L226618 +++$+++ u5427 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DIANA +++$+++ Ed...
L226615 +++$+++ u5427 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DIANA +++$+++ Do you have to ask?
L226614 +++$+++ u5432 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Steven buggin' you?
L226613 +++$+++ u5427 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DIANA +++$+++ Not so bad, today.
L226612 +++$+++ u5432 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Legs giving you trouble?
L226611 +++$+++ u5427 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DIANA +++$+++ It's going.
L226610 +++$+++ u5432 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Everything going okay?
L226686 +++$+++ u5427 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DIANA +++$+++ 'Night, Josh.
L226685 +++$+++ u5430 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ Good night, beautiful.
L226684 +++$+++ u5427 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DIANA +++$+++ Okay.
L226683 +++$+++ u5430 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ Everything'll work out.  Trust me on that.
L226682 +++$+++ u5430 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ So's he and he knows it.
L226681 +++$+++ u5427 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DIANA +++$+++ I'm just too old for going steady, Josh.
L226680 +++$+++ u5430 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ Listen...don't you worry about Ed. He'll come around.  He's too good a Sheriff to let you give him the slip.
L226679 +++$+++ u5427 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DIANA +++$+++ It's...It's all right.
L226678 +++$+++ u5430 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ Sorry, Di.  I was just going to my car.  I didn't mean to frighten you...
L226677 +++$+++ u5427 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DIANA +++$+++ Jesus!
L226840 +++$+++ u5428 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ You think you can lock me up in this piss-ass prison?  Hell, this place is motel fuckin' six to me.
L226839 +++$+++ u5432 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Lock this asshole up.
L226838 +++$+++ u5428 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Information like that is very expensive and you don't have the balls to pay the price.
L226837 +++$+++ u5432 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Tell me!
L226836 +++$+++ u5428 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Sorry.
L226835 +++$+++ u5432 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Tell me.
L226834 +++$+++ u5428 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ For a good reason.
L226833 +++$+++ u5432 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Why did you want her body?
L226829 +++$+++ u5428 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ That's what I'd like to know.
L226828 +++$+++ u5432 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Where the fuck is she, Duke?!
L226665 +++$+++ u5432 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Take him to my car.  I'll be out in a minute.
L226664 +++$+++ u5428 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ That's very colorful, chief.
L226663 +++$+++ u5432 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ I know who you are and the last thing we need around here is some freak show "bounty hunter" making trouble. I want you outta town and I want you outta town now!
L226662 +++$+++ u5428 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Careful, Chief.  I don't think you know who I am.
L226661 +++$+++ u5432 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Goddamnit!
L226660 +++$+++ u5428 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ She's your lady only cause she ain't had a taste of the Duke yet.
L226659 +++$+++ u5432 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ You're talking about my lady.
L226658 +++$+++ u5428 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Why don't you blow me, Chief.  After your girlfriend gets through.
L226657 +++$+++ u5432 +++$+++ m361 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Get up!
