L95794 +++$+++ u4133 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ Of course, George.  We are beautiful. We are brothers.  Real brothers.  Not like Diego.  We started this, George.
L95793 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good?
L95792 +++$+++ u4133 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ I'm sorry, George.
L95791 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I get it.   I'm really pissed, Pablo. You know the DEA knows about Norman's Cay.  For Chrissakes, Diego worships Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's fucked up!
L95790 +++$+++ u4133 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ Life will take care of everybody. Diego, me, you.  It is the teacher.
L95789 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You're saying life will take care of Diego?
L95788 +++$+++ u4133 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ It is very difficult.  Diego makes me a lot of money.  If Diego goes so does the money.  You were an excellent teacher, George.  When the student has learned well, the teacher is no longer necessary.  We must remember we have wives, friends, familia.  Even familia that has not been born.  But sometimes, we must forget as well.  I am like you. I must teach the lesson.  We want to teach the lesson.  But we cannot.  We must remember that life is the teacher.
L95787 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You know why I'm here.  You know what I have to do.  I came here for permission. Out of respect, Pablo.  This is bullshit, he's making me look like a punk.
L95786 +++$+++ u4133 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ I see.  I'm sorry about this, George. I'm not happy about this situation. It's bad.  You now know who your Brutus is.
L95785 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I didn't come here to drink scotch.
L95784 +++$+++ u4133 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ Please.  Sit down.  We'll drink some scotch.
L95783 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yeah.
L95782 +++$+++ u4133 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ Diego?
L95781 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yeah, well...
L95780 +++$+++ u4133 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ George, you look terrible.
L95618 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Diego is my brother.
L95617 +++$+++ u4133 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ And Diego?
L95616 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Money.
L95615 +++$+++ u4133 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ Keep them coming?  Ah, yes.  Ha ha.  You are right.  But money.
L95614 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Keep them coming.
L95613 +++$+++ u4133 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ Beautiful girls?
L95612 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Sure.
L95611 +++$+++ u4133 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ Family.
L95610 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yeah, maybe.
L95609 +++$+++ u4133 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ Power?
L95608 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Freedom.
L95607 +++$+++ u4133 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ Yes.  Money.  Which is what, George?
L95606 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I want money.
L95605 +++$+++ u4133 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ Yes.  I do not know, either.  What do you want, George?
L95604 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What do I think?  I don't want my answer to be influenced by what I want, so I'm going to have to say I don't know.
L95603 +++$+++ u4133 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ People tell me that I am crazy.  That my business will never work in your country.  What do you think, George?
L95602 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ It's beautiful.
L95601 +++$+++ u4133 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ I like to come up here.  To make the decisions.  To be one with nature.
L95600 +++$+++ u4133 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ As much as I can give you?  Ha ha.  Very good.  I like that.  Come, George.  Let us drive.  We have much to talk about.
L95599 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yes, sir.  As much as you can give me.
L95598 +++$+++ u4133 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country, George?
L95597 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yes, it is.
L95596 +++$+++ u4133 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ I like you, George.  You are loyal. That is good.  That is rare.  Maybe crazy.  Yes.  I can tell already.  You are like me.  I look at you and I see myself.  It's in the eyes, no, George?
L95595 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ With all respect, Padrino.  Diego is my partner.  I do not do business without him.
L95594 +++$+++ u4133 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ But, never mind.  I am thinking we can do much together.  This problem with Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very silly business.  To release him from the carcel, it causes me much inconvenience. The fifty kilos could have been a big problem.  And I don't like problems.
L95593 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yes.
L95592 +++$+++ u4133 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ Un rata - no good.  But he could have run, fled the country.  Gone to the policia.  But then his wife, his children, his parents, his friends, many people would die.
L95591 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Un sapo?
L95590 +++$+++ u4133 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ The man in the garden.  He was full of courage.
L95589 +++$+++ u4133 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ Good.  Very good.  Welcome, my friend. Welcome to my country.
L95588 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ It would be my pleasure.
L95587 +++$+++ u4133 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ The man who gives us the airplanes.  The man from America.  The mafia.  Chicago. Boom boom.  Hollywood.  You are going to open for us the gates of Hollywood, George?
L95586 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Actually, it was three.
L95585 +++$+++ u4133 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ So, this is the man who takes fifty kilos and makes them disappear in one day?
L96017 +++$+++ u4134 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ Did you know I died two weeks after you sent me that tape?
L96016 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I meant every word of it.
L96015 +++$+++ u4134 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ That was a beautiful message.
L96014 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I guess I kind of lost sight of things. "May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face, and the winds of destiny carry you aloft to dance with the stars."  Love, George.
L96011 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ That was a good one, Dad.  That was really something.  Remember that?
L96010 +++$+++ u4134 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ ...you sonofabitch.  Putting on George's boots.
L96009 +++$+++ u4134 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ That's where you belong...
L96008 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ And that FBI agent, Trout?  When he had to get on his knees to put my boots on? You said...
L95875 +++$+++ u4134 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ I'll tell her.
L95874 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Tell Mom, you know...
L95873 +++$+++ u4134 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ Yeah, I know.  This is it, isn't it?
L95872 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her happy.
L95871 +++$+++ u4134 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ Money.  You and your mother.  All the time chasing it.  I never understood it.
L95870 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Give this to Mom, will you?
L95869 +++$+++ u4134 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ Good.
L95868 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ No.
L95867 +++$+++ u4134 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ You're not going to trial?
L95866 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going away for awhile.
L95865 +++$+++ u4134 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ She's angry.  It's all over the news.
L95861 +++$+++ u4134 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ I heard.  Ermine, your son is here.
L95860 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Hi.
L95693 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yeah, Dad.  I'm happy right now.
L95692 +++$+++ u4134 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's good if it makes you happy.  It's nice to have nice things.  Are you happy, son?
L95691 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Dad.
L95690 +++$+++ u4134 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ You're like your mother.  You love money.
L95688 +++$+++ u4134 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ Don't bullshit me, George.  I don't see you very much, I don't want to waste the time.
L95687 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ So, business is going good.  I've got this import/export thing going on in Miami that's been very profitable.  With my investments...
L95370 +++$+++ u4134 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ Let me tell you something, son.  You would have been great at anything.
L95369 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I mean, I'm really great.
L95368 +++$+++ u4134 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ I just don't know what you're thinking. I don't understand your choices.  You know, the police are looking for you.
L95367 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yeah, you are.  I can tell by the way you look at me.
L95366 +++$+++ u4134 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ Not mad.
L95365 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You mad at me?
L95364 +++$+++ u4134 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ Tough spot.
L95363 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I gonna do?
L95362 +++$+++ u4134 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ You loved her, didn't you?  You really loved her.
L95361 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Just low.
L95358 +++$+++ u4134 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ ...and the winds of destiny carry you aloft...
L95357 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face...
L95145 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'm going to California.
L95144 +++$+++ u4134 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ What are you going to do?
L95143 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ No, Dad.  I don't want to...I mean, I just don't want...
L95142 +++$+++ u4134 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
L95141 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I know.
L95140 +++$+++ u4134 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
L95139 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
L95089 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'm going to California.
L95088 +++$+++ u4134 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ What are you going to do?
L95087 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ No, Dad.  I don't want to...I mean, I just don't want...
L95086 +++$+++ u4134 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
L95085 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I know.
L95084 +++$+++ u4134 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ FRED +++$+++ That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
L95083 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
L96030 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ No thanks, fellas.  You've got the wrong fucking guy.  I'm not a rat.
L96029 +++$+++ u4135 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GARCIA +++$+++ Don't be stupid, George.  We've got him. We've got him dead to rights.  But like I said, this is top priority so we're handing out free passes on this one. And the first one's got your name on it. Cut your sentence in half, maybe more.
L96024 +++$+++ u4135 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GARCIA +++$+++ He's going down, George.  It's election year.  We're not making any deals.
L96023 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What the fuck?  Is he going to walk?
L96022 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What about him?
L96021 +++$+++ u4135 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GARCIA +++$+++ You hear about your old friend, Diego?
L96020 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What do you guys want?
L96019 +++$+++ u4135 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GARCIA +++$+++ How are you doing, George?
L95247 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ He's getting middled, too.  And Derek's our partner.  What's good for us is good for him.
L95246 +++$+++ u4144 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ TUNA +++$+++ Source?  What about Derek?
L95243 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ The set-up is wrong.  We're doing all the legwork, and at the end of the day, we're still paying retail.  We're getting middled.
L95242 +++$+++ u4144 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ TUNA +++$+++ What the fuck are you talking about, man?
L95194 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Holy shit, Dulli.  What the hell are you doing here?
L95193 +++$+++ u4144 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ TUNA +++$+++ Look what the cat dragged in.
L95173 +++$+++ u4144 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ TUNA +++$+++ Tuna.
L95172 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ George.
L95161 +++$+++ u4144 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ TUNA +++$+++ We sell it.  I got it all figured out. We make three finger lids and sell them on the beach.  We move all of it.  We've made ourselves a hundred bucks.  Or a lot of weed for our head.  What do you think?  Not bad, huh?  I got the baggies and everything.
L95160 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this?
L95156 +++$+++ u4144 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ TUNA +++$+++ You know how we were wondering what we were going to do for money?  Being how we don't want to get jobs and whatnot? Well, check this out.
L95155 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Figured what out?
L95154 +++$+++ u4144 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ TUNA +++$+++ Figured it out.
L95117 +++$+++ u4144 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ TUNA +++$+++ Tuna.
L95116 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ George.
L95105 +++$+++ u4144 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ TUNA +++$+++ We sell it.  I got it all figured out. We make three finger lids and sell them on the beach.  We move all of it.

L95099 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Figured what out?
L95098 +++$+++ u4144 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ TUNA +++$+++ Figured it out.
L96040 +++$+++ u4141 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ MIRTHA +++$+++ Better than you.
L96039 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Mirtha, how are you doing?
L96038 +++$+++ u4141 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ MIRTHA +++$+++ George, he wasn't asking.
L96037 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ He wants me to testify?  Is that what he's asking me to do?
L96036 +++$+++ u4141 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ MIRTHA +++$+++ Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down.  His exact words were "Fuck Diego."
L96035 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yeah.
L96034 +++$+++ u4141 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ MIRTHA +++$+++ Is she here?  George, Kristina hates you.  You fucked her over one too many times.  And I'm not here to socialize. Did you hear about Diego?
L96033 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Is she here?  Is she coming?
L96032 +++$+++ u4141 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ MIRTHA +++$+++ Kristina's fine.
L96031 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Mirtha, what's going on?  Everything okay with Kristina?
L95959 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yeah.  I'm fine.  I'm good.
L95958 +++$+++ u4141 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ MIRTHA +++$+++ Hey, George.  You okay?
L95957 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I know.  Well, that's all I really wanted to say.  So, okay, then.
L95956 +++$+++ u4141 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ MIRTHA +++$+++ She's getting big.  Getting her own ideas.
L95955 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yeah.
L95954 +++$+++ u4141 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ MIRTHA +++$+++ Hey, look.  You start paying, who knows what will happen.  You're a good father, George.  I always gave you that.  But you've got to talk to her.
L95953 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yeah, you will.  Of course.
L95952 +++$+++ u4141 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ MIRTHA +++$+++ Yeah?  I better see some money out of it.
L95951 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yeah, well.  I'm working on that.  I've got something going.
L95950 +++$+++ u4141 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ MIRTHA +++$+++ I haven't seen one dollar from you.  You haven't paid me one cent in child support, alimony.
L95949 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yeah, so I've been thinking.  I love her, y'know?  I kind of want to have her.  I've been away for so long.  Make up for the missed time, you know?
L95948 +++$+++ u4141 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ MIRTHA +++$+++ Yeah.  She told me.  You walk her to school.
L95947 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?
L95946 +++$+++ u4141 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ MIRTHA +++$+++ What do you want?
L95901 +++$+++ u4141 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ MIRTHA +++$+++ Fuck you, George.  I knew you'd say something like that.  Always thinking about yourself.
L95900 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What do you want me to say?  I'm in prison.  You should know.  You put me here.
L95899 +++$+++ u4141 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ MIRTHA +++$+++ You should have taken better care of me, you know?  You've been away a long time. Four years.  Say something.
L95895 +++$+++ u4141 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ MIRTHA +++$+++ That's right.  Always spying, always judging.  Everyone's laughing at you, you fucking pussy.  You let Diego fuck you in the ass.  Maybe you are a fucking faggot.  You must be fucking Diego because you're not fucking me.
L95894 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What?
L95893 +++$+++ u4141 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ MIRTHA +++$+++ My problem?  We're broke, that's my fucking problem.  And you're a fucking spy.
L95892 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Hey, why don't you just put a "I'm doing cocaine" sign on the car.  What is your fucking problem?
L95891 +++$+++ u4141 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ MIRTHA +++$+++ Fuck you, George, just fucking drive.
L95890 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ There's a fucking cop behind us, Mirtha. Be cool, will ya.
L95884 +++$+++ u4141 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ MIRTHA +++$+++ Don't give me that shit.  You just better do something.
L95883 +++$+++ u4136 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Not in front of the kid.
L95882 +++$+++ u4141 +++$+++ m276 +++$+++ MIRTHA +++$+++ Don't touch me.  Tell me.  Just answer the question.  What do I spend?  What? How will we live?
