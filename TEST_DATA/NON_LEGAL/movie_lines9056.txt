L206579 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ There's nothing to it.
L206578 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Well I never did it.
L206577 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ What's the big deal?
L206576 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Like, you know, giving blow jobs.
L206575 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ What variables?
L206574 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at.
L206573 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.
L206572 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Yeah but they look more sophisticated. You'd probably think they'd be better in bed.
L206571 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Oh, give me a break, Stacy. You're much prettier than them.
L206570 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Do you think guys find that attractive?
L206567 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I know.
L206566 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Linda. That girl looks just like Pat Benatar.
L206561 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ God. People exaggerate so much at this school.
L206560 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ No way! He just called him a dick.
L206559 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I hear some surfer pulled a knife on Mr. Hand this morning.
L206488 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Believe it.
L206487 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ I can't believe I start high school tomorrow.
L206476 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ If I didn't have a fiancé in Chicago, I'd go for it.
L206475 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ He was hot, wasn't he?
L206474 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will.
L206473 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Really?
L206472 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Face it. With some guys you have to make the first move. A lot of guys are just... wussies.
L206471 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ I can't do that.
L206470 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him.
L206469 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ So what did you do?
L206468 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Listen, Stace, you want to know about guys? I'll tell you. They're mostly chicken. Before I met Doug I chased after every guy I thought was cute. I thought if I gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up. Well, guess what? They don't call.
L206467 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Come on, Linda, I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this week?
L206466 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Should we buy a frame for that?
L206465 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ He gave me his card.  'Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant.'
L206431 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Just take his order, look him in the eye and if he says anything remotely funny, laugh a lot.
L206430 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ What should I do?
L206429 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man.
L206428 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really.
L206427 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Don't you like him?
L206424 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Do you think that guy's cute?
L206423 +++$+++ u910 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ How's it going.
L207292 +++$+++ u912 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ MR. HAND +++$+++ Aloha, Spicoli.
L207291 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ Aloha, Mr. Hand!
L207290 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ All right! Oh, yeah!
L207289 +++$+++ u912 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ MR. HAND +++$+++ Don't worry, Spicoli. You'll probably squeak by.
L207288 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ You're gonna flunk me?!
L207287 +++$+++ u912 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ MR. HAND +++$+++ If you graduate.
L207286 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
L207285 +++$+++ u912 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ MR. HAND +++$+++ Well, you'll find out next year.
L207284 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?
L207283 +++$+++ u912 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ MR. HAND +++$+++ What's that?
L207282 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?
L207281 +++$+++ u912 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ MR. HAND +++$+++ I think I've made my point with you tonight.
L207278 +++$+++ u912 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ MR. HAND +++$+++ Well, then, I'm glad I remembered to bring an extra copy just for you.
L207277 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand.
L207276 +++$+++ u912 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ MR. HAND +++$+++ Now, Mr. Spicoli, comes a rare moment for me. Now I have the unique pleasure of squaring our account. Tonight, you and I are going to talk in great detail about the Davis Agreement, all the associated treaties, and the American Revolution in particular. Now if you can just turn to Chapter 47 of Lord of Truth And Liberty.
L207274 +++$+++ u912 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ MR. HAND +++$+++ Fine. You sit right here on your bed. I'll use the chair here.  As I explained to your parents just a moment ago, and to you many times since the very beginning of the school year -- I don't like to spend my time waiting for late students, or detention cases. I'd rather be preparing the lesson.
L207273 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ I don't know. I guess so.
L207272 +++$+++ u912 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ MR. HAND +++$+++ Do you want to sit there, Jeff?
L207271 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ Did I do something wrong, Mr. Hand?
L207270 +++$+++ u912 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ MR. HAND +++$+++ I'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, Jeff.
L207269 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
L207268 +++$+++ u912 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ MR. HAND +++$+++ Were you going somewhere tonight, Jeff?
L207266 +++$+++ u912 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ MR. HAND +++$+++ That's right, Jeff. Mind if I come in?
L207265 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ Mr... Mr. Hand.
L207035 +++$+++ u912 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ MR. HAND +++$+++ And you, my friend. I'll see you for a two-hour detention every afternoon this week.
L207034 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ You better save some for me, you swine!
L207030 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ I've been thinking about this, Mr. Hand. If I'm here... and you're here... doesn't that make it our time?
L207029 +++$+++ u912 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ MR. HAND +++$+++ Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time.
L207028 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
L207027 +++$+++ u912 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ MR. HAND +++$+++ Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
L206718 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ I don't know.
L206717 +++$+++ u912 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ MR. HAND +++$+++ Food will be eaten on your time!  Why are you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?
L206716 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever.
L206715 +++$+++ u912 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ MR. HAND +++$+++ You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?
L206714 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ I couldn't make it in time.
L206713 +++$+++ u912 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ MR. HAND +++$+++ Thank you, Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy?
L206712 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ Hey! Wait a minute! There's no birthday party for me here!
L206534 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ Hey, bud. What's your problem?
L206533 +++$+++ u912 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ MR. HAND +++$+++ Yes.
L206532 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ You just ripped my card in two!
L206531 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ That's the name they gave me.
L206530 +++$+++ u912 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ MR. HAND +++$+++ Mr. Spicoli?
L206528 +++$+++ u912 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ MR. HAND +++$+++ Oh, please. I get so lonely when that third attendance bell rings and I don't see all my kids here.
L206527 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ Can I come in?
L206526 +++$+++ u912 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ MR. HAND +++$+++ Really?
L206525 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ This is U.S. History, right? I saw the globe in the window.
L206524 +++$+++ u912 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ MR. HAND +++$+++ What class?
L206523 +++$+++ u914 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ SPICOLI +++$+++ Yeah. I'm registered for this class.
L206615 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Yes.
L206614 +++$+++ u913 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ RON +++$+++ Is this your first time?
L206613 +++$+++ u913 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ RON +++$+++ No. I mean back to your home.
L206612 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ What about those other guys you live with?
L206611 +++$+++ u913 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ RON +++$+++ I think I better take you home.
L206610 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Yes... I am really nineteen.
L206609 +++$+++ u913 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ RON +++$+++ Are you really nineteen?
L206608 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last?
L206607 +++$+++ u913 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ RON +++$+++ It's very warm out tonight.
L206606 +++$+++ u913 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ RON +++$+++ Thanks. Thanks a lot.
L206605 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ That's a nice shirt.
L206604 +++$+++ u913 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ RON +++$+++ All right, the point it is.
L206603 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ The point sounds fine.
L206602 +++$+++ u913 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ RON +++$+++ How about the point?
L206601 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ I don't know. Wherever you want.
L206600 +++$+++ u913 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ RON +++$+++ Where do you feel like going?
L206599 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Thanks. So do you.
L206598 +++$+++ u913 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ RON +++$+++ 'The Cuer-vo Gold, the fi-ine Columbian.'  You look nice tonight.

L206596 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Thanks for picking me up.
L206436 +++$+++ u913 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ RON +++$+++ How about your phone number?
L206435 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ What can I get for you tonight.
L206434 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ I know, everyone says that.
L206433 +++$+++ u913 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ RON +++$+++ You look like you could still be in high school.
L207343 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ I'd like that.
L207342 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ Well, I don't know, I may be doing some traveling this summer. I don't know how much I'll be around...  But I'll give you a call sometime.
L207341 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer.
L207340 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ Really?
L207339 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ I know everybody says it, but I really mean it.
L207338 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ Yeah? About fifty people I didn't know wrote that in my annual.
L207337 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ I'm fine. Mark, I'm so glad you came over here because I want you to know something. I just thought I would tell you that I really enjoyed getting to know you this year.
L207336 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ Hi, Stacy. How are you?
L207335 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Hi, Mark.
L207134 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ I'll get you the notes.
L207133 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ What about the notes?
L207132 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ Nobody noticed. Don't worry about it. We'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in.
L207131 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ I made a fool of myself.
L207100 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Oh. I see.
L207099 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ John Bonham. The drummer for Led Zeppelin. He died a couple years ago. Every birthday he stays home and plays everything John Bonham ever recorded. It's like his own holiday.
L207098 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ John Bonham?
L207097 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ It's John Bonham's birthday.
L207096 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ What's April 16th?
L207095 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.
L207094 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Where's Mike today?
L206925 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ Well... it's getting kind of late.
L206924 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Do you really have to go?
L206923 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ ...I've got to go home.
L206921 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan.
L206920 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan?
L206919 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ Sure.
L206918 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right?
L206917 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ I don't know.
L206916 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Thanks. So...  What do you want to do?
L206915 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ So... pretty nice house you've got here.
L206911 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ Naw. I don't mind.
L206910 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind.
L206909 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ No. That's okay.
L206908 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?
L206907 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ Where's your brother?
L206906 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ Okay. Sure. I'll come in.
L206905 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house.
L206904 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ Aren't your parents asleep?
L206903 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Do you want to come inside?
L206902 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ I never thought it would happen at The Atlantis. Jeez.
L206901 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck.
L206900 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ I had a really nice time tonight.
L206890 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ Two more Cokes.
L206889 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Sure. I'll... have another Coke.
L206872 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Not at all.
L206871 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?
L206870 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ Oh yeah.
L206869 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Are you all right?
L206868 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ Excellent.
L206867 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
L206866 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ Do you know what you want?
L206865 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ I've heard that, too.
L206864 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ Joey at Cinema Four said this is a pretty good restaurant.
L206863 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Yeah. She is pretty good.
L206862 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ Yeah. She is pretty good.
L206861 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Do you have Mrs. George for English?
L206860 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ Yeah. It's my sister's.
L206859 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ This is a nice car.
L206858 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ Sure thing.
L206857 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Thanks for coming to get me.
L206762 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ Oh... yes.
L206761 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ Do you have a pen? This one's out of ink.
L206760 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ My other question is... can-I-have your-phone-number-so-I-can-ask-you out-sometime?
L206759 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ What's your other question?
L206756 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ We keep them, in case the people come back.
L206755 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ You keep them.
L206754 +++$+++ u915 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ STACY +++$+++ We keep them.
L206753 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ What do you do with the jackets people leave here?
L206888 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ I'll have one more Coke... Do you want another Coke, Stacy?
L206887 +++$+++ u917 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ WAITRESS +++$+++ Are you sure there's nothing else I can bring you?
L206877 +++$+++ u917 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ WAITRESS +++$+++ Okay. Thanks.
L206876 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ Two Cokes.
L206875 +++$+++ u917 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ WAITRESS +++$+++ Anything to drink?
L206874 +++$+++ u916 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ THE RAT +++$+++ Well... sure.  She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same.
L206873 +++$+++ u917 +++$+++ m59 +++$+++ WAITRESS +++$+++ Are you ready to order here?
L208900 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice.
L208899 +++$+++ u918 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?
L208898 +++$+++ u920 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Don't worry. You're protected. Just treat this poor woman like you'd treat any other human being in trouble.
L208897 +++$+++ u918 +++$+++ m60 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ Well, certainly... We're always happy to cooperate with the police...
