L367002 +++$+++ u1991 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ MANZANO +++$+++ It galls me to watch you. You can do as much in days as I can in years. Men like the 'The Dreamer' are protected. Out of everyone's grasp it seems, but yours.
L367001 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ It's not worth it. Be with them instead.
L367000 +++$+++ u1991 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ MANZANO +++$+++ My family lives in Miami. Because of the death threats.
L366998 +++$+++ u1991 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ MANZANO +++$+++ He was one of the original founders of 'Le Hermanidad' in the days when it represented good not evil.
L366997 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ I don't know shit about you.
L366996 +++$+++ u1991 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ MANZANO +++$+++ The same thing as you. Except, my reach isn't as long as yours. My father was a policemen, did you know that?
L366995 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ What do you want?
L366994 +++$+++ u1991 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ MANZANO +++$+++ The last few days may represent the best police work of my life.
L366993 +++$+++ u1991 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ MANZANO +++$+++ Sit, Creasy. Everything that happens from now on does so with my permission.  Really. You won't find a better carne asada in all of Mexico.
L366992 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ It's what you and Rosanna named me. Right?
L366991 +++$+++ u1991 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ MANZANO +++$+++ Hombre en fuego. Man On Fire. That's what the papers have named you.
L366740 +++$+++ u1991 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ MANZANO +++$+++ All these photos you just saw were of policemen. Sadly they're protected. La Hermanidad. The brotherhood.
L366739 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Show me mugshots of Mexican policemen. Maybe then we'll get somewhere.
L366738 +++$+++ u1991 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ MANZANO +++$+++ No. It would be convenient, but no.
L366737 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Am I a suspect?
L366736 +++$+++ u1991 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ MANZANO +++$+++ You have a rather checkered past. Mr. Creasy. Your Interpol file is six pages long.
L366735 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ No.
L366734 +++$+++ u1991 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ MANZANO +++$+++ Believe it or not, you're safe here. The Judicial police will kill you. If they can.  This page?
L366733 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ What am I doing here?
L366230 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ [It's a permit to carry a gun in Columbia. The gun you're about to find in that suitcase.]
L366229 +++$+++ u1985 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CUSTOMS +++$+++ [Senor?]
L366227 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ [I have a friend there.]

L366225 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ [I'm on to Juarez.]
L366224 +++$+++ u1985 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CUSTOMS +++$+++ [Where are you staying in Mexico?]

L366982 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Where?
L366981 +++$+++ u1995 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ ROSANNA +++$+++ Deal.
L366980 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ I show, you give me the information?
L366979 +++$+++ u1995 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ ROSANNA +++$+++ I traced the PIN. I have an address for you. But I need to see you.
L366965 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ You don't, I'll call you. Oh! I have a tape recording that I am sure will interest you.
L366964 +++$+++ u1995 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ ROSANNA +++$+++ How do I contact you? We still don't have the ATM info.
L366963 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Another favor... get me banking info on Jordan Kalfus. U.S. deposits or withdrawals. Thanks. Oh, get me the same on Samuel Ramos.
L366883 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Give me the address.
L366882 +++$+++ u1995 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ ROSANNA +++$+++ He lives in a Judicial Compound. He travels by motorcade. He has better protection than George Bush. Even more importantly he is part of La Hermanidad. His reach is far and wide.
L366881 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Where does he live?
L366880 +++$+++ u1995 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ ROSANNA +++$+++ He's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation. He's high on my hit list.
L366879 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ What do you know about the cop? Tazinari. The one who made the ransom drop with Samuel Ramos?
L366878 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ I'll call you tomorrow.
L366877 +++$+++ u1995 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ ROSANNA +++$+++ Where do I find you?
L366875 +++$+++ u1995 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ ROSANNA +++$+++ I have connections.
L366874 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ I need something. Do you have banking connections?
L366784 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Let's see how the relationship develops. I'll call you in the AM. Thanks.
L366783 +++$+++ u1995 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ ROSANNA +++$+++ So what do I get in return?
L366782 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ I need the name and address of the owner of a Toyota Corolla, license number ME31704... We didn't get the last digit so I need the ten possible matches.
L366781 +++$+++ u1995 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ ROSANNA +++$+++ So where do we begin?
L366780 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Maybe I can help your situation and you mine.
L366752 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ It's a little late.
L366751 +++$+++ u1995 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ ROSANNA +++$+++ It's Santa Muerte. Death worship. The religion of La Hermanidad. There's a curse on you.
L366749 +++$+++ u1995 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ ROSANNA +++$+++ We're interested in the same thing. I'm writing a story.
L366748 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ I guess that makes you the smart one.
L366747 +++$+++ u1995 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ ROSANNA +++$+++ A lot of people are looking for you.

L366770 +++$+++ u1993 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ RAYBURN +++$+++ Fuck. Look at you; you won't last a day the shape you're in. Unless you stop bleeding you should have your spleen removed.
L366744 +++$+++ u1993 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ RAYBURN +++$+++ I'll get you up to the border. Friend of mine'll take you in to San Diego. Drop you right at the hospital.
L366743 +++$+++ u1983 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Stomach's gone. But... okay.
L366697 +++$+++ u1993 +++$+++ m129 +++$+++ RAYBURN +++$+++ Two days gone. They're negotiating a ransom.
