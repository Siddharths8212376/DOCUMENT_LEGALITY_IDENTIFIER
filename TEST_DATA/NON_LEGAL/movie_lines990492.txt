L641184 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ What is it?
L641183 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ If I was to think...If I were to think... No I mean I have thinked it over...I have. And without putting a lot of pressure on you I just...Well I just...
L641182 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ No. No. No. This is my doing. You see I'm gonna have my wahoo spark for my own. For Lois and the kids, for my brother, for Franco. I'm gonna turn myself in. I am all that. I'm gonna do it for sweet Lois.
L641181 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I appreciate it. I do, but...Maybe you ought to just ease up om yourself a bit.
L641176 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ I've been looking for that flash and I look and I look and I can't find it. And what if I already had it? You know. My moment? What if it's gone? And I never saw it?  You're getting married, man. That's a fucking beautiful thing. Just a beautiful thing. I just can't stop breaking beautiful things.
L641175 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I think so.
L641174 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ That's my point! You see Man...burning at his absolute. To see all the forces just come together, just right, you know, just in perfect harmony. That's what I'm driving at. You get me?
L641173 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ The wahoo moment?
L641172 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ The sparkler would burn hot, then hotter, then even hotter...and there would be one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook just perfect. Perfect. It would only last a second, but that second was it. It was it. That's what dad had us looking for...You get me?
L641171 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ The wahoo?
L641170 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ Dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and Adam. Out back we'd light 'em up. The three of us. We'd hold 'em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light. Sparks. And dad would be all... "Get ready"..."watch for it"..."here it comes," here comes the "wahoo".
L641169 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Have another drink.
L641168 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem.
L641167 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I don't hear it.
L641166 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing. Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull.
L641165 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Buzzing?
L641164 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ Do you hear buzzing Fish?
L640897 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ At the newsstand on 3rd.
L640896 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Where did you get that?
L640816 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ Just go ahead and say what's on your mind.
L640815 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Dear God...I don't know how to pray.
L640723 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...
L640722 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I'm getting married...
L640627 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ Come on.
L640626 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Go for it.
L640625 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ I'll take a ride.
L640457 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ So?
L640456 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ He's your brother.
L640455 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ I don't care for him.
L640447 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Lately I'll just start getting lightheaded, dizzy, and I realize I haven't breathed in like two minutes.
L640446 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ You're not breathing right?
L640445 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I'm not breathing right.
L640444 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ Same alarm clock every morning, same two pops on the same snooze button...  Micheal Brenn. Yes...Yes...  Hold your horses. Okay. Got it. 6.321 at 17.28 for 6.6 at 9.256 out at 3432.343.  Same shower, towel, toothbrush, razor, hair gel. It's a fucking epidemic Fisher and you better start addressing it. You're getting married and I'm not going to candy-coat it. It just gets worse. It's an eighteen wheel cement mixer that will crush every bone in your body.
L640443 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I just want her to be happy.
L640442 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ Mike Brenn. Yes. Yes. 14.3 at 7.5 for 6. At 29.83 at 9.  I'm amazed the windows don't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed, ass-puckering rage in these soul-less lizards.
L640441 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ About what?
L640440 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ It means she's insecure.
L640439 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ What does that mean?
L640438 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.
L640437 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I don't know. She's really been stressing out.
L640436 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ That's just insecurity.
L641347 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Yup.
L641346 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ Well that ought to be about the end of that.
L641345 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ That's what I'm thinking.
L641344 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother.
L641342 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ I want a black one. A little black brother. That's a big problem it seems to me. Lack of racial integration. That's a big one. You think?
L641341 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ That's a good one.
L641340 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ I think there's a lot of truth in that. I'm gonna pursue some options. I want to join that Big Brother thing.
L641339 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Yeah?
L641334 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ Where?
L641333 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ There.
L641330 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ That's right, "Pup Corn." Doggie treats. Little snacks for dogs. He's figured it out. There is a hole in the market and he's going to fill it. Spends all our money, works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up. After fifteen months, the big day arrives, the first box of "Pup Corn" pops off the belt. He comes running home with that box, pulls us out of school. We all pile into the living room, must be fifty of us, and in comes "Shelmer," our 8 year old mutt. "Here Shelmer," my dad cries. He's got that little fucking pup corn in his hand, "Here girl." This dog will eat anything, she eats rocks, anything. She walk's up to my dad's hand, looks down at the little pellet, licks it once, turns around, walks out of the room. Shelmer rejected the "Pup Corn." Fifteen months of my dad's life, right there. Not one dog ate Pup Corn. Not one. Three months later, "Pup Corn" shuts down. Chapter Eleven. My father never got over it. Never.
L641329 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ Pup corn?
L641328 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I'm saying it's luck. All luck. You work your entire life, all the training, focus, all the dedication, all irrelevant. Where does the ball bounce? My father spent his whole life trying to start a company, practiced every day, worked like a dog, finally got enough money. He's paid the dues, he's ready, does all the market research, picks his shot - "Pup Corn."
L641327 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ I guess.
L641326 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Yeah. I'm thinking about Micheal's Franco Harris fixation. You know how Micheal was always harping "Immaculate Reception?" I've seen that play. A lot of times...and I have to say this... Franco was lucky. Flat out, right place, right time. That's it. He was where the ball bounced. You get me?
L641325 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ You alright?
L641304 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ All week long.
L641303 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Did he try to kiss you?
L641302 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ He said he was the Brain Trust. Said he was smarter than all of us. He started reading "Atlas Shrugged," staring at himself in the mirror.
L641301 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ My God...
L641300 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ He came to me early today, was talking about money, insurance money. Said he was gonna get what was his.
L641290 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Downstairs in the closet.
L641289 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ Where's Boyd?
L641209 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ Maybe go up to the North Pole, the Arctic. Tag polar bears with dart guns. I've always had a pretty good aim...
L641208 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Greenpeace?
L641207 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ Greenpeace.
L641206 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ A move?
L641205 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ I'm thinking about maybe making a move.
L641107 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Well I don't have that skill and if I had to guess I would say that in no way did she believe me.
L641106 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ You can tell when people believe you. It's obvious.
L641105 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I have no idea.
L641104 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ Did she believe you?
L641103 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I told her that I have no idea what Adam was talking about in that letter.
L640859 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ What?
L640858 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ The first day.
L640809 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I got to agree with that.
L640808 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ Boyd...I don't know man...It just seems to me that ever since you took Tony Robbins self-help thing...you're all fucked-up in the head.
L640646 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ How do you know she's dead.
L640645 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ No...No.
L640334 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Yup.
L640333 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ That ought to be about the end of that.
L641298 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ I do.
L641297 +++$+++ u8772 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ JUDGE TOWER +++$+++ Liz do you take Fisher to be your beloved husband, to respect, honor and cherish him till death do you part?
L640883 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ You know,  Darling you...you send me...Darling you ...You mend me.  Honey, sing it for Judge Tower.
L640882 +++$+++ u8772 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ JUDGE TOWER +++$+++ Oh I know that. How does it go...
L640881 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ "You Send Me."
L640880 +++$+++ u8772 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ JUDGE TOWER +++$+++ What song?
L640879 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ We're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar. Acoustic.
L640878 +++$+++ u8772 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ JUDGE TOWER +++$+++ Okay great. What will that be?
L640877 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ We don't think so. I mean, we just want the singing when I come out.
L640872 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ I kind of like "till death do us part." I mean, this is forever. In sickness and in health, through good times and bad. Honey, what do you think?
L640871 +++$+++ u8772 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ JUDGE TOWER +++$+++ We don't say "love, honor and obey" anymore. And we don't say "till death do us part." Today we say, "respect, honor and cherish, as long as you both do love." How does that sound?
L640489 +++$+++ u8774 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Okay boys, smile!
L640488 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ A mutant species.
L640487 +++$+++ u8774 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ The post-Vegas Man.
L640486 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ The stone age.
L640485 +++$+++ u8774 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ ...regression of Modern Man to his most primitive, ape-like state...
L640484 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ ...embarrassing, shameful...
L640483 +++$+++ u8774 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ ...We will compare these before photos with whatever form of degeneration presented to us in 24 hours, no matter how low, how vile...
L640923 +++$+++ u8775 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Well, I just need your signature on these contracts and a deposit check so I can get the ball rolling.
L640922 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ That's our plan.
L640921 +++$+++ u8775 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Smart. Smart. Smart. Think big picture, take your time. I wish I had.
L640918 +++$+++ u8775 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ So where to on the honeymoon?
L640917 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ We will.
L640916 +++$+++ u8775 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Take your time. I wish I had.
L640915 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ We're in no hurry. I think we'll take some time to enjoy each other, enjoy our freedom before we surrender ourselves to kids.
L640914 +++$+++ u8775 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Are you guys gonna fill this place with kids? You sure got room for them.
L640913 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ I love it. I just love, love, love, love it.
L641180 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ I said out of respect. Respect for you Fisher. For you and your wedding and your beautiful bride. There will be no more rain. You see where I am here?
L641179 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ I don't think that's a good idea.
L641178 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ You see for me it's over. Over baby. I'm gonna turn myself in. After the wedding of course. After the wedding. Out of respect.
L641057 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ I KILLED MY BROTHER!
L641056 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ Shut up Micheal.
L640863 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ That's right.
L640862 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ Right.
L640728 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ Fish, I'm really sorry. I just...I owe you man.  Desert.
L640727 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ Fucking desert.
L640678 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ It was an accident!
L640677 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ She's dead.
L640553 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ Drum banging real times.
L640552 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ Good times.
L642515 +++$+++ u8783 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ ENEDINA +++$+++ It's a present from my parents.
L642514 +++$+++ u8781 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON AMALIO +++$+++ Where's the camera?
L642508 +++$+++ u8783 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ ENEDINA +++$+++ Let me go, Don Amalio, I'll tear her apart.
L642507 +++$+++ u8781 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON AMALIO +++$+++ Stop this, stop this.
L642450 +++$+++ u8783 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ ENEDINA +++$+++ Yes, yes.
L642449 +++$+++ u8781 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON AMALIO +++$+++ Didn't you say you know how to make vanilla pudding?
L642439 +++$+++ u8783 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ ENEDINA +++$+++ You'd like me to kill them?
L642438 +++$+++ u8781 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON AMALIO +++$+++ Keep quiet. These miserable brats only get in the way.
L642247 +++$+++ u8781 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON AMALIO +++$+++ Then I'll get you in the fields tomorrow ...
L642246 +++$+++ u8783 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ ENEDINA +++$+++ No, I don't want to because they yell. And I've got news for you too.
L642245 +++$+++ u8781 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON AMALIO +++$+++ Give them to Refugio.
L642244 +++$+++ u8783 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ ENEDINA +++$+++ No, the children sleep with me.
L642243 +++$+++ u8781 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON AMALIO +++$+++ I'll come to you tonight.
L642537 +++$+++ u8794 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ POCA +++$+++ Really, Don AMALIO, there's not much point in making a fuss.
L642536 +++$+++ u8781 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON AMALIO +++$+++ Take me there.
L642535 +++$+++ u8794 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ POCA +++$+++ That one.
L642534 +++$+++ u8781 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON AMALIO +++$+++ Which couch?
L642533 +++$+++ u8794 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ POCA +++$+++ They're playing games behind the couch ...
L642532 +++$+++ u8781 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON AMALIO +++$+++ What about them?
L642531 +++$+++ u8794 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ POCA +++$+++ Enedina and Paco ...
L642530 +++$+++ u8781 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON AMALIO +++$+++ What's that?
L642529 +++$+++ u8794 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ POCA +++$+++ Don Amalio!
L642487 +++$+++ u8794 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ POCA +++$+++ Tell me the answer to this! What bird lays eggs in a barn?
L642486 +++$+++ u8781 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON AMALIO +++$+++ They've got a real hen house here! You can't hear yourself speak.
L642296 +++$+++ u8781 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON AMALIO +++$+++ Smoking makes me feel ill? It's these filthy fag ends. I won't mention in this company what's upsetting you.
L642295 +++$+++ u8794 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ POCA +++$+++ No, miss. Smoking makes him spit and feel ill.
L642199 +++$+++ u8794 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ POCA +++$+++ So you didn't come from the poorhouse!
L642198 +++$+++ u8781 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON AMALIO +++$+++ When I wasn't so miserable I used to sell pigs. Begging your pardon, I was more honest than my holy Mother.
L642143 +++$+++ u8781 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON AMALIO +++$+++ Then it's a respectable house.
L642142 +++$+++ u8794 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ POCA +++$+++ Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.
L642141 +++$+++ u8781 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON AMALIO +++$+++ Are there many windows?
L642140 +++$+++ u8794 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ POCA +++$+++ Two.
L642139 +++$+++ u8781 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON AMALIO +++$+++ So much the better. We'll all fit. How many floors are there?
L642065 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ Then you won't forgive me?
L642064 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ You disgust me... even if what you say is true.
L642063 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ All that I said just now was a lie. I said it so you wouldn't leave. I only molested you in my thoughts ... I can't bear to have you leave me, hating me like this.  Tell me you believe what I'm saying and I'll let you go.
L642062 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ I've listened to you long enough. Let me out.
L642061 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ You must listen to me before you go.
L642060 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Let me pass!
L642051 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Go away! Leave me alone.
L642050 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ Think about it. Don't hurry. Think it over.
L642047 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ No, it's true.  Last night when you were sleeping, I had you all to myself.
L642046 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ You're lying.
L642036 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Don't go!
L642035 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ Leave us alone, Ramona.
L641999 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ You must be out of your mind. I've been so happy these last few days -- now you've spoiled it all.
L641998 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ Yes, I don't want you ever to leave this house.
L641990 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Maybe ...
L641989 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ It's my fault. If I'd come to see you more often, if I'd invited you here for holidays, maybe everything would be different.
L641988 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Unfortunately ...
L641987 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ It's up to you entirely. Don't leave, then ...
L641986 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Uncle, you mustn't think that I won't be sad to leave you.
L641984 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ No, it isn't that, I can assure you. I wouldn't be afraid in the face of real danger. I've proved that to myself. On the other hand, if a stranger visited me simply to say hello, I'd be alarmed.
L641983 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Wasn't that cowardice?
L641982 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ If you only knew ... When I was young I was full of idealism. I wanted to do something on a big scale for others, something to show my great love for humanity. But as soon as I tried to do something about it, I became afraid that I would be laughed at and I felt like a fool ... and so I went back into my shell.
L641981 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ No, Uncle, and now I'm pleased to have been able to do this favor, because, although I didn't think so at first, you are really a good man.
L641980 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ You must think I'm mad.
L641977 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ I don't like masquerading, but as you see I decided to give in to your whim.
L641976 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ How strange you are! When I asked you to do this favor for me you refused. You seemed almost offended. And now, here you are, making me so very happy all of a sudden. Thank you, my child!
L641972 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Today I can refuse you nothing.
L641971 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ I should like you to do something for me. It's an innocent sort of thing but I'm very set on it.
L641970 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Whatever you like.
L641969 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ This evening we must do something special by way of a farewell.
L641968 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Thank you, Uncle.
L641967 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ If you like, I will come with you tomorrow to the village when you leave.
L641966 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ Then it's penance for you who are going to be a nun; and for me, who am old, it's death ...
L641965 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ No, Uncle; ashes mean penance and death.
L641936 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ No, but what a pity life is like that.
L641935 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ You must think I am a monster.
L641934 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ Don't worry. He won't be forgotten.
L641933 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ And this innocent child.
L641932 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ His mother wanted to keep him. She came from a poor family. I was in love with your aunt. I would like to have acknowledged him but I was afraid of losing her. That's why I didn't say anything.
L641930 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ And what do you know about life? When all is said and done you couldn't possibly understand.
L641929 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Evil.
L641928 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ Sometimes these things happen because of inexperience. Sometimes it's because of...
L641927 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ How could anybody behave like that?
L641926 +++$+++ u8782 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ DON JAIME +++$+++ Never.
L641925 +++$+++ u8797 +++$+++ m596 +++$+++ VIRIDIANA +++$+++ Don't you ever see him?
