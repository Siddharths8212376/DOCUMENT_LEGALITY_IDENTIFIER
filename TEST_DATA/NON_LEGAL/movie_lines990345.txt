L549275 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ You're still going to have to be dealing with me -- with us.  We should tell them together.
L549274 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ WE'RE still their parents for the next hundred years.
L549273 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ WE are over.
L549272 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ We...
L549271 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You can't be an 'us' just when you want to.  You can't play that card when it's convenient.
L549270 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ It's a huge moment in their life --
L549269 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ To make it easier for them or you?
L549268 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ It's going to be hard for the kids when I tell them...I'd like you to be there.
L549264 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Just not to me.
L549263 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I grew up, a little.  I'm ready for a life that's built around commitm...
L549262 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Tell me exactly how you're different from three years ago?  The music sounds kind of the same from where I'm sitting.
L549261 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I didn't think a phone call was appropriate...
L549259 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Getting so beautiful...she looks more like you every day.  Jackie...I've really given this a lot of thought.  A great deal of thought...
L549258 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Annabelle showed me the new dress. She's amazing in it.
L549257 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Still, please.
L549149 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ And I'm supposed to care.
L549148 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I'm afraid she's going to walk.
L549147 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ <u>Slugs</u>.  Have faster learning curves. <u>Trees</u>, even.
L549146 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ You know the kids aren't really in danger.  This is about Rachel, and you're right, I'm disappointed in her learning curve, and...
L549145 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Partly.  But partly, you're mad.
L549144 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You're saying, don't make the kids a football, don't put them through a war.  But I'm doing this for <u>their</u> well-being.
L549143 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Don't do this.
L549142 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Called him.  We set an ap...
L549118 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ We've broken a lot of promises, haven't we Luke?
L549117 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Jackie stop.  We promised we never go there.
L549116 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I'm not gonna wait around to see the next one.  I'm not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement.  I'm seeing a lawyer.
L549115 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Jackie, you've made mistakes -- We all make mistakes --
L549114 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Not to me.
L549113 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ But he hasn't.  He wandered off.  I know it's terrifying.  I can imagine how you felt when that call came -- But it happens.
L549112 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Do you realize what could have hap- pened to your son today?  How lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did?  He could have been...
L549111 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Our children.
L549076 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ ...until the plan changed, when Jessie's mom gave us these tickets. What, Rachel. 'forgot' I told her?
L549075 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Jackie, <u>we</u> were taking them water- skiing for the <u>whole</u> weekend!
L549074 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ At the Big Apple Circus, it's the only big top I know.  I <u>said</u> I'd get 'em back tonight...
L549073 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ You're WHERE?
L549072 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Just outside the big top, we're almo...
L548919 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Good...Well...Take care.
L548918 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Easy enough.
L548917 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Fine.  But I wanted to take the kids to work with me on Wednesday so I'll take Wednesday, and you can pick up that Thursday, Friday after soccer, and Saturday before riding.
L548916 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend...  ...that way you'll be there, and I'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
L548915 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Me too.
L548914 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I'm worried.
L548913 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ You ask me that counselor's making a mountain out of a molehill...
L548912 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You tried that last week and we were on hold forty-five minutes...
L548911 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I'll call from work.  We can have a conference call.
L548910 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ It's Wednesday night.  She's at my house.  I'll talk to her.
L548909 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Thank you Mrs. Franklin.  Jackie?  This has been very valuable for us.  And I'll have a serious talk with Annabelle tonight.
L548905 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Jackie, she was five minutes late --
L548904 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Except for last Thursday when Rachel forgot to pick them up --
L548903 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Napalm.
L548900 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Jackie, they come to be part of my life.  Rachel <u>is</u> part of that life.
L548899 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ They want to be with you Luke, they go to your house to be with their father.
L548898 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Well, we're not discussing Rachel's age either.
L548897 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ We're not discussing your age.
L548896 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Rachel's not half my age.
L548895 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Since our divorce Luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids, he's now living with a woman half his age --
L548894 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I've been with someone for quite some time, and didn't feel it was appropriate for her to move in too quickly.  But after a lot of thought and careful discussion with her -- and the kids I might add -- she moved in last month.
L548891 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ You think I didn't get that?
L548890 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Something's up wi...
L548889 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I'm here.  I've got a case where they're this close to sequestering the jury but have I answered the goddamn thing?!
L548888 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Because you don't really seem here.
L548887 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I'm here.
L548886 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Are you here?
L548884 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Remarried.  There is no move.
L548883 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Planning on getting --
L550026 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Just sit me up.  Nice and tall. Bring Benjamin first.
L550025 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You know, there's nothing you have to say.  Because they know your heart.  You don't have t...
L550022 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Just want to be a little sharper. For a few minutes.
L550021 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Now Edna says you short-changed your last meds.  You can do presents and be comfortable at the same time, y'know.
L550010 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I have their past.
L550009 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's <u>happiness</u> has been wrapped up in <u>you</u>, every moment...
L550008 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You'll learn.
L550007 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You ride with Annabelle...
L550006 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You're the hip and fresh.
L550005 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Everything.  You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...
L550004 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ What do I have that you don't?
L550003 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ With good reason.  They fucking worship you as it is.
L549999 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Uh.  You hate my guts?
L549998 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Why didn't I?
L549997 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ He only remembers I <u>found</u> him.  My point is, telling you this story would have been the kindest, most helpful thing I could ever have done for you.
L549996 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Ben never mentioned it.
L549995 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off.  Doing my imitation of you.
L549994 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You are lying, you never lost that kid for 4 <u>seconds</u>, you could find him from a <u>coma</u>, there is no WAY!
L549993 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I lost him.  I was panicked.
L549992 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You're lying.
L549986 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Maybe I was wrong on that one.
L549985 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Come on, a wuss like me?  The stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back?
L549984 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Well, it's the Jack Kennedy Syndrome, huh?  You die young, you always look golden.  Perfect.  The memory kind of burnishes the image, and...
L549983 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Is scary.  But you want it.  Gimme some truth here.
L549982 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I never wanted to be a mom.  Then, sharing it with you was one thing. Carrying it alone, the rest of my life...
L549980 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ And I have looked down the road. At what my life will be.  And I can't handle it.
L549979 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ No, there isn't.
L549978 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I love Luke, I love the children. But there is more to life than even love...
L549977 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Don't flatter yourself.  I always liked that line.
L549976 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ What's this about?  Because we <u>fought</u>?
L549975 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Double.
L549974 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ She likes a Stolie, no ice.
L549972 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Neutral ground.  What's up?
L549971 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Thanks for coming out.
L549928 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ <u>That's</u> what it is.  And that's <u>all</u> it is.
L549927 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You've turned her into you.  And I may not get another chance.  To turn her back.
L549926 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ And she'll fight back again.  God help me, what have I done.
L549925 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ And there will come <u>another</u> moment. When the stakes are <u>really</u> there. And she will look back on this.  And remember how good it felt.  How easy it was.
L549924 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Well, that's what parenting is <u>about</u>, little girl.  They are <u>pleading</u> to know how they are supposed to do it. And you sure as hell <u>showed</u> her.
L549923 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ She wasn't steering her own course, she was steering <u>yours</u>.
L549922 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Doing the <u>right</u> thing.  Knowing who you <u>are</u>, inside.  Not <u>caving</u> to peer pressure, or <u>lowering</u> yourself to that level, <u>steering</u> your <u>own</u> course...
L549921 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Shut the fuck up.  <u>I</u> didn't go behind <u>your</u> back.
L549920 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Oh please.
L549919 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ See, in that crisis, I saw an opportunity.  For some <u>real</u> growth.
L549917 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Well, maybe <u>your</u> version of growing up is 'Just win, baby'.
L549916 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You weren't passing 'em out.
L549915 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You think <u>I</u> didn't have some dirty words for that little putz?  You think <u>I</u> couldn't figure out some low blows?
L549914 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ That's not wh...
L549913 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You taught my child that I am some limp dick <u>loser</u>.  Who didn't <u>care</u> about her pain.
L549912 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ So you became the hero.  And I became the schmuck.
L549911 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ She was beaten, and bloodied, and it was going to go on, uni...
L549910 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Worked.  Like a charm.
L549909 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancy-boy <u>model</u>!
L549908 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Aw.
L549907 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You put filth in my child's mouth.
L549906 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Right down to the ground.  Let's get to it.
L549905 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You are <u>defending</u> what you did?
L549904 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Is that what you're worried about? Looking bad at the PTA?
L549903 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Actually.  They'll want Annabelle's mother.
L549902 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Give 'em my number.
L549901 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so.  And they'll b...
L549900 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ It doesn't matter, I didn't tell h...
L549899 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Now, 'limp dick', I know.  What. Is 'snowballing'?
L549898 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Don't be too sure.
L549897 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ And I'm going to win.
L549896 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Are we.
L549895 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Now we're going to have a fight, you and I.
L549893 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ He looks familiar.  Did he do a Calvin Klein ad?
L549892 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Looks nice enough to m...
L549891 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Who in the world <u>is</u> he?
L549890 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You really didn't have to come, you know.  I'd have brought them straight t...
L549846 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ He won't discuss it.  Just calls it history.
L549845 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Is that what he told you?
L549844 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ That thing you said before.  Pushing the guy sleeping next to you away. Because of what you gave up for motherhood...
L549838 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Took 28 hours.  She just wasn't sure about entering this world.
L549837 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ And her...?
L549836 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Somehow, his blanket always looked like a cape, even the nurse said that.  He <u>loves</u> to hear that story, over and over.  How he was born a magician.
L549832 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Feeling the pressure?
L549831 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ My advice to you?  Don't die.
L549828 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ That's motherhood.  That's the job, with or without a career. I'm telling you the biggest gift you can give them is your happiness. They <u>need</u> you to be happy.
L549827 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I just want to spend time with them when I'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or...
L549826 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I know you, huh?  The car pools, he measles, the PTA.  It's not gonna be enough for you in the long run.  You have to think long term.
L549825 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Yes.  I made the choice that was right for me.  And I don't regret it.  But even for me, there were days when I felt so lost, so invis- ible.  And then I'd hate myself for the kids not being enough.
L549824 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ It's the same choice you made.
L549823 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Juggle it!  Move the darkroom into your house.  You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway.  Don't lose your confidence.  Don't lose your edge.
L549822 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Hey, you haven't quit on you, I'm sure as hell not gonna.  I just mean, I'm juggling a lot right n...
L549821 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You mean, after I'm dead?
L549820 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
L549819 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Do what you've worked your whole life to do?
L549818 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ It's just not the right time t...
L549816 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ No.
L549815 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I'm thinking.  Do I know you well enough to really chew you out?
L549810 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ ...go to the park.  In the worst way.
L549809 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Hon, maybe your mom would like t...
L549727 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ It's <u>covered</u>, okay?  I appreciate your concern.  Can I talk to her?
L549726 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Yah?  Well, even the best mom in the world, the smartest, the wisest, whatever.  Needs to know when to find a Plan B.  Cos Plan A <u>is</u> not and <u>will</u> n...
L549725 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Thanks, but it's under control.
L549724 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Can I say one thing?  I mean, the <u>last</u> thing I want to do is inter- fere on the Brad thing, b...
L549723 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ How's she doing with Brad?
L549722 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Yeh, she's...I'll get you Ben first, it's past his bedti...
L549721 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Eat your heart out.  Is Annabelle there?
L549701 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ What else?  Keep on keepin' on.
L549700 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ And you said...
L549699 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ He's relentless.  A <u>major</u> asshole.
L549697 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I think my 'primo shit' got left in my 'bellbottoms.'
L549696 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ The primo stuff is great for pain.
L549694 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Brad Kovitsky.
L549693 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You try to center on the big issues, y'know.  What it's all about.  What this whole trip has meant.  But then, the <u>really</u> big issues keep swamping y...
L549691 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Yeh, that's bull.  I'm going for serene, they say some actually get there.
L549690 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.
L549689 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I really look like shit.
L549688 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ It's promising, this one.  We're upbeat.
L549687 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ So.  Hopeful.
L549683 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ It's a mess, right now.  That's my project when I get back.
L549682 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Can I look at the pictures?
L549598 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Beats me.  Ask your mom.
L549597 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ And you said...?
L549594 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Doesn't <u>begin</u> to describe it. I mean, you've got cancer, <u>this</u> is serious.
L549593 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ She's devastated.
L549592 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Right.  Which is the whole <u>point</u> of this 'going out' thing, so one of them can dump the other one, and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy, without ever having to actually date.
L549591 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Oh, my God.
L549590 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Anyway.  He walks up to her on lunch yard today.  And tells her... publicly...that they're 'breaking up.'
L549589 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ ...going out, yeh.  I had kids of my own, once.
L549588 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ As you may know, 'going out' in the six grade doesn't mean shit.  They don't actually <u>go</u> to a movie or anywhere, they don't even eat lunch together, it's just a declaration to the world that they're...
L549587 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Toi.  They've been 'going out' for two weeks.
L549586 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Moi?
L549585 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ She was afraid you'd make a big deal out of it.
L549584 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ She hasn't mentioned this.
L549583 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ That.  And.  Annabelle is over her head.  With Brad 'The Dreamboat' Kovitsky.
L549582 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You're a cross-dresser.
L549581 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ So I have to tell you something in confidence...
L549580 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Luke's depo ran late.  I promised I'd take notes.
L549579 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Small world.
L549505 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Ironic, huh?
L549504 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Okay, I'm undeserving.
