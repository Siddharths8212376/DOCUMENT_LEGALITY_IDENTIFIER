L664060 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?
L664047 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --
L664046 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ The atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.
L664041 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ It will happen, Laurie.  I've already seen it.  Neither of us can do anything to change it.
L664040 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Jon, no -- I can't --
L664039 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye. You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .
L664038 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Collect me?
L664037 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ I'm not here.  I'm still on Mars.  I've come to collect you.
L663397 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ . . . And just how would you manage that?
L663396 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ I could stay and go.
L663395 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Mm hmm.
L663394 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Would you like me to stay?
L663392 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Not yet, there's plenty of time.
L663391 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?
L663390 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ I'm here, Laurie.
L663359 +++$+++ u8979 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DR. MANHATTAN +++$+++ Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.
L663358 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Blake?  Dead?
L664172 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ We'd better hope so.  -- It's almost time.
L664171 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
L664170 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Your problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.
L664165 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Then I¹ve been a very bad boy and you¹ll have to spank me.  Christ!  I¹m doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!!
L664164 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ What if you¹re wrong??
L664163 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ I¹m not.
L664162 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ And what if you¹re wrong?
L664161 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Don¹t be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We won¹t even be here, will we?
L664150 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ I've seen them!  I've seen them in there. 
L664149 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Adrian -- you've lost it.
L664148 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
L664147 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ What is it?  How does it work?
L664146 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Gentlemen, the past.  Unfolding before your eyes.  Stand back from the field.  It'll blow you to bits.
L664128 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ It's not on tape.  It's live.  We're watching it happen.
L664127 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Good Lord.  How'd you get it on tape?
L664126 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ It is  Jon.  Twenty-four years ago.  Before he turned into Dr. Manhattan.
L664117 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ I couldn't let him interfere with my project.
L664116 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ What??
L664111 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Uh huh.  You might recognize the names.  Quite a few of them worked at Gila Flats.
L664110 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ The missing scientists.
L664109 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Yeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of course . . .
L663803 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Thanks for the offer, Adrian.  I'll let you know.
L663802 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.  Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.
L663801 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ She's with me.
L663800 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?
L663799 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Who?
L663343 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Good night.
L663342 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good night.
L663341 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ No.  I just wanted you to --
L663340 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
L663339 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
L663338 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.
L663337 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ I know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells blood.
L663336 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Us.  You mean the Watchmen.
L663335 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's . . . I don't know, stalking us.
L663334 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
L663333 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ The Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.
L664215 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ We'll tell them what's happened.  They'll listen to reason, won't they -- ?
L664214 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --
L664213 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Dan -- what do we do now?
L664201 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Everything's changed --
L664200 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Those cars.  What year is this??
L664199 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Dan, is this -- is this New York??
L664196 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Where did he go?
L664195 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ He saved himself.  He changed the past.
L664179 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Trying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --
L664178 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ What was he doing?
L664018 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?
L664017 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Welcome back, Night Owl.
L664001 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
L664000 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.
L663985 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ My God!  We bust him out of jail, in the middle of a riot, and he stops to take a --
L663984 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ I think he's going to the john.
L663983 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ What's he doing?
L663949 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ . . . What??
L663948 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.
L663947 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ You're full of yourself.  What are you doing?
L663946 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ It's because there's nothing to be afraid of anymore.  The world's about to end.  I feel like I could save it.
L663945 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ That's because --
L663944 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.
L663943 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Yes you are.
L663942 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ No way.  I'm not that much of a pervert.
L663941 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ The costumes.  Am I right?
L663940 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ What?
L663923 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.
L663922 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ They're practically on us . . .
L663921 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.
L663920 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!
L663915 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ All right.  Mission accomplished.
L663914 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ They're following us.
L663891 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Oh, Laurie.  Jesus.  No.
L663890 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
L663889 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ What the hell -- ?
L663869 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Okay!
L663868 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ This'd better not be what I think it is.
L663867 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Don't look.  Turn around.
L663866 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ What are you up to?
L663865 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.
L663864 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Me neither.  Mine barely even fits.  The thing is, I try to remember why we did it, and I can't.  Helping people, or righting wrongs, or trying to save the world . . . I don't know.  It all seems so abstract.
L663863 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Dan!  The spare costumes!  I can't believe you kept them.
L663861 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ You and me.
L663860 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.
L663859 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come along.  I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.
L663858 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Antarctica??
L663857 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ I took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some cows.  -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica.
L663854 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ -- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.
L663853 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ The Owlship.  I can't believe it.
L663849 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Memory lane.
L663848 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Enough is enough, Daniel.  Where exactly are we?
L663810 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ With any luck, the world'll end before we get ours.
L663809 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
L663808 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Laurie --
L663807 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
L663806 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ -- What is it.
L663805 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.  . . . First time I've ever heard him scared.
L663804 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Ohh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?
L663758 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ The Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.
L663757 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I just realized.  I'd never seen his face.  I guess it was just a matter of time.  He's totally -- Daniel? What's wrong?
L663754 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Are you kidding?  If they put him in jail he's dead.  He'll never get to trial.
L663753 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Eight cops?  Oh, great.  A jury's gonna love that.
L663725 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.
L663724 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ . . . What?
L663723 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.  Here, you pick one.
L663722 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Old?
L663721 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .
L663720 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?
L663719 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!
L663718 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ No wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?
L663706 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Play one.  Educate yourself.
L663705 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.  Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people.
L663704 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ I told you I was a little bit out of step.  A lot of the old stuff I listen to -- it never came out on crystal.
L663697 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I'm not his . . . whatever.  Okay?
L663696 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ His . . . whatever.
L663695 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ His what?
L663663 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really sweet.  Sleep tight, okay?
L663662 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Oh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I mean, if you need some aspirin, or --
L663658 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ You're sure?
L663657 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.
L663656 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Laurie, wait.  I've got a spare room.  It's empty.  If you'd like . . . LAURIE Oh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't.  You'd just be all nervous about --
L663654 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Dan, what are you so scared of?  I mean, me, I've spent all these years keeping Jon together, and now that it's over I feel -- I feel glad.  I'm finally free to, to go out and live my own life, and --
L663653 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Maybe not, but why take chances?
L663652 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen.
L663651 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ You'll find something.  -- I should go.  You and me, seeing each other, someone might put two and two together . . .
L663650 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
L663649 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .  How about you, Laurie?
L663432 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.
L663431 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?
L663430 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?
L663429 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .
L663428 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
L663427 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
L663426 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Damn straight!  We were heroes.
L663425 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Damn straight.
L663421 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ 
L663420 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Okay, okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us made other choices.
L663419 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Fine, but the Civil Terrorism Unit?  It's a fucking Gestapo!  Dirty tricks -- political assassinations --
L663418 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.
L663417 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .
L663416 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
L663415 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?
L664160 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Adrian.  It¹s too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.
L664159 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ . . . And they call me a fucking nut.
L664108 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Adrian -- you?  You killed Blake, and --
L664107 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.
L664106 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?
L664088 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Don't know.  Nothing I can think of --  -- outside of a nuclear blast.

L664086 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.

L664053 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't matter.
L664052 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Veidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --
L664051 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ We're running, Rorschach.  We've got no place to go.  We're hightailing it down to Adrian's.

L664023 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ How do we know they've got cancer?  Could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . .
L664022 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us?  What about all those poor shits with cancer?

L663997 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.
L663996 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ I don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.
L663987 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd.  Let's get out of here.
L663986 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ . . . That was quick.
L663327 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Hey.  Hey.  If you don't mind, use the back stairs, all right?
L663326 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Maybe.  Or maybe somebody's finally caught up with us.  Somebody with a grudge.  Thought you might want to spread the word.
L663325 +++$+++ u8980 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ DREIBERG +++$+++ Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just paranoia.
