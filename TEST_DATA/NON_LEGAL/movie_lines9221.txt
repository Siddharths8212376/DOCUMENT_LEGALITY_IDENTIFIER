L349088 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Not for the weekend.  For the summer.
L349087 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore.
L349086 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'll be by Saturday to pick him up.
L349085 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day.
L349084 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ When's school over?
L349083 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Look, I wasn't serious about you taking Sam, so you don't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it.
L349082 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ The garage.
L349081 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Where will you live?
L349080 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I love those doors.
L349079 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ How many years did I live with your beams and boards?  First in the garage, then in the living room.  We're going to do it, Robin.  Next year.  Next year.  Salvaged floorboards from a house in Pasadena. Doors from a church in New Hampshire...
L349078 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Severance pay.  And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy.
L349077 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Money?
L349076 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ There's nothing anymore to stop me.
L349075 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ You've been saying that for twenty years. While we were dating, you said it.
L349074 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'm going to tear down the shack and build my house.
L349073 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Why call me?
L349072 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I was parked in day parking.
L349071 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Why would they tow your truck?
L349070 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I need to talk to you.
L349069 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I wasn't thinking.  Look, I'm sorry I didn't think to call you while I thought...I think.
L349068 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ But you can't call me while you think?
L349067 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Kurt's been feeding him.
L349066 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ What did you do with your dog?
L349065 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Four days.  I left to think.
L349064 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Where have you been for a week?!
L349063 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ A blueprint spool.
L349062 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ You didn't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat?!
L349061 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I didn't think you'd know I went missing.
L349060 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'm not talking just physically.  Even your anger is perfect.
L349059 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ What?
L349058 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You're the most beautiful woman I have ever known in my life.
L349057 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ You're inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion!
L349056 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Thanks for waking me up.  Picking me up. You're loud today.
L349055 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I called everyone, everywhere!  You just vanished!  You could be dead!
L348955 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Because he put the lock on!  Do you think I told him he could have a nose ring?! Why do you ask me everything you should ask him!?  I don't know anything, anymore!
L348954 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Why does he have a lock on his door?
L348953 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ He never answers.
L348952 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ He doesn't answer.
L348951 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ What are you doing?
L348942 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Where he always is.
L348941 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Where is he?
L348940 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Lock the door behind you.
L348939 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You let him pierce his nose?
L348938 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Did Sam call to tell you he wouldn't be over this weekend?
L348937 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Ring the bell before you try the door.
L348936 +++$+++ u1799 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You should lock your doors.
L349815 +++$+++ u1800 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ I could use the money.
L349814 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ It's just a joke.  A stupid joke.
L349377 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm thinking it's too weird now.
L349376 +++$+++ u1800 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ He already knows everything about what he can't do.  You can tell him not to even look at you, if you want.
L349374 +++$+++ u1800 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ She wouldn't even fucking go out with until she was sixteen.  I mean, that's not even a rule, just her own thing.  She like figures things out on her own and then that's it.
L349373 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I wasn't sure.
L349372 +++$+++ u1800 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ Don't even...I'm there.
L349371 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What's your deal with Alyssa?
L349336 +++$+++ u1800 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ You got the money?
L349335 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You got any weed?
L349334 +++$+++ u1800 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ Nothing.
L349333 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Does Alyssa know?
L349332 +++$+++ u1800 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ It'll take you like twenty, thirty minutes.
L348885 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ No.
L348884 +++$+++ u1800 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ JOSH +++$+++ Been thinking?
L350016 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ The payoff.
L350015 +++$+++ u1801 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ Then you tell me, what just happened?
L350014 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Everything happens for a reason.  That's what my dad said.
L350013 +++$+++ u1801 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ What the fuck?
L350010 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm sixteen years old.  I'm underage. How could I possibly threaten you?
L350009 +++$+++ u1801 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L349998 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Who?
L349997 +++$+++ u1801 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ KURT +++$+++ He said he heard hammering.
L349992 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I feel in love with George again.
L349991 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ That was my plan...to be hardly recognizable to you as me.
L349990 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I hardly recognize you with a beard.
L349711 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I'll be in the bedroom.
L349710 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Sam took them to a movie.
L349709 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Where are the kids?
L349708 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Please don't leave me.
L349707 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ That's the problem.
L349706 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I never asked for more.
L349705 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Despite you.
L349704 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You live a fabulous life, Robin.
L349703 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ You never really trusted me.
L349702 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I always felt I could never marry you without first showing you what a fabulous life you cloud live despite me.
L349701 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ What are you doing home?
L349700 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ That sounds pathetic, doesn't it?
L349628 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I know.
L349627 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I was talking about our marriage.
L349625 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ So am I, Robin.  I'm working at something, too.  I'm even talking.  Do you want to be around for it?
L349624 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Sam is working at something for the first time in his life.  Once in a while he even talks to me.  I want to be around for that.
L349623 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You can't go with me because of Sam?
L349622 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ We haven't been away together for three years.  What difference does a few months make?
L349621 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You can't go because of Sam?
L349620 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I can't go right now.
L349619 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Good.  That was the plan.  We couldn't stand him and George needed help.
L349618 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I've been helping for the last few days. Weeks.  Sam's working.  I told you Sam was working.  I mean, he really is.
L349617 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What?
L349616 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I'm helping George build his house.
L349615 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Lois will stay with them.  Or we can pawn them off on your parents.
L349614 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ After the kids are back in school.
L349613 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Sooner than the Fall.
L349612 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I'd love to drive through New England in the Fall.
L349610 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Do you remember anything I've said that wasn't negative?
L349609 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ The biggest waste of time since television.
L349608 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ We should take a vacation.
L349607 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ To shave your chest?
L349368 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I'd be you.
L349367 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you?
L349366 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ If I let everything that should worry me, worry me, I'd be dead from worry.
L349365 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ It would worry me.
L349364 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Should I?
L349363 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Do you think it's odd your kids don't hug you?
L349328 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I'll make you something.
L349327 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Is Lois still here?  I'm starved.
L349326 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ We've eaten.
L348869 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ A man he respects.
L348868 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ His father is a man.
L348867 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I don't have a clue anymore.  I wish you'd talk to him.  He needs a man.
L350027 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Do you like red?
L350026 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I thought I might be able to help, but it looks like you have all you can handle.
L350025 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Either do you.
L350024 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You don't look like you.
L348875 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ If I walk out the door, who's gonna be here tonight for the follow through?
L348874 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Do it now!
L348873 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Take it off.
L348872 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ No.
L348871 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Are you wearing eye shadow?
L348870 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Thanks for talking about me behind my back...useful in court.
L349989 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Okay.
L349988 +++$+++ u1805 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ I guess I could teach you some things.
L349987 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ No.
L349986 +++$+++ u1805 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ Do you know anything about building a house?
L349966 +++$+++ u1805 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ Why?
L349965 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I've missed you guys.
L349964 +++$+++ u1805 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ It's not ours.  It's George's.
L349963 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You got a dog?
L349962 +++$+++ u1805 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ Hey.
L349961 +++$+++ u1803 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Hey.
L350039 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Then maybe this isn't what he wants, but this what he was hoping for.  Maybe it's what I want.
L350038 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I read the letter.  You read the will. He wants you to keep it.  To live in it some day.
L350037 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ This is what he wants.
L350036 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ You could keep it and rent it out?
L350035 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Yeah.
L350034 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ You're sure about this?
L349795 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I wouldn't let Adam or Ryan see you doing it.
L349794 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I don't know what I'm doing.
L349793 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ The door was open.
L349756 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Depends on what I'd give up on.
L349755 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Can you stay for dinner?
L349754 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ There were no PG's.  So I just gave them money to play games.
L348962 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I locked the door!  Get out!  I locked the door!  Get out!
L348961 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I didn't go in your room.
L348960 +++$+++ u1806 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What are you doing in my room?
L349760 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ In the bedroom.
L349759 +++$+++ u1805 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ Dad's home, already?
L349758 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Go tell your father we're eating.
L349662 +++$+++ u1805 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ Enough for drinks, popcorn and candy!
L349661 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Nothing R, okay?
L349603 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Would you stop being ridiculous?  Your father wants Sam home as much as I do.
L349602 +++$+++ u1805 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ Yes, it is.
L349601 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Adam, that's not true!
L349534 +++$+++ u1805 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ Someone stop her!
L349533 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I brought a few of my own.
L349469 +++$+++ u1805 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ Can we really help build a house?
L349468 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Ryan, would you rather swim or work?
L349463 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Not all day.  I'll be home after lunch.
L349462 +++$+++ u1805 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ All day again?
L349459 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I just thought it would be nice.
L349458 +++$+++ u1805 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ Why do we have to get up and eat with you this early?
L348879 +++$+++ u1805 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ Dad said it first.
L348878 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ What did you say?
L348877 +++$+++ u1805 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ Queer.
L348850 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ He'll be gone for his birthday.
L348849 +++$+++ u1805 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ Why?
L348848 +++$+++ u1804 +++$+++ m119 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Run downstairs and give your dad a hug.
L348409 +++$+++ u1807 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ ABERNATHY +++$+++ Better make it a week.
L348408 +++$+++ u1821 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ MAE ROSE +++$+++ A night in the hole?
L348405 +++$+++ u1807 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ ABERNATHY +++$+++ That's my girl.
L348404 +++$+++ u1821 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ MAE ROSE +++$+++ Nigger.
L348403 +++$+++ u1807 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ ABERNATHY +++$+++ No, nigger.
L348402 +++$+++ u1821 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ MAE ROSE +++$+++ Nagger?
L348401 +++$+++ u1807 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ ABERNATHY +++$+++ They ain't men, Mae Rose. They're convicts. And nigger convicts to boot. Can you say nigger?
L348527 +++$+++ u1807 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ ABERNATHY +++$+++ It's a boy! Well, let's get a look at him.
L348526 +++$+++ u1815 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ He's a big one.
L348525 +++$+++ u1807 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ ABERNATHY +++$+++ And the baby?
L348524 +++$+++ u1815 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ She's doing just fine.
L348523 +++$+++ u1807 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ ABERNATHY +++$+++ Is Mae Rose okay?
L348522 +++$+++ u1815 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ She'll be fine. She just had a bit of a shock.
L348563 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Well you can't stay here, Biscuit. This ain't no life for a man. Any one of these fellas would give their right arm to be in your shoes. I sure know I would.
L348562 +++$+++ u1808 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ BISCUIT +++$+++ Not for me, it ain't.
L348561 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ It's 1945. It's a different world now.
L348559 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Come on, Biscuit, this is good news. Your mama's gonna break down in tears when you show up on her doorstep.
L348558 +++$+++ u1808 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ BISCUIT +++$+++ What am I gonna do out there, Ray? I can't go home to my mama like this. I'll get the strap for sure.
L348557 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ These are free papers.
