L462133 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Goodbye!  See you!
L462132 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ A what?
L462131 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I'll bet you're a real yo yo.
L462130 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Oh.
L462129 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ The kids take me.
L462127 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ University and 10th--Want to carry my books?
L462126 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Yeah.  So where's the high school?
L462125 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Dig the square wardrobe!
L462124 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Yeah--why--
L462123 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ You going there?
L462122 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Where's Dawson High School?
L462121 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You're really flipped--aren't you.
L462120 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Won't mother be proud.
L462119 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ See, I'm new.
L462118 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Who lives?
L462117 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Where I saw you.  Everything going okay now?  You live around here?
L462116 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Where what was.
L462115 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ "Life can be beautiful." Hey, I know where it was.
L462114 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ "Life is crushing in on me."
L462113 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ See?
L462112 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Now that's true!
L462111 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You don't have to be unfriendly.
L462110 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Bully for you.
L462109 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Hi.  I saw you before.
L462815 +++$+++ u2592 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ PLATO +++$+++ Hi.
L462814 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Hi, Plato!
L462672 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ It's all right.
L462671 +++$+++ u2592 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ PLATO +++$+++ I did?  Well, he might as well be dead.  What's the difference?
L462670 +++$+++ u2592 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ PLATO +++$+++ He's dead.  He was a hero in the China Sea. JIM You told me he's a big wheel in New York!
L462669 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Plato, where's your father now?
L462635 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Talk to them!  Heavens!
L462634 +++$+++ u2592 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ PLATO +++$+++ Shall I show you the nursery?  It's far away from the rest of the house. If you have children--Oh I hate the word!--or if you decide to adopt one--they can carry on and you'll never even notice.  In fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again, much less talk to them.
L462631 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Yes.  And so terribly annoying when they cry.  I just don't know what to do when they cry, do you dear?
L462630 +++$+++ u2592 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ PLATO +++$+++ Children?  Well, we really don't encourage them.  They're so noisy and troublesome, don't you agree?
L462625 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Oh, we can manage that!  I'll scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone...
L462624 +++$+++ u2592 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ PLATO +++$+++ Don't give it a thought.  Only three million dollars a month!
L462391 +++$+++ u2592 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ PLATO +++$+++ Okay.
L462390 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Want to finish my hamburger?  I only took a bite.
L462389 +++$+++ u2592 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ PLATO +++$+++ Maybe next summer he's going to take me hunting with him--and fishing.  I want him to teach me how and I bet he won't get mad if I goof.  His name's Jim.  It's really James but he likes Jim more.  People he really likes--he lets call him "Jamie."
L462388 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Well, that's the main thing--don't you think so?
L462387 +++$+++ u2592 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ PLATO +++$+++ Oh, I don't know.  You have to get to know him.  He doesn't say much but when he does you know he means it.  He's sincere.
L462386 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ What's he like?
L462385 +++$+++ u2592 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ PLATO +++$+++ Yes.  My best friend.
L462384 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Is he your friend?
L461964 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Goodbye, Judy.  Take it easy.
L461963 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ You said you'd call my father.
L461962 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ She's being called for.
L461961 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ My mother?
L461960 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
L461959 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ What?
L461958 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Your mother will be down in a few minutes, Judy--
L461945 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Would you like to go home if we can arrange it?  Did you notify the parents?
L461944 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ You know where they picked me up! Twelfth Street!  I wasn't even near there!
L461943 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Some kids stomped a man on Twelfth Street, Judy.
L461942 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I'll never get close to anybody.
L461941 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Do you think you can get back at your Dad that way?  I mean sometimes if we can't get as close to somebody as we'd like we have to try making them jealous--so they'll have to pay attention.  Did you ever think of that?
L461940 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ No.  I don't even know why I do it.
L461939 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Did you stop to talk to anyone, Judy?  Do you enjoy that?
L461938 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ No.
L461937 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You weren't looking for company, were you?
L461936 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I was just talking a walk.  I tried to call the kids but everybody was out and I couldn't find them.  I hate my life.  I just hate it.
L461935 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Is that why you were wandering around at one o'clock in the morning?
L461934 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house.
L461933 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ That one?
L461932 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--
L461931 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Do you think your father means that?
L461930 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
L461929 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ He makes you feel pretty unhappy?
L461927 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I don't think.  I know.  He looks at me like I'm the ugliest thing in the world.  He doesn't like my friends--he--
L461926 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What makes you think he hates you, Judy?
L461925 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ He hates me.
L461924 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What?
L461923 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ He hates me.
L461922 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Judy--we're ready for you now.
L462321 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Girls don't love their father? Since when?  Since I got to be sixteen?
L462320 +++$+++ u2587 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY'S FATHER +++$+++ I'd like to, that's all.  Girls your age don't do that.  You need an explanation?
L462319 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Why?
L462318 +++$+++ u2587 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY'S FATHER +++$+++ I'm tired, Judy.  I'd like to change the subject.
L462317 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I guess I just don't understand anything.
L462315 +++$+++ u2587 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY'S FATHER +++$+++ I didn't kiss her so it's a big thing.
L462314 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I was talking to Dad.
L462311 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I didn't want to stop.
L462310 +++$+++ u2587 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY'S FATHER +++$+++ You're too old for that kind of stuff, kiddo.  I thought you stopped doing that long ago.
L462308 +++$+++ u2587 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY'S FATHER +++$+++ What?
L462307 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Didn't you forget something?
L462306 +++$+++ u2587 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY'S FATHER +++$+++ Hi.
L462305 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Good evening.
L462304 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Daddy--
L462303 +++$+++ u2587 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY'S FATHER +++$+++ With us old creeps?  Come on, we have to eat.
L462302 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Nothing, only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change.
L462301 +++$+++ u2587 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY'S FATHER +++$+++ No.  Why?
L462300 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Are you and Mom home tonight?
L462299 +++$+++ u2587 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY'S FATHER +++$+++ We were romantic then too--
L462298 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ But the same song.  I think it's fantastic!
L462297 +++$+++ u2587 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY'S FATHER +++$+++ We used to sing it in school.  Don't look at me with such horror. They had schools in those days.
L462296 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ How did you know that?
L464267 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ That's for the hundred bucks worth of pay-per-view.  And that's for the two hundred you took outta your minibar.
L464266 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Gabriel!
L464254 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Mmm, baby. And I'd still want to be the tinsel round your tree...
L464253 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Y'know something, baby? If you were my sister? I'd still want to wake up Christmas morning with you...
L464252 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ He'll be dead when he does.
L464251 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ He's shown us the setup, he's drawn us the map, he's helped us do the plan. He wants a gun, give him a gun. Take the bullets out, whatever, but give him the gun. The more manpower we've got in there, the better. He won't try and make his move till the money's in hand.
L464250 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ What, he should see me help you catch him?
L464249 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
L464248 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
L464247 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ I've been doing good, though.
L464246 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas.
L464245 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ I can't take watching you touch him. I can't take his hands on you.
L464244 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ That's a book, baby.  That's a book of love.
L464243 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ -- plus the forty to Mason... how many letters is that?
L464242 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ -- till he fucked his parole --
L464241 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth --
L464240 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Searching for a money man...
L464239 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ To all those cons...
L464238 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ All those letters are about to pay off, baby... all those letters...
L464236 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ ...whoever she is.
L464235 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ He wants... your "sister"...
L464234 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ No, baby. He wants me.
L464233 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ He wants the money.
L463899 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ We're talking, aren't we?
L463898 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Gabriel! You said talk to him. That's all you ever said...
L463848 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ NO!
L463847 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ He'd rather die than be with you, he'd make a fucked-up boyfriend anyway.  Bury him all over the place.
L463846 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ And you promised me you'd get your sweetheart to help!
L463845 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ You promised me!
L463844 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ I promised that when he helped us, we'd be gone! When he helped us! Loverboy don't want to play!
L463843 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Gabriel, you promised!
L463787 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ YES!!!

L463783 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Don't hurt him...
L463782 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Is this him!?
L463763 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ GABRIEL, I LOVE HIM!
L463762 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ A man of some travels.

L463758 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Read a lot about you, Nick.

L463756 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ You better be here to be good to her, loverboy. 'Cause she's been good to you.
L463754 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ Gabriel, what are you doing!

L464427 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
L464426 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ No --
L464425 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ I... you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't Nick --
L464424 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ You said Merry Christmas, Rudy.
L464423 +++$+++ u2595 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ ASHLEY +++$+++ What are you talking about?
