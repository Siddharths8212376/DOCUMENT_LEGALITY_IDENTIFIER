L307043 +++$+++ u1517 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ KENNETH +++$+++ Yes?
L307042 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ That was Marvin Untermeyer.
L307041 +++$+++ u1517 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ KENNETH +++$+++ What?
L307040 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ My God.
L306947 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I already made my move, Kenneth.
L306946 +++$+++ u1517 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ KENNETH +++$+++ It's your move, Miles.
L306945 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ They won't get a conviction. The husband called it in as a suicide. The forensic guys weren't thinking murder. I'm sure some of the evidence was compromised.
L306796 +++$+++ u1517 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ KENNETH +++$+++ Oh. I thought maybe --  Gee!
L306795 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ No. You have the ring. Wrigley has the pre-nup.
L306794 +++$+++ u1517 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ KENNETH +++$+++ No. I have the ring. Was I supposed to have a pre-nup?
L306793 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You have the pre-nup?
L306792 +++$+++ u1517 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ KENNETH +++$+++ I have it.
L306786 +++$+++ u1517 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ KENNETH +++$+++ Well... I'm still...
L306785 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Asian? No.
L306784 +++$+++ u1517 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ KENNETH +++$+++ Is she Asian?
L306783 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Thanks, buddy.
L306782 +++$+++ u1517 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ KENNETH +++$+++ I'm happy for you, pal.
L306620 +++$+++ u1517 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ KENNETH +++$+++ Miles! Don't waste time with someone else's queen, either.
L306619 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ He's the wrong man.
L306618 +++$+++ u1517 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ KENNETH +++$+++ Doyle Oil?  A Massey Pre-nup?  She loves him.
L306617 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle.
L306616 +++$+++ u1517 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ KENNETH +++$+++ What?
L306615 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ She can't really love that idiot, can she?
L306614 +++$+++ u1517 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ KENNETH +++$+++ The Center Counter Defense. The thing is not to move your queen too early.
L306613 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What?
L306612 +++$+++ u1517 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ KENNETH +++$+++ Oh. That.  Don't waste time with your queen.
L306611 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.
L306610 +++$+++ u1517 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ KENNETH +++$+++ Got any symptoms?
L306609 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Do you think I'm going to end up like Herb Myerson, with a colostomy bag instead of a family?
L306520 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I should be in therapy.
L306519 +++$+++ u1517 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ KENNETH +++$+++ You're in check.
L306518 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Denial is not a river in Egypt.
L306517 +++$+++ u1517 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ KENNETH +++$+++ I was going to play golf. You were going to have Asian girlfriends.
L306516 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You were going to be a Cardiac Surgeon. I was going to clerk for the Supreme Court.
L306515 +++$+++ u1517 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ KENNETH +++$+++ We did not.
L306514 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Botox. Christ. We had aspirations when we were in college.
L306513 +++$+++ u1517 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ KENNETH +++$+++ Set one side for Bel Air.
L306512 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ It was a gift from a client.
L306511 +++$+++ u1517 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ KENNETH +++$+++ Why would you need two time zones? You never leave Beverly Hills.
L306510 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ It's a LeCoultre Revers. You can flip the face, and set it for two time zones.
L306509 +++$+++ u1517 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ KENNETH +++$+++ No frown lines.  New watch?
L306508 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Why in God's name would I want...?
L306507 +++$+++ u1517 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ KENNETH +++$+++ It's a form of botulism. I just inject it into your forehead, and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't raise them...
L306506 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What the hell is Botox?
L306505 +++$+++ u1517 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ KENNETH +++$+++ You want Botox?
L306504 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I don't need it.
L306503 +++$+++ u1517 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ KENNETH +++$+++ Everyone needs plastic surgery. You need it.
L306502 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Not this one. Not unless her HMO covers plastic surgery, which, incidentally, she does not need.
L306501 +++$+++ u1517 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ KENNETH +++$+++ So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement.
L306500 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ She got absolutely nothing. Zero. Zip.
L306277 +++$+++ u1527 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ WITNESS +++$+++ He manufactures staples and industrial brad-tacks. He's very successful.
L306276 +++$+++ u1518 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ LAWYER +++$+++ What is your husband's profession?
L306275 +++$+++ u1527 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ WITNESS +++$+++ I was a hostess. For Trans-World Airlines.
L306274 +++$+++ u1518 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ LAWYER +++$+++ Prior to your marriage, what was your profession?
L306273 +++$+++ u1527 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ WITNESS +++$+++ Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea.
L306272 +++$+++ u1518 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ LAWYER +++$+++ Mrs. Guttman, you have testified that you were your husband's sexual slave for thirty-six years, ever since you were married --
L306954 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ I'll be right back.
L306953 +++$+++ u1522 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ It sounded like a bell.
L306889 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Yeah. I guess. You know --
L306888 +++$+++ u1522 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ Oh boy. If he only knew.
L306887 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Well. He said to "make the house mine."
L306879 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ I think Ming is older than Tong.  What is this?
L306878 +++$+++ u1522 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ Is Tong older than Ming?
L306875 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ I said yes.
L306874 +++$+++ u1522 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ You said 'yes' didn't you?
L306838 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ It's about time.
L306837 +++$+++ u1522 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ You're vulnerable.
L306497 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ In the Godfather, after the courtroom scene, Frankie Pentangeli opens his veins in the bathtub.
L306496 +++$+++ u1522 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ I begged you to have a baby!
L306488 +++$+++ u1522 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ Maybe they put a horse head in her bed?
L306487 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA. Maybe they offered her money. Massey is very seductive. Who knows.
L306486 +++$+++ u1522 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ Why do you think she did it?
L306485 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ It was like that scene in The Godfather. Frankie Pentangeli is called to testify against the Family. And he's in court, and he looks into the spectators gallery, and sees his Brother. They brought the brother from Sicily. And Frankie can't say a word. He can't testify. That's what it was like seeing Pat in there. I couldn't even have Ruth cross examine her.
L306262 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ I can't have a baby with a man I don't love... And I can't submit a child to divorce.
L306261 +++$+++ u1522 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ You like kids.
L306260 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ No.
L306259 +++$+++ u1522 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ You should have tried to get pregnant Marylin -- solidify your position.
L306242 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Ruth Rabino.
L306241 +++$+++ u1522 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ RAMONA +++$+++ So who'd you hire?
L307150 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I thought so.
L307149 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Sweet.
L307145 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Fine. They were created during a dictatorship.  What if something happened to you? What would I tell little Gus when he asked "what was my daddy like?"
L307144 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Pre-Castro.
L307132 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ I don't see how we can ever find our way back from...
L307131 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Murder!
L307130 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Murder?
L307129 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Income tax evasion?
L307128 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Forgery? Fraud?
L307127 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You're forgetting Howard Doyle?
L307126 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?
L307125 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You wounded me first, Marylin.
L307116 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt when I realized you'd hired the goon to kill...
L307115 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ But then -- I guess -- something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.
L307114 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ It's not something I wanted either.
L307113 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us.
L307112 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Hello Miles.
L307111 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Hello Marylin.
L307106 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ I'm not leaving you. I took self defense
L307105 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Marylin. Run. I'll distract him.
L307094 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ That's true.
L307093 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Nonono. Marylin -- I'm your husband. I'd be entitled to Rex's money. No matter what happened to you.
L307090 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Wait just a second there. You sent him here. You unearthed this pestilence.
L307089 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You were going to have this thug...?
L307088 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Now. But first, he worked for you.
L307087 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Wait! He works for YOU?
L307086 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ It's okay Joe.
L307085 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Marylin!
L307084 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ It's a no go, Joe.
L307071 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ You do? You do love me?
L307070 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ So did I. Now pack up a few basics and --
L307069 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ I fell in love Miles.
L307068 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Please! Leave the house.
L307067 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Just listen to me. I'm sorry, Miles. It's true that my initial intention was to...
L307066 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ No buts. Now. Out.
L307065 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ I will, Miles. I will leave. But Miles --
L307064 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You have to leave the house immediately!
L307063 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Miles? Miles! Where have you been? I've been trying to get in touch.
L307062 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Marylin?
L307061 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Hello?
L306999 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ That's marriage.
L306998 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ That's blackmail.
L306997 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Drop the bogus forgery charge and I'll forget about your generous friends slash clients.
L306996 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Did our marriage ever mean anything to you?
L306995 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ I believe the residence will be part of the settlement.
L306994 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Meaning my house.
L306993 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ I know. So am I, right? And so is Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of Southwestern University -- very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague.  I think it's only fair to warn you: I'm going to file an action, Miles. And after a decent interval I plan to have Ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house.
L306992 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You're out of your league, Marylin. Rexroth was a primate. I'm a professional.
L306991 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ I don't have to. That's what the IRS guys do. And they do it with great zeal. See, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. And they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel WRATH.  What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?
L306990 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You can't prove anything.
L306989 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Salary. Unreported income.  By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road?
L306988 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Those are gifts.
L306987 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Arty Farty stuff.  Lithographs and pre Castro Cubans. Watches and mileage on private jets. Stuff, Miles. Stuff you get from grateful clients.
L306986 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What kind of "stuff?"
L306985 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ STUFF.  Got a light?
L306984 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ I'm not talking about dollars, studmuffin. I'm talking about --
L306983 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I'm clean with the IRS. I've reported every dollar I've ever made. Try again, girlfriend.
L306982 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting a refund.
L306981 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ I'm reporting you to the IRS.
L306980 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Are you threatening me, because I'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail.
L306979 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ I want to nail you ass.
L306978 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What do you want?
L306977 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Comfy!
L306976 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ On the contrary. We're married and we have no pre-nup, so a case could be made that everything in here is mine.
L306975 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I don't believe you have "things."
L306974 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ I'd just like to pick up a few of my things
L306973 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I don't know. Maybe I should grab my mace. I'm a civil attorney. I have little experience with "the criminal mind."
L306972 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ May I come in?
L306971 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail!
L306938 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I'm sorry, Darling. I love it. It's chic and timeless and elegant and eclectic and. It's you, Marylin. It is YOU.
L306937 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Miles? You're scaring me.
L306936 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Can you Marylin? Can you return the trust? Can you return the hopes? The dreams? Can you just...  SEND IT ALL BACK FOR STORE CREDIT?
L306935 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Miles. I have a very good relationship with all the salesmen. I can return everything.
L306934 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ What's wrong Miles? Did I spend too much?
L306933 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I love you. I want to have your baby.
L306932 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ You don't like me?
L306929 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I bet.
L306928 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ I have a surprise for you.
L306927 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Hello Marylin.
L306926 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Hi.
L306872 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I think a nursery should be right off the master suite. My parents put mine in the guest house. Apparently they did have a Fisher Price intercom, but my mother turned it off when I was seven months old because I was so --
L306871 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Miles.
L306870 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not right away -- There's a room right off the bedroom -- It would be perfect for a nursery.  It's a walk in humidor right now -- but if I took out the refrigeration unit --
L306869 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Fabric and fringe.
L306868 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Good.  Are those foods?
L306867 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Well, I suppose I could "girly" it up for you with a little Fortuny, and some passementerie --
L306866 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Here's my card. Spend as much as you want. We get mileage.
L306865 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I know. But I've converted most of them into ridiculous "Guy" rooms -- a billiard room, a card room, a gym -- Honey, want you to go out, as soon as you feel up to it -- and buy married things. Woman things. Personalize it. Marylinize it. Make this your house.
L306864 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Hardly. You have six bedrooms
L306863 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ In fact, this is not a married house -- it's a bachelor pad.
L306862 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Honey, I could sit...
L306861 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ No. Stay. I want you close to me. This couch is wrong. It's not a "married couch."
L306860 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ I'm sorry. I'm squishing you. I'll move to the...
L306834 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ I want this to be a marriage based on love, trust and community property. That's all I've ever wanted.
L306833 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ But?
L306830 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What I mean is, your wealth is completely protected.
L306829 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Oh Miles!
L306828 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ No. Judge -- just a sec. But Marylin, if we sign it, I can't hope to benefit from the marriage.
L306816 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yes. Short notice you know, but I think there's nice closure to it. Hello Judge Muson. A pleasure as always.
L306815 +++$+++ u1519 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MARYLIN +++$+++ Wasn't she the Judge at my divorce hearing?
L306780 +++$+++ u1520 +++$+++ m102 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I have a watch.
