L347962 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Bank teller's just a start. I got plans. Real plans. Not opening some Zoom-Boom Room. This time next year I'll be a loan officer.
L347961 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You're talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller.
L347960 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ At some point a man's got to get serious about his future. I'm sure you have no idea what I'm talking about.
L347959 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You gave up baseball to be a bank teller? I can't latch on to that.
L347958 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ The Negro League don't pay so good. And you're always on the road. That don't wash with Daisy.
L347957 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Why didn't you take it?
L347956 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ I didn't start out to be a bank teller. I was gonna be a ballplayer. Even had an offer to play short for the Newark Eagles.
L347955 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Hey, you'd be surprised what you find in other people's pockets. Just gotta avoid them deadbeat bank tellers. Get you every time.
L347954 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Well, maybe I should dig around in other people's clothes for money. It's obviously been highly successful for you.
L347953 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I don't know. Bank teller. Sounds like ladies work to me.
L347952 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ No, tell me what's so funny.
L347951 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Nothing.
L347950 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ What?
L347949 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Damn straight, it is. I got my own set of keys because I'm supposed to open up. So if I ain't there 8 a.m. Monday morning, there's gonna be hell to pay.
L347948 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ That's some long green.
L347947 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Well, if you must know, bank teller at First Federal of Manhattan. I'm responsible for keeping track of hundreds, occasionally thousands of dollars.
L347946 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Start your job? What kind of job?
L347945 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Look, man, I don't want friendly conversation. I don't want to be your friend. I've seen your friends and I don't like them. I just want to do this thing and get back to New York in time to start my job.
L347944 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Come on, daddy-o. You haven't said a word since we started. Least you could do is make some friendly conversation.
L347914 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ A thumb? What do you mean, like cut it off? For ten bucks?  That include the tip?
L347913 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You? Dine and ditch, right?  Over ten bucks?  You're probably looking at a thumb.
L347912 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ What are they gonna do to us?
L347911 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I can't wait to see that. You slay me, man.
L347910 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Good, I'm looking forward to meeting this Spanky. Give me a chance to straighten out this whole mess.
L347909 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Probably to Spanky's headquarters down at the pier.
L347908 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Where they taking us, anyway?
L347907 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Did those two muscle heads shake you down? Swear I've seen them down at the track with Sure-shot Riley. That's it, ain't it? A gambling debt.
L347906 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ I don't see where that's any of your business.
L347905 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What I want to know is what happened to your cush between the time that you got up from the table and when I caught up with you in the Johnny?
L347904 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Good old Monroe.
L347903 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Here, this belongs to you.  It was empty when I found it.
L347892 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ That's right! Good old Monroe...
L347891 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ You went to Monroe?
L347890 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Claude Banks. How could I forget that? You've got to remember me. Ray Gibson. We went to high school together.
L347889 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ Claude Banks.
L347888 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Sure I do. What's your name again?
L347887 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ I don't think so.
L347886 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Don't I know you?
L348166 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ I try to moisturize regularly.
L348165 +++$+++ u1819 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ JANGLE LEG +++$+++ Soft and supple. Like a lady's.
L348164 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ 'Preciate it. Claude.
L348163 +++$+++ u1819 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ JANGLE LEG +++$+++ Then you won't have no problem making the adjustment. You need anything, help of any kind, gimme a holler. Name's Jangle Leg.
L348162 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ You kidding? I've been in and out of prison my entire life. Mostly in. I'm hard-core.
L348161 +++$+++ u1819 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ JANGLE LEG +++$+++ You ever done time before?
L348160 +++$+++ u1811 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ CLAUDE +++$+++ I'm all right.
L348159 +++$+++ u1819 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ JANGLE LEG +++$+++ How you doin'?
L348339 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ No problem. Oh, boy!
L348338 +++$+++ u1812 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ COOKIE +++$+++ How about some steak sauce?
L348337 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Made just for you, Cookie.
L348336 +++$+++ u1812 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ COOKIE +++$+++ Ray, my man, this steak is like butter!
L348253 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Well, not yet. It's still in the planning stages.
L348252 +++$+++ u1812 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ COOKIE +++$+++ You got your own nightclub?
L348214 +++$+++ u1812 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ COOKIE +++$+++ Grandma Dodi's Pork Rib Joint.
L348213 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Alright, well, let's say you make it to Greenville. What's there, anyway?
L348199 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You killed Santa Claus?
L348198 +++$+++ u1812 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ COOKIE +++$+++ At least he didn't kill Santa Claus with his bare hands.
L348177 +++$+++ u1812 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ COOKIE +++$+++ Those are for trusties, unless you got thirty cents or two packs of cigs.
L348176 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there?
L348175 +++$+++ u1812 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ COOKIE +++$+++ Creamed chip beef on toast. Except we're outta beef, so I had to improvise.
L348174 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What is that?
L348537 +++$+++ u1817 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ HOPPIN' BOB +++$+++ You heard what the man said! Move it!
L348536 +++$+++ u1814 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ DILLARD +++$+++ Alright, listen up! I want every man lined up out here in the yard on the double! Let's move it!
L348469 +++$+++ u1814 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ DILLARD +++$+++ That's right. We don't need no fences, we have the gun line. It runs from shack to shack clear around the yard. You are now inside the gun line...
L348468 +++$+++ u1817 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ HOPPIN' BOB +++$+++ We don't need no fences at Camp 8, boss.
L348386 +++$+++ u1817 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ HOPPIN' BOB +++$+++ Movin' it out, boss.
L348385 +++$+++ u1814 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ DILLARD +++$+++ Move it out.
L348384 +++$+++ u1817 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ HOPPIN' BOB +++$+++ All in, boss!
L348293 +++$+++ u1817 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ HOPPIN' BOB +++$+++ You heard the boss! Let's move!
L348292 +++$+++ u1814 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ DILLARD +++$+++ We lost yesterday on accounta the rain. That means we gotta make up for it today, so put your backs to it.
L348143 +++$+++ u1814 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ DILLARD +++$+++ Life, huh? They step outta line again, we'll shorten up that sentence real fast.
L348142 +++$+++ u1817 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ HOPPIN' BOB +++$+++ Judge gave 'em the long ride.
L348141 +++$+++ u1814 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ DILLARD +++$+++ Looks like we got a couple of live ones. How long these boys in for?
L348139 +++$+++ u1814 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ DILLARD +++$+++ New York. That's up north, ain't it? They'll find we do things different down here.
L348138 +++$+++ u1817 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ HOPPIN' BOB +++$+++ He's from New York City. That one, too.
L348135 +++$+++ u1817 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ HOPPIN' BOB +++$+++ State of Mississippi wants this ditch cleared by sundown. You got that?!
L348134 +++$+++ u1814 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ DILLARD +++$+++ Tell him the state of Mississippi is only interested in getting this ditch cleared by sundown.
L348133 +++$+++ u1817 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ HOPPIN' BOB +++$+++ Listen up, jiggaboo! State of Mississippi ain't interested in your... in your...  metropolitan assets!
L348132 +++$+++ u1814 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ DILLARD +++$+++ Too hot, huh? Well, you tell that lazy jiggaboo the state of Mississippi ain't interested in his meteorological assessments.
L348129 +++$+++ u1817 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ HOPPIN' BOB +++$+++ Why ain't that pick swinging?
L348128 +++$+++ u1814 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ DILLARD +++$+++ Why ain't his pick swinging?
L348334 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ C'mon, Goldmouth, somebody's gotta watch the front door.
L348333 +++$+++ u1816 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ GOLDMOUTH +++$+++ Where am I at, man?
L348332 +++$+++ u1816 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ GOLDMOUTH +++$+++ Hey, Ray...
L348331 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ That's right, fellas. Catch any cab heading uptown. All the drivers know Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
L348327 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ He's a good friend of mine. Drops by the club whenever he's in town.
L348326 +++$+++ u1816 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ GOLDMOUTH +++$+++ You mean Louis Armstrong?
L348255 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Just because it's in my mind, Goldmouth, don't mean it ain't real. Everything worth anything starts with a dream.
L348254 +++$+++ u1816 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ GOLDMOUTH +++$+++ So it don't exist.
L348222 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ My corn bread? Oh no, my friend. I love corn bread.
L348221 +++$+++ u1816 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ GOLDMOUTH +++$+++ Maybe I oughta eat your corn bread.
L348824 +++$+++ u1820 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I think that old man lost his marbles about a hundred years ago. Come on, let's get this over with.
L348823 +++$+++ u1818 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ What do you think about that?
L348816 +++$+++ u1818 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Hell, no! I just got something in my eye.
L348815 +++$+++ u1820 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Man, you really bummed me out. That's a terrible story.  Nigger, you crying?
L348768 +++$+++ u1820 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ What happened to 'em after that, Willie?
L348767 +++$+++ u1818 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ That musta messed 'em up pretty bad.
L348763 +++$+++ u1818 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Oh, right. Well, why didn't they get those pardons?
L348762 +++$+++ u1820 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ No, they didn't get their pardons, you dumb shit! If they'd got their pardons way back then, we wouldn't be burying them today, would we?
L348761 +++$+++ u1818 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ So Ray and Claude got their pardons, right?
L347846 +++$+++ u1818 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I seen the bodies before they sealed 'em up. Them fellas sizzled up good. Looked like some shit from the X- Files.  Damn, that shit's nasty.
L347845 +++$+++ u1820 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Hell of a way to get out. Heard they burned up in that fire yesterday.
L347844 +++$+++ u1820 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Come on, old-timer, hook the brothers up.
L347843 +++$+++ u1818 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Hey, the dude's holdin'.
L348819 +++$+++ u1832 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ WILLIE +++$+++ Nothing to it, really. Claude figured they could steal a couple of bodies from the morgue. They got a couple of crackers working there don't know their asses from their elbows. Then they was gonna set fire to the infirmary and make it look like those bodies was them that got stuck inside. Claude figured during the commotion, it wouldn't be too hard to slip onto one of the fire trucks and hang tight until it rolled right on out of here in the morning.
L348818 +++$+++ u1820 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Hey, Willie, what was Claude's plan, anyway?
L348817 +++$+++ u1832 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ WILLIE +++$+++ It's alright for a man to cry once in awhile. Just don't make a habit of it.
L348766 +++$+++ u1832 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ WILLIE +++$+++ Of course nobody believed Ray and Claude.
L348765 +++$+++ u1820 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Just like Elvis.
L348764 +++$+++ u1832 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ WILLIE +++$+++ Old man Wilkins' never came out of that bathroom. Died right there on the crapper.
L347848 +++$+++ u1820 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ What were they, bootleggers?
L347847 +++$+++ u1832 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ WILLIE +++$+++ Ray's special recipe. He always had exacting standards where the hooch was concerned.
L347842 +++$+++ u1832 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ WILLIE +++$+++ Sixty-five years ago. They always said the farm couldn't hold 'em forever. Looks like you're finally free, boys.
L347841 +++$+++ u1820 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ 1932? That's like, that's like...
L347840 +++$+++ u1832 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ WILLIE +++$+++ I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.
L347839 +++$+++ u1820 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Why do I get the feeling when you say some time, you mean some time.
L348281 +++$+++ u1822 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ MAMA GIBSON +++$+++ I gave you life. And they can't take it away from you. Remember that. You'll get outta here someday. I believe that. You gotta believe it, too.
L348280 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ They gave me life, mama.
L348279 +++$+++ u1822 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ MAMA GIBSON +++$+++ Don't say that, Rayford. Don't ever say that. He gave up hope. That's where you gotta be different.
L348278 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I can't believe this. I always said I'd never end up like this. I thought I'd make something of myself, do something with my life. You know, be successful. Have a big house, a family. Now I'm gonna end up just like daddy.
L348277 +++$+++ u1822 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ MAMA GIBSON +++$+++ Don't argue with me. You need it more than I do. I know how a little money can help in a place like this.
L348276 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I can't take that, mama.
L348275 +++$+++ u1822 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ MAMA GIBSON +++$+++ Don't you lie to me, Rayford.  You still have your daddy's watch?  Well, this is all I can give you. I wish it was more.
L348274 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Don't cry, mama. This place ain't so bad as it looks. Sure, we work hard, but there's plenty fresh air and sunshine... And you know something else, I've taken to going to church regular. They got services every Sunday right there in the mess hall.
L348273 +++$+++ u1822 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ MAMA GIBSON +++$+++ Rayford, I wanted so much more for you than this.
L348261 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Don't worry about that. Hey, fellas, this here is my mama. These are some of my friends. That's Willie, there's Poker Face, Radio, Cookie, Goldmouth, Biscuit, Jangle Leg.
L348260 +++$+++ u1822 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ MAMA GIBSON +++$+++ I heard some things so I went to see Spanky Johnson. He told me what happened and gave me some money to get down here. What happened to your face?
L348259 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What are you doing here, mama?
L348258 +++$+++ u1822 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ MAMA GIBSON +++$+++ Rayford!
L348257 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Mama?
L348810 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I'm going in for him. He'd do the same for me.
L348809 +++$+++ u1823 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ NURSE HUMPHRIES +++$+++ You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it!
L348808 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ It'll be too late.
L348807 +++$+++ u1823 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ NURSE HUMPHRIES +++$+++ Wait for the firemen!
L348806 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ He must still be in there.
L348805 +++$+++ u1823 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ NURSE HUMPHRIES +++$+++ Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him. Claude! Has anyone seen Claude?
L348804 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Hey, where's Claude? I don't see Claude!
L348803 +++$+++ u1823 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ NURSE HUMPHRIES +++$+++ Is everyone here?
L348741 +++$+++ u1824 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ What difference does it make? Natchez was better off without Winston Hancock! Who cares if a couple of no- account bootleggers went to jail for his killing? At least the state of Mississippi got 40 years of cheap labor out of the deal!
L348740 +++$+++ u1831 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ WILKINS +++$+++ Is there any truth to what he's saying, Pike?
L348736 +++$+++ u1831 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ WILKINS +++$+++ Do you realize what your saying, Gibson?
L348735 +++$+++ u1824 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ He's crazy. Don't listen to him, Wilkins.
L348727 +++$+++ u1824 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ I'm afraid I'm gonna have to teach this uppity nigger a lesson in manners.
L348726 +++$+++ u1831 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ WILKINS +++$+++ What's going on here?
L348714 +++$+++ u1831 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ WILKINS +++$+++ If somebody deserves respect, Mr. Pike, they receive it from me, convict or no convict.
L348713 +++$+++ u1824 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.
L348712 +++$+++ u1831 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ WILKINS +++$+++ I believe in treating the convicts with respect, if that's what you mean.
L348711 +++$+++ u1824 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ If you don't mind my saying, you seem mighty familiar with your house boy.
L348708 +++$+++ u1831 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ WILKINS +++$+++ Thank you, Claude. That'll be all for tonight.
L348707 +++$+++ u1824 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ You don't have to twist my arm.  Say now, that gumbo has quite a kick.
L348706 +++$+++ u1831 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ WILKINS +++$+++ Hunting's been pretty good on the farm the last few years. It's one of the perks of the job. If you're interested, tomorrow I could show you some of my favorite spots.
L348705 +++$+++ u1824 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Well, fortunately, I carry my own.
L348704 +++$+++ u1831 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ WILKINS +++$+++ I'm sorry, I don't keep any liquor in the house.
L348703 +++$+++ u1824 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ I prefer bourbon.
L348702 +++$+++ u1831 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ WILKINS +++$+++ Lemonade?
L348739 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ He shoots me, I swear I'll take you with me! I just want to hear you say it.
L348738 +++$+++ u1824 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Goddamn it, Wilkins, would you please just shoot the nigger!
L348737 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ That watch was the only thing my daddy ever gave me. It meant the world to me.
L348732 +++$+++ u1824 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Shoot him, Wilkins!
L348731 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I'm gonna work this man's brains out the back of his head.
L348725 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Like you shot Winston Hancock?
L348724 +++$+++ u1824 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ I oughta shoot you for that comment, boy.
L348723 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ She give you that scar, too?
L348722 +++$+++ u1824 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Something like that, yes.
L348721 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Must have been some time ago. Maybe forty years?
L348720 +++$+++ u1824 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Why, my wife gave it to me on our anniversary some years back.
L348719 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it?
L348718 +++$+++ u1824 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Yeah, it's special. They don't make 'em like this anymore.
L348717 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ That's a real nice watch you got there, sir. Fancy old thing even plays a little tune.
L348716 +++$+++ u1824 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Yeah, it's getting late. I could sure use a bath.
L348107 +++$+++ u1824 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ You may be able to buy your way out of trouble up in New York City, but down here we take murder seriously.
L348106 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice.
L348105 +++$+++ u1824 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Are you offering me a bribe?
L348104 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Mr. Johnson is very well connected. If you were to let us go, I guarantee he would show you his appreciation, if you know what I mean.
L348101 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Excuse me, sheriff. As we explained to your associate here, there's been a mistake. We didn't kill anybody. Now, as for the bootlegging, we happen to work for a very important man in New York.
L348100 +++$+++ u1824 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Besides, why bother with bootlegging when we got us a clear cut case of murder?
L348325 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Satchmo.
L348324 +++$+++ u1825 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ POKER FACE +++$+++ Who?
L348247 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ They're called subways. A nickel will take you from one end of Manhattan to the other. Helluva ride, too.
L348246 +++$+++ u1825 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ POKER FACE +++$+++ Hey, Ray, Goldmouth don't believe me. Ain't it so they got trains up in New York City that run under the streets?
L348158 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Anybody else need anything read?
L348157 +++$+++ u1825 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ POKER FACE +++$+++ Appreciate it.
L348154 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ No, it says Marleen here.
L348153 +++$+++ u1825 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ POKER FACE +++$+++ Jenny?
L348152 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Apparently, your sister died.

L348320 +++$+++ u1826 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RADIO +++$+++ That's it. The Boom-Boom Room. Sure would like to see that place when you get it up and running.
L348319 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You mean the Boom-Boom Room?
L348318 +++$+++ u1826 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RADIO +++$+++ Hey, Ray, what's the name of that nightclub of yours?
L348249 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Sure I've been to the Cotton Club. It's pretty sweet. But it don't hold a candle to the Boom Boom Room. That's where the real action is.
L348248 +++$+++ u1826 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RADIO +++$+++ Hey, Ray, you ever been to the Cotton Club?
L348210 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Greenville, that the nearest town?

L348605 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Alright Willie, I think I got everything. I'll talk to Dillard, see if I can get up to the infirmary and check up on you. Make sure they're changing your diapers regular.
L348323 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I'm talking about old Satchmo nearly blew the roof off the joint.
L348322 +++$+++ u1832 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ WILLIE +++$+++ Last night? What are you talking about, Ray?
L348251 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ That's my joint. The swinginest nightclub in town.
L348250 +++$+++ u1832 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ WILLIE +++$+++ What's the Boom Boom Room?
