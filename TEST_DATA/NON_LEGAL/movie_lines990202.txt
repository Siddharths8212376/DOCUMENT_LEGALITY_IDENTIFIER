L443587 +++$+++ u7069 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ LUCIUS +++$+++ He wouldn't leave her.
L443586 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ I told you not to bring the other one.
L443446 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ At the very least, this man has the right to know whether there's a charge against him.
L443445 +++$+++ u7070 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ MAXIMUS +++$+++ And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
L443444 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
L443443 +++$+++ u7070 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ MAXIMUS +++$+++ You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here.
L443383 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ We're -- conducting a new experiment.
L443382 +++$+++ u7070 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ MAXIMUS +++$+++ Why special?
L443381 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ Yes, Sir. But this -- creature is a special case.
L443380 +++$+++ u7070 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ MAXIMUS +++$+++ I know it's a man. And you know the rules. No animals outside the compound, and most certainly not without a leash.
L443379 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ A man, Dr. Maximus.
L443378 +++$+++ u7070 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ MAXIMUS +++$+++ What is that?
L443514 +++$+++ u7071 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Bailiff! Stop this outburst! Gag that monstrosity!
L443513 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ You destroyed his memory! His mind! His identity! And, you want to do the same to me!
L443494 +++$+++ u7071 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Dr. Zira! Silence that man!
L443493 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ One is in a museum!
L443462 +++$+++ u7071 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Bailiff! Make the animal be quiet.
L443461 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story...
L443460 +++$+++ u7071 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ It says here that his name is Bright Eyes. You gave him that name yourself.
L443459 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ My name is Taylor.
L443458 +++$+++ u7071 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down.
L443532 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ Sustain all objections, but face the truth!
L443531 +++$+++ u7071 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Sustained.
L443526 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ Let us assume, as common sense dictates, that the prisoner's story is false. But if he does not come from another planet, then surely he sprang from our own. Yes, sprang.  As an animal psychologist, I have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute.
L443525 +++$+++ u7071 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ How so?
L443485 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man?
L443484 +++$+++ u7071 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ This is a joke in very poor taste.
L443483 +++$+++ u7071 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Stop right there. Bring me that paper.
L443482 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ 'I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. I am an explorer in space, with no hostile intentions against your civilization. On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal, while the apes remained..."
L443481 +++$+++ u7071 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Read it yourself.
L443480 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ Since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense, he asks that this statement be read into the record.
L443471 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ Did we create his mind too? Not only can this man speak. He can write. He can reason.
L443470 +++$+++ u7071 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Mind your tongue, madame.
L443469 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ That’s a lie!
L443454 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ Then why is he called the accused Your Honors must think him guilty of something.
L443453 +++$+++ u7071 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Sustained. In all fairness, Dr. Zira, you must admit the accused is a nonape, and therefore has no rights under ape law.
L443442 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ By your leave, Mr. President -- the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry.
L443441 +++$+++ u7071 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential, and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the Tribunal.  You may proceed, Dr. Honorius.
L443790 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ Don't look for it, Taylor. You may not like what you find.
L443789 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ We're back at the beginning. I still don't know the why. A planet where apes evolved from men. A world turned wrong side up. A puzzle with one piece missing.
L443788 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise. Your breed made a desert of it, ages ago.
L443787 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ What evidence? No weapons were found in the cave.
L443786 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself.
L443785 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Why? From the first, I've terrified you, Doctor. And in spite of every sign that I'm an intelligent being who means no harm, you continue to hate and fear me. Why?
L443769 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ No, thanks. I'll take freedom.
L443768 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
L443767 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Sure.	In a cage.
L443766 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ Of course, you could return with us. Our society might find a place for you and your mate.
L443765 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Then there is another jungle?
L443753 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ He might have been wiped out by a plague. Natural catastrophe. Like a fiery storm of meteors. From the looks of this part of your planet, I'd say that was a fair bet.
L443752 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ Then answer this: If ran was superior, why didn't he survive?
L443729 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ Cease fire! Withdraw!
L443728 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Tell him to pull back!
L443723 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ That's lunacy. I can give an alternate description for everyone of those objects that's equally as inventive as yours. But it would be conjecture, not proof.
L443722 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ I don't say he was a man like an Earthman, but I'd call him a close relative, for he was plagued by most of man's ills.  Yet, fragile as he was, he came before you -- and was superior to you.
L443691 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Okay.Up to the cave.
L443690 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ Of course.
L443689 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?
L443688 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ Twelve hundred years ago.
L443687 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
L443686 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ What is your proposal?
L443683 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ All right, let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test.
L443682 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ There is no contradiction between faith and science. True science.
L443667 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ Don't be a fool. You're outnumbered and outgunned.
L443666 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Stop right there.
L443566 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ You're a menace! A walking pestilence. I do know who you are, Taylor. As I know that others of your kind must live in the Forbidden Zone.  You have just six hours to make a full confession. After that I'll employ surgery to obtain one.  Guards!
L443565 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?
L443564 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity.
L443563 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ I don't know.
L443562 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.  The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.  Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?
L443561 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
L443560 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?
L443559 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Then you admit --
L443558 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --
L443557 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?
L443556 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ Of course.
L443555 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ That's exactly what Zira and Cornelius claim. You're talking heresy, doctor.
L443554 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ Certainly not.	You're a mutant.
L443553 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira.
L443552 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?
L443551 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ What about it?
L443550 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ Then how is it we speak the same language?  Even in your lies, some truth slips through! That mythical community you're supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'?
L443549 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ My tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system.
L443548 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ You lied. Where is your tribe?
L443547 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
L443546 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ However, it's within my power to grant You a reprieve.  That is why I summoned you here tonight.  Tell me who and what you really are and where you come from, and no veterinary will touch you.
L443545 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ Emasculation, to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a kind of living death.
L443544 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ No.
L443543 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ Oh, your case was preordained. In a way, you performed a service for the State ...  Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.  And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. Do you know what that means?
L443542 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ What about me?
L443505 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ Identify him, then. Speak to him.
L443504 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ With one of them.
L443503 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ Well...do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?
L443778 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ God bless you.
L443777 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ Go with God, Taylor.  That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man.
L443776 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ All right, but....  ...you're so damned ugly!
L443775 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Dr. Zira, I'd like to kiss you good-bye.
L443772 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ It's better than going to prison for heresy.
L443771 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ We can't.
L443770 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Would you like to come along?
L443749 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? Didn't you lead me around on a leash?
L443748 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ It's humiliating.
L443747 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Why not?
L443746 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ Taylor, please -- don't treat him that way.
L443742 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ Taylor, you can't.
L443741 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave here alive.
L443710 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ He has a point. On my planet children often play with ape dolls.
L443709 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ Taylor! Tell him.
L443681 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Except that he's also the Chief Defender of the Faith.
L443680 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ Taylor, please --
L443679 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ And that's your Minister of Science. Honor- bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge.
L443655 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ She's not sick at all.  She's pregnant.
L443654 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ What's the diagnosis, doctor? A touch of the sun?
L443637 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ You threw us together, remember? And you guessed right. Men, like apes, get despondent without a mate.
L443636 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ You want her that much?
L443635 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Maybe not.
L443634 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
L443633 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Yes.
L443632 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ Are you going to take her with you?
L443619 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ You're going back to the Forbidden Zone?
L443618 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy. Unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal.
L443590 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this. Remember that men all look alike to most apes.
L443589 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Listen-
L443510 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ You did this to him! You've removed his frontal lobes!
L443509 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.
L443508 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ You! ... You knew about this?
L443502 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Second from the left.
L443501 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ Which one?
L443500 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ It's him...Landon.
L443436 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ A hearing.
L443435 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ What is this?
L443434 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ Shhhh!
L443433 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Where have you been? Why didn't you come to see me?
L443281 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ Dr. Zaius, I could have sworn he was answering you!
L443280 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ I'm not acting! I can talk! How much proof do you want?
L443278 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ There! Can you believe it? I looks like he's talking.
L443277 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!
L443276 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ Speak! Go on.	Speak again.
L443259 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Listen, listen -- I can speak --
L443258 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat feeling better?
L443799 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ In a few minutes there will be no doll. There can't be.  I'm sorry.
L443798 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ But the proof? The doll?
L443764 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ He won't survive.  Do you know what sort of life awaits you out there, Taylor? That of an animal. If you aren't eventually hunted down and killed by apes, some jungle beast will devour you.
L443763 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ But suppose you find nothing but a wasteland. How will you survive?
L443706 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ What?
L443705 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ But there's the doll, sir.
L443704 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ Secondly, if these 'tools' as you call them, are unidentified, why are they introduced as 'evidence' of anything?
L443524 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
L443523 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.
L443497 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ Mr. President, I believe the Prosecutor has reassembled all he surviving humans captured in the hunt along with Bright Eyes.
L443496 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ He doesn't know.
L443495 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ How sad. Stuffed and mounted, eh? Dead men, like sunken ships, can tell no stories. And his other companion?
L443492 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ Where are they now?
L443491 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ This is his assertion.
L443490 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?  You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.
L443489 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ Like you, I find it difficult.
L443488 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ Do you believe him?
L443487 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does.
L443486 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ Dr. Zira -- you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert.
L443385 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ Yes, Sir.
L443384 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ Wouldn't it more properly be done in your office?
L443288 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ But perhaps he understood --
L443287 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ Of course. He saw you moving yours.
L443286 +++$+++ u7074 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZIRA +++$+++ He's moving his fingers!
L446133 +++$+++ u7078 +++$+++ m474 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ KILL YOU MOTHERFUCKER!!!
L446132 +++$+++ u7075 +++$+++ m474 +++$+++ BARNES +++$+++ I SHIT on all o' you.
L446101 +++$+++ u7075 +++$+++ m474 +++$+++ BARNES +++$+++ Yeah. Back about 100 metres. He's dead, now get going, the gooks are all over the fuckin' place.
L446100 +++$+++ u7078 +++$+++ m474 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ He's dead! Where?... You saw him?
L446099 +++$+++ u7075 +++$+++ m474 +++$+++ BARNES +++$+++ Elias is dead. Join up with the platoon. Move it.
L446096 +++$+++ u7075 +++$+++ m474 +++$+++ BARNES +++$+++ I'll get him. You get the man in, Taylor  NOW. Or I'll Article 15 both your asses. Move!
