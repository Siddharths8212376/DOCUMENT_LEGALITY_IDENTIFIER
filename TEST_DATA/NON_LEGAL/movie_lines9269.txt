L392861 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ I do *not* want a Senator. And I do *not* want any more of this nonsense! Emma!
L392843 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ For instance, how to run the affairs of government? No doubt my children could make this appointment *for* me-- with the greatest ease!
L392842 +++$+++ u2135 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Nonsense. Why don't you listen to your children for a change? You might actually learn something?
L392832 +++$+++ u2135 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Nonsense.
L392831 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ Really, my dear--I don't feel like a thing.
L392830 +++$+++ u2135 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ We're waiting, Hubert.
L392829 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ I'll bear that in mind... What? Oh. Dinner. Pet--my stomach couldn't hold a bird seed.
L392828 +++$+++ u2135 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Dinner, Hubert.
L392765 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ Now, pet--  Jim!
L392764 +++$+++ u2135 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Save that for the laying of cornerstones, Hubert!  Oh, that morning you looked in the mirror and saw a statesman!
L392763 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ Now, now, Emma, dear--you mustn't forget we have been chosen by the people of this commonwealth to--
L392762 +++$+++ u2135 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ This isn't a home, it's the crossroads of the world!
L392761 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ No, no--believe me, pet--this is *most* urgent--  Hello, hello. Is Taylor there?-- Governor Hopper. Quickly, please--
L392760 +++$+++ u2135 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Can't that wait, Hubert?
L392759 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ Taylor, my dear.
L392758 +++$+++ u2135 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Whom are you calling--in the dead of night?
L392757 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ Of all the times! Of all the times! Two months to the end of his term-- and Foley has to go and die on us--
L392756 +++$+++ u2135 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Great saints!
L392755 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ Sam Foley--dead!
L392754 +++$+++ u2135 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ What is it?
L392753 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ Yes, Joe, yes--right away. 
L392751 +++$+++ u2135 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ What is it?
L392750 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ Yes, yes--phone, phone--  A--an outrage, pet--an outrage--I'll look into this--  Hello--Joe!--What!--No! Not really! Terrible!
L392749 +++$+++ u2135 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ That infernal phone!
L392748 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ Wha--? Yes, sweetheart-- Wha--?
L392747 +++$+++ u2135 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ I knew it! I knew a night's rest wasn't possible in this house!  Hubert!
L393030 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Oh! Go away.
L393029 +++$+++ u2136 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ GRIFFITH +++$+++ Your name's spreading like wild-fire out here--you are the winterbook favorite to get on the National ticket.
L393028 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ All right, why?
L393027 +++$+++ u2136 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ GRIFFITH +++$+++ How do you feel, champ?
L393026 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Fine. The first thing to do is-- present Mr. Smith to the press--in the *right* way. Hurry him along, Bill.
L393025 +++$+++ u2136 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ GRIFFITH +++$+++ Yup--Sweeney, Flood, Farrell--waiting for you--
L393024 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Good. Are the newspaper men at the hotel?
L393023 +++$+++ u2136 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ GRIFFITH +++$+++ All set. Foley's rooms in the Senate office building--nice, big clean desk--lot of Senator stationery to write his little boys on--and Foley's secretary, Saunders, to make it look like the real thing--
L393022 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Are you ready for him, Bill?
L392947 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ He's the hero of fifty thousand boys and a hundred thousand parents. Look at these congratulations pouring in! I tell you, gentlemen, by this one statesman-like act, I have--
L392946 +++$+++ u2141 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MCGANN +++$+++ Oh--oh.
L392943 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ Listen--the simpleton of all time--a big-eyed patriot--knows Washington and Lincoln by heart--stood at attention in the Governor's presence-- collects stray boys and cats--
L392942 +++$+++ u2141 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MCGANN +++$+++ He's batty!
L392804 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ Jim--if I fling a party man like Horace in the face of those angry committees--
L392803 +++$+++ u2141 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MCGANN +++$+++ Terrific! A born stooge! Horace'll perform like a trained seal.
L392781 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ Washington! Always discussing the problems of Washington. Nobody ever thinks of the State--and my problems!  I *will* tell Jim Taylor. It's high *time* I told him a thing or two! 
L392780 +++$+++ u2141 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MCGANN +++$+++ *You* tell Jim Taylor.
L392779 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ I *can't* wait, McGann! You go into that room and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine that I give them *one more minute*--
L392778 +++$+++ u2141 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MCGANN +++$+++ Relax, Happy. Jim said to wait.
L392777 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ Yes, yes--tell them I'll see them immediately--immediately!  I can't hold them off! They want something to say about this appointment. Ten to one they've got a man.
L393755 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ I doubt it! Come on, Ken.
L393754 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ Y-yes, Jim.
L393753 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ You couldn't understand! Listen, Ten Thumbs, I'll be on my way to Washington in half an hour. Whatever happens, I'm all ready for this Ranger of yours. Never mind how. You'll get your instructions from Ken Allen here. It isn't anything you have to do. I wouldn't trust you to lick a stamp. Allen'll do it himself. You just use your *high office* to help him get it done. Understand?
L393752 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ Me! Jim--how--?
L393751 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Yes! He's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens--and *you with it*, Mr. Governor!
L393750 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ Will you please tell me *exactly* what he's done?
L393749 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Boy Ranger! The answer to a prayer. Manna from heaven! Didn't know the time of day--!
L392951 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ Oh--Jim!
L392950 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ *But you never asked me*!
L392949 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--
L392948 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ But you went ahead and made this appointment without asking me--
L392945 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ Joe--*you* know what I'm talking about. The perfect man. Never in politics in his life. Wouldn't find out what it's all about in two *years*, lets alone two months. But the important thing--and this was the genius of the stroke--*it means votes*!
L392944 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ What!
L392941 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ Jim--the answer to a prayer--manna from heaven--the man *we want*--and the votes *we need*--
L392940 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ --a *boy ranger* a squirrel chaser-- to the United States Senate!
L392821 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ *Your* political future! I bought it for you and made you a present. And I can grab it back so fast it'll make your head spin. You got a nerve to stand there and worry about just *your future* when we're in this spot!  The man is--*Miller*.
L392820 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ I *won't* let you stand there callously and perhaps wreck my whole political future!
L392819 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ *You won't?*
L392818 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ I *won't* send Horace Miller!
L392817 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ I said forget 'em! Horace Miller goes to the Senate--and that settles it!
L392816 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ Jim, that bunch is out for blood. If I throw Horace in their teeth now--
L392815 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ We can't help *what* they were! Forget 'em!
L392814 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ I--I couldn't, Jim. Those men were--
L392813 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ *Henry Hill?* That crackpot? That long-haired--! Why, you should have killed that so fast--!
L392812 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ Henry Hill.
L392811 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ They put up *their* candidate? Who?
L392806 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ Now, wait fellows--great Heavens. I've got to see those angry committees first--feel them out a little--work for harmony--harmony.
L392805 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Happy, for reasons there isn't time to go into--it's got to be Miller! We've given you the man. Now write the ticket.  Come on, Joe. Come on, Chick.
L392802 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ Horace Mill--!
L392801 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Happy, we've got the man. Horace Miller!
L392800 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ One minute! Just one minute!
L392784 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ Yes, Jim.
L392783 +++$+++ u2151 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ You'll see those committees when we're finished!
L392782 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ Look here, Jim--if you and Joe are going to gab about this appointment *any* longer, I'm going ahead and see those committees!
L392934 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ I said, sir--in my official capacity-- as an honorary gesture--I appoint you to the United States Senate!
L392933 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ What were you saying, Governor? Sorry.
L392931 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Just get one hand against each ear there--keep his face straight up.
L392930 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ The--head?
L392929 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Thanks, Governor--*yes*! Do you mind? His head--Ma'll take the tail.
L392926 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Ma! Hold him!
L392925 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ --And it is in my power to confer a very signal honor upon you. In my official capacity, therefore, I--
L392924 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Aw--
L392923 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ Well--yes--I was saying--the State should reward you--
L392904 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ No doubt. No doubt. And this fine little paper--"Boy Stuff"--with, I dare say, an *enormous* circulation in the State.
L392903 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Well--that's not work, sir--that's fun.
L392902 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ No. No. A signal service to the State. Yes, indeed. And not only that but-- uh--I've heard of your excellent work in leading and guiding our youth--
L392901 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Oh, now, I'm afraid that's been exaggerated some--
L392900 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ Not at all. I've come to pay you a personal and official--and I might say--a *tardy* tribute, Mr. Smith, for your recent heroic conduct.
L392899 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ This--this is a great honor, sir. I-- I--
L392898 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ Now--now--please--that's quite all right. Relax, boys--
L392866 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ Peter, I'm in no mood to hear childish prattle!
L392865 +++$+++ u2145 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ "Boy Stuff." That's the name of Jeff's magazine. He prints it.  Look--here's one--oh, it's great-- *everybody* reads it--all the kids in the State--a million of 'em. Look, Pop--let me read you a--
L392857 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ Himself!
L392856 +++$+++ u2145 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Well, Jeff put that out himself.
L392855 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ I did. What about it?
L392851 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ Oh, a *boy*!
L392850 +++$+++ u2145 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Gosh, Pop--head of the Boy Rangers!
L392834 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ Is *what* getting me down?
L392833 +++$+++ u2145 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What's the matter, Dad? Is it getting you down?
L393837 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ Emma!
L393836 +++$+++ u2143 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ A dirty frame!
L392872 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ Emma! Will you *please*--?
L392871 +++$+++ u2143 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ Jeff for Senator.
L392870 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ Than what?
L392869 +++$+++ u2143 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ No, *sir*! You couldn't do better, Dad.
L392864 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ What stuff?
L392863 +++$+++ u2143 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ OTIS +++$+++ He's the greatest *American* we got, too, Dad. Can tell what George Washington said--by heart. An' "Boy Stuff's" got the swellest stuff in it.
L392928 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ Uh--could--could I help--?
L392927 +++$+++ u2140 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ I just can't, son--not the head and tail both!
L392918 +++$+++ u2140 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Well, it sort of got to be--from Jeff just pullin' splinters and things--
L392917 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ A pet shop?
L392914 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ Why, of course.
L392913 +++$+++ u2140 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Maybe you'd like to come along and watch, Governor? Jefferson's done a wonderful job with that leg.
L392906 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ Excellent! Excellent! My boy, I'm convinced our State has a great debt of gratitude to you--
L392905 +++$+++ u2140 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Well--it started with a little mimeograph sheet--and it's just grown out of all sense and reason--
L392893 +++$+++ u2140 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Certainly. Step right in.
L392892 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ Is--uh--Jefferson Smith at home?
L392891 +++$+++ u2140 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ Yes. Come in.
L392890 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ Uh--Jefferson Smith's residence?
L392889 +++$+++ u2140 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MA +++$+++ I *thought* I heard... Yes?
L394041 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ When Jeff gets through with Taylor--  Quiet! What do you mean by breaking in here--? Get out! Get *out* of here!
L394040 +++$+++ u2139 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JIMMIE +++$+++ When Jeff gets through with Taylor, Pop--
L392845 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ I beg your pardon?
L392844 +++$+++ u2139 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JIMMIE +++$+++ That's easy. Jefferson Smith.
L392841 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ Emma! I will not have conversations of this sort carried on by the children at dinner!
L392840 +++$+++ u2139 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JIMMIE +++$+++ Well, he's still running the show, ain't he, Dad?
L392839 +++$+++ u2137 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ HUBERT +++$+++ Taylor! May I ask what *Taylor* has to do with it?
L392838 +++$+++ u2139 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JIMMIE +++$+++ Gee, I wouldn't appoint an old twerp like Horace Miller--Taylor or no Taylor!
L393744 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Saunders said--this whole thing was *his* idea to get graft--!
L393743 +++$+++ u2141 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MCGANN +++$+++ What makes you think he's got *anything* to do with it?
L393742 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ He's a newspaper publisher I know-- and--
L393395 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Oh, I couldn't tonight. Thanks a lot.
L393394 +++$+++ u2141 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MCGANN +++$+++ Uh--Senator--I thought you and me might go out to dinner together--and grab off a few monuments.
L393393 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ You have?  Will you come in a minute, Miss Saunders.
L393392 +++$+++ u2141 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MCGANN +++$+++ H'ya, Senator. I--I've sorta been looking for you--
L393391 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ You should hear our Ranger Band rattle that off--if you want to *hear* something! Good evening, Miss Saunders. Good evening Mister McGann.
L393033 +++$+++ u2141 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MCGANN +++$+++ What? Who?
L393032 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Look! There it is!
L393031 +++$+++ u2141 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MCGANN +++$+++ All right, Senator--let's get these bags and the livestock together--
L392990 +++$+++ u2141 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MCGANN +++$+++ Well, that ends that crisis. This way, Senator.
L392989 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Here they are--I got them. They are all right.
L392986 +++$+++ u2141 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MCGANN +++$+++ Boy! My head's like a balloon--for two whole days. I never knew there was so much American history.
L392985 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Just a minute, I better make sure.
L392984 +++$+++ u2141 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MCGANN +++$+++ The porter's got them. They're coming.
L392983 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ My pigeons--I better see about my pigeons.
L392982 +++$+++ u2141 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ MCGANN +++$+++ Yeah, for the fifth time, Senator-- Washington.
L392981 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Washington!
L394108 +++$+++ u2148 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SENATOR +++$+++ In view of the gentleman's touching concern for the Senators, would he permit a motion to recess until the morning--at which time he could continue to educate this august body with his profound babblings?
L394107 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ I yield.
L394106 +++$+++ u2148 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SENATOR +++$+++ Will the Senator yield for a question?
L394020 +++$+++ u2148 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SENATOR +++$+++ Is he fully aware that this bill has been months in both Houses--delayed and delayed--millions will be without food and shelter until its passage-- public works to relieve unemployment will be at a standstill--government agencies will be forced to suspend-- ?
L394019 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ For one week!
L394018 +++$+++ u2148 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SENATOR +++$+++ Has the gentleman the effrontery-- standing there convicted and in disgrace--to try to force the postponement of that bill--?
L394017 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ For a question!
L394016 +++$+++ u2148 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SENATOR +++$+++ Will the Senator yield?
L393963 +++$+++ u2148 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SENATOR +++$+++ I am about to ask for a roll call on the passage of the Resolution--without further delay. The Senator can have nothing to say at this time that would not be either in bad grace or--
L393962 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ I addressed the Chair first, sir!
L393961 +++$+++ u2148 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SENATOR +++$+++ Mr. President!
L393960 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Mr. President!
L393861 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ To--to a reception--uh--for a princess-- I forget her name--
L393860 +++$+++ u2148 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ SENATOR +++$+++ Where were you?
L394185 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ I say it's *your* parade, sir! You've *got* to come!
L394184 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ No, Jeff--please--!
L394183 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Please, sir!--come with me!
L394164 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Mr. President, have I permission to bring into this Chamber evidence of the response from my State?
L394163 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Yes, sir, you bet I would.
L394161 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ The gentleman has said repeatedly that he is speaking to the people of his State. He has been waiting, as he so fancifully puts it, for them to come marching here in droves. Would the gentleman be interested in knowing what those people have to say?
L394160 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Yes, sir, I yield for a question.
L394003 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ I *did* see Taylor! And I was in that room!
L394002 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Mr. President--I did not say that Senator Paine was one of those Congressmen I saw. If the chair please, I will deny that Senator Paine *saw* Taylor or even knows him--
L394001 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ He has imputed to me conduct unworthy a Senator--and I demand he be made to yield the floor--!
L394000 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Mr. President--
L393997 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Mr. President--
L393996 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Mr. President! A point of order!
L393995 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ I will not yield, sir! This same man-- Mister Taylor--came here to offer me a place in this Senate for twenty years, if I would vote for a dam that he knew and *I* knew was a *fraud*! But if I opened my mouth against it, he promised to break me in two! And I stood here one day and tried--I *started* to open my mouth-- and it all came to pass. The long, powerful arm of Mister James Taylor reached right into this sacred chamber and took me by the scruff of the neck--
L393994 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Will the Senator--
L393990 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ The committee ruled otherwise! The gentleman stands guilty as charged. And I believe I speak for all the members when I say that no one cares to hear what a man of his condemned character has to say about *any* section of *any* legislation before this house!
L393989 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ I have no defense against forged papers and--
L393988 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ I wish to ask the gentleman--has he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give--and *could* not give at that same hearing?
L393987 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Mr. President--
L393986 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Every *aspect* of this matter--the gentleman's attack on that section-- everything--was dealt with in the committee hearing--
L393985 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ It does!
L393984 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Does my colleague's piece concern Section Forty of the bill--a dam on Willet Creek?
L393983 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ For a *question*.
L393982 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Will he *yield*?
L393981 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Ah, now, that's better.
L393980 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Will he yield for a question?
L393979 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Yield *how*, sir?
L393827 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Mr. President--gentlemen--I--I have risen to a painful duty--to say that, out of evidence that has come to my attention, I consider Senator Smith unworthy to address this body!
L393826 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Y-yes.
L393741 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ Yes--the *benefits*! What's a man called Taylor got to do with this?
L393740 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Jeff! You're trying to understand in a moment everything about a project that took two years to set up--the reasons--the benefits--
L393739 +++$+++ u2138 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ JEFFERSON +++$+++ But--there are a hundred other places in the state that *need* the water. Besides--I talked to Kenneth Allen, who owns some of that land--and he didn't say anything about a dam. No-- I'm sure, sir--there's something wrong--and I--I won't vote on this thing until I get a lot of questions answered--
L393738 +++$+++ u2144 +++$+++ m139 +++$+++ PAINE +++$+++ Jeff--listen--this was all taken up in the State Legislature and approved-- they're going to divert waters from up above--
