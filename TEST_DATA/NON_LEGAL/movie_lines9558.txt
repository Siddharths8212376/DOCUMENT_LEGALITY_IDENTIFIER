L49869 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ We've got another two hours of daylight.
L49868 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Let's camp.  There's grayling under this ice. I'll snare some for dinner.
L49867 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ It wasn't my idea to crash the plane.
L49866 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Most dangerous thing in the world: A regular Joe, in over his head.  You trying to prove how tough you are for me, or for yourself?
L49863 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ I'm right behind you.
L49862 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Be my guest.
L49861 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ I've been on ice like this when I was a kid, skating.  Spread your weight, keep moving.  Go on.
L49860 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ We get wet, we freeze to death in a couple hours.
L49859 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ We're not sitting here 'til November.  There's a cargo plane coming to Devil's Cauldron in four days, and I'm putting you on it.
L49858 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Ice is too thin -- you can see the water moving underneath.
L49857 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ -- Turn around.
L49856 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Still quite a hike to Devil's Cauldron.  Days.  A long stretch to go without sleep, my friend.  You can hide behind that pistol for now, but take your eyes off me long enough to sneeze --
L49853 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Snow shelter.  Okay.  You dig. I'll have a little sit-down.
L49852 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ We'll stop here, dig out a snow shelter.
L49851 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ I don't plan on dying.
L49850 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Why in hell you care enough about me to die taking me in?
L49844 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Look, take these cuffs off.  We need to work together.
L49843 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ That's right.  You're not.
L49842 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ I'm not gonna carry you out of here.
L49839 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ You sound like the tourists. Know-it-alls who read about survival in a magazine.  Fuck you.  You won't make it off this mountain.
L49838 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ With light clothing and no supplies, this is nobody's territory.
L49837 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ I took the odds on getting down in one piece, and I made it.  Now we're in my territory.
L49836 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Next time you want to kill yourself, don't include me.
L49834 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ You got the belly to look me in the eye and pull the trigger?
L49833 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Stay put!
L49828 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Hunting and trapping was a damn fine life.  Me and Mitchell, Bob and LeMalle, we were teams.  I'd always go with Mitchell.  Good man, Mitchell.  I'd let Bob worry about goddamn LeMalle.  We'd hire a plane in October.  On the way to a dirt airstrip somewhere, we'd drop supplies.  We'd land, tell the pilot to come back for us a few days before Christmas.
L49827 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Sounds like professional jealousy.
L49824 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ That makes the flight more interesting.
L49823 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ I needed a pilot's license to take the job here, so I got one in six weeks.
L49822 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Been driving long?
L49821 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Smart?  Sure.  That's why I'm sitting in this plane and they're down there blowing me kisses.
L49820 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ How the hell were they smart enough to find us?
L49771 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ -- Killing is what you know.  Pack some food while I prep for the flight.  I'm sure not gonna let him go.
L49770 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Surviving is what I know --
L49767 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Send him down to her.  There's money in my duffel bag, back at his cabin.
L49766 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ A daughter in Oregon.
L49765 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Does he have people?
L49752 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ -- To take you to jail?  It'll be my pleasure.
L49751 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ A lot to ask, dragging him away from such a good-looking girl --
L49679 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Yeah.  Maybe so.
L49678 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Nice bluff the other day with the tranquilizer gun out your jeep window.  See you again, maybe.
L49666 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Ecology.  Folks use that term for everything but what it means: who's eating who.
L49665 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Six months.  Ecological study for Northland Oil.
L49664 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ New to the country, kid?
L49663 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Desmond.
L49662 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ No big deal.  We just got off on the wrong foot.  What's your name?
L49661 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Kenai at the general store asked me to bring these.  Didn't expect we'd already met.
L49660 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Yep.  Afraid you have me at a disadvantage.
L49659 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Ben Corbett?
L49558 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ I got your plate number, asshole. Maybe you feel like spending a few months in jail.
L49557 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Can't be much of a crime, if all they got minding the area is a cocky kid.
L49556 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ You got two counts against you -- trapping out of season and poaching on restricted land.
L49760 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Nothing personal.
L49759 +++$+++ u3775 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ WILDER +++$+++ I'm not too old to knock the snot out of you!
L49758 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ I don't want to hurt you, Sam.
L49757 +++$+++ u3775 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ WILDER +++$+++ Goddammit, I don't need this aggravation.  I'll shoot you, Ben.  Bank on it.
L49754 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Good idea.  Flying over mountains can give you some nasty surprises.  Go too low, one of the clouds might have a big rock inside it.
L49753 +++$+++ u3775 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ WILDER +++$+++ You better get some sleep.
L49695 +++$+++ u3775 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ WILDER +++$+++ Don't try me.  I'll kill you if it comes to it.
L49694 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ I'll get loose before that plane comes.
L49693 +++$+++ u3775 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ WILDER +++$+++ If that was all, fine.  But carving him up, stranding the others, that's too fucking much. Is everything that walks, crawls, flies or swims fair game to you?
L49692 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Sam, listen -- I shot to defend my man.  Other guy drew first.
L49675 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Sam, give Dixie here fifty bucks out of my kit, will you?
L49674 +++$+++ u3775 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ WILDER +++$+++ I got it from here.  Thanks.
L49673 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Christ if I shouldn't know better than to step in soft earth.  I've seen footprints in the tundra a hundred years old.
L49672 +++$+++ u3775 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ WILDER +++$+++ You left a footprint at the Sportsmen's camp.  Only pretty sight there, Ben, 'cause the two men you didn't shoot and mutilate died of exposure.
L49671 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ All this for laying traps on private land?
L49670 +++$+++ u3775 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ WILDER +++$+++ But I would.
L49669 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ You wouldn't shoot anyone...
L49616 +++$+++ u3775 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ WILDER +++$+++ No, I better stay at my post.
L49615 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Can we buy the Marshal some dinner?
L49614 +++$+++ u3775 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ WILDER +++$+++ I'm living proof of that sad fact.
L49613 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Relax.  One more day without drink won't kill you.  Right, Sam?
L49598 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Just passing through.
L49597 +++$+++ u3775 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ WILDER +++$+++ Ben...boys.  Yeah, real slow, and I'd like to keep it that way.
L49596 +++$+++ u3766 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ CORBETT +++$+++ Hullo, Sam.  Slow day?
L50096 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ If you have to ask, you wouldn't understand.
L50095 +++$+++ u3768 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ KENAI +++$+++ -- Forget it.  And try not to bleed on my throw rugs.  Why do this?
L50094 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ -- Here's a hundred dollars.  And if you or anyone else will back me up on this --
L50093 +++$+++ u3768 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ KENAI +++$+++ Pretty clever:  If the trappers got that signal beacon and get here in time, Sam's is the first place they'll look.  They may figure you're waiting for an airplane, so you can't stay in the shack by the airstrip.  Last place they'd expect you is on the far side of town.  I can't afford any trouble --
L50092 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Will you rent me a cabin, or not?
L50091 +++$+++ u3768 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ KENAI +++$+++ What's the problem with Sam Wilder's place?
L50090 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ I need to rent a cabin.
L50219 +++$+++ u3772 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ NEFF +++$+++ You're an outsider, Mr. Desmond. Step aside; stay out of it.
L50218 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Neff, you know better than this...
L50123 +++$+++ u3772 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ NEFF +++$+++ -- Sam Wilder was my cousin. He's why I came to Alaska.  All his letters, saying what a paradise it is.  But me ending up dead won't do Sam a lick of good.
L50122 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ You don't care enough about Sam to --
L50121 +++$+++ u3772 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ NEFF +++$+++ I'm real sorry.  In a while, you're gone from this country. But we live here.  No one wants to mix it up with those hombres.
L50120 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ There'll be three, four men at the most.  I have some backup, nothing will happen.
L50119 +++$+++ u3772 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ NEFF +++$+++ Bastards killed Sam, you think they won't kill the rest of us?
L50118 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L50117 +++$+++ u3772 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ NEFF +++$+++ Look, Mr. Desmond, I didn't count on it turning this ugly.
L50114 +++$+++ u3772 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ NEFF +++$+++ I'm the one should be sorry... Goddamn Kenai, always out for a score.  I never should've let him go over there.
L50113 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last night.
L50112 +++$+++ u3772 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ NEFF +++$+++ I was just on my way to your ladyfriend's, but I guess she found you.
L50083 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Just stay out of my face until I'm gone!
L50082 +++$+++ u3772 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ NEFF +++$+++ What's wrong?
L50038 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Corbett ruined my two-way.  Go to my place on the Haul Road, tell Anne Marie I'm okay and to sit tight.
L50037 +++$+++ u3772 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ NEFF +++$+++ Jiminy Christmas.  What do you want from me?
L50036 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ -- I'm putting him on the plane to Fairbanks, eleven tomorrow.
L50035 +++$+++ u3772 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ NEFF +++$+++ If Corbett's men find out --
L50034 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Back at my place... he, uh, broke his leg.
L50033 +++$+++ u3772 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ NEFF +++$+++ -- Here?!  Where's Wilder?
L50032 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Look, Neff, I've got Ben Corbett with me --
L50031 +++$+++ u3772 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ NEFF +++$+++ Not a damn thing.  What's going on?  Mr. Meyerling was here, all steamed up, looking for you.
L50030 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Have you heard anything from the girl staying with me, Anne Marie?
L50029 +++$+++ u3772 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ NEFF +++$+++ You don't mind me saying, Mr. Desmond, you look like hell.
L49698 +++$+++ u3772 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ NEFF +++$+++ Snowplow, generator, TV dish... hell, we get the goddamn Playboy Channel!  Here, this is for you.
L49697 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Sure.
L49696 +++$+++ u3772 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ NEFF +++$+++ Mr. Desmond!  Arthur Neff.  Area rep for the Federal Assistance Plan.  Tell the boys in DC to keep those goodies coming.
L50211 +++$+++ u3770 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ MEYERLING +++$+++ This isn't your concern.  It's over, here and now.
L50210 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Fuck you.
L50209 +++$+++ u3770 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ MEYERLING +++$+++ Nobody wants any more killings; we all agree to that, correct?  That's good.  Now, Eric, you're gonna hand your prisoner over to us.
L50079 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Some day these people'll wake up, and you'll be the first one they'll run out of here.
L50078 +++$+++ u3770 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ MEYERLING +++$+++ This miserable wilderness is a state of the union.  Policy's made here the same way as in the civilized world: at the ballot box.  That's the beauty of it -- these icebox cowboys are living a century too late.  Get them on your side, it's like buying Manhattan for beads.  With a handful of votes you control the greatest frontier since white men stumbled onto the New World.
L50077 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ I should release Corbett because you want some votes?
L50076 +++$+++ u3770 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ MEYERLING +++$+++ You can't see past your lousy little assignment, sniffing around the pipeline.  The few voters there are in this district look up to Corbett, and I'm not about to alienate them.
L50075 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ What does this matter to you?
L50074 +++$+++ u3770 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ MEYERLING +++$+++ Alleged killer.
L49750 +++$+++ u3775 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ WILDER +++$+++ I could've sat tight for the transport, 'til Bob came poking around.
L49749 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ That's what we should've done in the first place.
L49748 +++$+++ u3775 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ WILDER +++$+++ ...You give us a ride in the Cessna you got hangared at the pumping station, we'll be in Fairbanks in a few hours.
L49649 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Any idea who could've done it?
L49648 +++$+++ u3775 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ WILDER +++$+++ I'm too old for this shit.
L49641 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ We'll go with you.
L49640 +++$+++ u3775 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ WILDER +++$+++ Damn.  Likely that's an SOS. Have to pass on that lunch.
L49639 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Hey, Sam, look over there.  Black and white smoke.
L49633 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Mobile Arctic Dwelling -- MAD.
L49632 +++$+++ u3775 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ WILDER +++$+++ What'd you say they call these spaceships?
L49631 +++$+++ u3767 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ -- We appreciate the company. Anne Marie's getting cabin fever already.
L49630 +++$+++ u3775 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ WILDER +++$+++ Bet you're right.  But I didn't come by to wangle a meal --
L50187 +++$+++ u3768 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ KENAI +++$+++ Aw, Jesus.  Told you this was trouble.  What about you, big shot?  Do something.  Who's side are you on, anyway?
L50186 +++$+++ u3772 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ NEFF +++$+++ Dead.  Trappers killed him.
L50057 +++$+++ u3768 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ KENAI +++$+++ Dixie's waiting at the infirmary. She'll put a splint on that injured leg.
L50056 +++$+++ u3772 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ NEFF +++$+++ He saw you and Corbett come in...
L50046 +++$+++ u3772 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ NEFF +++$+++ Stay out of it.
L50045 +++$+++ u3768 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ KENAI +++$+++ Corbett coming here stinks of trouble.  We should make the best of it before it turns around and bites us in the ass.
L50044 +++$+++ u3772 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ NEFF +++$+++ You're out of your greedy goddamn mind.
L50043 +++$+++ u3768 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ KENAI +++$+++ Bet I could make some money turning Ben Corbett in.  Maybe more for lettin' him loose.  I was up in my cache.  Saw the Northland man come talk to you.
L50042 +++$+++ u3772 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ NEFF +++$+++ Why the smirk?
L50009 +++$+++ u3768 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ KENAI +++$+++ I just as soon he stay gone. Fool could've got us all killed, arresting Ben Corbett here in town.
L50008 +++$+++ u3772 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ NEFF +++$+++ Wilder's missing church services; you believe it?
L50172 +++$+++ u3774 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ VIKING BOB +++$+++ Doesn't matter.  We know where they're going.  C'mon.
L50171 +++$+++ u3769 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ LEMALLE +++$+++ Kenai's PA -- but how the fuck she seein' us?
L50141 +++$+++ u3774 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ VIKING BOB +++$+++ Ease off.  We do this my way.
L50140 +++$+++ u3769 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ LEMALLE +++$+++ You hear me?  Ben?
L50136 +++$+++ u3769 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ LEMALLE +++$+++ I'm right fuckin' here with you.
L50135 +++$+++ u3774 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ VIKING BOB +++$+++ Look, we pull Ben's ass out of the fire, I'll get you a whole damn crate of Snickers bars.
L50028 +++$+++ u3774 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ VIKING BOB +++$+++ Quit fucking around.  Get in.
L50027 +++$+++ u3769 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ LEMALLE +++$+++ Thought that door was open last night...
L50025 +++$+++ u3769 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ LEMALLE +++$+++ Not in the right hands it ain't.
L50024 +++$+++ u3774 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ VIKING BOB +++$+++ What you gonna do with it?  Large bore's for shit on small game.
L50023 +++$+++ u3769 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ LEMALLE +++$+++ I ain't gonna leave a seven- hundred-dollar Remington behind.
L49987 +++$+++ u3769 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ LEMALLE +++$+++ Cool out.  I ain't about to get blasted.
L49986 +++$+++ u3774 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ VIKING BOB +++$+++ Go easy.
L49908 +++$+++ u3769 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ LEMALLE +++$+++ Maybe they went back to Devil's Cauldron.
L49907 +++$+++ u3774 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ VIKING BOB +++$+++ It's a three-hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.
L49906 +++$+++ u3769 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ LEMALLE +++$+++ Get the fuck out of here.
L49905 +++$+++ u3774 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ VIKING BOB +++$+++ I called the cops in Fairbanks, see when Ben is standing trial. They don't know shit about Ben or Wilder!
L49783 +++$+++ u3774 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ VIKING BOB +++$+++ It's a long shot.
L49782 +++$+++ u3769 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ LEMALLE +++$+++ There you go.  Wilder's always chummy with the fuckin' Bambi-lovers.
L49775 +++$+++ u3769 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ LEMALLE +++$+++ Goddamn!  Viking Bob!  Mitchell's inside, boring bastard...
L49774 +++$+++ u3774 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ VIKING BOB +++$+++ LeMalle.  We got a problem. Where's Mitchell?
L50165 +++$+++ u3771 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ They'll have to come right past us.
L50164 +++$+++ u3774 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ VIKING BOB +++$+++ There's what they're waiting on!
L49981 +++$+++ u3771 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Where's the kid?
L49980 +++$+++ u3774 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ VIKING BOB +++$+++ Musta wanted to keep him from the bears.  If Ben killed him, he sure as hell wouldn't hang him up like this.
L49979 +++$+++ u3771 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ It's Sam Wilder!
L49914 +++$+++ u3771 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ We were just talking about him.
L49913 +++$+++ u3774 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ VIKING BOB +++$+++ Okay, let's backtrack, try to pick up his trail.  You know the kid out on the pipeline that Wilder's buddies with?
L49910 +++$+++ u3774 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ VIKING BOB +++$+++ That plane might've been to throw us off the track.  Remember the bait-and-switch Wilder pulled with the Eskimo and his truck?
L49909 +++$+++ u3771 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Naah, Wilder knows we got friends in town.
L49781 +++$+++ u3771 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Hang on...  Remember that Cessna we saw at the pumping station on the Haul Road?  Belongs to the guy they got patrolling the pipeline.
L49780 +++$+++ u3774 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ VIKING BOB +++$+++ Closest planes for hire are here in Cache.
L49779 +++$+++ u3771 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ Meaning he'll need a plane.
L49777 +++$+++ u3774 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ VIKING BOB +++$+++ Musta never got a chance to -more-
L49776 +++$+++ u3771 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ MITCHELL +++$+++ ...Ben never sent a signal.
L49689 +++$+++ u3773 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ STATE POLICEMAN +++$+++ So shoot him.  Won't have to feed him that way --
L49688 +++$+++ u3775 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ WILDER +++$+++ This man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration.
L49687 +++$+++ u3773 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ STATE POLICEMAN +++$+++ Sit your suspect out in the cold. He'll keep.
L49686 +++$+++ u3775 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ WILDER +++$+++ Next plane's not coming 'til next Monday.
L49685 +++$+++ u3773 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ STATE POLICEMAN +++$+++ On a good day I couldn't spare a crosswalk guard.  But now, no way.  Folks're batshit with the weather turning sour.  Bring him in yourself.
L49684 +++$+++ u3775 +++$+++ m248 +++$+++ WILDER +++$+++ This is Sam Wilder, Marshal in Devil's Cauldron.  Had some killings here.  I got a suspect; be real nice if someone came and took him off my hands.
L51893 +++$+++ u3776 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ Everybody wants that, dear -- it doesn't exit...  Sorry... didn't mean to interrupt.
L51892 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Stop it!! Why can't I have a normal boyfriend??? Why? Get out of here. Just a regular boyfriend who doesn't go nuts on me...
L51614 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I love you.
L51613 +++$+++ u3776 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ Call me as soon as you're settled.
L51611 +++$+++ u3776 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ Well, maybe he has nice friends.
L51610 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.
L51609 +++$+++ u3776 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ How was it talking to him?
L51525 +++$+++ u3776 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ I want us to go out.
L51524 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ What is it you want? What?
L51523 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Leave me be! Why are you doing this? Why are you picking at my sores... What is it that you want?... You want what? What's with you? I hope getting me thinking of everything that's wrong when all I want is to not do this has some purpose.  What is it, Mom? No kidding.
L51522 +++$+++ u3776 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ Spencer's doing fine. So what are you saying, that you're frustr...
L51521 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ ... moving in the wrong direction... Away from when I even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for Christ's sake. I was feeling like really bad that Dr. Bettes is married.  Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to... Like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems. He has to make up for his mom not getting any.  Oh, boy. Who needs these thoughts?
L51520 +++$+++ u3776 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ Go ahead.
L51519 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I don't know... It's very strange not feeling that stupid panic thing inside you all the time. Without that you just start thinking about yourself -- and what does that ever get anybody. Today, on the bus there was this adorable couple and I felt myself giving them a dirty look -- I had no idea everything was...
L51517 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I don't need one 'cause I know what's really going on here. I have to finish this letter or I'll go nuts.  This can't be right -- con- science.
L51516 +++$+++ u3776 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ Spencer is okay. You'd better start finding something else to do with your free time. If you can't feel good about this break and step out a little...  You ought to get Mr. Udall to send you over a psychiatrist.
L51515 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again?
