L130984 +++$+++ u694 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ FUZZY +++$+++ But did you know him?
L130983 +++$+++ u697 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ LARCH +++$+++ *Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
L130982 +++$+++ u694 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ FUZZY +++$+++ *Liver* killed him?
L130981 +++$+++ u697 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ LARCH +++$+++ Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
L130980 +++$+++ u694 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ FUZZY +++$+++ Is *your* father dead?
L131083 +++$+++ u694 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ FUZZY +++$+++ Why can't we have pumpkins for Christmas, too? We don't get any good presents at Christmas, anyway.
L131082 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.
L131079 +++$+++ u694 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ FUZZY +++$+++ Is that soon?
L131078 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Uh... it's the end of October.
L130977 +++$+++ u694 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ FUZZY +++$+++ His father's dead, right?
L130976 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ "I was a posthumous child. My father's eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months, when mine opened on it."
L130972 +++$+++ u694 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ FUZZY +++$+++ That's why Kong loves her!
L130971 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.
L130970 +++$+++ u694 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ FUZZY +++$+++ Homer... doesn't King Kong think the woman is his *mother*?
L130862 +++$+++ u699 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ MARY AGNES +++$+++ I must have been *dreaming* of kissing someone.
L130861 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
L130860 +++$+++ u699 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ MARY AGNES +++$+++ Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
L130859 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
L130858 +++$+++ u699 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ MARY AGNES +++$+++ I don't remember.
L130857 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Did you bite it?
L131263 +++$+++ u707 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ I don't think so, Homer. *I'm* the lucky one.
L131262 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Well, sure... that's good, then.  All I mean is, I'm lucky I met you.
L131261 +++$+++ u707 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ You're the one who's helping *me*, Homer. You're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while I'm gone. Candy, too.
L131260 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Uh... actually, picking apples is as much excitement as I want for a while. I'm grateful for the job.
L131259 +++$+++ u707 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ Uh... I'm shipping out sooner than I thought. I just wanted to be sure you were settled in--and happy enough, considering...  Are you bored stiff? Or can you stick it out for a bit?
L131238 +++$+++ u707 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ The trees are flak--antiaircraft fire from those geeks on the ground.
L131237 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ What about the trees?
L131236 +++$+++ u707 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ It's almost like flying.
L131189 +++$+++ u707 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ Yes. They pick fruit, all kinds. They travel up and down the coast with the seasons.  The trick to Mr. Rose is, you have to let him be the boss.
L131188 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Migrants?
L131187 +++$+++ u707 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ They're migrants.
L131169 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Oh, I would love that, Wally.
L131168 +++$+++ u707 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ Uh, look... if you're serious about wanting a job, picking apples isn't that boring.
L131165 +++$+++ u707 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ Actually, I volunteered.
L131164 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ What lousy luck--I mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that!
L131163 +++$+++ u707 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ I've got thirty-five minutes to climb to fifteen thousand feet--that's the first mountain pass.
L131162 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ At what altitude?
L131161 +++$+++ u707 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ *And* over the Himalayas. That's called flying over the hump.
L131160 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ "Burma run" because you fly over Burma...
L131152 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ It's all very normal.
L131151 +++$+++ u707 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*!
L131150 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ This is all normal. Don't worry. The abortion procedure... it affects you. It's the ether, too. It'll take a little time.
L131129 +++$+++ u707 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring.
L131128 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ No, I'm not. I need a job.
L131127 +++$+++ u707 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ You're a little overqualified, aren't you?
L131126 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ I think I'd probably like the apple business.
L131089 +++$+++ u707 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ We're heading back to Cape Kenneth.
L131088 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Where are you going?
L131087 +++$+++ u707 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
L131086 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ I wonder if you might give me a ride.
L131085 +++$+++ u707 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ Actually, someone did. I just didn't think I could eat anything.
L131084 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Has anyone offered you anything to eat?
L131066 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ No, it's not serious. I'm just not supposed to get excited. You know-- no strain, no stress. I try to keep calm all the time.
L131065 +++$+++ u707 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ Really! Is it serious?
L131064 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect.
L131063 +++$+++ u707 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ Have you enlisted?
L131062 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Liberator...
L131061 +++$+++ u707 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ A B-24 Liberator.
L131060 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ What kind of plane are you flying?
L131051 +++$+++ u707 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ Ah, well... okay. Good! I just wondered...
L131050 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
L131049 +++$+++ u707 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ So, now, uh... you're not... I mean, do *you* do the--
L131039 +++$+++ u707 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ It's okay--I don't mind.
L131038 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ I'm sorry. They're not used to seeing a car like this.
L131736 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Right?
L131735 +++$+++ u700 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ MR. ROSE +++$+++ Let me hear you say that! I so unhappy she runned away that I killed myself-- that what happen here, ain't that right?
L131733 +++$+++ u700 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ MR. ROSE +++$+++ That's 'cause I sticked my *own* knife in the wound--after she go, I sticked my *own* knife in there. I poked it all around, I just tryin' to find the same place she got me.
L131732 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ There's more than one laceration, more than one cut.
L131727 +++$+++ u700 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ MR. ROSE +++$+++ She just plan misunderstand me--I was tryin' to give her my knife, I was just reachin' to touch her hand. But I understand if she misunderstand me--it's all my fault, ain't that right?
L131726 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Where'd she get you?
L131725 +++$+++ u700 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ MR. ROSE +++$+++ If that was your knife, Muddy, I wanna thank you for givin' it to her-- no girl should be goin' *hitch-hikin'* if she don't got a good knife with her.
L131684 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Okay. Then you can be of use.
L131683 +++$+++ u700 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ MR. ROSE +++$+++ I'm stayin', Homer.
L131680 +++$+++ u700 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ MR. ROSE +++$+++ When it comes to this, you is the real thing--is that what you sayin'?
L131679 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Merthiolate, ether, vulval pads, gauze--lots of gauze.
L131678 +++$+++ u700 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ MR. ROSE +++$+++ There ain't no *almost* about this stuff, Homer--ain't that right?
L131677 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
L131676 +++$+++ u700 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ MR. ROSE +++$+++ What's that? What's it called?
L131675 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Mr. Rose, I'm in the *doctor* business.  If you want, I can help you. You don't have to go anywhere.
L131674 +++$+++ u700 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ MR. ROSE +++$+++ What business is you in, Homer?
L131673 +++$+++ u700 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ MR. ROSE +++$+++ You forget yourself, Homer. This here's my daughter! You got your own mess to deal with--ain't that right?
L131672 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Please listen to me! *Both* of you...
L131616 +++$+++ u700 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ MR. ROSE +++$+++ And I *love* her! There ain't nobody else gonna treat her as good as I do!  I wouldn't do nothin' to hurt her, Homer--you must know that.
L131615 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ But she's your *daughter*...
L131613 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Go on, cut my clothes. I've got other clothes.
L131612 +++$+++ u700 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ MR. ROSE +++$+++ Homer, don't you know what business you in? You don't wanna go into no business with me, Homer--ain't that right?
L131611 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ You're lying. How can you... with your own daughter!
L131610 +++$+++ u700 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ MR. ROSE +++$+++ Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father knows.
L131609 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
L131608 +++$+++ u700 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ MR. ROSE +++$+++ I think you been stayin' up too late at night, Homer.
L131606 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Is it true?
L131605 +++$+++ u700 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ MR. ROSE +++$+++ I didn't see where you was pickin' this mornin', Homer, but you musta worked up a big appetite. You look like you're serious about gettin' to your lunch today!
L131484 +++$+++ u700 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ MR. ROSE +++$+++ You still doin' it too fast!
L131483 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
L131482 +++$+++ u700 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ MR. ROSE +++$+++ Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a big hurry.
L131412 +++$+++ u700 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ MR. ROSE +++$+++ Of *course* there's worms, Homer! And what is them worms, really? They just *protein*, them worms! They is *good* for you!
L131411 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.
L131410 +++$+++ u700 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ MR. ROSE +++$+++ Cider don't have no taste till later in October--it's too watery now, when we're usin' just them early Macs and them Gravensteins. You don't get no *good* cider till you're pickin' them Golden Delicious and them Winter Bananas, them Baldwins and them Russerts...
L131301 +++$+++ u700 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ MR. ROSE +++$+++ Homer, you the only one who's read them rules, so you the only one who feels like he's doin' somethin' wrong.
L131300 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Are we supposed to be up here? The rules said...
L131267 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ I guess so...
L131266 +++$+++ u700 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ MR. ROSE +++$+++ That's better. I can tell you got yourself some education. Them's good hands you got, Homer. Them hands you got, they know what they're doin'-- ain't that right?
L131233 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Okay...
L131232 +++$+++ u700 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ MR. ROSE +++$+++ Stop it, Homer. They aren't our rules. We didn't write them. I don't see no reason to read them.
L131216 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Right.
L131215 +++$+++ u700 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ MR. ROSE +++$+++ It's big enough to keep you out of the war, I suppose. Ain't that right?
L131202 +++$+++ u700 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ MR. ROSE +++$+++ Out back, there's a shed. It's just a mess. If that shed was better organized, I could put my truck in there.
L131201 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ So. What should I do now?
L131531 +++$+++ u697 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ LARCH +++$+++ You know everything I know, plus what you've taught yourself--you're a better doctor then I am and you know it!
L131530 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ I am not a doctor.
L131100 +++$+++ u697 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ LARCH +++$+++ It's your heart--you ought to take it with you.
L131099 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ I don't need this--I know all about my condition.
L131098 +++$+++ u697 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ LARCH +++$+++ I don't need your gratitude.
L131097 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ You know I'm grateful for everything you've done for me...
L131096 +++$+++ u697 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ LARCH +++$+++ Are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well! And you won't be able to take care of them, either. There's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there!
L131095 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Of course.
L131094 +++$+++ u697 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ LARCH +++$+++ In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.
L131093 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
L131092 +++$+++ u697 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ LARCH +++$+++ Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do.
L131023 +++$+++ u697 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ LARCH +++$+++ Happy to be alive, under any circumstances--is that your point?
L131022 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Try to look at it *this* way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator! 
L131021 +++$+++ u697 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ LARCH +++$+++ Try to look at it this way. What choice does Buster have? What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him. 
L131020 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ I'm happy I amuse you.
L131019 +++$+++ u697 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ LARCH +++$+++ It's just a marvel to me that you still have such high expectations of people.
L131016 +++$+++ u697 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ LARCH +++$+++ How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?
L131015 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ How about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with?
L130974 +++$+++ u697 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ LARCH +++$+++ It is. I'll get this. You go ahead.
L130973 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ I thought it was my turn.
L130962 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ It's *your* splice! You blame me for everything!
L130961 +++$+++ u697 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ LARCH +++$+++ I thought you took care of this. It always breaks in the same place. It's your splice, isn't it?
L130896 +++$+++ u697 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ LARCH +++$+++ We haven't had a Wilbur here in a year or so, have we? We used to have *dozens*!
L130895 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Okay, he's just a Wilbur then.
L130894 +++$+++ u697 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ LARCH +++$+++ I'm not crazy about the "Little..."
L130893 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Henceforth you shall be... Little Wilbur.
L130892 +++$+++ u697 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ LARCH +++$+++ You do it then.
L130891 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ I don't think so.
L130890 +++$+++ u697 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ LARCH +++$+++ Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
L130889 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ He doesn't like it.  He's a boy, That's why.
L130887 +++$+++ u697 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ LARCH +++$+++ It's my turn!
L130886 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Nobody's named this one yet.
L130885 +++$+++ u697 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ LARCH +++$+++ Where's the name sheet?
L130854 +++$+++ u697 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ LARCH +++$+++ When *doesn't* he have bronchitis? I wouldn't call his bronchial infections "underdeveloped." Would you?
L130853 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ But isn't Fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?
L130852 +++$+++ u697 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ LARCH +++$+++ I haven't, either. But you *will*. The morons who write the books should do a little research *here*.
L130851 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ I haven't read that.
L130850 +++$+++ u697 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ LARCH +++$+++ Fuzzy is not uncommon. I tell you, there's something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers. They seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along.
L130838 +++$+++ u697 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ LARCH +++$+++ Good boy. Good job. And you call yourself "not a doctor"!  Keep an eye on her--she's in trouble.
L130837 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ In other words, scurvy.
L130836 +++$+++ u697 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ LARCH +++$+++ If you take enough of it, your intestines lose their ability to absorb Vitamin C.
L130835 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ I don't know it.
L130834 +++$+++ u697 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ LARCH +++$+++ Christ, it's oil of tansy!
L130833 +++$+++ u697 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ LARCH +++$+++ Obviously.
L130832 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ It's obviously an aborticide.
L130825 +++$+++ u697 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ LARCH +++$+++ Scurvy! Ah yes, the curse of the old- time sailor, suffering long periods at sea with no fresh fruits or vegetables. Homer, Dorothy isn't a *sailor*!
L130824 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ It looks like scurvy.
L130823 +++$+++ u697 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ LARCH +++$+++ No. The fetus was dead. Her uterus was virtually *disintegrating*--my stitches pulled right through the tissue!
L130822 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ There was no visible wound?
L130802 +++$+++ u697 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ LARCH +++$+++ What *else* could I have showed you, Homer? The only thing I can teach you is what I know! In every life, you've got to be of use.
L130801 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ One: it's illegal. Two: I didn't ask how to do it--you just showed me.
L130800 +++$+++ u697 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ LARCH +++$+++ You know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can't get help anywhere else?
L130799 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ All I said was, I don't want to perform abortions. I have no argument with *you* performing them.
L130798 +++$+++ u697 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ LARCH +++$+++ I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery.
L130797 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Yes, for both.
L130796 +++$+++ u697 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ LARCH +++$+++ First pregnancy?
L131507 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Right.
L131506 +++$+++ u703 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ OLIVE +++$+++ Good-bye, Arthur.  Homer, I'll see you tomorrow?
L131503 +++$+++ u703 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ OLIVE +++$+++ Just promise me that, if there's a blizzard, you'll move into Wally's room until it's over.
L131502 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Uh... sure.
L131501 +++$+++ u703 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ OLIVE +++$+++ I don't know.  Just promise me one thing.
L131500 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ I think Wally will be fine, Mrs. Worthington--he seems indestructible to me.
L131499 +++$+++ u703 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ OLIVE +++$+++ There's not a lot of work in the winter, and you'll have to tolerate Vernon--even Wally despises him, and Wally likes everyone.
