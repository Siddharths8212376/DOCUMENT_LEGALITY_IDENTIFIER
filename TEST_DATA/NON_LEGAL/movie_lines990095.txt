L361817 +++$+++ u6426 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Solomon, please.  Please.  I am so fucked here if you do this.  This is the worst timing. The worst timing I could ever imagine. I need to keep working.  I have so many debts, so many things, I have, I have, I have -- I have surgery -- I have my oral surgery coming --
L361816 +++$+++ u6448 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ SOLOMON +++$+++ Two years! Two years later and out of your paycheck, I never charge interest --
L361815 +++$+++ u6426 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ I paid you back.

I trust you with so much. The keys to my store, the codes to my locks, the life, the blood of my bussiness and return is smashing in seven-eleven, late, <u>always</u> late, loans -- I loaned you money for your kitchen that you never did --
L361813 +++$+++ u6426 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ I lent my name, my celebrity. Exactly --
L361812 +++$+++ u6448 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ SOLOMON +++$+++ -- I give you money, I give you a paycheck. Your sales suck, Don. I give, I give. When I find you, when I meet you, what? I put you on the billboard, I put you in the store, my salesman, my fucking representation of Solomon and Solomon Electronic, Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the game show --
L361811 +++$+++ u6426 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ I don't have any money, Solomon. If you fire me --
L361808 +++$+++ u6426 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ Solomon: I am in the middle of so much. So much in my life and this is -- If you do this, if you fire me: I Am Fucked. I can't really explain much, but please, please, I've worked here for four years, four years I've given you and I'm, I'm, I mean what?  I'm sorry I was late. I had a car accident.  I accidentaly drove into a seven-eleven. It was not my fault.
L361807 +++$+++ u6448 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ SOLOMON +++$+++ Don't get strong, Donnie. This is making sense, this making a lot of sense. You are not doing the job, the job I ask you to do, a job I give you. Over and over and over and I'm sorry. But I'm not gonna say I'm sorry that much more.
L361806 +++$+++ u6426 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ This is so fucked, Solomon. I don't deserve this.
L361805 +++$+++ u6448 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ SOLOMON +++$+++ Don't Donnie. Don't do it.
L361804 +++$+++ u6426 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ DONNIE +++$+++ ...please...
L361746 +++$+++ u6427 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ DR. LANDON +++$+++ The job here is to make him as comfortable as possible -- right now -- our job is to just try and make it as painless as possible. Right?  You understand?
L361745 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ -- how the fuck can I say anything to that -- I don't know what to say to that --
L361744 +++$+++ u6427 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ DR. LANDON +++$+++ This is the number for Hospice. Ok. Now. As far as the morphine pills go, there is something else to consider that can take the pain away that he is in, there is a very strong and very potent solution of liquid morphine....it's a little bottle, with an eye dropper and it's easy to get in his mouth and drop on his tounge and it will certainly diminish the pain that he is in but you have to realize that once you give it to him; there really is no coming back, I mean, it will certainly cure his pain, but he will float in and out of consciousness, even worse than he is now, Linda.  I mean, any sign of the recognizable Earl will pretty much go away --
L361742 +++$+++ u6427 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ DR. LANDON +++$+++ Ok. Linda:  Earl is not gonna make it. He's dying. He is.  He is dying very, very rapidly --
L361741 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I need to sit down.
L361740 +++$+++ u6427 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ DR. LANDON +++$+++ Do you wanna sit down?
L361739 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I'm listening.  I'm getting better.
L361738 +++$+++ u6427 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ DR. LANDON +++$+++ We can fix that, because I can give you -- are you listening?
L361737 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ -- you don't understand: it's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills aren't working, he's -- past two days it's like he can't really swallow them and I don't know if they're going down -- I can't see inside his mouth anymore -- I'm up all night staring at him and I don't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts --
L361736 +++$+++ u6427 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ DR. LANDON +++$+++ If you're happy with Phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine, but contact Hospice to arrange for the body --
L361735 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Yeah.
L361734 +++$+++ u6427 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ DR. LANDON +++$+++ Phil's one of the nurses from the service?
L361733 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ He has Phil right now.
L361732 +++$+++ u6427 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ DR. LANDON +++$+++ Well that's what Hospice will take care of for you.  They will send a nurse, someone who can take care of all of that for you --
L361731 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I just, I just -- I just -- I'm just in a fucking state, I know he's going and it's like I don't know how -- just tell me <u>practical</u> things -- What the fuck do I do with his body? What happens when he dies? That next moment: What? What do I do?  Then What?
L361730 +++$+++ u6427 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ DR. LANDON +++$+++ I can help you through this the best I know how but there are certain things you are gonna have to be strong about and take care of, now we can go over them, but I need to know that you're listening to me, ok?
L361729 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ -- he's fucking dying, he's dying as we're sitting here and there isn't a fucking thing -- jesus, how can you tell me to calm down?

She told me, I couldn't take it...take that I wasn't a man....because if I hadn't had sex with women...like as many women as she had men...then I was weak...a boy.... But I loved her...you understand? ....well, of course, I wanted to have sex with her...and I did and we were together....we met...age twelve, but then again...age seventeen...something, somethin...

L361699 +++$+++ u6443 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Alright.  Thank you.
L361698 +++$+++ u6429 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FEMALE VOICE +++$+++ Yeah.  You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here.
L361697 +++$+++ u6443 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Is this 509-9027?
L361696 +++$+++ u6429 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FEMALE VOICE +++$+++ No.
L361695 +++$+++ u6443 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ I'm looking for Frank Mackey.
L361694 +++$+++ u6429 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FEMALE VOICE +++$+++ I think you have the wrong number.
L361693 +++$+++ u6443 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Hi.  Is Frank there?
L361692 +++$+++ u6429 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FEMALE VOICE +++$+++ Hello?
L362692 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ -- fuck you.
L362691 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ You're hurting a lot of people, Frank --
L362690 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You requested my time and I gave it you, you called me a liar and made accusations. And you say, "If I'd known I wouldn't have asked," then it's not an attack?  Well, I don't wanna be the sort of fella who doesn't keep his word.  I gave you my time, Bitch. So fuck you now.
L362689 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ So you sat it out, that's what you did?
L362688 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Time's up.  Thank you for the interview.
L362630 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I'm quietly judging you.
L362629 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ Yeah.
L362628 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What am I doing?
L362627 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ C'mon, Frank.  What are you doing?
L362472 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ I talked to Miss Simms.  Miss Simms was your caretaker and neighbor after your mother died in 1980.
L362471 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ And that's what you've heard?
L362470 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ I was told that your mother died. That your mother died when you were young --
L362469 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Go ahead and waste your time.
L362468 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ No, this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question --
L362467 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ An old stomping ground --is this the "attack" portion of the interview, I figured this was coming sooner or later -- Is "the girl" coming in for the kill?
L362466 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ She lived in Tarzana.
L362465 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Mm. Hm.
L362464 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ She does.  From when you were a boy.
L362463 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me.
L362462 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ Do you remember a Miss Simms?
L362461 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I'm not sure I hear a question in there?
L362460 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ We talked earlier about your mother. And we talked about your father and his death. And I don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but I have to ask and I would want to clarify something -- something that I understand --
L362459 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ This is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is -- "The most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me," Chapter Three --
L362458 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ It's not like I'm trying to attack you --
L362457 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Not really.
L362456 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ It's all important --
L362455 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ -- there's a lot more important things I'd like to put myself <u>into</u> --
L362454 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ I'm saying, Frank, in trying to figure out who you are --
L362453 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ In aid of what?
L362452 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ Well, just trying to figure out who you are, and how you might have become --
L362451 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Yes.
L362450 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ Are you asking me that?
L362449 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ -- and I try and teach the students to ask: What is it in aid of?
L362448 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ This isn't meant --
L362447 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Thank you, Muffy.  Funny thing is: This is an important element of, "Seduce and Destory:" "Facing the past is an important way in not making progress," that's something I tell my men over and over --
L362446 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ I would just want to clear some things up:
L362445 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ So boring, so useless --
L362444 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ -- just to clarify --
L362443 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Is that still lingering?
L362442 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ I'm confused about your past is the thing.
L362441 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Muffy -- coffee?
L362440 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ -- let's talk more about your background --
L362439 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I warned you -- I get on a roll...
L362438 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ It's fine.  I can bleep it out.
L362437 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I just realized this is for television, isn't it?  I can't swear up and down like I just did.
L362436 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ Let's talk about --
L362435 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ -- that's right, that's right, and what I'M saying, that none of my competitors can say is this:  That there is no need for insight or understanding.  Things of the past! Gone, Over, Done. Do you realize how fucking miraculous this is? How fucking razor sharp and cutting edge and ahead of it's time this concept is?  I'm talking about eliminating <u>insight</u> and <u>understanding</u> as human values.  GOD DAMN I'M GOOD.  There is no need for INSIGHT.  There is no need for UNDERSTANDING.  I have found a way to take <u>any</u> subjective human experience -- in other words -- all the terrible shit or all the great shit that you've had happen to you in your life -- and quickly and easily transform it in the unconscious mind through the subtle and cunning use of language.  The "listener-patient"  settles into a very light, very delicate, conversationally induced state: NOT A TRANCE, mind you, but a STATE. A state that is brand new.  The System's state. What did I do?  I REALIZED that concept and put it into practical "get my dick hard and fuck it" use. I'm gonna build a state for the seducer and the seducee to live, vote, breath, pay takes and party 'till dawn.  I'm gonna teach methods of language that will help anyone get a piece of ass, tit and tail --
L362302 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Like I said, yeah --
L362301 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ -- see, I thought you grew up here in the valley --
L362026 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ Ok.  So, lemme just ask you a couple questions to start --
L362025 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ -- go, go, go.  I'm givin' pearls here. And I'II tell you samethin' else: I'm not succeding in the bush because I'm Frank TJ Mackey.  If anything, there are women out there that want to <u>destroy</u> me -- it makes it twice as hard for me, I run into some little muffin, knows who I am, knows my schemes and plans -- shit, she's gonna wanna fuck around, prove to her friends, say, "Yaddda-yadda-yadda, I saw that guy, he wasn't anything, didn't get me."  So me? I'm runnin' on full throttle the whole fuckin' time.  Dodging bullets left and right from terrorist blonde beauties. But I'II tell you this: The battle of the bush is being fought and won by Team Mackey.  Can I have a cigarette?
L362024 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ I'm gonna start rolling --
L362023 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Just one look, one hesitation, one subtle gesture for me to know -- And Bing-Bam-Boom I'm away on a tangent -- I get so fuckin' amped at these seminars and lemme tell you why: Because I Am What I Believe. I am what I teach, I do as I say, I live by these rules as religiously as I preach them: And you wanna know what? I'm gettin' pussy left, right, up, down, center and sideways.
L362022 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ All it takes is one second?
L362019 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You got us a room so quick?
L362018 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ If you're up to it, I've got us set up in a suite upstairs --
L362017 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Are we gonna tape some stuff now?
L362016 +++$+++ u6432 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWENOVIER +++$+++ That's fine.  It's nice to meet you.
L362476 +++$+++ u6431 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ Well I guess the question is this: Do you remember Miss Simms?
L362475 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Are you asking me a question?
L362316 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I wouldn't want that to be misunderstood: My enrollment was totally unoffical because I was, sadly, unable to afford tuition up there.  But there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes, and they're names are: Macready, Horn and Langtree among others. I was completely independent financially, and like I said: One Sad Sack A Shit. So what we're looking at here is a true rags to riches story and I think that's what most people respond to in "Seduce," And At The End Of The Day? Hey -- it may not even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it -- it's about finding What You Can Be In This World.  Defining It.  Controling It and saying: I will take what is mine.  You just happen to get a blow job out of it, then hey-what-the-fuck- why-not?  he.he.he.
L362315 +++$+++ u6431 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ Kind of.
L362314 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ no, no, no.  Certainly not.  I wasn't officialy enrolled, that's right. Was that unclear?
L362313 +++$+++ u6431 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ They wouldn't?
L362312 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Oh, yeah.  No, no, no.  They wouldn't --
L362311 +++$+++ u6431 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ Ok.  That's why.  I had trouble locating your school records at Berkely and UCLA. Your name change -- they had no official enrollment --
L362310 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ "Frank" was my mother's father.
L362309 +++$+++ u6431 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ And "Frank?"
L362308 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ My mother's name, actually. Good question.  You've done you're research.
L362307 +++$+++ u6431 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ It's not your given name, right?
L362306 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What name?  My name?
L362305 +++$+++ u6431 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ Where does that name come from?
L362304 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I don't how much I went -- but I was enrolled.  I was such a loser back then. I was -- misguided, pathetic -- I was very fat. Not even close to what I am today. Not the Frank TJ Mackey you're eager to talk to because I was swimming in what <u>was</u> as opposed to I <u>wanted</u>.
L362303 +++$+++ u6431 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ And you went to Van Nuys High, right?
L362271 +++$+++ u6431 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ In five years?
L362270 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ ...this close...
L362269 +++$+++ u6431 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ Do you have your masters?
L362268 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Right.
L362267 +++$+++ u6431 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ Psychology major?
L362266 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ From '84 to '89.
L362265 +++$+++ u6431 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ And you ended up at UC Berkely --
L362264 +++$+++ u6430 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Not a problem.
