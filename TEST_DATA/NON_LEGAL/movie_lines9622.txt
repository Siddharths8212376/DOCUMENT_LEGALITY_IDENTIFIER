L99679 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Your Honor, I fail to see what Mrs Crawford's educational background has to do with this case.
L99617 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Objection.  Your Honor, we don't know where this tape is from.  Who made it -- or under what circumstances it was made.
L99616 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Your Honor, this is a tape from Miss Lawson's answering machine.  I would like to play it now.
L99313 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Yeah.  Well -- we'll let the blindfolded lady with the scales decide that.
L99312 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Aren't they all?
L99311 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ She's innocent.
L99310 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Then she's not as smart as I thought she was.  You've seen her in the depositions.  Tell me you don't have any doubts?
L99309 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ I'll tell her but she won't take it.
L99308 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ We're going all the way on this one, Frank.  Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.
L99307 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ I don't buy it and neither will a jury.
L99306 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ The M.E.'s report stated that Marsh's nasal membranes showed no sign of prior cocaine use.  Without the nasal spray we would have still treated it as a poisoning.  We would have looked for motive and the trail would have still led back to her.
L99305 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Suspicions maybe -- but suspicions aren't enough for a conviction.
L99304 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Because she's clever.  Because she knows that even if we didn't find it we'd have suspicions as to why a man in Marsh's condition would use cocaine.
L99303 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Why would she want that?
L99302 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ She planned this.  She wanted us to find the nasal spray.
L99301 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ C'mon -- think about it.  If she was going to kill Marsh why leave the nasal spray bottle there for the police to find?
L99300 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ You're bluffing.  John, it's me, remember?  I've known you since your name was Juan Carlos.
L99299 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Take your pole out of the water, Frank.  The fish ain't biting today.
L99298 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Can you?
L99297 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ You can't show intent.
L99296 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Marsh left her close to three million dollars in his will.  That's motive. She admits to being there the night of his death.  That's opportunity -- and her fingerprints are on the nasal spray bottle.
L99295 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Lookin' to make the papers, John?
L99288 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ No.  Miss Lawson came in here voluntarily to answer your questions. She doesn't have to sit here and be insulted.  So, either you charge her now or we're leaving.
L99287 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Sit down, Frank.
L99286 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ That's it.  My client doesn't have to take this crap from you.
L99280 +++$+++ u4174 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ That's correct -- but Andrew never told me he had a heart condition.  He said he had a heart arrhythmia and it was nothing serious.
L99279 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Mr. Marsh's Cardiologist and his nurse have told us that you accompanied Mr. Marsh to their office on at least two occasions.
L99278 +++$+++ u4174 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ No.
L99277 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Were you aware of Mr. Marsh's heart condition?
L99272 +++$+++ u4174 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ No.  I haven't done it in years.
L99271 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Did you use it the night Marsh died?
L99270 +++$+++ u4174 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ I have.
L99269 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Miss Lawson, do you use cocaine?
L99553 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ What did Mr. Marsh say?
L99552 +++$+++ u4168 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ JOANNE +++$+++ Yes.
L99551 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Did you talk about Miss Lawson?
L99550 +++$+++ u4168 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ JOANNE +++$+++ Horrible.  He was tired and pale.
L99549 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ How did he look?
L99548 +++$+++ u4168 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ JOANNE +++$+++ Yes.
L99547 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Did you see Mr. Marsh the day before his death?
L99546 +++$+++ u4168 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ JOANNE +++$+++ I opened the bathroom door one day and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine out of a vial.
L99545 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Tell the court about that, please.
L99544 +++$+++ u4168 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ JOANNE +++$+++ Yes.
L99543 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ What about Miss Lawson?
L99542 +++$+++ u4168 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ JOANNE +++$+++ No -- never.
L99541 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use Cocaine?
L99540 +++$+++ u4168 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ JOANNE +++$+++ Six years.
L99539 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ How long were you Mr Marsh's personal secretary?
L99162 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Thank you.
L99161 +++$+++ u4168 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ JOANNE +++$+++ No -- but I can get it for you.
L99160 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ You wouldn't know her address, would you?
L99159 +++$+++ u4168 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ JOANNE +++$+++ Rebecca Lawson.
L99158 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Her name?
L99157 +++$+++ u4168 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ JOANNE +++$+++ I assume his girlfriend.
L99156 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?
L99155 +++$+++ u4168 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ JOANNE +++$+++ I had some papers to pick up.
L99154 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Why did you come by?
L99153 +++$+++ u4168 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ JOANNE +++$+++ A little after eleven.
L99152 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Miss Braslow -- I'm District Attorney John Cardenas.  You arrived at what time tonight?
L99145 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Show me.
L99144 +++$+++ u4175 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ REESE +++$+++ No.  She stopped by to pick up some papers.
L99143 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ She was here?
L99142 +++$+++ u4175 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ REESE +++$+++ His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.
L99141 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Who found him?
L99139 +++$+++ u4175 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ REESE +++$+++ Yeah.
L99138 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Is it Marsh?
L99530 +++$+++ u4164 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DR. TRAMMEL +++$+++ Doctor Steven Trammel.  Cardiologist.
L99529 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Just one last question.  What does the sign on your office door say?
L99528 +++$+++ u4164 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DR. TRAMMEL +++$+++ Yes.
L99527 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh to your office?
L99526 +++$+++ u4164 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DR. TRAMMEL +++$+++ Yes.
L99525 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ He did everything he could to take care of his heart?
L99524 +++$+++ u4164 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DR. TRAMMEL +++$+++ Yes -- he stopped smoking and drinking and exercised regularly.
L99523 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Did Mr. Marsh change his lifestyle after that?
L99522 +++$+++ u4164 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DR. TRAMMEL +++$+++ About a year and half ago.
L99521 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Doctor Trammel, when did you first diagnose that Mr. Marsh had heart disease?
L99798 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Thank you.  The State rests.
L99797 +++$+++ u4176 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ ROSTON +++$+++ She was.
L99796 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Who was your primary beneficiary?
L99795 +++$+++ u4176 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ ROSTON +++$+++ Yes.
L99794 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Did you change your will while you were with Miss Lawson?
L99793 +++$+++ u4176 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ ROSTON +++$+++ I woke up the next morning and she was gone.
L99792 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ What happened after that?
L99791 +++$+++ u4176 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ ROSTON +++$+++ I couldn't help myself.  You get lost inside a women like her.  It was like a drug.  It was the best sex I ever had.
L99790 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ If you knew it was bad for you why did you do it?
L99789 +++$+++ u4176 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ ROSTON +++$+++ She started touching herself and telling me how much she wanted me. She reached down and put me inside her.  My doctor had warned me about exerting myself -- but you really don't think of those things at a moment like that.  You just think about how beautiful this woman is -- how much you want her.  How deeply you want to please her.  At first it started off slowly -- but the rhythm built and built.    Every time I got close to an orgasm she would stop.  Eventually I started to have trouble breathing.  Rebecca just kept going -- faster and faster.  No matter what I said she wouldn't stop. I really thought for a moment I was going to die.
L99788 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ What did she do next, Mr. Roston?
L99786 +++$+++ u4176 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ ROSTON +++$+++ She said she was going to fuck me like I've never been fucked before.
L99785 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Mr. Roston I know this is difficult for you, but it's important you tell the court what she did.
L99784 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ What did she say?
L99783 +++$+++ u4176 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ ROSTON +++$+++ She told me that tonight we were going to open new doors.  I asked her to stop -- to take off the handcuffs, but she wouldn't listen.
L99782 +++$+++ u4176 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ ROSTON +++$+++ She's a woman who is very much aware of her own sexuality.  Sometimes I felt she could read my mind.  It was uncanny how she knew exactly what I wanted.  A few nights before my heart surgery Rebecca woke me.  She had handcuffed me to the bed.
L99781 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ What would she do that made it hard to resist?
L99780 +++$+++ u4176 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ ROSTON +++$+++ It's hard to resist a woman as beautiful as she is.
L99779 +++$+++ u4176 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ ROSTON +++$+++ It was like sex was a game to her. She got off on the control.  She always used to tell me it had to be her way.
L99778 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Can you give the court an example?
L99777 +++$+++ u4176 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ ROSTON +++$+++ It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could.  She called it opening new doors.
L99776 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ When you say your sexual relations with Miss Lawson were intense what exactly do you mean?
L99768 +++$+++ u4176 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ ROSTON +++$+++ Well -- I think that after the operation she realized that...
L99767 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Why do you think she left you?
L99766 +++$+++ u4176 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ ROSTON +++$+++ She didn't.  She just left.
L99765 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Why did she say she was leaving?
L99764 +++$+++ u4176 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ ROSTON +++$+++ She left me.
L99763 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Why not?
L99762 +++$+++ u4176 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ ROSTON +++$+++ It didn't.
L99761 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ How did your relationship with Miss Lawson progress after the surgery?
L99760 +++$+++ u4176 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ ROSTON +++$+++ Fine.  The doctors say if I keep taking care of myself I can live to be a very old man.
L99759 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ And how are you now?
L99758 +++$+++ u4176 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ ROSTON +++$+++ I had bypass surgery.
L99757 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ What happened next?
L99756 +++$+++ u4176 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ ROSTON +++$+++ I had a bad heart.
L99755 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ What kind of condition are you referring to?
L99754 +++$+++ u4176 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ ROSTON +++$+++ It was wild.  She was constantly trying to get me more and more worked up -- kinky things.  I tried to satisfy her the best I could, but it was difficult in my condition.
L99753 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ I know this is a very personal subject, but could you be a little more specific?
L99752 +++$+++ u4176 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ ROSTON +++$+++ Intense.
L99751 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson?
L99750 +++$+++ u4176 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ ROSTON +++$+++ For about one year.
L99749 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ How long were you together?
L99748 +++$+++ u4176 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ ROSTON +++$+++ We were lovers.
L99747 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Mr. Roston, what was your relationship with Miss Lawson?
L99602 +++$+++ u4163 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DR. PALEY +++$+++ Cocaine.
L99601 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ -- And what did you suggest?
L99600 +++$+++ u4163 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DR. PALEY +++$+++ She said that those weren't any good -- because their use would be detected and the police would know the victim had been poisoned.  She wanted to know if there was a drug that would induce a heart attack but could also be used to enhance a sexual high.
L99599 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ What did she say?
L99598 +++$+++ u4163 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DR. PALEY +++$+++ Yes -- Insulin and others.
L99597 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Did you suggest any?
L99596 +++$+++ u4163 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DR. PALEY +++$+++ She said that she was working on a novel and she wanted to know what kinds of drugs would be harmful to someone with a bad heart.
L99595 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ What kind of information?
L99594 +++$+++ u4163 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DR. PALEY +++$+++ Well -- I realized that she wasn't interested in me.  She was just trying to get information out of me.
L99593 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Why?
L99592 +++$+++ u4163 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DR. PALEY +++$+++ We stopped seeing each other.
L99591 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ What eventually happened to your relationship with Miss Lawson?
L99590 +++$+++ u4163 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DR. PALEY +++$+++ Yes -- several times.
L99589 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Did you ever see her again after that?
L99588 +++$+++ u4163 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DR. PALEY +++$+++ At a dinner party -- about eight months ago.
L99587 +++$+++ u4162 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ CARDENAS +++$+++ Where did you meet Miss Lawson?
L100043 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ I mean she only screwed me two or three times a night because she had to -- I'm sure she didn't enjoy it.
L100042 +++$+++ u4163 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DR. PALEY +++$+++ That's enough.
L100041 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ I'm sure that every orgasm she had with me was faked.
L100033 +++$+++ u4163 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DR. PALEY +++$+++ You called him?
L100032 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Don't you see what she's doing?  She needs you to kill me.  She's planned it that way from the start.  That's why she phoned me tonight.
L99630 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ That's all Dr. Paley.
L99629 +++$+++ u4163 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DR. PALEY +++$+++ I may have been infatuated with her - - but I wouldn't perjure myself.
L99628 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ No further questions.
L99627 +++$+++ u4163 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DR. PALEY +++$+++ You can suggest anything you want. It happened.
L99626 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ I suggest it never happened.
L99625 +++$+++ u4163 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DR. PALEY +++$+++ No -- she asked me about cocaine.
L99624 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ You're still angry, aren't you? Isn't it true that your whole story is nothing more than a vindictive attempt on your behalf to get back at Miss Lawson?
L99623 +++$+++ u4163 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DR. PALEY +++$+++ I was angry.
L99622 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ You'll be sorry?
L99615 +++$+++ u4163 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DR. PALEY +++$+++ No.
L99614 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson?
L99613 +++$+++ u4163 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DR. PALEY +++$+++ Yes.
L99612 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ And the argument was about the fact that you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not.
L99611 +++$+++ u4163 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DR. PALEY +++$+++ Well -- as I remember it, we had an argument.
L99610 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ If necessary I can bring in the valet parking attendant and two customers who witnessed the occurrence.
L99609 +++$+++ u4163 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DR. PALEY +++$+++ No.
L99608 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ You didn't grab her and try to kiss her?
L99607 +++$+++ u4163 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DR. PALEY +++$+++ No.
L99606 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Isn't it true that later that night you tried to force yourself on Miss Lawson in the parking lot?
L99605 +++$+++ u4163 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DR. PALEY +++$+++ We had dinner at a restaurant.
L99604 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Dr. Paley, where were you the last time you saw Miss Lawson?
L99538 +++$+++ u4164 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DR. TRAMMEL +++$+++ No.  No, I don't.
L99537 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Then you have no way of knowing what Mr. Marsh told Miss Lawson were the reasons for his visits?
L99536 +++$+++ u4164 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DR. TRAMMEL +++$+++ No.
L99535 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh inside during his examinations?
L99534 +++$+++ u4164 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DR. TRAMMEL +++$+++ No.
L99533 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to Miss Lawson about his illness?
L99532 +++$+++ u4164 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DR. TRAMMEL +++$+++ No.
L99531 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Dr. Trammel, did you ever speak to Miss Lawson about Mr. Marsh's condition?
L99859 +++$+++ u4165 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DR. WONG +++$+++ Yes -- quite easy.
L99858 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ One last question, Doctor.  If someone didn't know better, would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine?
L99857 +++$+++ u4165 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DR. WONG +++$+++ October twenty-seventh.
L99856 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ A previous witness stated that she saw Miss Lawson pouring a white powder into her hand on October twenty-eighth.  According to your records when did you prescribe the drug?
L99855 +++$+++ u4165 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DR. WONG +++$+++ I tell them to pour an amount the size of a quarter into the their hand and mix it with water.
L99854 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ How do you instruct your patients to take it?
L99853 +++$+++ u4165 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DR. WONG +++$+++ It's a white powder that comes in a vial.
L99852 +++$+++ u4166 +++$+++ m278 +++$+++ DULANEY +++$+++ Would you describe for the court what Chinese peony root looks like?
