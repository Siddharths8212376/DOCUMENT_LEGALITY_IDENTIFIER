L103813 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Right. Freezers. Imported foods.
L103812 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ What exactly is this place? Freezers?
L103805 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ You'll meet him this afternoon. He's helping us set it up.
L103804 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Who's Mr. Henry?
L103803 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Mr. Henry has an inside source. We call him Steve. That's where we get our information.
L103802 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ What's Hinckley Cold Storage?
L103801 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
L103800 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ What is it?
L103799 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ I want you to look at this.
L103797 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ You really hit a guy with a bottle?
L103796 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Applejack would of got him anyway. This was just the quicker way.
L103789 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Sure.
L103788 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ That's Applejack. You want to meet him?
L103787 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Who's in the car?
L103785 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Ah. Couple days ago.
L103784 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ When'd you get back?
L103724 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ What are you going to do, get married? Have a bunch of little idiot janitor brats! And go around scrubbing the --
L103723 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Shut up!
L103722 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
L103721 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ I know that. But --
L103720 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ That's what she is!
L103719 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.
L103718 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
L103717 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ She needed it.
L103716 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ You gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! What the fuck is your problem?
L103714 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ $383.
L103713 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ How much?
L103712 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ I had to give some to Inez.
L103711 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Where's the rest?
L103710 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ I know.
L103709 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Sixteen dollars.
L103707 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ That's not correct.
L103706 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ We've got sixteen dollars.
L103705 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred --
L103704 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Our money situation is not good.
L103703 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ You can't just run home every time things get tough. First of all, we've got enough dough to --
L103702 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ I'm not. But there's --
L103701 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Don't panic, Anthony.
L103700 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ I think we better go home.
L103694 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ No, I'm serious. He made me a diagram.
L103693 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
L103692 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
L103691 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ You don't know how to hotwire.
L103690 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ I don't think we need any keys, Dignan. I think I can hotwire a car for us.
L103685 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Dignan. I can't do that. All right? I just can't.
L103684 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ No one to back me up. Now I have a good idea. So unless you come up with something better --
L103683 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Shh.
L103682 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out of here. It's real torture for me to be here. Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans.
L103681 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ I don't know, Dignan. I just --
L103680 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ She doesn't need to know.
L103679 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.
L103678 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and --
L103677 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ I don't think we can do that.
L103676 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she?  Doesn't she?
L103675 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ What?
L103674 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ I have an idea for that.
L103673 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ We need a car.
L103672 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
L103671 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk --
L103670 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Would of been nice.
L103669 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ I wish I'd been there.
L103668 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Can you hand me those french fries.
L103667 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ I can't believe he just jumped you.
L103643 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ OK.
L103642 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Why don't you come with us.
L103641 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you later.
L103640 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ We're going over to this bar if you feel like going.
L103636 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Well, the world is a little bit colder today.
L103635 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
L103634 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ If you'd gone with Bob you'd probably be in Weatherford by now. Of course I'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped.
L103633 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ If you say so.
L103632 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.
L103631 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.
L103630 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real surprised, that was just an act. You were just --
L103629 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Well, I didn't do it, did I?
L103628 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?
L103627 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.
L103626 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ He told you and you let him do it.
L103625 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ You were asleep.
L103624 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Where was I?
L103623 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ This morning.
L103622 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ When'd he tell you?
L103618 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ That's a long time to be in jail.
L103617 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ We said 48 hours.
L103616 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ He went back for his brother.
L103615 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ He took his stuff. He's gone.  I should of seen this. I should of expected it. Bob doesn't have any character.
L103614 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Maybe he just went to the store.
L103613 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ That coward. Son of a bitch.
L103612 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Right here.
L103611 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Where was it parked?
L103610 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ He's gone. He stole the car.
L103608 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Yes... It's true.
L103607 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ But if it wasn't for Dignan I probably would of died.
L103606 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ They blamed my family for everything. They always said Mr. Langston saved Anthony's life.
L103605 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
L103604 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.
L103603 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ This was in fourth grade.
L103602 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ See, one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor Mr. Langston's house and Anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious. I had to dive in and save him.
L103594 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Don't worry about it, Bob.
L103593 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ See, now we've got a plan.
L103589 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Bob?
L103588 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Obviously. That's a given.
L103587 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ As long as he gets out OK.
L103586 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Now that makes sense. We'll hang out for a couple of days. Get a little R&R. Make sure Future Man's OK and then get back on the road.
L103583 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ No, no. Look. OK. Let's stay here until we find out what's going on.
L103582 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ He needs to hire an attorney.
L103577 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ No kidding.
L103576 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ She's from Cuba.
L103575 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ On the left.
L103574 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Which one was that?
L103573 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.
L103572 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ They don't?
L103571 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.
L103570 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Anthony, we're on the run from the law here. Did you tell these people your real name?
L103569 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ What. What's the matter?
L103568 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ What the fuck is going on here?
L103567 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Sure.
L103566 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ May I have a word with you, please?
L103565 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Jerry.  And this is my associate Cornelius.
L103564 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Inez, this is --
L103563 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Hi.
L103562 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ This is Inez. Carmen. Anita.
L103560 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ No. We didn't.
L103559 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ I thought you guys went to get your hair cut.
L103477 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Even if it's the difference between some trooper recognizing us and throwing us in prison or not?
L103476 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ No, Dignan. I'm sorry. I can't do that.
L103475 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony. We've got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car.
L103474 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Dignan, I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible, all right?
L103458 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ True.
L103457 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.
L103456 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.
L103455 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ It's not a plan. It's just --
L103454 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.
L103453 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
L103452 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony.
L103451 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ It's a great shirt. Don't worry about it.
L103450 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.
L103449 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Look, man. She didn't know anything about shirts.
L103442 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Bob?
L103441 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ You owe me fifty bucks.
L103440 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ On your marks...  Get set go.
L103439 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ OK. Go ahead.
L103438 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ I'll say it.
L103437 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ I'll just say it.
L103434 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ You were spoiled rotten.
L103433 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.
L103432 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.
L103431 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, Dignan.  In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E.
L103430 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Really. OK, Dad. But seriously, Anthony. These are fast shoes.
L103427 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Well, those treads stink. You'd blow a knee out racing on those.
L103426 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ They obviously weren't designed for racing.
L103425 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ What about them?
L103424 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Look at the treads on those.
L103423 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Yes, they are.
L103422 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
L103421 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ See if mine are in there.
L103419 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Anthony, we're on the run. This is an emergency. It's only fair that...
L103418 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ I keep it for emergencies.
L103417 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Well, then cut it in half.
L103416 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ I don't want to use it.
L103415 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ She's not going to notice, Anthony.
L103414 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Because my mom gets the bill.
L103413 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Why not?
L103412 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.
L103411 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Can I get that credit card from you?
L103343 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Don't even say it, man.
L103342 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --
L103341 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
L103340 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.
L103339 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ What do you think?
L103338 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ What's wrong with him?
L103330 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Like I'm going to hunt you down and kill you.
L103329 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Like he would find Dignan. One day.
L103328 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Yeah.
L103327 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Like he meant it.
L103326 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ I swear to God. In a very quiet voice.
L103323 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Oh, shit. That was scary. In the middle of the robbery. The manager looks at me. Right in the eye. And goes, I'm going to remember you.
L103322 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ What about what that guy said?
L103317 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ We got it. We got it.
L103316 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Holy shit.
L103297 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Unlock that door.  Check the aisles.
L103296 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Is that the manager?
L103290 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ We know there's another stocker.
L103289 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ There's another stocker, right?
L103288 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Where's the other stocker?
L103287 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Where's the manager?
L103249 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ You're right. You're right.
L103248 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Calm down. Take a deep breath.
L103247 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Dignan! Stop!
L103246 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!
L103245 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Dignan, calm down.
L103241 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's all of ours.
L103240 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Anthony, give me the fucking gun!
