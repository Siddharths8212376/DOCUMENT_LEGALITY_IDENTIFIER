L569611 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ You'd be surprised how often you see the same people, get the same fare. People have patterns. They do more or less the same things every day. I can tell.
L569610 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ That would have been quite a coincidence.
L569609 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ South Bronx. The worst. I tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so I had to take him. That's the law. Otherwise I would have picked you up.
L569608 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ The DMZ?
L569607 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ If it wasn't for a drunk I would have picked you up. He wanted to go to the DMZ.
L569606 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ You're right! Now I remember! It was after the Western regional planners were in town and the meeting went late. The next day I was completely bushed. It was unbelievable.
L569605 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ No. It was you. You had some manila folders and a pink bag from Saks.
L569604 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.
L569603 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ Late one night. About three. At the plaza.
L569602 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Huh?
L569601 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ I know. I could have picked you up.
L569600 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Com'on, Travis. It's not that bad. I take lots of taxis.
L569598 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ The full moon. One night I had three or four weirdos in a row and I looked up and, sure enough, there it was -- the full moon.
L569597 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ The moon?
L569596 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. Especially when the moon's out.
L569595 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ That's really something.
L569594 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ I shut the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't going to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him.
L569593 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ What did you do?
L569592 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ He'd been shot. I didn't know that. He just crawled into the back seat, said "West 45th Street" and conked out.
L569591 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Really?
L569590 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ Just people people, you know. Just people.  Had a dead man once.
L569589 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ What kind of people?
L569588 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ Yeah, well...  In a cab you get to meet people. You meet lotsa people. It's good for you.
L569587 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ After this job, I'm looking forward to being alone for a while.
L569586 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ I had a regular job for a while, days. You know, doin' this, doin' that. But I didn't have anything to do at night. I got kinda lonely, you know, just wandering around. So I decided to works nights. It ain't good to be alone, you know.
L569585 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
L569584 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much.
L569583 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Where do you live?
L569582 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ I can believe that.
L569581 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Travis, I never ever met anybody like you before.
L569580 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ I know what you mean. I've got the same problems. I just can't get things organized. Little things, I mean. Like my room, my possessions. I should get one of those signs that says, "One of these days I'm gonna get organezizied"
L569579 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ We've signed up 15,000 Palantine volunteers in New York so far. The organizational problems are becoming just staggering.
L569575 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Thank you, Travis.
L569574 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ My name is Travis.
L569573 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Yes?
L569572 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ Oh, I appreciate that, Betsy mam. I'll be here at four o'clock exactly.  And... ah... Betsy...
L569571 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ All right.  All right. I'm taking a break at four o'clock. If you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie.
L569570 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you.
L569569 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ I don't know...
L569568 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ Well, Betsy mam, I drive by this place here in my taxi many times a day. And I watch you sitting here at this big long desk with these telephones, and I say to myself, that's a lonely girl. She needs a friend. And I'm gonna be her friend. 
L569567 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Why?
L569566 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ If you don't mind, mam, I'd be mighty pleased if you'd go out and have some coffee and pie with me.
L569565 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do?
L569564 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at night.
L569563 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Well, we're all working tonight.
L569562 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ If you don't mind, mam, I'd rather work for you.
L569561 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ If you talk to Tom, he'll assign you to something.
L569560 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ I'm a good worker, Betsy mam, a real good worker.
L569559 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Well, that's not exactly what the Senator has proposed. You might not want to canvass, but there is plenty more other work we need done: Office work, filing, poster hanging.
L569556 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ Yes, mam.
L569555 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ You want to canvass?
L569554 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ Oh, I think he's a wonderful man. Make a great, great President.
L569553 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Charles Palantine. The man you want to volunteer to help elect president.
L569552 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ Who mam?
L569551 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Is that so?  But what do you think of Charles Palantine?
L569835 +++$+++ u3138 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Now look more closely. Look around the eyes and chin. See? See there?
L569834 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ No, I don't think so.  That's someone else.
L569832 +++$+++ u3138 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Just follow me.
L569831 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ What is it? I'm busy.
L569830 +++$+++ u3138 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Betsy, come over here a moment.
L569544 +++$+++ u3138 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Show me how he did that again.
L569543 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ No, this is young -- well, I'm never sure how old Black people are -- but, anyway, he isn't old. That's for sure.
L569542 +++$+++ u3138 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I know that guy. His hand looks like a paw. An old Black guy, the newsstand at --
L569541 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.
L569540 +++$+++ u3138 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ With the other hand, right?
L569539 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ First, he's not Italian. Second he's not a thief. I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change -- the right change. Two of his fingers are missing. Just stubs. Like they were blown away. I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a cigarette. I couldn't help watching. I was dying to see how he'd light it.
L569538 +++$+++ u3138 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I don't know. Maybe they don't leave a canary. Don't be technical. What I'm saying is if this newsstand guy's Italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief.
L569537 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?
L569536 +++$+++ u3138 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Don't be naive. They can't kill everybody. They have different punishments for different things. Like, if they kill a stool pigeon, they leave a canary on the body. It's symbolic.
L569535 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ As I said, he isn't Italian. Besides, I thought they just killed them.
L569534 +++$+++ u3138 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Well, If he had been Italian, they could have been shot off. Sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson, If they blow a job or something.
L569533 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ He's Black, OK?
L569532 +++$+++ u3138 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ You sure he's not Italian?
L569531 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ No, why?
L569530 +++$+++ u3138 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Is he Italian?
L569529 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ He happens to be missing fingers. I first noticed when --
L569528 +++$+++ u3138 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand, Mr. Asbestos...
L569527 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ No. I just wanted to see if you could light it that way. The guy at the newsstand can.
L569526 +++$+++ u3138 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I'm great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose.
L569525 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Oh, are you all right?
L569524 +++$+++ u3138 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Ouch!
L569523 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ This I gotta see.
L569522 +++$+++ u3138 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ This is gotta be a game, right?
L569521 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Try holding the match like this.
L569466 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ I don't know -- but it feels like a long time.
L569465 +++$+++ u3138 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ How long has he been there?
L569464 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ That taxi driver. The one that's been sitting here.
L569463 +++$+++ u3138 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ What taxi driver?
L569462 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us?
L569461 +++$+++ u3138 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ No, why?
L569460 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Have you been noticing anything strange?
L569459 +++$+++ u3138 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Sure we could run him. You realize he's already head of his block association.
L569458 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ That's the last. The finish. Period. Some people can learn. Some people can't. And you wonder why we never get serious --
L569457 +++$+++ u3138 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Well, if Cronkite's so great, why don't we run him instead?
L569456 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Alright, now. You want to know why CBS has the highest ratings? You think their news is any different from NBC, ABC? It's all the same news. Same stories. Same order usually. What, you thought they had good news for people, right? You thought that's why people watched CBS? I'll tell you why people watch CBS. Cronkite. The man. You got it? Not the news, not the issues, the man. If Walter Cronkite told people to eat soap, they'd do it. We are selling cars, goddamn it.
L569455 +++$+++ u3138 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ With who?
L569454 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Maybe if you'd try thinking once in a while, you'd get somewhere.
L569453 +++$+++ u3138 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Kidding around... you know, fun.
L569452 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Just what?
L569451 +++$+++ u3138 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just...
L569450 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,
L569449 +++$+++ u3138 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ More people watch it.
L569448 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings?
L569447 +++$+++ u3138 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Well, for Christsakes, you sound like you're selling... I don't know what... cars... not issues.
L569446 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Oh, Tom, please.
L569445 +++$+++ u3138 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Just didn't get around to it, huh?
L569444 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ No, I didn't forget "sexy".
L569443 +++$+++ u3138 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ You forgot "sexy".
L569442 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ First push the man, then the issue. Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man.
L569441 +++$+++ u3138 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the issues.
L569440 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway.
L569439 +++$+++ u3138 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?
L569438 +++$+++ u3129 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ BETSY +++$+++ Tom, come here a moment.  I think this canvas report is about ready to go out. Check it out with Andy, and if he okays if, have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county.  And don't forget to add the new photo releases.
L569434 +++$+++ u3130 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ CONCESSION GIRL +++$+++ That's a dollar forty-seven.
L569433 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ That's fine.
L569432 +++$+++ u3130 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ CONCESSION GIRL +++$+++ We don't have ju-jukes. We don't have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal Crown Cola.
L569431 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ No, no, it's alright. I'll have a big Coca-Cola -- without ice -- and a large buttered popcorn, and...  ...some of them chocolate covered malted milk balls... and ju-jukes, a box. They last.
L569430 +++$+++ u3130 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ CONCESSION GIRL +++$+++ Ya want me to call da boss? Huh? That what you want?
L569429 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ No, I'm serious, really...
L569428 +++$+++ u3130 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ CONCESSION GIRL +++$+++ Awh, come off it, Pal.
L569427 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ What is your name? My name is Travis.
L569785 +++$+++ u3140 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ And the kid says, "Yeah. She's about 19, good-lookin." McCall says, "What can I tell you?"
L569784 +++$+++ u3131 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ DOUGH-BOY +++$+++ Fuckin' One-Ball.
L569781 +++$+++ u3140 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ That's the guy. Eddie calls him up and says, "Hey, what do you want me to do. I'm over here at Poly Prep. I got a girl in the back and she doesn't have the fare. She wants me to come in back and collect. What should I do?
L569780 +++$+++ u3131 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ DOUGH-BOY +++$+++ One-Ball McCall?
L569779 +++$+++ u3140 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ ...he called up the Dispatcher last night. Charlie McCall, our dispatcher...
L569520 +++$+++ u3131 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ DOUGH-BOY +++$+++ Support my kids. Can you dig it?  Nice to meet ya, Travis. So long, Wizard. Say hello to Malcolm X for me. 
L569519 +++$+++ u3140 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ What ya gonna do with all that money, Dough-Boy?
L569518 +++$+++ u3131 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ DOUGH-BOY +++$+++ Well, if there's this many hackies inside, there must be lots of fares outside. And I'm gonna hustle 'em.
L569517 +++$+++ u3140 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ I never use mine. But it's a good thing to have. Just as a threat.
L569516 +++$+++ u3131 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ DOUGH-BOY +++$+++ For a fee.
L569515 +++$+++ u3140 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ For a fee.
L569514 +++$+++ u3131 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ DOUGH-BOY +++$+++ Truck drivers bring up Harlem Specials that blow up in your hand. But this guy don't deal no shit. Just quality. If you ever need anything, I can put you in touch.
L569513 +++$+++ u3140 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ The cops and company raise hell they find out.
L569512 +++$+++ u3131 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ DOUGH-BOY +++$+++ Well, you ever need one, I know a feller that kin getcha a real nice deal. Lotsa shit around.
L569506 +++$+++ u3140 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what it is.
L569505 +++$+++ u3131 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ DOUGH-BOY +++$+++ You run all over town, don't you, Travis?
L569498 +++$+++ u3131 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ DOUGH-BOY +++$+++ Look who's talking?  Who else would stay up all night to catch the morning rush hour?
L569497 +++$+++ u3140 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.
L569496 +++$+++ u3131 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ DOUGH-BOY +++$+++ Yeah. We went to Harvard together. 
L569494 +++$+++ u3131 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ DOUGH-BOY +++$+++ A real skunk.
L569493 +++$+++ u3140 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ She stayed in the cab, what's she gonna do? But she stiffed me. A real skunk.
L569492 +++$+++ u3131 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ DOUGH-BOY +++$+++ And what happened?
L569491 +++$+++ u3140 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ Well, I said, "Lady, please, we're on a bridge..."
L569490 +++$+++ u3131 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ DOUGH-BOY +++$+++ You said that?
L569489 +++$+++ u3140 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ Sure. What do you think? She wanted to get out of the cab. I said "Look, you're in the middle of the fucking bridge..."
L569486 +++$+++ u3140 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ What was I supposed to do? I was watching in the rear view. You know, just checkin' traffic.  So howsit?
L569485 +++$+++ u3131 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ DOUGH-BOY +++$+++ Yeah.
L569484 +++$+++ u3140 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ Threw on the emergency, jumped the seat and fucked her brains out -- What do you think!  What do I have to do? Draw you a picture?
L569483 +++$+++ u3131 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ DOUGH-BOY +++$+++ What did you do?
L569482 +++$+++ u3140 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ Well, she was trying to keep her skirt down, sort of, you know. But it was pretty obvious what she was doing. I mean, Christ, it was rush hour and the traffic's practically standing still.
L569481 +++$+++ u3131 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ DOUGH-BOY +++$+++ Could you see anything?
L569480 +++$+++ u3140 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ Yeah.
L569479 +++$+++ u3131 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ DOUGH-BOY +++$+++ No.
L569478 +++$+++ u3140 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ Well, whatever the fuck it is, she used it. And then the spray perfume. You know, the real sweat kind -- and, on top of that, get this, right when we're crossing the Tri-boro bridge -- she changes her pantyhose!
L569477 +++$+++ u3140 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ Ask Travis. He's the ladies man.
L569476 +++$+++ u3131 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ DOUGH-BOY +++$+++ Yeah, that's Blush-On. My wife uses it,
L569473 +++$+++ u3140 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ The kind with a brush.
L569472 +++$+++ u3131 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ DOUGH-BOY +++$+++ Not rouge. Blush-On, they call it.
L569471 +++$+++ u3140 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ WIZARD +++$+++ First she did her make-up. You know, I hate it when they do that. I mean she does the whole works, the mascara, the eye-shadow, the lipstick, the rouge...
L569723 +++$+++ u3131 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ DOUGH-BOY +++$+++ Yeah. Hey thanks. That's real nice, Travis.
L569722 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ 20 bucks?
L569511 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ Nah.  I suppose not.
L569510 +++$+++ u3131 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ DOUGH-BOY +++$+++ You carry a piece? You need one?
L569509 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ I have.
L569508 +++$+++ u3131 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ DOUGH-BOY +++$+++ I mean, you handle some pretty rough traffic, huh?
L569507 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ Huh?
L569504 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ In the jungle. 122nd.
L569503 +++$+++ u3131 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ DOUGH-BOY +++$+++ Where.
L569502 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ No, just some crazy fucker. Cut half his ear off.
L569501 +++$+++ u3131 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ DOUGH-BOY +++$+++ Stick up?
L569488 +++$+++ u3131 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ DOUGH-BOY +++$+++ Stick up?
L569487 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
L570019 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ My work may take me out of New York.
L570018 +++$+++ u3132 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ What do you mean?
L570017 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ I want to -- what else can I do with my money?  You may not see me again -- for a while.
L570016 +++$+++ u3132 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ You don't have to.
L570015 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ I'll give you the money to go. I don't want you to take any from those guys.
L570014 +++$+++ u3132 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ I sure hate to go alone...
L570013 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ I can't. Otherwise, I would.
L570012 +++$+++ u3132 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ Sure you don't want to come with me?
L570011 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ I think you should go home, but otherwise I think you should go. It would be great for you. You have to get away from here. The city's a sewer, you gotta get out of it.
L570010 +++$+++ u3132 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ Do you really think I should go to the commune?
L570009 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ Well, Iris, I look at it this way. A lot of girls come into my cab, some of them very beautiful. And I figure all day long men have been after them: trying to touch them, talk to them, ask them out. And they hate it. So I figure the best I can do for them is not bother them at all. So I don't say a thing. I pretend I'm not even there. I figure they'll understand that and appreciate me for it.
L570008 +++$+++ u3132 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ You're not much with girls, are you?
L570007 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
L570006 +++$+++ u3132 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.
L570005 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ I don't know. Just should, though.  Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.
L570004 +++$+++ u3132 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ How?
L570003 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ You can't leave 'em to do the same to other girls. You should get rid of them.
L570002 +++$+++ u3132 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ Sport never treated me bad, honest. Never beat me up once.
L570001 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ Cops don't do nothin.
L570000 +++$+++ u3132 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ What should I do? Call the cops?
L569999 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ You just gonna leave 'em?
L569998 +++$+++ u3132 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls.
L569997 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ What are you going to do about Sport and that old bastard?
L569996 +++$+++ u3132 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ God, I don't know who's weirder, you or me.
L569995 +++$+++ u3132 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ Yeah.
L569994 +++$+++ u3139 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ TRAVIS +++$+++ Do I look like a narc?
L569993 +++$+++ u3132 +++$+++ m205 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ You a narc?
