L53427 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ It's big, right Jahn?
L53426 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Puppet theatre, don't you need something a little bigger?
L53425 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Well, it's like I said, there's a ton of empty buildings around here and most of them were apparently given back to the city, so they're not private.... Now, Jahn here is an drama student at the University. He knows of a building that they were going to turn into a puppet theatre - they even began work on it, until they ran out of money.
L53424 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Okay, we're listening. But I'm with Katka on this one.
L53419 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ No "if's" or "but's" it's a cinch. Do you want to know what the icing is?
L53418 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Amazing, he didn't even say "if".
L53417 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Well, providing we're treated like Czechs and we squat something that's not privately owned, we should be in the clear; at least DOUG  until they get an eviction order and bring in the bailiffs.
L53416 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Care to elaborate?
L53415 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Good news comrades, it's better than we'd hoped. Lubosh filled me in on the legal side of squatting here and it's a piece of cake.
L53399 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ These guys think the West is just MTV and Hollywood movies. We've got to show them there's more to it.
L53398 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Like Custer huh?
L53397 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Maybe, but someone's got to make a stand.
L53396 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ He's not drunk, he's crazy.
L53393 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ You've got to stop using that word "we" it's getting kind of scary. Right Katka?
L53392 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ What we need is a space for real performance art. A cultural exchange for radical expressionism.
L53390 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ So? DOUG Well, there's tons of empty buildings - why don't we get one?
L53389 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Right and not just the bar, Lubosh and his mates took the whole freakin' building.
L53388 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Squatted it.
L53387 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ No, it's the whole idea behind it. How did they get this place?
L53386 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ I ain't sure poetry will go down too well here.
L53385 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ An alternative literary venue!
L53384 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Oh yeah, what's that?
L53382 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Still, fifty cents ain't bad.
L53381 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ This place is getting expensive too, used to be twelve.
L53380 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Fifteen crowns.
L53379 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ What did the beer cost?
L53378 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Hmm..Smells good. Cheers!
L53377 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ That's Lubosh, the greatest fiddle player in Prague. You must have seen him playing with Johnny on the bridge. ......Come on, let's grab a table.
L53376 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Who's your friend?
L53361 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Give'em a break Doug, all it takes is a little work.
L53360 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Just because they've got a choice of four McDonalds, doesn't mean they can afford a cheeseburger.
L53359 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ What's that? Free!
L53358 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ It all comes down to ideology and they've lost theirs. If I'd been here ten years ago, maybe they wouldn't be in the mess they are today.
L53357 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Yeah and they manage to go to bourgeois joints!
L53356 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ I don't have the money for those Bourgeois traps. Hell, I'm making what a Czech earns.
L53355 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Never heard of K-MART?
L53354 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ No, just crap. I want some picture frames.
L53353 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Anything in it?
L53348 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Yeah, let's check out the low-life.
L53347 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ What about that squat bar you showed me, is that open on a Sunday?
L53342 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ You're outnumbered Kat two to one, got to go with the majority, that's democracy.
L53341 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Sorry Katka, but I'm with Doug on this.
L53335 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Well, this place is too expensive so you've had it.
L53334 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ We're only joking.....It is your round though!
L53333 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ You guys having a go a me or what?
L53330 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ And not even then sometimes.
L53329 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Inspirations a fickle thing, you don't realise you had it till it's gone.
L53324 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ No you don't get it. Every cabby in town knows this joint. So where's the mystery, the danger?
L53323 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ But we are underground?
L53322 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Yeah, but it's not just that. To the Czech mind, any movement, whether political or literary should be underground. If it isn't, then it's not radical and not worthy of a look-in.
L53321 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Because it's in English?
L53320 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Yeah right!....I don't know, something isn't right with this place, it's all too sterile and staged. Do you ever wonder why there's no Czechs here?
L53319 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ How to make a buck!
L53318 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Wanker more like, what does he know about writing.
L53317 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Son of the American ambassador and a banker - good enough?
L53316 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ What is it with that Josh guy? Who does he think he is shoving that Reflections rag down our throats?
L53299 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Yeah, group bloody therapy time.
L53298 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Fresh from the shrink I'd say!
L53289 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ What's that? A Democrat with an attitude!
L53288 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ He_s the closest we've got to an intellectual.
L54258 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Turn around quick!
L54257 +++$+++ u3805 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Doug?
L54256 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ There shooting at something.
L54255 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Yeah....Shit, those guys have guns.
L54254 +++$+++ u3805 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ It's that one isn't it.
L54253 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Follow that Budjovice sign.
L54252 +++$+++ u3805 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Okay, but I don't want to miss him.
L54251 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Jesus Holly, we got enough time.
L54249 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Yeah!
L54248 +++$+++ u3805 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ That one?
L54247 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Take this exit.
L54232 +++$+++ u3805 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Good we'll take Josh's Jeep, come on!
L54231 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Yeah, pretty well.
L54230 +++$+++ u3805 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ No, by road?
L54229 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Sure, it's on the red metro line you....
L54228 +++$+++ u3805 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Do you know the way?
L54227 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Well, he should be on his way back to his apartment by now.
L54225 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Sure I'm sure!
L54224 +++$+++ u3805 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ You're sure?
L54223 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ No!
L54222 +++$+++ u3805 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ You mean, Josh's father had nothing to do with it?
L54221 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Josh didn't get Doug out of jail, he did a deal in return for some computer disks we'd held onto.
L54220 +++$+++ u3805 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ In return for Doug's freedom, I was never to see him again, I had to - it was his only chance.
L54219 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L54218 +++$+++ u3805 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ It was a condition of getting Doug out.
L54217 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ What?
L54216 +++$+++ u3805 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ I made a deal with Josh.
L54215 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Listen, Doug took the rap for us all so grab your coat 'cause you're going.
L54214 +++$+++ u3805 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ You don't understand, I can't!
L54213 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Look, I don't care whether you go with Doug or not, but you_ve got to see him before he leaves.
L54212 +++$+++ u3805 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ I can't go with him.
L53997 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ We ain't going to give it away this time, are we?
L53996 +++$+++ u3805 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ Yeah, no problem.
L53818 +++$+++ u3805 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ HOLLY +++$+++ I'm not hungry, really.
L53817 +++$+++ u3801 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Time for lunch I think. I'll get the sandwiches. What would you like Holly?
L54064 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Sure, they wanted to know if I ever voted Conservative.
L54063 +++$+++ u3802 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DIPLOMAT +++$+++ Before you go, did you get those bruises here?
L54062 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Regards to Her Majesty.
L54061 +++$+++ u3802 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DIPLOMAT +++$+++ Well a plea of ignorance won't go far here. Frankly, I think you deserve everything that's coming.
L54060 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ They didn't look like medical files to me.
L54059 +++$+++ u3802 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DIPLOMAT +++$+++ Well, I'll try and get that clarified. As I understand it though, the charges include break and enter, theft, trespass, operating an unlicensed facility, vandalism and destruction of government documents - Whatever possessed you to start destroying people's medical records?
L54058 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ No!
L54057 +++$+++ u3802 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DIPLOMAT +++$+++ Now, have you been read your rights and are you aware of the charges?
L54056 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ No!
L54055 +++$+++ u3802 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DIPLOMAT +++$+++ I see, would you like us to inform her of your situation?
L54054 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ That's my mum's.
L54053 +++$+++ u3802 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DIPLOMAT +++$+++ Your home address is 18 Thornton Avenue, Coventry.
L54052 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Yes.
L54051 +++$+++ u3802 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DIPLOMAT +++$+++ Date of birth, November the fourth nineteen-sixty-two.
L54050 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Yes.
L54049 +++$+++ u3802 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DIPLOMAT +++$+++ Now - Your name is Douglas Greenwell, yes?
L54048 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ So am I.
L54047 +++$+++ u3802 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DIPLOMAT +++$+++ I don't know what it is with you bloody hooligans. Not content with causing trouble back home, YOU idiots have to go off and wreak havoc throughout the whole of Europe. And when finally, the police do catch up with you, you expect us to wave a magic wand and get you out, well not this time, I'm sorry.
L54046 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ You mean your NOT going to spring me?
L54045 +++$+++ u3802 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DIPLOMAT +++$+++ I'm just here to record some details, standard stuff.
L54044 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Good morning.
L54015 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Yeah, maybe.
L54014 +++$+++ u3811 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ LAWRENCE +++$+++ Turned Czech huh?
L53779 +++$+++ u3811 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ LAWRENCE +++$+++ I'll take a rain-check for now.
L53778 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ I could pencil you in if you like?
L53777 +++$+++ u3811 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ LAWRENCE +++$+++ Really?
L53776 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ We should be done by the weekend.
L53775 +++$+++ u3811 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ LAWRENCE +++$+++ Hmm, I see possibilities but you got a lot to do.
L53774 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ I'd like to talk with you about doing some performance poetry here....A weekly thing.
L53687 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Here's the details.
L53686 +++$+++ u3811 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ LAWRENCE +++$+++ Sure. Excellent.
L53685 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ No! Look Lawrence, I've taken over the lease on a theatre downtown and I'm throwing a party tomorrow night to show it off. It's going to be for alternative arts, but I need some help to finish it off, can you put the word out?
L53684 +++$+++ u3811 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ LAWRENCE +++$+++ Have you met Holly? Josh's friend.
L53683 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ I've been around.
L53682 +++$+++ u3811 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ LAWRENCE +++$+++ Doug, haven't seen you for a while.
L53681 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Hey, Lawrence how are you doing mate?
L54161 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Not this time, Kat.
L54160 +++$+++ u3810 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ KATKA +++$+++ No, it's not true, you're lying.
L54159 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ It was a mistake, I never wanted to hurt you, but it had to end sooner or later and now, well now I love someone else.
L54158 +++$+++ u3810 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ KATKA +++$+++ But I love you!
L54157 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Forget about me Kat.
L54156 +++$+++ u3810 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ KATKA +++$+++ I'm sorry about what I said, really I am. Just take me with you, I don't care where.
L54155 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ There's nothing there for me.
L54154 +++$+++ u3810 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ KATKA +++$+++ I don't understand, it's your home?
L54153 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ No Kat, I lied to you, I hate England and I don't ever want to live there again.
L54152 +++$+++ u3810 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ KATKA +++$+++ But we could go to London and live in England.
L54151 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ I'm no good for you Katka, besides I won't be able to stay in Prague.
L54150 +++$+++ u3810 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ KATKA +++$+++ If you get out can we be together again.
L54149 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ I hope so!
L54148 +++$+++ u3810 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ KATKA +++$+++ Will it help to get you out?
L54147 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Thanks.
L54146 +++$+++ u3810 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ KATKA +++$+++ I thought for sure they would catch me.
L53666 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Look, I love you Katka but I'm twelve years older, I could never marry you, it'd be stupid, you know that!
L53665 +++$+++ u3810 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ KATKA +++$+++ Then tell me, what will happen? Tell me!
L53664 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ No, I love you, really.
L53662 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Right now, yeah - you're talking crap.
L53661 +++$+++ u3810 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ KATKA +++$+++ That's it, I am just stupid teenager, yes?
L53660 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ I'm not a bloody teenager okay, I told you I can't do that shit.
L53659 +++$+++ u3810 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ KATKA +++$+++ I could have my choice of many boyfriends and go to movies and discos but I waste my time waiting for you and then going to stupid pubs.
L53658 +++$+++ u3810 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ KATKA +++$+++ Oh sure and you will want sex, always sex.
L53657 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ That's not true, we have a great time together. I've said I'm sorry. Let's forget about it and go stop by my place, so I can get changed.
L53656 +++$+++ u3810 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ KATKA +++$+++ I thought you loved me Doug but all you want from me is sex.
L53655 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ No.
L53654 +++$+++ u3810 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ KATKA +++$+++ I think I'm stupid.....All you do is use me and expect me to wait for you.
L53652 +++$+++ u3810 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ KATKA +++$+++ Fernet and tonic.
L53651 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Beer please! Do you want another drink?
L53488 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Yeah, you're right.... I've got an idea!
L53487 +++$+++ u3810 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ KATKA +++$+++ No way Doug, I can't.
L53486 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ I want you so bad. She'll be asleep soon, maybe we could do it quietly under the sheets.
L53485 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ It's bad news when you can't even bribe kids.
L53484 +++$+++ u3810 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ KATKA +++$+++ She's tired.
L53473 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Let's have a look anyway.
L53472 +++$+++ u3810 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ KATKA +++$+++ Everybody is at home, it's no good.
L53471 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ I hope you're going to invite me in?
L53470 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ No, not just yet.
L53469 +++$+++ u3810 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ KATKA +++$+++ So, we won't be going to London?
L53468 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Kat, I'm in paradise. I don't ever want to leave.
L53467 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Nonsense, we can pick up the tram on the other side, it won't take any longer. Come on!
L53466 +++$+++ u3810 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ KATKA +++$+++ We should go to the Metro it's quicker.
L53465 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Let's walk over the bridge, we haven't done that for a while.
L53463 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ I'm sorry but it's been a crazy evening. I'm going to make that place into something big. God, I love you!
L53462 +++$+++ u3810 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ KATKA +++$+++ It's not fair, you hardly talked to me tonight.
L53458 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Alright, I'm coming. It's the perfect place Jahn, thanks.
L53457 +++$+++ u3810 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ KATKA +++$+++ Doug you said you wouldn't be long. Come on, I've got to go. Now!
L53442 +++$+++ u3803 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ DOUG +++$+++ Okay, whatever. Come on Chris!
L53441 +++$+++ u3810 +++$+++ m251 +++$+++ KATKA +++$+++ I'm not going in Doug. I'll wait for you here.
