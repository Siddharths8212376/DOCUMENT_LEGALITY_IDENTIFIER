L112697 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ That's the stuff. I call it the Red Lion. Very king-of-the-jungle.
L112696 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Is this what you gave Mary?
L112695 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ Sleep is all stress reduction. Here.  You take one of these, sleep two hours, that's all you need.  Why do you think I'm telling you this, Frank--for my health?  You ought to look at yourself in the mirror, man. Kanita, get him a glass of water.
L112694 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I should be going. I just quit.
L112693 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ Red Death?  Tell me something, Frank--does killing your clients make good business sense to you? The kids selling that shit have no sense. They'll be taken care of, don't worry about that.
L112692 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Did you give Mary something called Red Death?
L112691 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ That shit is poison, Frank. We don't drink alcohol here. What you need is one of these.
L112690 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Got a beer?
L112689 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ I'm always interested in people in stressful occupations and being a paramedic is about as stressful as I can imagine. Here, sit down. What's it like? Tell me some war stories.
L112687 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Mary, we really have to go.
L112686 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ She wanted something to help her sleep.
L112681 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I better just go in and see her.
L112680 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ I know, but she told me to tell you she wants to crash here a few hours. Terrible about her father, isn't it?
L112679 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ She asked me to pick her up.
L112678 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ Sleeping in the back.
L112677 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Where is she?
L112676 +++$+++ u4255 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ COATES +++$+++ Mary said you might be coming.
L112675 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Frank Pierce.
L112639 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Ten-four.
L112638 +++$+++ u4256 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ DISPATCHER LOVE +++$+++ Male diff breather, approximately 30, Houston and A.
L112637 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Let's do it!  It's Marcus, Love, only for you.
L112580 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Ten-four, hon.
L112579 +++$+++ u4256 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ DISPATCHER LOVE +++$+++ You're going to three-four Avenue C, 17 year-old female cardiac arrest, no further information.
L112578 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Don't worry, hon. Young is here and he's gonna help out--just remember, you owe me.
L112577 +++$+++ u4256 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ DISPATCHER LOVE +++$+++ I can't wait all night, Young. I'm holding a priority and if you don't answer I'm going to knock you out of service.
L112576 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ She said to me, I love the way you talk on the radio.
L112575 +++$+++ u4256 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ DISPATCHER LOVE +++$+++ Twelve Young, answer the radio. I have a call for you.
L112456 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Ten-four, hon.  This is for you.
L112455 +++$+++ u4256 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ DISPATCHER LOVE +++$+++ I'm not your baby, Young, I'm not your mother either. You're going to a cardiac arrest, Avenue C and Ninth, northeast corner. It's a club. Take the side entrance.
L112454 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ I usually don't do calls before coffee. But I think it might do you some good.  Twelve Young is here and I'm gonna take care of you, baby. Don't you worry about a thing, yahear, cause Marcus is alive and on arrival.
L112453 +++$+++ u4256 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ DISPATCHER LOVE +++$+++ Twelve Young, I don't have time for your games. Now answer me or do I have to come out there myself?
L112472 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ What'd you mean IB Bangin? What kind of name is IB Bangin?
L112471 +++$+++ u4257 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ DRUMMER +++$+++ IB Bangin.
L112470 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ What's his name?
L112469 +++$+++ u4257 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ DRUMMER +++$+++ All right, all right, he's been snorting that Red Death stuff. Been going for four days.
L112462 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ He's dead and there's nothing we can do. Come on, Frank, that's it.
L112461 +++$+++ u4257 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ DRUMMER +++$+++ No way, man.
L112460 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ No. He's dead.
L112459 +++$+++ u4257 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ DRUMMER +++$+++ He's going to be all right, right?
L112458 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Okay, what happened?
L112908 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ The pitch, high heater. Bucky knows what's coming. He steps in, smash, over the green monster.
L112907 +++$+++ u4264 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ NOEL +++$+++ Oh man, Bucky.
L112906 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What the hell.  The next year, tiebreaker for the division, in Boston, Yanks down two to nothing, Bucky Dent steps to the plate.
L112905 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Yeah?
L112904 +++$+++ u4264 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ NOEL +++$+++ Sure, sure, give go.
L112903 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ No, I'd better not.
L112902 +++$+++ u4264 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ NOEL +++$+++ Here, you try.
L112901 +++$+++ u4264 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ NOEL +++$+++ Strawberry ain't shit. Drug pussy.  Me.  I swing like Reggie. Mr. October. Number three, game six, World Series.
L112900 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ That's a hell of a swing you got there, Noel. I'm thinking Strawberry in his prime.
L112389 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Shut up. You're going to die and he's not. Got it.
L112388 +++$+++ u4264 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ NOEL +++$+++ What did you say?
L112387 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You're not going to die.
L112364 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Well, you have your choice: pills, injection, gas.
L112363 +++$+++ u4264 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ NOEL +++$+++ Oh man, do you mean that?  Thank you man, thank you. How?
L112362 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Noel, you didn't let me finish. We have rules against killing people on the street. Looks bad, but there's a special room at the hospital for terminating. A nice quiet room with a big bed.
L112359 +++$+++ u4264 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ NOEL +++$+++ No, no medicine!
L112358 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You came out of the hospital. You were tied down and hallucinating. You got some bad chemicals in your head, Noel. There's some medicine at the hospital that will fix that.
L112357 +++$+++ u4264 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ NOEL +++$+++ See, I can't do it. I came out of the desert.
L112226 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I can't. I have to stay with my patient.
L112225 +++$+++ u4264 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ NOEL +++$+++ Excuse me. You are a very kind man. I can see that. A man like you could not refuse a poor sick dying helpless man a small cup of water.
L112944 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Come on up.
L112943 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Frank.
L112942 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Who is it?
L112870 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ There's no time.
L112869 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ This is not a good time.
L112866 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ No, the city doesn't discriminate. It gets everybody.
L112865 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.
L112864 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Can I bring you something back to eat--a falafal, some pizza?
L112863 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I wish these people would leave already. I can't listen to another story. Did you see him?  That doctor says the brain is coming around. They're waiting for the heart to stabilize. I don't know who to believe. He says they still have to keep him tied up.
L112862 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ No problem. Thanks for letting me crash. It was the best sleep I've had in months. I used some of your soap.
L112861 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ OK, last night I was weak. it won't happen again. And all that shit I said--it was just because I was stoned. Forget it.
L112860 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It'll be a while before he's up and running again.
L112859 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That they kill him. That's what I told him.
L112858 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ He'll be all right.
L112857 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I heard CY Coates was brought in. He looked pretty bad.
L112729 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Or maybe you wanna fuck me? Everyone else has.
L112728 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I need to sit down a minute.
L112727 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ What is it? You want to help me, you feel sorry for me? Keep it to yourself.
L112724 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Because you can barely walk.
L112723 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You and CY have a nice talk? He tell you about Sunrise Enterprises, helping people? Well, I've seen him hurt people. Why are you following me?
L112685 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ No, no.
L112684 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Mary. Mary, we've got to get going.
L112664 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Don't be a cop. If you have any doubts about this, it's my fault.
L112663 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ We can still go back. I'll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath.
L112662 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time.
L112661 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Fifteen minutes.
L112660 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Promise you won't go inside.
L112659 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You asked me not to come.
L112658 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I shouldn't have asked you to come.
L112657 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ No, I'll be fine. I'm just visiting a sick friend.
L112656 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you.
L112655 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ If I'm not back in fifteen minutes, hit the buzzer. That way she'll let me go.
L112654 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Maybe I should come up with you.
L112653 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'm only asking because it's a dangerous building. There's been some robberies, a woman was raped not long ago. This woman I'm seeing, she'll want to talk to me all day, but if I can point to you out the window and say you're waiting, I can be out quick. if anything happens, I'll be in apartment 16M.
L112652 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Okay.
L112651 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that.  Look, since you're here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a friend who's sick.
L112650 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Don't seem so bad to me.
L112649 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up.  I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.
L112648 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Excuse me. You seemed like you were in trouble.
L112558 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Sure.
L112557 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this.
L112556 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest.
L112555 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Maybe not. I was a different person then. Does everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this?
L112554 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I think I'd remember that.
L112553 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You must get a lot of overdoses. I bet you picked me up a couple of times.
L112552 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You learn to sort of block it out, you know, like cops fence off a crime scene. But then something good will happen and everything will just glow.
L112551 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen?
L112550 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Five years.
L112549 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ How long you been doing this?
L112548 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It's been bad lately, but it's always bad.
L112545 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Ah, no. I was.  It's hard to explain. She had a hard time adjusting to, well, maybe it was my fault too.
L112544 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You married?
L112543 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ They're fine. My old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse--I was sort of born to it, I guess.
L112542 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Like everybody else--except us. Always standing on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks. Your parents ... ?
L112541 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ We moved out after that. Upstate.
L112540 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
L112539 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
L112538 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?
L112537 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You remember that pizza place, Joe's on Tenth Street maybe fifteen years ago?  When you ordered a pie it came with a little plastic madonna in the middle?
L112536 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Not as good as Nino's.
L112535 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It's best not to ...  It's good pizza, huh?
L112534 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ My father was a great man, you know. There was nobody he wouldn't help. You know that crazy guy Noel who I gave water to last night? He lived in our house for almost a year. A total stranger he'd do anything for, his own family though ...
L112530 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Look, I'm sorry, but it's important to me. I mean, a week ago I was wishing he was dead. And now I want hear his voice again, just once more-- you know what I mean?
L112529 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ He's better.
L112528 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ He's better, though, right?
L112527 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ That's how it's done. You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
L112526 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You sure? I know my father would hate to be tied down. He wouldn't even go to the dentist.
L112525 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ He wants to pull that tube out. It's pretty painful--that's why they keep him sedated--but it's a good sign.
L112512 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Okay.
L112511 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Be tough to get a taxi here. We can give you a ride if you like.
L112510 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You can't kill my father that easy. He'll fight forever. Like with me: hasn't talked to me in three years. But it's okay. Sometimes you have to put things behind you.
L112509 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.
L112508 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Sleeping.
L112507 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ How is she?
L112506 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I was going nuts in that waiting room so I came back to check on my mom.
L112505 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I think it looks good.
L112504 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I know. It's awful, isn't it? Night of the Living Cheerleaders.
L112503 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You look so different.
L112502 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I knew. I sensed it when I heard your voice.
L112501 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Well, the doctor says he's showing some movement. It's still early, it might mean nothing, but I thought you'd want to know.
L112500 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ He's better, isn't he?
L112499 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'll be right down.
L112498 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news.
L112497 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Yes?
L112415 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'd take her, but then who would stay here?
L112414 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ She should go home.
L112413 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ My father's in a coma, now my mother's going crazy. It's like she's in a trance.
L112412 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Thing is, I'm supposed to be the fuckup. The one on the stretcher in there--that's supposed to be me. With my parents crying out here. I got a lot of guilt, you know what I mean?
L112411 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ He's working a double shift.
L112410 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.
L112409 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ No.
L112408 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Did you see my father?
L112407 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Our Lady of Misery.
L112406 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I think this place stinks.
L112405 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Yes.
L112404 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ He's dead, huh?
L112403 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Yes.
L112402 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ That boy you brought in, he was shot, wasn't he?
L112400 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ That's my brother's problem. He's passed out inside.
L112399 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It's okay. They're prescription.  Works better with a little whiskey.
L112398 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You shouldn't smoke.
L112333 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ That's what I told her. If she could just see him a second, then I could take her home.
L112332 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out now.
L112331 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Right now, I'm more worried about my mother than anything. They won't let her see my father.
L112330 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Even when you say the things, there's always more things.
L112329 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, I thought of all these other things I wanted to say.
L112328 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ At least he's got people around him.
L112327 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I mean if he was dead, I could handle that.
L112326 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You never know.
L112325 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ It's the waiting that's killing me, not knowing, you know? It's really hard on my mother. The doctor doesn't think my father'll make it. He says he was dead too long, after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door.
L112324 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ The first is always the best.
L112323 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ It's my first cigarette in over a year.
L112258 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ It's not so rare. He grew up on our street. He's had a rough life and he's a little crazy from it, but that's no excuse for not giving someone a lousy cup of water.
L112257 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I wouldn't do that.  The doctor seems to think he's suffering from some rare disorder.
L112253 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I guess there's always a chance.
L112252 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Is there any chance?
L112251 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ We'd better go outside. Quickly.
L112250 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I know him. That's Noel.
L112249 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ He's very very sick.
L112207 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ His heart's beating.
L112206 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Is he going to be alright?
L112201 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ John, play the Sinatra.
L112200 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Music. I think it helps if you play something he liked.
L112199 +++$+++ u4263 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ What?
L112198 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Do you have any music?
L112644 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ You can't leave me now.
L112643 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I quit! I'm through!
L112642 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Where you going?
L112634 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Greatest job in the world.
L112633 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Here's to the greatest job in the world.
L112632 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I'll drink to that.
L112631 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Please, a little decorum if you will. What I was going to say is, is that holding that baby in my arms, I felt like I was twenty-one again. A call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week, not two, start running again, cut down on the drinking.
L112630 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I hate vodka.
L112628 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I don't want to hear about it, okay? That's three jobs for the night. It's over. Three jobs and time for a drink. Six am, the cocktail hour. Pass the bottle; I know you're holding.
L112627 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ We just saved a little baby boy. Think of it that way.
L112626 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You know what I'm talking about. It's all over your face. That I-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look.
L112625 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ What look?
L112624 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Don't give me that look.
L112604 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ It's coming.
L112603 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Backup?
