L430903 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Before you start picking your nose, I know he put you up to it.
L430902 +++$+++ u6946 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Hi there...
L430901 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ You...
L430068 +++$+++ u6948 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PHONE +++$+++ Huh?  Uh, yeah-- I've gotta run. Tell Dwayne hi.  Maybe someday we can all get together.
L430067 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Venice?  I love Venice.  With the boats, right?...
L430066 +++$+++ u6948 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PHONE +++$+++ I'm on my way to Venice.  Why?
L430065 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Where are you going?
L430064 +++$+++ u6948 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PHONE +++$+++ Well, he'd have to hurry.  My flight leaves at four o'clock.
L430063 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
L430062 +++$+++ u6948 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PHONE +++$+++ I'm at the airport.  Why?
L430061 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ WAIT!!  Where are you?
L430060 +++$+++ u6948 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PHONE +++$+++ Right.  Thanks a lot.  And congratulations.  It's not easy finding love these days.
L430059 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Damon Bradley...
L430058 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I can hardly hear you.  Could you spell that?
L430057 +++$+++ u6948 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PHONE +++$+++ My name's 
L430056 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I'm sure he'll be sorry to hear that.  Who should I tell him called?
L430055 +++$+++ u6948 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PHONE +++$+++ Oh, hi.  I'm an old high school buddy of Dwayne's.  I was in town this weekend, was hoping to stop by and surprise him. But I've gotta catch a plane so I'm afraid I'm not gonna be able to make it.
L430054 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ This is his fiancee.  Who's this?
L430053 +++$+++ u6948 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PHONE +++$+++ Who's this?
L430052 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ He's not in at the moment.  Can I take a message?
L430051 +++$+++ u6948 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PHONE +++$+++ Dwayne Pinsley?  I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
L430050 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Hello?  Is anybody there?
L430982 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I brought you that, too.
L430981 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I was hoping for the real thing.
L430896 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ There is no us.
L430895 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Look, I just thought if you finally got rid of this obsession with this name, if you could get it out of your system once and for all, then maybe you'd be able to stop waiting and open your heart to someone real.  Granted, ideally, me.  I didn't do it to hurt you.  I did it for you.  I did it for us...
L430894 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ If you had wanted to, you'd have gone home.
L430893 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
L430892 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ And this is the thanks I get.  I did you a favor.  You never wanted to marry that joker in the first place.
L430891 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Yes.
L430890 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Really?...
L430889 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ No, it isn't.  I called off my wedding all because of you.
L430888 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Very funny.
L430887 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Gee, I'm flattered.  What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.
L430886 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yes.  I'm crazy.  You have driven me crazy.  No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you.  Did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up?  How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated?
L430885 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Rational?!  Love is not rational! Are you crazy?
L430884 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Don't you think you're overreacting just a little here?   We're talking about love, okay?  Let's be rational.
L430883 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I would call it-- unforgivable.
L430882 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What would you call it?
L430881 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ A "little white lie"?  A "little white lie"?
L430880 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ As I recall, you were on your way home.  And I didn't want you to go so, yes, I told you a little white lie.
L430879 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Well, I might've found him again if I hadn't left Rome to make this pointless trip down here with you.
L430878 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I sabotaged it?  You're the one who lost him, remember?
L430877 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
L430876 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
L430875 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I can't believe you did that!
L430874 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Alright.  The truth is... I thought we had something here.
L430872 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ No one had to tell me.  He's starring in the local play.
L430871 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about.  Who told you that?
L430870 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Who cares?!  You hired an actor??
L430869 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Reptilian swine.  There's no such thing.  Reptiles aren't swine.
L430868 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ What?
L430867 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ There's no such thing.
L430866 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ You want a hint?  I'll give you a hint.  You are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine--
L430865 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I'd call that a yes.  Do I get a hint?
L430864 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ GET OUT!!
L430863 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Is something the matter?
L430861 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Okay.  I'll meet you at the dock in ten minutes.
L430860 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
L430859 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You can't come to Southern Italy and not see the Blue Grotto.
L430855 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ In that case... no...
L430854 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Yes.  I am.
L430853 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Are you asking me out?
L430852 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Thank you.  So, since I have a few more days of vacation left, I was wondering if maybe you'd want to do something sometime.  I mean, you know, if you don't have... other plans.
L430851 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Well.  Congratulations.
L430850 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ No.  I mean yes, I'm not.  I decided to call it off.  Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.
L430849 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You aren't?
L430848 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Yeah...  Well, anyway, I also wanted to tell you, I'm not getting married.
L430847 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I know the feeling.
L430846 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ It seems like ever since I found out about this guy, this name, I've been kind of crazy.  Like I was on drugs or something.
L430845 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ No.  I just came by to apologize.
L430844 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ No.  Are you're leaving?
L430843 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Hi.  Are you... busy?
L430842 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Hi.
L430814 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ No.  Course not.
L430813 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Promise me you won't leave without saying goodbye.
L430810 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ No, it was more than that.  It was very generous of you.  It was very kind.
L430809 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yeah.  Well, was the least I could do.
L430806 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I feel like the world's biggest idiot.
L430805 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L430804 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I guess he turned out to be kind of a loser, huh?
L430803 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Yeah.
L430802 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You okay?
L430782 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Actually, I think I prefer Katherine Hepburn.
L430781 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Well, how about those old romantic movies with those great stars, huh? Like Audrey Hepburn.
L430780 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ The Boston Pops.  Season tickets.
L430779 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ How about music?  You like classical?
L430777 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ The Sun Also Rises.  For Whom the Bell Tolls.  The Old Man and the--
L430776 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Well, what about books?  You like Hemingway?  You gotta love Hemingway.
L430756 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Exactly.  Besides, no hard feelings.  You found somebody.  I found somebody. I thought we could double.
L430755 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ So were you.
L430754 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I just wanted to keep an eye on you.  The guy's a total stranger, remember?
L430753 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Why are you doing this?
L430751 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I don't know if that's such a--
L430750 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Say, I saw where they had motor boats for rent down in the harbor. Why don't we all go for an evening cruise around the bay?
L430743 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Boy, that looks tasty.  What is that?
L430742 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ You were saying...
L430728 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ We were hungry.
L430727 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L430726 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What?...
L430707 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Thank you, Peter.  Thank you so much.
L430706 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Nice dress.
L430705 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ What?
L430704 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Hey--
L430703 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ You too.
L430702 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Oh, thanks.  Well, have a good time.
L430701 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Just to that place down at the bottom of the stairs.  Nothing fancy.
L430700 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Where are you going?  Just-- out of curiosity...
L430698 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Anyway, that's why I came by.  I need to fix this button.  Do you have a needle and thread?
L430697 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Well, good.  Good for you.
L430696 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ And she's a knock-out, too.
L430695 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yeah.
L430694 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Oh.  That's nice.
L430693 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Well, it looks like we both lucked out.  I just met somebody myself. Somebody my aunt introduced me to.
L430692 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ You found him.  I don't know how to thank you.
L430691 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ So.  You found him.
L430689 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Hi.
L430688 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Hi, Peter.
L430632 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ NO.
L430631 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Do you want me to do it?
L430626 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Oh, and I forgot to tell you.  He's here with his mother.
L430625 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Right now?
L430624 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ He's out by the pool right now.
L430620 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Or Hustler.
L430619 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Mickey Spillane?
L430618 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Mickey Spillane.
L430617 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Please.  I need to know.
L430616 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I'd really rather not say.
L430615 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Tell me.
L430614 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Uh, I'd rather not say.
L430613 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ He likes to read...  Did he mention anyone in particular?
L430612 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ The guy at the hotel told me he always wears a gold medallion, and usually has a book or magazine with him.
L430605 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Because-- I want you to be happy.
L430604 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Why?
L430603 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Look, I know there's no going back for us.  That's not it.  I just want to make this up to you.  Clear my relationship karma.  And I know the area, I've got some cousins down there.  Please.  Let me do this for you.  Let this be my gift to you.
L430602 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Oh no, I don't think that would be a good idea.
L430601 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ It's in the south.  I've still got my rental car.  I can get you there by morning...
L430600 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Where's Positano?
L430599 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I went back to that restaurant and I spoke with his waiter, just on an off chance, you know, and, anyway-- he knew the name of the guy's hotel.  So, I called there, they said he left yesterday.  But, apparently he comes here every year, always follows the same route.  He always goes from here down the coast to the Le Sirenuse hotel in Positano.  I called.  And they told me he's checked in.
L430598 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Because.  I know where he is.
L430597 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Why not?
L430594 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Who says I don't love him?...
L430593 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Fine.  Okay.  Forget me.  Leave me out of it.  But don't go throwing your life away on somebody you don't love.
L430591 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Because I don't have the right name?!
L430590 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Don't you see?..  We're not the ones who are meant to be.  You're the man of somebody else's dreams.
L430589 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ No, that wasn't a lie.  That was...  a mirage.
L430588 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What about the oasis in the desert? Are you telling me that was a lie?
L430587 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ So it wasn't real.
L430586 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ So?
L430585 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking.  We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.
L430584 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ There must be something I can do, something I can say to make this up to you?...  Just tell me what it is, I'll say it.  I'll do it. I don't want you to hate me.
L430583 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ He's a podiatrist.  Pain is your body's way of telling you something is wrong.  Your toe is trying to tell you not to do it.
L430582 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ What?
L430581 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You stubbed your toe, don't you think that's a sign?
L430580 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Because I'd like to think at least one of you feels that way.  Does he  know who you are?
L430579 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Why are you asking me this?
L430578 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You didn't answer my question.
L430577 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
L430576 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Does he love you?
L430575 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ So?!  Is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe?
L430574 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ He's safe.
L430573 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Because I know who Dwayne is, and he's reliable and stable and wants to marry me.
L430571 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Yes.
L430570 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ To the foot doctor.
L430569 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Yes.
L430568 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yes?!  To be married, I suppose.
L430567 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ If it's any of your business, yes.
L430566 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Why can't you just tell me?
L430565 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You are leaving, aren't you?
L430564 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ NO.
L430563 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Are you okay?  You want some help?
L430562 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
L430561 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You're limping.
L430489 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Oh, come on...  What kind of an excuse is that?
L430488 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I'm in love with you.
L430487 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ How could you do this to me?
L430483 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ That was before I found out what it was.
L430482 +++$+++ u6947 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You said whatever it was you would understand.
L430481 +++$+++ u6940 +++$+++ m464 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ That's not the point.
