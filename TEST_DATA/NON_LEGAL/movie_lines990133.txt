L391631 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ Loretta, what are you talking about?
L391630 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ What the hell are you talking about? We're engaged.
L391583 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ No, I'll tell him.  What am I going to tell him?
L391582 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ No, I'll tell him.
L391562 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Ronny, please...
L391561 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ No. I'm gonna wait.
L391560 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ You've gotta get outta here.
L391557 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ Good! We can get this out on the table.  I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother. 
L391556 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ He's coming.
L391555 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ Is Johnny here?
L391554 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Ronny!
L391481 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ Come upstairs. I don't care why you come. No, that's not what I mean. Loretta, I love you. Not like they told you love is and I didn't know this either. But love don't make things nice, it ruins everything, it breaks your heart, it makes things a mess. We're not here to make things perfect. Snowflakes are perfect. The stars are perfect. Not us. We are here to ruin ourselves and break our hearts and love the wrong people and die! The storybooks are bullshit. Come upstairs with me, baby! Don't try to live your life out to somebody else's idea of sweet happiness. Don't try to live on milk and cookies when what you want is meat! Red meat just like me! It's wolves run with wolves and nothing else! You're a wolf just like me! Come upstairs with me and get in my bed! Come on! Come on! Come on!
L391480 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ I'm freezing to death.
L391479 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ No.
L391478 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Let me go home.
L391477 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ No.
L391476 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Let me go home.
L391475 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ I don't know. Everything seems like nothing now against that I want you in my bed. I don't care if I burn in hell. I don't care if you burn in hell. The Past and Future is a joke to me now. I see that they're nothing, I see they ain't here. The only thing that's here is you. And me. I want you to come upstairs. Now. I tried to take everything last night, like you told me, but I couldn't. I couldn't take everything in a hundred years. It's the way we are. We compound each other.
L391474 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Why not?
L391473 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ And you're not now?
L391472 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ I was.
L391471 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ I'm afraid of who I am.
L391470 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ Why?
L391469 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ I'm really afraid.
L391468 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ Yeah.
L391467 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ I went with you.  Now I'm gonna marry Johnny and you're gonna leave me alone.  Right?  A person can see where they've messed up in their life, and they can change how they do things, and they can change their Luck. Maybe my nature does draw me to you, but I don't haveta go with that. I can take hold of myself and say yes to some things and no to something that's just gonna ruin everything! I can do that. Otherwise, what is this stupid life that God gave us for what?  Ronny? Are you listening to me?
L391466 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ The deal was if I came to the Opera with you you'd leave me alone forever.
L391465 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ Yeah.
L391464 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ This is where we're going!
L391463 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ That's right.
L391462 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ This is your place.
L391461 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ We're here.
L391460 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ You're late!
L391459 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ I'm here!
L391458 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ He didn't come!
L391457 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ And what do you know? You tell me my life? I'll tell you yours. I'm a wolf? You run to the wolf in me, that don't make you no lamb! You're gonna marry my brother? Why you wanna sell your life short? Playing it safe is just about the most dangerous thing a woman like you could do. You waited for the right man the first time, why didn't you wait for the right man again?
L391456 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ I know what I know.
L391455 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ Of what? Only God can point the finger, Loretta.
L391454 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ You are guilty. I'm guilty.
L391453 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ You're making me feel guilty again.
L391452 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ How can you ask me that?
L391451 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ What's the matter?
L391449 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ Yeah. It smells like snow.
L391448 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ It's really cold.
L391447 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ I wanna go home.
L391446 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ What do you want to do now?
L391445 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ I think that's it.
L391444 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ No thanks.
L391398 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ I couldn't believe it! I didn't think she was going to die. I knew she was sick...
L391397 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ Yeah.
L391396 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Beautiful. Sad. She died!
L391395 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ Awful?
L391394 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ That was just so... awful!
L391384 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ I like parts of it, but I don't really get it.
L391383 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ It's the best thing there is.
L391382 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ They get some turnout for this stuff.
L391329 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ Come on.
L391328 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ So. Where are we sitting?
L391327 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ I don't know. For your hair. For your beautiful dress. For... you know, I feel like a man again. You know I love the Opera. You know it's been a long time since I've been to the Opera.
L391326 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ For what?
L391325 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ Thank you!
L391324 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ He was having some fun. Yeah, well he's dead.  Come on, let's go in.
L391323 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Kinda gaudy.
L391322 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ Marc Chagall. A Russian.
L391321 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Who painted that?
L391319 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ Thank you.
L391318 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ I thought I'd try it.  You look good.
L391317 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ You look beautiful. Your hair...
L391316 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Hi.
L391315 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ Hi.
L391232 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Alright. Where's the Met?
L391231 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ Alright. Meet me at the Met.
L391230 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Alright.
L391229 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ I love two things. I love you, and I love the Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night, I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.
L391228 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L391227 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera.
L391226 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ What?
L391225 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.
L391224 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ But that's cause he don't know!
L391223 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ But he wants me to come!
L391222 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ I'm telling you you can't.
L391221 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ I'll come to the wedding.
L391220 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Alright. Then I must never see you again. The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all time. You won't come to the wedding.
L391219 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ I can't!
L391218 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Snap out of it!
L391217 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ I'm in love with you!
L391216 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Why not?
L391215 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ I can't do that!
L391214 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Last night never happened, you hear me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and I are gonna take this to our coffins!
L391213 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ What?
L391212 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Oh yes, oh yes you did! You've got those bad eyes like a gypsy! Why didn't I see it yesterday! Bad Luck! Is that all I'm ever gonna have? Why didn't I just pick up a stone and kill myself years and years ago? I'm gonna marry him!
L391211 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ Oh no I didn't!
L391210 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life!
L391209 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ You ruined my life.
L391208 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ What did I do?
L391207 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ What did you do?
L391206 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ You don't get along with anybody!
L391205 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ She didn't like me.
L391204 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ You're invited to the wedding! It's in a few weeks. Why didn't you do like him and be with your dying mother in Palermo?
L391203 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ All right, I'm guilty. I confess!
L391202 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ I'm marrying your brother!
L391201 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ You're trying to make me feel guilty.
L391200 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ I thought if I stayed away from the City Hall, I won't have that Bad Luck I had again.
L391199 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ Don't just become excited.
L391198 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ This time I was trying to do everything right.
L391197 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ Take it easy.
L391196 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ What? What have we done?
L391195 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ What?
L391194 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Oh my God.
L391178 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ It makes you look like an angel.
L391177 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ I've never seen a moon like that.
L391176 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ It's so bright.
L391174 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ I don't know. I think it's the moon.
L391173 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ That light.
L391172 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ What?
L391147 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ Alright. Alright. There will be nothing left.
L391146 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
L391145 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ What about Johnny?
L391144 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Get all of me. Take everything.
L391143 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ I've got you.
L391142 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ I want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. I want you to swallow me.
L391141 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ Loretta.
L391140 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ All my life I have never reached a man. I knew that I would reach my husband, but I took my time and he was dead. Ronny.
L391139 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ Your blood.
L391138 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ I was dead, too.
L391137 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ I was dead.
L391136 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Me neither.
L391135 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ I can't believe what is happening.
L391134 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Oh. Oh God. I don't care about anything. I don't care about anything! Take me to the bed.
L391133 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ To the bed.
L391132 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Where are you taking me?
L391131 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ Son of a bitch!
L391127 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ A wolf without a foot!
L391126 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ A bride without a head!
L391125 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ I am looking where I should to become a bride!
L391124 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ He made me look the wrong way and I cut off my hand. He could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head!
L391123 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Because I have no Luck!
L391122 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ Why are you marrying Johnny? He's a fool!
L391121 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ No!
L391120 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ Stop it!
L391119 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ I'm telling you your life!
L391118 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ What are you doing!
L391117 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ The big part of you has no words and it's-a wolf. This woman was a trap for you. She caught you and you could not get away.  So you chewed off your foot! That was the price you had to pay to be free.  Johnny had nothing to do with it. You did what you had to do, between you and you, and I know I'm right, I don't care what you say. And now you're afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of the wrong love. That's why there has been no woman since that wrong woman. You are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake again!
L391116 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ I'm a wolf?
L391115 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ I was raised that a girl gets married young. I didn't get married until I was twenty-eight. I met a man. I loved him. I married him. He wanted to have a baby right away. I said no. Then he got hit by a bus. No man. No baby. No nothing! I did not know that man was a gift I could not keep. I didn't know... You tell me a story and you think you know what it means, but I see what the true story is, and you can't.  She didn't leave you! You can't see what you are. I can see everything. You are a wolf!
L391114 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ You don't know nothing about it.
L391113 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ You really are stupid, you know that.
L391112 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ Yes.
L391111 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ You think so?
L391110 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ She was right to leave me.
L391109 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ You got any whiskey? How 'bout giving me a glass of whiskey?
L391108 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ Why you talking to me?
L391107 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
L391106 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.
L391105 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.
L391104 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ Stupid yourself.
L391103 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Just Johnny.
L391102 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ How many men since then?
L391101 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Seven years ago.
L391100 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ When your husband get hit by the bus?
L391099 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Stupid.
L391098 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ No.
L391097 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?
L391096 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ I don't know.
L391095 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Why what?
L391094 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ Why?
L391093 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Yesterday.
L391092 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ When you get engaged?
L391091 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Instantaneous.
L391090 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ Fast.
L391089 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Bus hit him.
L391088 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ How'd he die?
L391087 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ He knew my husband who died.
L391086 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ Where'd Johnny find you?
L391085 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Loretta.
L391084 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ This is good. Uhh...
L391083 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ You'll eat this bloody to feed your blood.
L391082 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ I like it well done.
L391081 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ I know that. I do what I want.
L391080 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ You don't have to help me.
L391079 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ I'm making you a steak.
L391078 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ Loretta. What's that smell?
L391062 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ I don't care! I ain't no freakin monument to justice! I lost my hand, I lost my bride! Johnny has his hand, Johnny has his bride! You come in here and you want me to put away my heartbreak and forget?
L391061 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ But that wasn't Johnny's fault.
L391060 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ That's it.
L391059 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ That's the bad blood between you and Johnny?
L391058 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ It's wood. It's fake. Five years ago I was engaged to be married. Johnny came in here, he ordered bread from me. I put it in the slicer and I talked with him and my hand got caught cause I wasn't paying attention. The slicer chewed off my hand. It's funny 'cause - when my fiancé saw that I was maimed, she left me for another man.
L391053 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ No, I want you to see this! I want you to watch me kill myself so you can tell my brother on his wedding day! Chrissy, gimme the big knife!
L391052 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Maybe I should come back another time.
L391051 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ Gimme the big knife! I'm gonna cut my throat!
L391046 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ I don't understand.
L391045 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ I have no life. My brother Johnny took my life from me.
L391044 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Excuse me.
L391043 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ I have no life.
L391042 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Yes. Do you want...
L391041 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ You are going to marry my brother?
L391040 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ I'm going to marry him.
L391039 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ Why?
L391038 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Yes.
L391037 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ Have you come from my brother?
