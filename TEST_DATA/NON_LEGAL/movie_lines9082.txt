L233714 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ 'We?'
L233713 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Harry, we spoke with Martin.
L233705 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ He happens to be loaning me five hundred grand, no strings, I write any kind of agreement I want.
L233704 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Harry, what're you still doing with those guys?
L233210 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Oh, yeah, sure.
L233209 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ What I'm saying, Harry, is I want you and your new buddy to get out of my house.
L233208 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ No problem. You go on off to bed.
L233207 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Well. I got an audition tomorrow.
L233206 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
L233205 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ With your experience, you could always become an agent. Right, Harry?
L233192 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ That's where you got the idea?
L233191 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ That Miami flight that went down, it was on the news every day for about a week. Harry must've been busy.
L233147 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Maybe you didn't hear me.
L233146 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ He's telling me an idea for a movie. It's not bad so far.  Sit down, have a drink.  Tell Karen, let's see what she thinks.
L233145 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ How did you get in the house?
L233104 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I'm going.
L233103 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Harry -–
L233102 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Anyone skim the pool? It needs it.
L233101 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Harry, are you going down, or you want me to?
L233100 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You don't? What happened to Muff?
L233099 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I don't have a dog.
L233098 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Yeah, well I turned off the set. I used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor. You know what could've happened? The dog came in and stepped on it, turned the TV back on.
L233097 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ When I came upstairs, you stayed to finish your drink. I told you to turn off the TV when you were through.  Come to think of it, I also told you you could sleep in the maid's room.
L233094 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I don't hear anything.
L233093 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Be quiet and listen.
L233092 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What's wrong?
L234009 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Shylock?
L234008 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.
L234007 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What money?
L234006 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ I have to run. But what I hope to see, they begin to have misgivings about wanting the money. It becomes their moral dilemma and they try to rationalize keeping it, but in the end they can't. Can they?
L234002 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Mob guy?
L234001 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Once their lives are in danger and you have the mob guy coming after them, it not only heightens the tension, it adds a wistful element to their love.
L234000 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Which two?
L234004 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ And after all, you have such morals.
L234003 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ I have to consider, I mean, as the mob guy, this is another man's wife I'm sleeping with.
L233992 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Thanks.
L233991 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Hi, sweetface. You look great. And mmmmm, you smell good, too.
L233677 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ I'm intrigued, yeah. You know what might help you, take a look at the Cylone again, the way a visual fabric is maintained even while the metaphor plays on different levels. Hey –-  This your ride, Chili?
L233676 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ But you are interested?
L233675 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Yeah, Karen knows him.
L233674 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Lufkin. His... agent.
L233628 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ I know. I'm doing Shylock instead of a shylock. Okay, what's my motivation? The acquisition of money. To collect. Inflict pain if I have to.
L233627 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Oh, for Christ's sake –-
L233602 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ 'It' didn't slip away, Martin, you did... when you went off to fuck Nicki in the middle of my birthday party.
L233601 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Yeah and I'm wondering, how did it go wrong? How did it all... slip away?
L233600 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Really.
L233599 +++$+++ u1081 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ I'm sitting here, I'm looking at you and I'm having these flashes. You know, flashbacks, of memories.  Of us.
L233591 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Hello, Martin.

L236156 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ You'd think on a ship this size there'd be something left to eat.
L236131 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Lemme see, was that before or after the oil fire?
L236130 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ The turbine blew.
L236129 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Maybe you shoulda thought a that before you scuttled our boat.
L236128 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ When they find out what it's carrying, they may not be so interested in what's legal.
L236081 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Wrong. It's Friday.
L236080 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ I don't know. Tuesday?
L236079 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ What day is it?
L235992 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ You find anything that even looks like a compressor. I don't care what, grab it.
L235991 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ I ain't no mechanic, just so you know.
L235990 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ I need lag bolts, especially one inch standard. And sheet metal. Preferably steel, about a sixteenth of an inch. Aluminium, even tin'll do.
L235983 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Yeah. Hell, what difference does it make if we report it now or later? We call this in now, gonna be Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all over the place.
L235982 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Let's not be too hasty.
L235921 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ She's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we'd never know it.
L235920 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Where's his boat, then? Where's his crew? He ain't gonna be out here by himself, that's for damn sure.
L235893 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ We'll see who's dreamin', m'man.
L235892 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Yeah, but not as cold as those Swedish girls you only gonna dream about.
L235889 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ It's a beautiful country. Very clean. Very civilized. And cold.
L235888 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ What's so great about Sweden?
L235865 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Looks like it took out the backup genny too.
L235864 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ One minute I'm minding my own business, the next thing I know the whole place is burning up.  An oxygen tank must've blown on the welder. Started an oil fire.
L235805 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Morning, skipper.
L235804 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Damn mind of it's own.
L235803 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a piece of metal.
L235802 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Fucker!
L235798 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago. You don't think that's just a little freaky?
L235797 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Are you crazy? Do you realize we got ourselves a ship? We own a ship, Dodge.
L235745 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Lemme see.
L235744 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ That's what it says.
L235743 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ What? You sure?
L235742 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Sixty pounds.
L235741 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ How about now?
L235730 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Nah. Everything was cool. It's just one of those things.
L235729 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ You think the extra strain caused it?
L235714 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ I don't care what, ain't nobody just gonna let us walk away with a ship that size.
L235713 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away.
L235712 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Hypothetically speaking, what if we get this boat to Sitka and find out somebody wants it back?
L235575 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ With that coxswain dickhead.
L235574 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Looks like Epps' gonna get some tonight.
L235549 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ I'll sleep good tonight knowing that.
L235548 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Hear that, Dodge? Epps don't think it's a problem.
L236215 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Yeah, yeah.
L236214 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Get up.
L236213 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ What?
L236212 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Dodge.  Dodge.
L236162 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Why not?
L236161 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ What say, Epps? You up for some roasted albatross?
L236100 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Hell no. You think I'm crazy?
L236099 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Did you?
L236083 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Right. Wednesday.
L236082 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Try Wednesday.
L236018 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Then what the hell happened to him?
L236017 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Other than the obvious, there's nothing wrong with him that I can see, not on the outside.
L236015 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ I heard a scream. When I got there I found him on the floor. He was having some kind of seizure. I didn't see anybody else.
L236014 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ I don't know what else you'd call it. He's breathing on his own, but his pupils are completely blown out. He's totally unresponsive to pain.  What happened up there?
L236013 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ A what?
L236012 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a coma.
L235960 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Oh yeah.
L235959 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Smokes?
L235952 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Seen a lota movies.
L235951 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Pretty handy with that scatter gun, Epps. You raised on a farm?
L235939 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Maybe he isn't alone.
L235938 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.
L235934 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ I'm saying we gotta do whatever we gotta do to preserve our interest.
L235933 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ So we kill him?
L235932 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Fifty million dollars. Fifty million. We gonna let this guy just take it from us? One guy?
L235923 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Gimme a break.
L235922 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Maybe that is his boat.
L235917 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I don't know who it was. But I saw somebody.
L235916 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Light in those passages ain't so good.
L235885 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ I like my job.
L235884 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ What're you crazy?
L235883 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Guess I'll just keep working.
L235875 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ I tell you one thing, we're not gonna be towing no ship now.
L235874 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ What other choices have we got?
L235870 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn!
L235869 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ This's gonna hurt a little.
L235851 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Or uninvited guests.
L235850 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Last thing we want is extra partners.
L235800 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Yeah, well how the hell you get something like that wrong? That's a damn big boat. It's either sunk or it ain't.
L235799 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago, we just hit the jackpot.
L235718 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Ever heard of insurance, big boy?
L235717 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either.
L235698 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Bring it on, dude.
L235697 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Ready?
L235696 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Then we'll all be doomed. Any other questions?
L235695 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
L235694 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds, it ain't gonna be what you'd call easy.  Any questions?
L235666 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Somebody's probably looking for her as we speak.
L235665 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Out here? What, so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of Spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now?
L235664 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Probably slipped her moorings, got tangled up in a current.
L235623 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ No.
L235622 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ You think that's funny
L235621 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Yeah.
L235620 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Roger?
L235619 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Roger.
L235617 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Maureen?
L235616 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Maureen.
L235615 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ What?
L235614 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Maureen.
L235613 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ It just occurred to me I don't know your first name. All this time and I don't know it.
L235612 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ What?
L235611 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ What is your first name?
L235610 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Why not.
L235609 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ One more?
L235547 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Amidships starboard at the beam. Just under the waterline. I don't think it's a problem.
L235546 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Where from?
L236219 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Right.
L236218 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Don't fall asleep.
L236217 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Sorry.
L236216 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ You're late.
