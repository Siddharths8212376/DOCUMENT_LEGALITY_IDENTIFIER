L229620 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ So... We get to shut down the neutron reactor?
L229523 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ What the hell are you talking about?
L229522 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ Jason?...  I don't think the pig lizard was Gorignak...
L229520 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ Turn on the translation circuit.
L229519 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Wait, the pig lizard is gone. Why are they still chanting for the pig lizard?
L229502 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ Nothing. Hold please.
L229501 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ What?  What did he say?
L229495 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ Jason, we're going to use the digital conveyer to get you out of there.
L229494 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Yeah. But I've got Gorignak staring me in the face. I think I can take it though...
L229493 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ Thank God. Are you okay?
L229492 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Yes. Yes, I'm here!
L229491 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ Jason.. Can you hear me?
L229452 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Will you stop RIDING ME?!
L229451 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ Clenched jaw...
L229444 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ It helps.
L229443 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ How does the rolling help, actually?
L229411 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ Why does this sound so familiar?
L229410 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ All right... here's the plan:  First, Fred, we need a diversion to clear those things out of the compound, then Gwen, Alex, Fred and I go down to get the sphere.  Any of those things come back, give a signal. Guy, you set up a perimeter.
L229383 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Don't be ridiculous.
L229382 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ You're playing your good side.
L229373 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ I could have held on to YOU! ...
L229372 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me?
L229371 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ Self control?  That's funny coming from the guy that slept with every Moon Princess and Terrakian slave girl on the show!...
L229315 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ Computer, do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
L229314 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
L229309 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ Computer, can it be repaired?
L229308 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Can it be repaired?
L229296 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ No, I don't think so... Wait. They're not but...  Something is.  Oh my god.
L229295 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Are they behind us?
L229275 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ I don't think that's a cloud...
L229274 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Maybe we can lose them in that cloud.
L229245 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Listen, Sarris, you can't blame me for trying...
L229244 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ I thought It was the "We're dead" gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is???
L229243 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ I made the CUT THE LINE gesture. You nodded okay.'
L229238 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ You just keep pushing those buttons, those there, send everything at him, okay?
L229237 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ JASON...
L229236 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ We're going to fire everything we've got at him, all right?
L229235 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ Jason..
L229234 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ All right, now nobody panic, I've dealt with this guy before and believe me, he's as stupid as he is ugly.
L229221 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Mathesar, maybe we should get some of your crew up here.
L229220 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ There's nobody here. Jason...
L229212 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Let me think. I need time to think.
L229211 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ We're leaving, Jason. We're leaving NOW.
L229157 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Gwen... Gwen, c'mon, wait, no!
L229156 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.
L229155 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Hey... Hey where are you going?
L229154 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ Ninty-nine percent of ACTING is commitment. ACTING.  Stella Adler never manned a resonance cannon, she taught ACTING...
L229153 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ It's not the STUFF. I mean, anybody can learn the STUFF...  The important thing is COMMITMNT. 99% of anything is just committing to it.
L229152 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ Well you have to tell them.  What if something happens? We're actors, not astronauts... We can't do this stuff!
L229151 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.
L229150 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
L229149 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Tell them? About...
L229148 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ Wait. When are you going to tell them?
L229147 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ C'mon, we're wanted up on the command deck.
L229146 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ On the show I talk to the computer and repeat what it says. So that's what they built.
L229145 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ But I'm the Commander!
L229144 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ Only answers to me.
L229143 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Let me try.  Computer?  Computer?...
L229137 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Oh come on, it's not like I haven't-
L229136 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'
L229135 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ It's Jason...
L229048 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ You know it's one thing to treat us this way, but how can you do this to your fans?...
L229047 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ This isn't mine. Wait, where is that kid?...
L228955 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ You smiled at me.
L228954 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ What?
L228891 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ What do you want me to say, Gwen?... They wanted the Commander.
L228890 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
L228889 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ A few fans built a little set in their garage.  .  I come in for an hour at most. It's a nothing.
L229881 +++$+++ u1049 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ I see them!  I see them! RD STREET	PASADENA 57
L229880 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ Tommy, look!  Those lights...
L229801 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ What are you doing? What are thev doino? ~7C INT. SARRIS' SHIP	h37C
L229800 +++$+++ u1049 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Closer?  I can try.
L229799 +++$+++ u1049 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ JASON  You think you could-get any closer to those mines?
L229489 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ Is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now?
L229488 +++$+++ u1049 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ I heard it too.
L229479 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ Wait, Fred, what about your thing, you know... "Digitize me, Sergeant Chen!"
L229478 +++$+++ u1049 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ That thing's not going to get us down there fast enough.  Face it, he's dead.
L229477 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ We got the Sphere but the Commander's down there with a bunch of cannibals!  Teb, reset the pod, we're going back.
L229468 +++$+++ u1049 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ I can't...  It's on autopilot!...
L229467 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ Oh my god! Tommy! Stop the pod! Stop the pod!
L229320 +++$+++ u1049 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Sure, no problem.
L229319 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ I have ONE job on this lousy ship. It's stupid, but I'm going to DO it. GOT IT?
L229318 +++$+++ u1049 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ You know, that's really getting annoying.
L229054 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ I don't know guys... I mean, he almost looked... sincere. I know, it's bizarre!
L229053 +++$+++ u1049 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ You should have let me hit him.
L229046 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ Don't do it, Tommy. He's not worth it.
L229045 +++$+++ u1049 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ That's it, It's go time.
L228941 +++$+++ u1049 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Almost as much as he loves himself.
L228940 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ You gotta admit, they do love him.
L228888 +++$+++ u1049 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ You are so full of shit
L228887 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ Unbelievable.
L228863 +++$+++ u1049 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Tomorrow morning, before the store opening.
L228862 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ You're kidding. When for?
L228859 +++$+++ u1041 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ GWEN +++$+++ This is great!  They're going to start eating each other out there.
L228858 +++$+++ u1049 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Where the hell is he?  An hour and a half late.  An hour and a half!
L229812 +++$+++ u1048 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ SARRIS +++$+++ This is embarrassing, really.   I shan't tell this story when I return home.
L229811 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Accelerate to Mark 4, Tommy.
L229584 +++$+++ u1048 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ SARRIS +++$+++ Yes... You understand THAT, don't you, Mathesar?...
L229583 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ We.. We lie.
L229582 +++$+++ u1048 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ SARRIS +++$+++ Simpler.
L229581 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ We pretend...
L229580 +++$+++ u1048 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ SARRIS +++$+++ Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
L229579 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ My name is Jason Nesmith. I'm an actor. We're all actors.
L229575 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Gwen. The show. There's no choice. Do it.
L229574 +++$+++ u1048 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ SARRIS +++$+++ Explain -
L229573 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Please, don't hurt them, it's not their fault. I'm not the Commander, I don't know anything.
L229572 +++$+++ u1048 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ SARRIS +++$+++ Wait. What did you say?
L229570 +++$+++ u1048 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ SARRIS +++$+++ Do you think I'm a fool? That the Commander does not know every bolt, every weld of his ship?
L229569 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ No! I swear I don't know! Please!
L229568 +++$+++ u1048 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ SARRIS +++$+++ Prepare a tear harness for the female...
L229567 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Stop, please! I don't know!
L229566 +++$+++ u1048 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ SARRIS +++$+++ Is it a bomb?  A booby trap?  Tell me!
L229565 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ I don't know.
L229564 +++$+++ u1048 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ SARRIS +++$+++ Then tell me one thing... What does it do, the device? The Omega 13.
L229563 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Yes.
L229233 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ All right. You got it. You win. I'll deliver it now.  Just give me a moment to set it up.
L229232 +++$+++ u1048 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ SARRIS +++$+++ You have ten seconds.
L229231 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Listen, I'd like to, but frankly.. I'm not even sure where it is, or even...
L229230 +++$+++ u1048 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ SARRIS +++$+++ Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship.
L229229 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Right.  Well... Listen, I'm  I'm sorry about that whole... thing.. before. It was kind of a misunderstanding.  I'm sure we can work this out like reasonable people... How's the uh...  ... that going to heal up? God, I hope so, I feel just awful about that.
L229228 +++$+++ u1048 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ SARRIS +++$+++ Better than my Lieutenant.  He failed to activate ship's neutron armor as quickly as I'd hoped on our last encounter.
L229227 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Yes... Hi Sarris... How are you doing?
L229011 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Okey dokey, let's fire blue particle cannons full. Fire red particle cannons full. Fire gannet magnets left and right. Fire pulse catapults from all chutes. And throw this thing at him too, killer.
L229010 +++$+++ u1048 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ SARRIS +++$+++ First, I require the Omega 13... Second-
L229834 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ You can oc that?
L229833 +++$+++ u1045 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ MATHESAR +++$+++ The ship is a model... As big as this!... A very clever deception indeed! He oan't oontaln hIs lauchter.  A belle-----TOMMY Set a course for home, lommander?
L229591 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ It's difficult to... On our planet we pretend in order to... entertain.
L229590 +++$+++ u1045 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ MATHESAR +++$+++ But...Why?
L229589 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Sections of rooms made of plywood. Our Beryllium Sphere was painted wire and plaster. The digital conveyor was Christmas lights... Decorations.  It's all a fake.  I'm not him...  I'm a nothing. A nobody.
L229588 +++$+++ u1045 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ MATHESAR +++$+++ But... Inside, I have seen-
L229587 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ A model, only as big as this.
L229586 +++$+++ u1045 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ MATHESAR +++$+++ But there it is!...
L229585 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ I'm not a Commander, there is no National Space Exploration Administration. There is no snip.
L229336 +++$+++ u1045 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ MATHESAR +++$+++ We have become aware of these concepts only recently. In our dealings with Sarris. Often Sarris will say one thing, and do another. Promise us mercy and deliver destruction... It is a concept we are beginning to learn at some great cost.  But if you are saying that any of you could have traits in common with Sarris.
L229335 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Well... Sort of...
L229334 +++$+++ u1045 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ MATHESAR +++$+++ "Deception..." "Lies."
L229323 +++$+++ u1045 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ MATHESAR +++$+++ We have seen you victorious in many more desperate situations. The fault must lie with us, with the ship...
L229322 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ You what?.. What are you talking about?
L229321 +++$+++ u1045 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ MATHESAR +++$+++ A thousand apologies. We have failed you.
L229277 +++$+++ u1045 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ MATHESAR +++$+++ It's the Tothian mine field left standing from the Great War of 12185.
L229276 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Mathesar? What is that?
L229217 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Mathesar, I need you to prepare pods for my crew.
L229216 +++$+++ u1045 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ MATHESAR +++$+++ Commander...
L229205 +++$+++ u1045 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ MATHESAR +++$+++ I'm sorry. You deserve to be shown.
L229204 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Former Commander?
L229203 +++$+++ u1045 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ MATHESAR +++$+++ Our former Commander was not... Strong.
L229202 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Then how did he find out about the device?
L229201 +++$+++ u1045 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ MATHESAR +++$+++ NO, Thank God he has not.
L229200 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Mathesar?. .. Has Sarris seen the.. historical records?
L229179 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Wherever a distress signal sounds among the stars, we'll be there, this fine ship, this fine crew. Never give up, never surrender!
L229178 +++$+++ u1045 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ MATHESAR +++$+++ To our brave guests.  Few in this universe have the opportunity to meet their heroes.  We are blessed to count ourselves among them.
L229096 +++$+++ u1045 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ MATHESAR +++$+++ ... Maintenance facility...
L229095 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ It's perfectly safe. I promise.
L229094 +++$+++ u1045 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ MATHESAR +++$+++ Weapons storage...
L229027 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ It was a lot of fun. You kids are great.
L229026 +++$+++ u1045 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ MATHESAR +++$+++ How can we thank you, Commander. You- You have saved our people.
L229025 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Thanks
L229024 +++$+++ u1045 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ MATHESAR +++$+++ An interstellar vox.
L229023 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ I would but I am REALLY running late and the 134's a parking lot after 2:00.  But listen, the guy gives you any more trouble, just give a call...
L229022 +++$+++ u1045 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ MATHESAR +++$+++ He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
L229021 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Oh, I don't think so. I gave him both barrels.
L229020 +++$+++ u1045 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ MATHESAR +++$+++ But what if Sarris survives?
L229019 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Long live Theramini.  Take a left here?
L229018 +++$+++ u1045 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ MATHESAR +++$+++ Theramin.
L229017 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Right. Long live... What's your planet?
L229016 +++$+++ u1045 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ MATHESAR +++$+++ But Commander... The negotiation... You... You... You fired on him.
L229015 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Yeah. "Earth." Time to get back to "Earth," kids.
L229014 +++$+++ u1045 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ MATHESAR +++$+++ You... You mean Earth?
L229013 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Home.
L229012 +++$+++ u1045 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ MATHESAR +++$+++ Commander?... Where are you... going?
L229000 +++$+++ u1045 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ MATHESAR +++$+++ As you wish.
L228999 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Mind If we skip that?  I have to get back pretty quick for this thing in Van Nuys.
L228998 +++$+++ u1045 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ MATHESAR +++$+++ Commander... Welcome to the Protector II.  Would you like to don your uniform?
L228983 +++$+++ u1042 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Oh, right! The thing with the thing. Come on in, I'll get some pants on.
L228982 +++$+++ u1045 +++$+++ m68 +++$+++ MATHESAR +++$+++ Sir, I understand this is a terrible breach of protocol, but please, I beg you to hear our plea. We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula.  Our people are being systematically hunted and slaughtered by Roth'h'ar Sarris of Fatu-Krey. Sarris wants the Omega 13. We are to meet in negotiation. However our past efforts in this regard have been nothing short of disastrous. The flames, the death...  Please Captain, you are our last hope.  We have secured a limousine.
