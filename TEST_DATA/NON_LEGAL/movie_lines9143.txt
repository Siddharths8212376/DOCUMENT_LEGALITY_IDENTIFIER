L290330 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ I guess I'll try to back it out on the rim... at least to the main road.

L290573 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I know, this is fucking nuts.
L290572 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ I can't believe what I'm seeing.
L290529 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Tasted pretty good.
L290528 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.
L290527 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Hey, I asked you if you wanted some chicken.
L290526 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Whatever, at this point all I care about is food. I'm starving and I got a fucking killer headache.
L290525 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Oh, don't worry she didn't get offended by what I said. You two got to lighten up... right, Bill?
L290357 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ No problem.
L290356 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Thanks.
L290355 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Don't forget the flashlight, it's pretty dark out there.
L290325 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage.
L290324 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. There's no saving it now.
L290312 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ You're a real fucking piece of work.

L290310 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Jesus Christ, Jerry.
L290309 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Yeah, I fixed it. Well, I ain't... um, I can't remember. I think I took it out to fit the bags and forgot to put it back.
L290308 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ I hope you fixed the spare like I asked ya.
L290307 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Gee, ya think it wouldn't be too much trouble.
L290306 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I'll help ya.
L290305 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ OK, let's relax. I'll check it, maybe I'm wrong. Don't everybody freak out just yet.
L290301 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Fuck. I think we blew a tire.
L290300 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ What was that?
L290295 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ No... yeah, they ripped him to pieces while his family watched from the car. The wife is screaming, the kids are crying. Some dude in another car filmed the whole thing.
L290294 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Oh yeah, I heard about that. I always thought it was bullshit.
L290293 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ That reminds me of a film I saw once of a guy who got out of his car at Lion Country Safari to take a picture of a lion cub and got eaten by the lions.
L290244 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Cat fight, cat fight.
L290243 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ She looks like she stinks.
L290233 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Way out here?
L290232 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ It's a hitchhiker.
L290231 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ What's that?
L290230 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Come on, we need something like this. It could be the real deal. It's too far out of the way to come back to.
L290227 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ I don't know.
L290226 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I'm not exactly sure... it looks close. Did we pass an abandoned school bus yet?
L290225 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ How much further?
L290224 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Keep straight on this road here.
L290127 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Hell yeah.
L290126 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome?
L290125 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Really fucking awesome.
L290124 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ How awesome?
L290123 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Holy crap. You gotta see this place. It's awesome.
L290122 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ OK, Boss.
L290121 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ I'll pump the gas. Go inside and see if it's worth thinking about.
L290120 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I hope this place is cool. We could use something interesting to liven up chapter 12.
L290119 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Perfect.
L290118 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Don't panic yourself, way too much caffeine guy... I see a sign.  Captain Spaulding's Museum of Madmen and Monsters... cool. Also... fried chicken and... gasoline... next exit.
L290117 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ I dunno... we'll ask around as we get closer. Man, I really don't want to run out of gas out here in the middle of Petticoat Junction, man.
L290116 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Yeah, no shit I just told ya.  Hey, you think this place called Alien Ed's UFO Welcoming Center is still around? It says, "Where the Fact is separated from the Fantasy."
L290115 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Oh yeah, I remember now.
L290114 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Then the devil says, "are you gay?" Guy says, "fuck no"... Devil says, "Well then, I guess you're gonna hate Thursdays."
L290113 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Yeah.
L290112 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Then the devil asks, "do you drink?" Guy says, "yeah"... devil say, "wonderful, Wednesday is free drinks night, best booze you ever had... all made from the finest stuff."
L290111 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Shit, we really need to find some gas.
L290110 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ So, the guy goes to Hell and the devil says, "do you smoke?" The guy say, "yeah"... the devil say, "great cause Tuesday is cigar night, sweetest Cuban cigars you ever had."
L290109 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Hold on, I've heard this before... but I can't remember the end.
L290108 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Hot has got nothing to do with it.
L290107 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always nuts.
L290106 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
L290105 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
L290104 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.
L290103 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Fuck yeah, she is. I'd join a cult to get some of that... and the best part is she didn't try to kill the President or nothing, so that baggage ain't hanging around.
L290102 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was pretty hot.
L290101 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
L290100 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Yeah, no shit.
L290099 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ If we're talking cute... like regular cute, I'd say Leslie Van Houton, but cute ain't hot.
L290098 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Better than pissing... anyway so, what's your choice?
L290097 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ There always one kid with no bodily controls. We had this dude, Jeff Baxter, he was a puker. The fucker would just sit there puke all over himself.
L290096 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Yeah but, she reminds me of this chick that I remember from fourth grade... called a... shit, what did we call her?  Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when ever she got called on by Miss Chumski, this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling.
L290095 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ She's pretty cute.
L290094 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Sqeaky! No way, she ain't that hot.
L290093 +++$+++ u1394 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Really? Huh, I thought for sure you'd say Lynette Fromme. She's got that snooty vibe I know you dig.
L290612 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ Lock the fucking doors.
L290611 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Don't look back, just get in the car.
L290592 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ I suppose. I mean they're obviously all bonkers, but I guess they're harmless.
L290591 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Yeah, I'd say at this point all we can do is just wait it out. There's nothing else.
L290588 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Man, it's already ten thirty.
L290587 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ Shit, I'm all for being a sport, but this is ridiculous.
L290569 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ That food...  ugh, I feel like I'm gonna puke.
L290568 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Just grin and bear it.
L290559 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ Yeah, showtime for what?
L290558 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ What's he so excited about?
L290465 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ I mean obviously we will compensate you for your troubles.
L290464 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Yeah, maybe R.J. could just tow us and our car to the nearest garage.
L290339 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ Turn that fucking radio off!
L290338 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Fuck! We are fucked!
L290285 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ He won't move.
L290284 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ Honk at him. Scare him.
L290213 +++$+++ u1392 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ DENISE +++$+++ Here he comes.
L290212 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ I like sleep.
L290621 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ It won't work.
L290620 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Drive through it!
L290619 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ I gotta open the gate.
L290618 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ What are you doing!
L290598 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Oh, I'm sorry, bothering you? Was I disturbing your viewing pleasure?
L290597 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Quiet.
L290596 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ How much is a person supposed to stand?
L290575 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Just sit back and enjoy the show.
L290574 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ This is starting to make me real uncomfortable.
L290571 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Well, ya can't complain I never take you anyplace.
L290570 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Check this out.
L290503 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Whatever it is just do it. The more we play along the faster we'll get the hell out of here.
L290502 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I hope to Christ she doesn't expect us to wear these things.
L290350 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Don't worry, I'll be quick. Just stay here, no sense everybody getting drenched.
L290349 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Screw that, no way, I ain't letting you go by yourself.
L290348 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Forget it. I'll just go.
L290337 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Fine! I'll go straight!

L290288 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Then run him over, he'll move.
L290287 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ There's not enough room.
L290286 +++$+++ u1395 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Go around him.
L290283 +++$+++ u1389 +++$+++ m92 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ There's a dog in the road.
