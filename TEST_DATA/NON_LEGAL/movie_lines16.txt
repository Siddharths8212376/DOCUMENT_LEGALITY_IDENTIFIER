L6737 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ See ya.
L6736 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back.
L6735 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You want me to come out there and play private eye?
L6734 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
L6733 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I'm a working stiff, pops.
L6732 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Well, I'm in New York now.  What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?
L6731 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art.
L6730 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Alright, I get the picture.
L6729 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
L6728 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money...
L6727 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Where does he sell it?
L6726 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You're learning.
L6725 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Specialty product.
L6724 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore.  Definitely not for the squeamish.
L6723 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd have thought it?
L6722 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks, supposed to be a real weirdo.
L6637 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Good question.
L6636 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?
L6635 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ A daughter.
L6634 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?
L6633 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ What about me?
L6632 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?
L6631 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
L6630 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers.
L6629 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.
L6628 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
L6627 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
L6626 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I don't know, where are yours?
L6625 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Where are your parents?
L6624 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Twenty-five.
L6623 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ How old are you?
L6622 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ First of all, basement sales like tonight aren't gonna last much longer.  It's too risky, one, and two, everything's going on the internet.  Anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants.  It's heaven for those degenerate chicken-hawks. They're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap 'em.  But, there's still some weird shit under the counter where I work sometimes.  No one knows where it comes from.  That's local underground, where information spreads by word of mouth.  Those are zombies, hardcore junkies.  Their hands are permanently pruned.  They go out in the sun they don't burn, they blister.  Other than that, all I know about is the mail. Classified ads in the paper with hidden codes.  Secret couriers. Credit card orders to dummy corporations.  Interstate wire transfers.  Revolving P.O. boxes. But, if you're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit... who knows?  That's the whole point -- the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible, and vice versa, and cops can't trace the deal.  There's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is.
L6621 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?
L6620 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.
L6619 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Snuff films.
L6618 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one.
L6617 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Child pornography.
L6616 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product.
L6615 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Interesting theory.
L6614 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go.
L6598 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Wake up, pops.  Your education begins tonight.
L6597 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ ... Hello... ?
L6596 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ See you then.  Oh, and, don't call me "pops."
L6595 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
L6594 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?
L6593 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Sounds good, pops.
L6592 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
L6591 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Four hundred a week, off the books.
L6590 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ How much do you make now?
L6589 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ How much?
L6588 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.
L6587 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
L6586 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Not quite.
L6585 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.
L6584 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I'm not a cop.
L6583 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.
L6582 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know.  I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great.  If not, speak now.
L6581 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ There's not much illegal.
L6580 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...
L6579 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Max.
L6578 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
L6577 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Three, four years.
L6576 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ How long you been working there?
L6575 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Good for you.
L6574 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight.
L6571 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Thomas Welles.  Nice picture.
L6570 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I need some information.  Thought you might be able to help.
L6569 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  Told you you would.
L6568 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Remember me?
L6561 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be?
L6560 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
L6559 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.
L6558 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Truman Capote.
L6557 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Catchy title.  What are you really reading?  Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting.
L6556 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Once you pick it up you can't put it down.
L6553 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I'll risk it.
L6552 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
L6551 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
L6550 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
L6549 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Pardon me?
L6548 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
L6547 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Yeah... guess so.
L6546 +++$+++ u108 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Big date tonight?
L6749 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ If you have a pencil and paper, I'll tell you how to send it.
L6748 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ How will I get it to you?
L6747 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I've got about five thousand left in cash, but I'll need another thirty, if you approve.
L6746 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ Fine...
L6745 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.
L6744 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?
L6743 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I hope it's nothing serious.
L6742 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
L6741 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
L6740 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ How are you?  Having any luck?
L6739 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
L6738 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ Hello?
L6655 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian.
L6654 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ You told me to look, so I looked.
L6653 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?
L6652 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ Okay.
L6651 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  Who knows?  It sure could have.  I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.
L6650 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ Do you think the film could have cost that much?
L6649 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I'm here.
L6648 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ Hello... ?
L6647 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ To the penny.  Exactly one million dollars in cash.
L6646 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You're joking.
L6645 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.
L6644 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Okay, I follow you so far...
L6643 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ One was for two hundred thousand, one dollar and thirteen cents. Another was for three hundred thousand, six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents...
L6642 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ The checks were for odd amounts...
L6641 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I'm not positive this means anything.
L6640 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.
L6639 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Okay...
L6428 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her.
L6427 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Nothing remotely like this.
L6426 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ You've found missing persons before.
L6425 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate investigations...
L6424 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously.  I've thought about it and there's no other way.  If you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I can't let that happen.  I'm telling you I won't.  If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then I'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her.
L6423 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ It won't work like that.
L6422 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...
L6421 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You don't have any other choice.
L6420 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ I told you I can't, not yet.
L6419 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You... you need to go to the police.
L6418 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Of course.  But, I'm certain it's nothing to worry about.
L6417 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ Will you watch it and see for yourself?
L6416 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.
L6415 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ I'm telling you it's not that.
L6414 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
L6413 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ No.
L6412 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Please, believe me.  This is probably a stag film.  Simulated rape.  Hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects...
L6411 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Mrs. Christian... please, will you sit down a moment?  I want you to listen carefully. What you're talking about is a "snuff film."  But, from what I know, snuff films are a kind of... urban myth.  Like, red light district folklore.  There's no such thing, I can assure you.
L6410 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ I didn't know what to think.  I can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband.  To know that he watched this... this atrocity.  But, I can't go to the police...
L6409 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ This is a movie showing a girl being murdered.  She's sitting on a bed, and a man rapes her... and he begins to cut her with a knife...  I only watched what I could.
L6408 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I'm afraid I don't...
L6407 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ It's a film... of a girl being murdered.
L6406 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ Cash, stock certificates, and this...
L6405 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Do you want to tell me what you found?
L6404 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...
L6403 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You hired someone to open it.  I'll bet the lawyer loved that.
L6402 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe.  I knew about it, but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business.  Not till now, that is.
L6401 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ Just curious.
L6400 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that, there's never any reason.
L6399 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?
L6398 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ We were married forty-five years. Hard even for me to imagine.  We had our troubles.  There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and I to him.  I loved him deeply.
L6397 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ He succeeded.
L6396 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
L6395 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Pittsburgh?
L6392 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I'll do whatever I can to help.
L6391 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.
L6390 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ My condolences.
L6389 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ As you know, my husband passed away recently.  Two weeks ago now.
L6388 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ You are highly recommended.  Praised for your discretion... your strict adherence to confidentiality.
L6387 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
L6386 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about you.  I must say you have friends in influential places.
L6385 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ He's a lawyer.  Please, sit, here...
L6384 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ He's odd.
L6383 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Thank you.
L6382 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ Have a pleasant evening.  Will you have tea, Mister Welles?
L6373 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.
L6372 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Uh huh, pleasure.
L6369 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I try to be.
L6368 +++$+++ u109 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS CHRISTIAN +++$+++ Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
L7098 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ They murdered her, Mrs. Mathews, I'm sorry.  It happened a month after she ran away.  She's been dead all this time...
L7097 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ Why... why are you doing this to me... ?
L7096 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...
L7095 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ No... no... no...
L7094 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...
L7093 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ No...
L7092 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...
L7091 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ Who are you?
L7090 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...
L7089 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ Who is this... ?
L7088 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead.
L7087 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ What... ?
L7086 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...
L7085 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ What are you talking about... ?
L7084 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I have to tell you something.  It won't be easy for you to hear.  It's about your daughter... Mary Anne...  When I... when I was there with you, her diary, in your attic, in silverware.  If you read it, you'll know what I'm telling you is true...
L7083 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ I remember.  You just left...
L7082 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...
L7081 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ Hello... ?
L6536 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ What am I supposed to do?  Forget her?  Time heals all wounds, right?  She's all I think about, and I've learned to live with that.  But, you want the truth... the real truth? If I had a choice... if I had to choose, between her being out there, living a good life and being happy, and me not knowing; never finding out what happened to her...  ... or her being dead and me knowing...  I'd choose to know.
L6535 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ It's been six years.
L6534 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ I think about it everyday.  But, every time the phone rings... every single time, I still think it's her.
L6532 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ Yes.
L6531 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You were right.  I didn't find anything.  I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?
L6528 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go.  Police are just as human as you or I.  They could have missed something.  They probably didn't.  Wouldn't you rather know?
L6527 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...
L6526 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Will you let me look?
L6525 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ How... how can you say that to me...?
L6524 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ If the police focused their search in her room, her belongings, well that'd be only natural, but they may have been looking in the wrong place.
L6523 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ No.  You don't have any reason to think that...
L6522 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
L6521 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ I don't know.  I think so.
L6520 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ Do you think the police did a good job?
L6519 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ There wasn't one.  The police looked.
L6518 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.
L6517 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ What?
L6516 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.
L6515 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ You should be.
L6514 +++$+++ u114 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ WELLES +++$+++ No.
L6513 +++$+++ u110 +++$+++ m6 +++$+++ MRS MATHEWS +++$+++ Are you religious?
