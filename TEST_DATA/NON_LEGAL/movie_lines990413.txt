L597256 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ I know where to look.
L597255 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ You know where to look for your Austrian, right?
L597253 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ I thought you’d never ask... As I was having my coffee and crescents at the Mondrian the other morning I spotted your photograph in the Los Angeles Times... There’s a tough lady, I thought. Just the kind who might help me...
L597252 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ There are over 4 million people in this city - why me?
L597251 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Lombard...  It will take a few days for the things I need to get here. Meanwhile I’d sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog...
L597250 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ Have you never heard of collect calls, Mr...
L597248 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ No. A poor little rich boy who thought he’d save a few kids from their retailer. He disappeared on his second shopping expedition.
L597247 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ You don’t know why he’s come to Los Angeles?  The man you say he killed? Who was he? A colleague of his?
L597246 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Yeah.
L597245 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ By your Austrian?
L597244 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.
L597243 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ Where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why can’t you go back there?
L597242 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ French people need a visa to enter this country. That takes time and I didn’t have any. I used a British passport. My name’s not Lamont but Lombard. Xavier Lombard.
L597241 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ Okay. The woman just can’t walk away...  I want straight answers. No hesitation or I walk for sure. Why can’t you go to your Embassy?
L597236 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ You...  Jesus Christ!
L597235 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Well, I’d sooner mug an old lady...
L597234 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ I can’t believe this...  What’s coming now, eh? If I don’t pay all Hell’s gonna break loose, is that it?
L597233 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ A small loan would be welcome. More urgently, I need access to a telephone and an address where things can be sent to me.
L597232 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ Is this some kind of sick stunt? Let me guess.  You want money, right?
L597229 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ I’m fine standing, thank you.
L597228 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ You’re sure you won’t sit down, Miss Stewart?
L597227 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ I don’t smoke. If you could get to the point...
L597226 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ You wouldn’t have a cigarette, would you?
L597225 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ You’re a long way from home...
L597224 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Europe...  France. I’m French but I live in London...  ... England.
L597223 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ May I ask where you’re from, Mr Lamont?
L597441 +++$+++ u8314 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ WHITNEY +++$+++ She’ll be alright. She’s tough...
L597440 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ Shit! Fuck! What’s fucking wrong with people!  I’m going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to! 
L597435 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ No. You’re looking at a real Musketeer here, Whitney. Brave and rash. Had to dash in there.  Take a prisoner... Might as well have sent them a notice to quit...  Come on, Musketeer! Got anything to say?
L597434 +++$+++ u8314 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ WHITNEY +++$+++ Emily...
L597433 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ Look at him, Whitney. Come all the way from England to clean up California. Huh!
L597430 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ That’s right. Where’s the fucking Italian, eh, Mr French hero?
L597429 +++$+++ u8314 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ WHITNEY +++$+++ We’ve still got the Italian...
L597282 +++$+++ u8314 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ WHITNEY +++$+++ Most of our information comes out of the mouths of babes, Mr Lombard - confused and frightened victims. It’s all too easily discredited, you understand. Now, you might be just what we’ve been waiting for. Your information could be enough to make ‘em sit up and listen.
L597281 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ If you have hard evidence about a child trafficker, we want it, Mr Lombard. And we want it before you get yourself killed...
L597280 +++$+++ u8314 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ WHITNEY +++$+++ Hi...
L597279 +++$+++ u8314 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ WHITNEY +++$+++ And losing you, we’d lose him. And that would be a shame, don’t you agree?
L597278 +++$+++ u8295 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ EMILY +++$+++ Whitney Armstrong, my deputy. What Whitney’s trying to say is that you might not live to tell the tale next time you meet your Austrian...
L596889 +++$+++ u8296 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ FRIEDMAN +++$+++ Have the money ready by 11am. We’ll call you.
L596888 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ ... Fine. I’ll go for the safe place.
L596887 +++$+++ u8296 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ FRIEDMAN +++$+++ Fifteen for a straight delivery. Twenty with the provision of a safe place. Visitors tend to find the second option more convenient.
L596886 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ I see. How much?
L596885 +++$+++ u8296 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ FRIEDMAN +++$+++ I’m afraid the only pups currently available at such notice are brown and trained. But they are all very cheerful and have been thoroughly checked for diseases...
L596884 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Tomorrow?
L596883 +++$+++ u8296 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ FRIEDMAN +++$+++ How much of a hurry are you in?
L596882 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ What about an untrained pup, white...
L596881 +++$+++ u8296 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ FRIEDMAN +++$+++ So, what are you looking for?
L596880 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Yes... Good, good...
L596879 +++$+++ u8296 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ FRIEDMAN +++$+++ We also provide 24-hour after-sale service. Were the puppy to fall sick or accidently die, we would unburden you, you understand?
L596878 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Yeah.
L596877 +++$+++ u8296 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ FRIEDMAN +++$+++ Pups. Bitches. From three to twelve months.  Trained and untrained ones. White and brown ones. You understand?
L596876 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ What sort have you got?
L596875 +++$+++ u8296 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ FRIEDMAN +++$+++ What sort of puppy are you looking for?
L596874 +++$+++ u8296 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ FRIEDMAN +++$+++ This is a bad line.
L596873 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Why?
L596872 +++$+++ u8296 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ FRIEDMAN +++$+++ May I have your phone number?
L596871 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ I saw the ad at George’s.  I’m passing through town and I’m in a hurry.
L596870 +++$+++ u8296 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ FRIEDMAN +++$+++ Have we done business before?
L596869 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ I’m calling about the puppies.
L597019 +++$+++ u8297 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ GIANT +++$+++ Downstairs... At the front... Jesus...
L597018 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Where is it?
L597017 +++$+++ u8297 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ GIANT +++$+++ B-Black...
L597016 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ What colour is your car?  What colour is your car?
L597015 +++$+++ u8297 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ GIANT +++$+++ F-five. The Wilsons and their three kids. They run the place. Look, man, I’ve got to get to...
L597014 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ What about the staff?  They’re in on what’s going on, aren’t they?  How many of them?
L597013 +++$+++ u8297 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ GIANT +++$+++ Another hotel. Down the road. Martin lives there. He took your money. He’s got a safe...  I need a doctor...
L597012 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ What’s the Ambassador?
L597011 +++$+++ u8297 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ GIANT +++$+++ Just me...  Martin’s gone back to the Ambassador. Look...
L597010 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ How many of you scumbags are here?
L597009 +++$+++ u8297 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ GIANT +++$+++ I don’t know. I don’t know, man. I don’t even know Friedman that well... I...  Man, you’ve got to get me out of here...
L597008 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ What company?
L597007 +++$+++ u8297 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ GIANT +++$+++ The company. We all work for the company.
L597006 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ And who does Friedman work for?
L597005 +++$+++ u8297 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ GIANT +++$+++ I don’t know...  This is just a delivery place, man! I swear I don’t know where the kids are... I work for Martin, that’s all. Martin knows. He works for Friedman. He knows...
L597004 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ There were six on offer, you scumbag. Where are the other five?
L597003 +++$+++ u8297 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ GIANT +++$+++ What kids?
L597002 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Where are the kids?
L597001 +++$+++ u8297 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ GIANT +++$+++ Finsbury Park. We’re in Finsbury Park.
L597000 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Where are we?
L596999 +++$+++ u8297 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ GIANT +++$+++ What?
L596998 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Where?
L596997 +++$+++ u8297 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ GIANT +++$+++ Yeah... The Diplomat.
L596996 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ What’s this place? A hotel of some kind?
L596995 +++$+++ u8297 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ GIANT +++$+++ No... No...  I swear...
L596994 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Ever seen him before?
L596993 +++$+++ u8297 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ GIANT +++$+++ Who?  Martin... He’s Martin...
L596992 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Who’s the money man?
L596991 +++$+++ u8297 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ GIANT +++$+++ Yeah... This morning. He left this fucking bloody morning... Jesus, man, my knees...
L596990 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ ...On holiday?
L596989 +++$+++ u8297 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ GIANT +++$+++ I don’t know. He’s gone!  He’s gone. I don’t fucking know where, I swear... He’s gone. On holiday...
L596988 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Where is he?
L596987 +++$+++ u8297 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ GIANT +++$+++ Yes. Friedman’s the fuckin’ Austrian!
L596986 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Where is the Austrian? Is Friedman the Austrian?
L596985 +++$+++ u8297 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ GIANT +++$+++ Who are you?
L596984 +++$+++ u8297 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ GIANT +++$+++ Jee... Fuck... You’re fucking mad!
L596983 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ You’re not playing with little boys now, scumbag. Where is the Austrian?
L596982 +++$+++ u8297 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ GIANT +++$+++ You... Fuck you!
L596981 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Where is the Austrian?
L596979 +++$+++ u8297 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ GIANT +++$+++ What...?
L596978 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ On the bed!
L597308 +++$+++ u8298 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ HYATT OPERATOR +++$+++ I certainly did, sir...
L597307 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ You sure you passed on my message?
L597167 +++$+++ u8298 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ HYATT OPERATOR +++$+++ Got it. Puppies.
L597166 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Next time he calls tell Mr Gluck he better be there to take his calls at 9 tonight or at 9 in the morning if he cares about his puppies. Got that?
L597165 +++$+++ u8298 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ HYATT OPERATOR +++$+++ Absolutely, sir. As a matter of fact he called this morning, sir.
L597164 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Does Mr Gluck call for his messages?
L597129 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Can I have the reception desk, please.
L597128 +++$+++ u8298 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ HYATT OPERATOR +++$+++ The Hyatt. Good afternoon. May I help you?
L597127 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ I’ll call again.
L597126 +++$+++ u8298 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ HYATT OPERATOR +++$+++ I’m sorry but Mr Gluck is not answering, sir.  Would you like to leave a message?
L597501 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Thank you, Jane.
L597500 +++$+++ u8299 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Yes. How did...
L597499 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Carlos De Moraes?
L597498 +++$+++ u8299 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Really? And how are you, eh?  Someone called Pierre Dreyer said that a month ago he had dinner with a Brazilian friend of...
L597497 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Hello, Jane. It’s me.
L597485 +++$+++ u8299 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ What are you up to, eh, Savieer? I mean, not this but... Money, passports, a gun in a microwave? Who are you, eh? Who are you?
L597484 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ I’d appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you can’t, don’t worry about it. I’ll call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but I’m in a hurry. 
L597483 +++$+++ u8299 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Your secretary, huh!
L597482 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Just ask if they can recall recommending my services to anyone in the recent past. Say you’re my secretary, all right?
L597481 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Thanks for cleaning my flat and sending my money, all right?... Come on, I need you. It’s important.
L597480 +++$+++ u8299 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Piss off!
L597468 +++$+++ u8299 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Well, I’m sorry. I...  This is my nephew... And my brother, Tim. I’ve got the week off and he’s come to stay.
L597467 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ It’s not.
L597466 +++$+++ u8299 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ No... I told you on the phone. Whoever broke in messed-up all your papers. I put everything back where I thought it ought to be.  Maybe it’s there with...
L597465 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Jane, there was an envelope in my desk. The one I’d given you and then got back, remember? I can’t find it. Do you know where it is?
L597464 +++$+++ u8299 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Hello there. How’s the flat. I cleaned...
L597463 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Oui, bonjour, Jean... Oui, très bien, merci. Dites-moi, pourriez-vous me dire si vous avez recommandémes services àquelqu’un récemment... Vous êtes certain... Non, non...  Je vous remercie... 
L597462 +++$+++ u8299 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I came to feed your fish. I didn’t know...
L597111 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Bye bye, Jane. And don’t be naughty.
L597110 +++$+++ u8299 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ She’s pretty... See you, huh?
L596723 +++$+++ u8299 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Oh yeah! Better be good and hurry away then! Who knows? We might be being watched! Maybe one of your stupid French companies has got a detective prying into your life - after all, that’s what they do to their employees, isn’t it? Huh! Hope you enjoy ruining people’s lives. Thanks for the lift!
L596722 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ I’ve got work tonight, Jane.
L596718 +++$+++ u8299 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Oh no. I’m all right. He was a jerk, really. Another boy, you know? All I meet is boys. When I think of all the fuss about older men fancying young girls. I mean, is it true?
L596717 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Well, I hope you’re not too heartbroken and...
L596716 +++$+++ u8299 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Oh... We split up.
L596715 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ It’s Friday night, Jane. What happened to your latest boyfriend?
L596714 +++$+++ u8299 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ So you haven’t seen the film, then?
L596713 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many. 
L596712 +++$+++ u8299 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I don’t know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
L596711 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Should I?
L596710 +++$+++ u8299 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ “La collectionoose”. It’s about a young girl in the south of France who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her. It’s on TV tonight and as I’m in I thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and... The review says it’s about the conflict between intellect and instinct. And witty. The director’s supposed to be famous. Rommel or something. French. You must know him?
L596709 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ La what?
L596708 +++$+++ u8299 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Have you heard of a French film called “La Collectionoose”?
L596707 +++$+++ u8299 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Yes. But my boss reckons you’d still be better off as a limited company. For expenses and all that, you know? It’d cost you about £100 but he said it’d be worth it.  Of course, you’d need a partner to register. But that’s a formality. I mean, I could be your partner. I mean, just as a name, right?
L596706 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Good.
L596705 +++$+++ u8299 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Must be your lucky day then. I’ve got your accounts - you don’t owe much tax for last year.
L596704 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ No.
L596703 +++$+++ u8299 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Fine. How was the match? Did you loose?
L596702 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ How are you, Jane?
L596701 +++$+++ u8299 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Hello again, neighbour. I didn’t intrude, did I?
L597636 +++$+++ u8306 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ MRS SPITZ +++$+++ Jah...
L597635 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Look at it this way. He might achieve everything your son never did.
L597633 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Plus a trust fund to provide for the boy’s education.
L597632 +++$+++ u8306 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ MRS SPITZ +++$+++ £10,000 a year to the girl for as long as she looks after the boy?
L596683 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Fine. One more thing, Mrs and Mr Spitz; may I ask what is or was your occupation?
L596682 +++$+++ u8306 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ MRS SPITZ +++$+++ My husband and I will be leaving tomorrow for a short stay in Israel. Deborah will be here if you need anything before our return.
L596681 +++$+++ u8306 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ MRS SPITZ +++$+++ Ha... No, Mr Lombard. His monthly allowance is all he is to expect from us. He knows it and we feel the amount is more than adequate.
L596680 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?
L596679 +++$+++ u8306 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ MRS SPITZ +++$+++ We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention.
L596678 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ My rates...
L596677 +++$+++ u8306 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ MRS SPITZ +++$+++ The £1,000 is on account.
L596673 +++$+++ u8306 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ MRS SPITZ +++$+++ When... I’m told he came here...
L596672 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ I’m sure... As far as you know, when and where was your son last seen?
L596671 +++$+++ u8306 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ MRS SPITZ +++$+++ The proprietor of his workplace is the only friend of his we know about.  His address is in this envelope with Leonard’s address, keys and other things you might need. 
L596670 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Any friends?
L596669 +++$+++ u8306 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ MRS SPITZ +++$+++ No. And before you ask, no, he’s not gay! He has had girlfriends, but nothing serious...
L596668 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ I take it your son is not married, Mrs Spitz?
L596661 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Then why aren’t you asking the police to look for your son, Mrs Spitz?
L596660 +++$+++ u8306 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ MRS SPITZ +++$+++ He could indeed, Mr Lombard. But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it.
L596659 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ So he could have decided to go on a trip...
L596658 +++$+++ u8306 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ MRS SPITZ +++$+++ Leonard does not hold a driving licence. As for his passport, I do not know where he keeps it.
L596657 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Did you look for his passport, driving licence?
L596656 +++$+++ u8306 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ MRS SPITZ +++$+++ Yesterday. It all looked normal.
L596655 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ I presume you checked your son’s apartment...
L596654 +++$+++ u8306 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ MRS SPITZ +++$+++ Then you should not have sought an explanation.
L596653 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ I didn’t mean to imply you did, Mrs Spitz.
L596652 +++$+++ u8306 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ MRS SPITZ +++$+++ I said earlier that my husband and I are supporting Leonard in his photography, Mr Lombard. By this I mean that since his return from America I have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold. So as you see, I did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account.
L596651 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Check with your son’s bank. Banks don’t usually give out information about their customers.
L596650 +++$+++ u8306 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ MRS SPITZ +++$+++ Do what, Mr Lombard?
L596649 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ How did you do that, Mrs Spitz?
L596648 +++$+++ u8306 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ MRS SPITZ +++$+++ You wouldn’t be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now.
L596647 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ What do you think has happened to your son, Mrs Spitz?
L596640 +++$+++ u8306 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ MRS SPITZ +++$+++ Leonard. What my daughter is on about, Mr Lombard, is that Leonard is somewhat of a Bohemian. You might as well know that...
L596639 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ I take it your son is called Leon?
L596630 +++$+++ u8306 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ MRS SPITZ +++$+++ What I can appreciate is insolence, Mr Lombard!
L596629 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Look Mrs Spitz... I don’t know to whom I’m indebted for the recommendation but... I’m not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references. What I do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not I can be of help. I hope you can appreciate that, Mrs Spitz.
L596628 +++$+++ u8306 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ MRS SPITZ +++$+++ Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?
L596627 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Okay. Recommended...
L596626 +++$+++ u8306 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ MRS SPITZ +++$+++ You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.
L596625 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Didn’t you say I came recommended?  That’s what I thought. May I know by whom?
L596624 +++$+++ u8306 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ MRS SPITZ +++$+++ Must I speak to you in French?
L596623 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Recommended?
L596622 +++$+++ u8306 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ MRS SPITZ +++$+++ Whatever, you come recommended. We...
L596621 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Well, I would have to point out that we could have dealt with that question when you called this morning, Mrs Spitz. I wouldn’t like to think I’d kept you waiting for nothing.
L596620 +++$+++ u8306 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ MRS SPITZ +++$+++ What if it is?
L596619 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ I hope it’s not too significant.
L596618 +++$+++ u8306 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ MRS SPITZ +++$+++ Lombard, this is not a Jewish name, is it?
L596617 +++$+++ u8306 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ MRS SPITZ +++$+++ May I ask if you are Jewish, Mr Lombard?
L596616 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ May I...?
L596613 +++$+++ u8306 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ MRS SPITZ +++$+++ Spitz. We spoke on the telephone.  My husband...  My daughter, Deborah, whose house this is.  My son-in-law, Carlos...  The gentleman is a business partner of his.
