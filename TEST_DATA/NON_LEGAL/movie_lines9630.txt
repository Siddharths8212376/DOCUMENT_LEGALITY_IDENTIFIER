L107149 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Ha!  What a load of crap.  Look at yourself, Caesar.  You're a thug. |You launder money for the mob.  You rent women like you rented this apartment.
L107148 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ I saved you.
L107144 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Everything you couldn't.
L107143 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ What did she do to you?
L107140 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Let us go and we'll make a deal.
L107139 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Shut up, Violet.
L107138 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ You need the money just like we do.
L107137 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Don't try to tell me what to do.
L107136 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
L107135 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Stupid cunt!
L107130 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Not until he has the money!
L107129 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Violet!
L107128 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ He can't kill you --
L107127 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Shut up, Violet!
L107126 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Don't tell him --
L107125 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Where is the money?
L107097 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Just hurry.
L107096 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ I can use Johnnie's car, dump it in Lake Michigan ...  I need plastic bags ...  tape and rope ...
L107081 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Who are you going to call?
L107080 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ We're going to need some time.
L107079 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ What are you doing?
L107078 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ I don't know.  it could be anywhere. We don't even know if he was alone. Please, Caesar, we don't have much time.  Let's get out of here.
L107077 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Where, then?
L107076 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ It's not here, Caesar.
L107059 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Caesar, someone could see us out here.
L107058 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!
L107011 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ They're just cops.  Stall them as long as you can.
L107010 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Caesar, what are we going to do?
L107009 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Fuck.
L107005 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ I don't know.  We may never know, but I'm going to guess it was a job, maybe the Karpoli family.
L107004 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ What happened to them?
L107003 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ No I didn't.  Not if his body disappears and not if the money is still here.  Then they never showed up.
L107002 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.
L107001 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened.
L107000 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ What?
L106999 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
L106998 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Caesar, what are you going to do?
L106997 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ ...  maybe three hours.
L106975 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ For Christ's sake, Johnnie, do what he says.
L106974 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Tell them!  Tell them!
L106948 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Shut up, Violet!  This is between me and Johnnie.
L106947 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Caesar ...
L106946 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ All right, Johnnie, you want to play it this way, I can play it this way. You want to know who made a mistake, why don't you open the case.
L106905 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ I've seen the way he looks at you. He's always wanted you.  Maybe two million dollars finally bought you.
L106904 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ You don't, you can't believe that ...
L106903 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ It would have been so easy to let him in as you went out.
L106902 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.  Maybe you dropped the Scotch by accident. Maybe you didn't.
L106901 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Caesar, this is crazy.
L106900 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ If you're not with me, Violet, then I have to assume you're against me.
L106899 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Violet, I won't let you leave.
L106898 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've never needed me!  I can't help you! Understand?!  I have to get out.
L106897 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ I need you ...
L106896 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ The hell I can't!
L106895 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ You can't leave.
L106892 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ This is insane!
L106891 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ See, right now he doesn't know that I know, that's why he put the paper in the case.  He wants me to hand the case to Gino.  Then there is no doubt it was me.  Gino will put a bullet in me himself.  But it ain't going to happen.  I won't let it! Johnnie ain't going to fuck me!  Not like this!  No way!
L106890 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ No.
L106889 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ He didn't see you, did he?
L106888 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ He didn't have that much time.  He had to pick up Gino.  I bet you he's got it with him.  I bet it's in the car.
L106887 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ But it could be anywhere.
L106886 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ No.  Johnnie's got it.  All I got to do is get it back.
L106885 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ The money?  The money's gone.
L106884 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ I got it!  I know what I got to do! I got to get the money.
L106870 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ All right, Caesar.
L106869 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just leave me the fuck alone!  Please! Leave!  Now!
L106868 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late --
L106867 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Violet, please!
L106866 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Caesar, maybe we should run --
L106865 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Got to think this through ...
L106857 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Caesar, what are we going to do?
L106856 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ So what?!  So fucking what?  Use your head, Violet.  The money is gone.  Gino is coming here to get it.  You think he's going to believe me if I tell him his piss-hole son stole it!  Is that what you think? I don't.  You know what I think?  I think I'm a dead man.  I'm one in the brain.  That's what I think!
L106855 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ But you know he did it.
L106854 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ I hate that little fuck!  I hate him!  I hate him!  I should've done him!
L106853 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Jesus Christ, Violet!  Open your fucking eyes!  Johnnie hates me like I hate him!
L106852 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Why?  Why would Johnnie do this?
L106832 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Caesar, I know Johnnie.  It was him. I screamed when I saw him.  I couldn't believe I missed them.  I knew you were going to be upset so I thought I'd apologize and give Gino the Scotch.  I honked a couple of times but he didn't stop.
L106831 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ It's impossible!
L106830 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ It was him.  I'm positive.
L106829 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ It couldn't have been.
L106828 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ I was getting out of the car when I saw him in the Mercedes.
L106827 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ What?
L106826 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Because I just saw Johnnie downstairs.
L106825 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Why?
L106824 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ That doesn't make any sense.
L106823 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ No!  They're still on their way.
L106822 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ You mean they weren't up here?
L106821 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ What are you, drunk?
L106820 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ They just left, didn't they?
L106819 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L106818 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ They were early.
L106794 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Don't be silly, Caesar.  It'll take five minutes.
L106793 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ There's no time.
L106792 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Don't worry, I'll get some more.
L106791 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ I'm sorry.  It was an accident.
L106790 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Fuck!  Fuck!  How did you ...  Awwww goddammit!
L106707 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Ummm ...  in the linen closet.
L106706 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Where the hell's the laundry detergent?
L106705 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ I told them to run it through the cycles.  But I guess Gino has plans for it because he's coming here tomorrow night to pick this shit up.
L106704 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ What are you going to do with it?
L106703 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Just look at this mess I got to deal with.
L106697 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ It was unbelievable!  Un-fucking- believable!
L106696 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Caesar, what happened?
L106633 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Why?  'Cause you know him?
L106632 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Caesar, I'm serious.  This is too much.  I have to get out of here.
L106631 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ What?  Oh, come on, I didn't use one of the good towels.
L106630 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Caesar, I'm leaving.
L106530 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ You're right.  You don't have to tell me, if you don't want to.  I just hope you understand you're among good people here.
L106529 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar.
L106528 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Not bad.  What for?
L106524 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ What?  It ain't no big fuckin' deal. I know who Don hires.  Did you know he did time himself?
L106523 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Jesus, Caesar!
L106522 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ So, you just got out?
L106520 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ No shit.  Bianchinni hired you?  You know he's a good friend of mine. |Family, really.
L106519 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ She's doing the work herself.
L106514 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ I'm sorry, Christ, I thought ... it's fucking dark in here.
L106513 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ Caesar, this is Corky.  Corky, Caesar.
L106512 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Oh, shit ...
L106511 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ What the fuck is going on?
L106510 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ I didn't expect --
L106385 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ All part of the business.
L106384 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ All part of the business.
L106383 +++$+++ u4214 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ VIOLET +++$+++ We make our own choices, we pay our own prices.
L107055 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Good idea.
L107054 +++$+++ u4209 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ COP #1 +++$+++ Try to keep the extra batteries for your aid around.
L107049 +++$+++ u4209 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ COP #1 +++$+++ Go right ahead, sir.
L107048 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ I'm going to make myself a drink, if that's okay?
L107044 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Oh, right.
L107043 +++$+++ u4209 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ COP #1 +++$+++ Not on duty, sorry.
L107040 +++$+++ u4209 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ COP #1 +++$+++ It's all right, sir.
L107039 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Fuck, this happened before.  It's this shitty ear.  Born with it.  The batteries wore out in my aid.  I'm sorry.
L107030 +++$+++ u4209 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ COP #1 +++$+++ Pretty good, sir.
L107029 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ How's it going tonight, fellas?
L107175 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ I could be lying.
L107174 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Why?
L107173 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ You can't kill me yet.
L107165 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ When I reach ten, then I'll start with you.
L107164 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ No.
L107163 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ I'm going to ask you where the money is.  Every time you don't give me an answer, I'm going to cut off one finger.
L107134 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Either pull the trigger or get that thing out of my face.
L107133 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Where is it?
L107132 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Lick me.
L107131 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Now, where the fuck is my money?
L106537 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Sure.
L106536 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Another time.
L106535 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ My brushes, I have to clean my brushes.  Thanks, though.
L106534 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ What?  How about a drink?
L106533 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ I should be going.
L106532 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Good.  I hate to worry.  I got ulcers.
L106527 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ Five.
L106526 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ How many'd you do?
L106518 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ No.  Rajeev's in India.
L106517 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ You're helping Rajeev?
L106382 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Where's the fucking money?
L106381 +++$+++ u4210 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CORKY +++$+++ You planned this whole thing, didn't you?
L107253 +++$+++ u4213 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Leave your phone on the hook.
L107252 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Call me as soon as you get him.
L107248 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Oh yeah.  Violet!
L107247 +++$+++ u4213 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ You got the key?
L107229 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Ssh!  I can't hear Gino!
L107228 +++$+++ u4213 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Un-fucking-believable.  I called those highway patrol dumb fucks.
L107222 +++$+++ u4213 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Where in the hell is he?
L107221 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ It's Gino!  It's Gino!
L107211 +++$+++ u4213 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Fuck it, I don't need the key.
L107210 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ The key, yeah, the key's in my pants in the bathroom.
L107209 +++$+++ u4213 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Hey, Caesar, where's the key?
L107205 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Yeah, that's it.
L107204 +++$+++ u4213 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Is that the money?
L107203 +++$+++ u4213 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Sure, Cease.  They make us do stupid things, don't they.
L107202 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Actually, yeah, she was nervous about Gino coming, wanted everything to look right.  You know women, Mick.
L107200 +++$+++ u4213 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Why'd you move all the furniture around?
L107199 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Yeah.
L107198 +++$+++ u4213 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Cease, can I ask you something?
L107197 +++$+++ u4213 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Hey, if Violet was helping me relax, I'd probably do the same thing.
L107196 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Oh Christ, the phone ...  That was a fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't it?
L107195 +++$+++ u4213 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I started thinking maybe it's about the money so I call you, but all I get is the busy signal.  I figure the phone is off the hook, that's why I come rushing over here.
L107194 +++$+++ u4213 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ We went over to Johnnie's place just to check it out and it was busted up, Bad.
L107193 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Me?  Why?
L107192 +++$+++ u4213 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ We was worried about you, Cease.
L107191 +++$+++ u4208 +++$+++ m281 +++$+++ CAESAR +++$+++ Shit, Mick, come on in, let me get you a drink.  Sit down, Lou.
