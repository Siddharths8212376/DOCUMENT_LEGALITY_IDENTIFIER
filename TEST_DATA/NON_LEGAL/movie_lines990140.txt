L396859 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ In so many ways ... and yet it is your presence they crave.  A figurehead.
L396858 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Is that not enough?
L396857 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
L396856 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Then they may read about me.
L396854 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ But I lack your prose, Mr Disraeli.
L396853 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ Your Majesty remains at the very epicenter of governance.  As for your people, look no further than the sales of your Highland Journals to see in what affection the nation holds their Queen.  You sell even more copies than Mr Dickens.
L396720 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ I was trying to imagine "rather upset."
L396719 +++$+++ u6703 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ The Princess Louisa is too ill to move.  Frankly, the Queen's rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity.  You're smiling.
L396718 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ What's her excuse this time?
L396717 +++$+++ u6703 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ She's refusing to leave Balmoral.
L396716 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ In the press, perhaps.  But she's sold more copies of her Highland Journal in three months than Punch will ever sell in a year.  Time to wheel her out.
L396715 +++$+++ u6703 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ It's questionable whether there's any advantage to be had from that direction.  She's never been less popular.
L396714 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ Mrs Brown.
L396713 +++$+++ u6703 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ Who?
L396712 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ Gladstone's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years. We need help.  Where is the old girl?
L396711 +++$+++ u6703 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ You can't know that for sure.
L396710 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ We're going to lose.
L396662 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ To know when he'll be king.
L396661 +++$+++ u6703 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ What did he want?
L396628 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ I hope he got his mother's permission.
L396627 +++$+++ u6703 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ I see the Prince of Wales is here.
L396554 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ We'll see which way the wind blows.
L396553 +++$+++ u6703 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ So?
L396552 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ Gossip counts.  Lord Aberdeen was right.  This country is not governed by wisdom but by talk.  Granted, it wouldn't take much to winkle the old girl out of mourning, but if public opinion is against her, then it doesn't do to appear too close.
L396551 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ My dear Stanley, a Prime Minister with only a handful of friends must respect public opinion.
L396550 +++$+++ u6703 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense--
L396549 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ The question is, do we need her?
L396548 +++$+++ u6703 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ Well, both.
L396547 +++$+++ u6698 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ DISRAELI +++$+++ The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?
L396546 +++$+++ u6703 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ Should we take it seriously?
L397035 +++$+++ u6701 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ PONSONBY +++$+++ No, indeed.
L397034 +++$+++ u6699 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ JENNER +++$+++ Well, no rest for the wicked, Henry.
L397033 +++$+++ u6701 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ PONSONBY +++$+++ Some young page was boasting about having seen it.  Lucky.
L397032 +++$+++ u6699 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ JENNER +++$+++ Where did you find it by the way?
L397031 +++$+++ u6699 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ JENNER +++$+++ Of course.
L397030 +++$+++ u6701 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ PONSONBY +++$+++ Quite.  I think I'd best take it back.
L397029 +++$+++ u6699 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ JENNER +++$+++ Yes.
L397028 +++$+++ u6701 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ PONSONBY +++$+++ We think she can be dissuaded.  Have you had a glance at the diary?
L397027 +++$+++ u6699 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ JENNER +++$+++ Dear oh dear.
L397026 +++$+++ u6701 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ PONSONBY +++$+++ The Queen wishes to publish an account of him.
L397025 +++$+++ u6699 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ JENNER +++$+++ A few days...  When he heard, the Prince of Wales threw the bust from the window of the Royal Gallery.  It took four hours to gather the fragments.
L397024 +++$+++ u6701 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ PONSONBY +++$+++ Not too protracted, I hope.
L397023 +++$+++ u6699 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ JENNER +++$+++ Erysipelas.
L396675 +++$+++ u6701 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ PONSONBY +++$+++ No, she wasn't.
L396674 +++$+++ u6699 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ JENNER +++$+++ A distinct flushing around the cheeks. She was drunk, I tell you.
L396375 +++$+++ u6699 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ JENNER +++$+++ Excellent!
L396374 +++$+++ u6701 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ PONSONBY +++$+++ A fine choice, sir.
L396988 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ How ill is he?
L396987 +++$+++ u6699 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ JENNER +++$+++ I did not consider it wise, in the circumstances, to tax your nerves.
L396986 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Why was I not informed?
L396985 +++$+++ u6699 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ JENNER +++$+++ The same, your Majesty.
L396984 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ No.  You are mistaken.  Prince Albert, my husband, had typhoid fever.  I asked what was wrong with my son.
L396532 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ I will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy....
L396531 +++$+++ u6699 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ JENNER +++$+++ Forgive me, Your Majesty.  In no way did I wish to suggest--
L396530 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Why am I being lectured in this way?!
L396529 +++$+++ u6699 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ JENNER +++$+++ Excellent, ma'am, excellent.  But perhaps if her Majesty were to consider accompanying her new-found physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity...
L396528 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Cold is good!
L396527 +++$+++ u6699 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ JENNER +++$+++ I'm sorry, ma'am?
L396383 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Whom?
L396382 +++$+++ u6699 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ JENNER +++$+++ We're expecting Brown this afternoon, ma'am.
L397015 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Why was I not told earlier?
L397014 +++$+++ u6700 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ LADY ELY +++$+++ A few days, ma'am.
L397013 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ How long has he been this sick?
L396790 +++$+++ u6700 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ LADY ELY +++$+++ I believe not, ma'am.  I understand -- he'd had rather too much to drink.
L396789 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Has he been hurt?
L396788 +++$+++ u6700 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ LADY ELY +++$+++ I understand he was in a fight.
L396787 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Unwell?
L396786 +++$+++ u6700 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ LADY ELY +++$+++ I believe he is unwell, ma'am.
L396785 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Why?
L396784 +++$+++ u6700 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ LADY ELY +++$+++ Mr Brown is unable to attend today.
L396783 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Well?
L396462 +++$+++ u6700 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ LADY ELY +++$+++ I don't know, ma'am.  He was observed earlier, I believe.
L396461 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ I made no request to go out riding today.  How long has he been there?
L396460 +++$+++ u6700 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ LADY ELY +++$+++ He appears to be ... standing by his horse.
L396459 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ What is he doing there?
L396458 +++$+++ u6700 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ LADY ELY +++$+++ It's Mr Brown, ma'am.
L396381 +++$+++ u6700 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ LADY ELY +++$+++ Yes, ma'am.
L396380 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Just them?
L396379 +++$+++ u6700 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ LADY ELY +++$+++ The Royal Family and senior members of the household, ma'am.
L396833 +++$+++ u6701 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ PONSONBY +++$+++ Ma'am.
L396832 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Please tell the Princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort.  Do I make myself clear?
L396831 +++$+++ u6701 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ PONSONBY +++$+++ Ma'am?
L396826 +++$+++ u6701 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ PONSONBY +++$+++ They are demanding the dismissal of John Brown on grounds of drunkeness.
L396825 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ What do they want?
L396824 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ My family is quite capable of communicating with the Queen in person.
L396823 +++$+++ u6701 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ PONSONBY +++$+++ From Princess Helena and other members of your family.
L396822 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ From whom?
L396821 +++$+++ u6701 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ PONSONBY +++$+++ I have a letter, ma'am.
L396820 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ What is it?
L396819 +++$+++ u6701 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ PONSONBY +++$+++ There is one other matter.
L396744 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Is it not enough that She is uncheered and unguided that she should also have to suffer these malicious rumors?!  I am not a fool.  I know there are those in the establishment too afraid to attack me and so they attack my dearest friends. Sometimes -- I feel that Brown is all I have left of Albert.  And now they attack Brown too.
L396743 +++$+++ u6701 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ PONSONBY +++$+++ Your Majesty --
L396742 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ No-one should think themselves wiser than me!  It is not for any of the Queen's subjects to presume to tell Her Majesty when and where She should come out of mourning.  It is the Queen's sorrow that keeps her secluded!  It is Her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility, work which She feels will soon wear her out entirely!
L396741 +++$+++ u6701 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ PONSONBY +++$+++ I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser than yourself.
L396740 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Why not?
L396739 +++$+++ u6701 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ PONSONBY +++$+++ I have no idea.
L396738 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Who told them that?
L396736 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Read it!
L396735 +++$+++ u6701 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ PONSONBY +++$+++ Again?
L396734 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Read it.
L396668 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ And now I am back.
L396667 +++$+++ u6701 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ PONSONBY +++$+++ We were expecting you to return by six.
L396666 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ We stayed a little longer than expected with Mr and Mrs Grant.  It was most agreeable.
L396517 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ No.  I shall be out walking.
L396516 +++$+++ u6701 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ PONSONBY +++$+++ He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government.
L396515 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Why?
L396514 +++$+++ u6701 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ PONSONBY +++$+++ Lord Clarendon arrives, by invitation, at eleven o'clock, followed at twelve by a picnic in the grounds to celebrate Princess Alice's birthday. Dispatches, as usual, at two.  The Chancellor writes to say that, by happy coincidence, he will be in Cowes for the weekend.  He asks if Your Majesty might grant him an audience.
L396466 +++$+++ u6701 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ PONSONBY +++$+++ Of course, at once.
L396465 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Please make sure it does not happen again.
L396464 +++$+++ u6701 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ PONSONBY +++$+++ I'm very sorry, ma'am.  I can't imagine -- he was certainly given no instructions.
L396463 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Sir Henry, Mr Brown is standing in the courtyard.  I have no wish to go riding.
L396983 +++$+++ u6702 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ PRINCESS ALEXANDRA +++$+++ He has typhoid fever, ma'am.
L396982 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ What is the matter with him?
L396981 +++$+++ u6702 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ PRINCESS ALEXANDRA +++$+++ You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral.
L396980 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Then why are you not with him?
L396979 +++$+++ u6702 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ PRINCESS ALEXANDRA +++$+++ He is sick, ma'am.
L396978 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Why is he not here?
L396977 +++$+++ u6702 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ PRINCESS ALEXANDRA +++$+++ Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.
L396976 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ Where is my son?
L396385 +++$+++ u6702 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ PRINCESS ALEXANDRA +++$+++ Yes, ma'am.
L396384 +++$+++ u6704 +++$+++ m446 +++$+++ VICTORIA +++$+++ That's a very pretty shawl you are wearing, Alex.  Silk suits you well.  But you are not eating enough.  One must not let vanity overrule one's appetite.
L398836 +++$+++ u6705 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ Sure.
L398835 +++$+++ u6712 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Thanks, Albert.  Think you could print up those schematics?
L398834 +++$+++ u6705 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ Well, technically "yes", but this is only the prototype.
L398833 +++$+++ u6712 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Could you play ARCADE with that?
L398826 +++$+++ u6705 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ Well, we're veering into classified info here, but I'll tell you that it involved a donor.  He was dead of course, so it's not like anything unethical was happening.
L398825 +++$+++ u6712 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ How the hell did you do that?
L398817 +++$+++ u6705 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ Well...it involves a paradox.  You have to trick The Boatman.  Now all the while, you also have to watch your strength.  You can build that back up by catching FIREFLIES...the little glowing guys...
L398816 +++$+++ u6712 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Just tell me the fucking riddle.
L398815 +++$+++ u6705 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ If I tell you, then it's no fun.
L398814 +++$+++ u6712 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What's the riddle?
L398813 +++$+++ u6705 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ You can't.  He gets you and you're dead. It's like time catching up with you, you know?  Like Fate.  Each level you get progressively less time to complete.  First half of the game takes place in the Wild Lands.  Then you reach Level 6, and that's the Sea of Darkness.  There's a two-headed Boatman that'll take you across if you answer his riddle right.  If you don't...
L398812 +++$+++ u6712 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ How do you stop The Screamer?
L398811 +++$+++ u6705 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ You've got your ten levels, right? Here they are...  Each level has an exit, only remember, the exits aren't always what they seem.  First one's The Blood Red Sky, then you've got The Blue Desert, Tower of Ghosts, Kingdom of the Blind...  On each world you have to find a golden key and you've only got so much time to do it in.  If you're too late, The Screamer comes.
L398808 +++$+++ u6705 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ It's a tough game.  Hard to pin that bastard down.  Keeps on changing the rules.
L398807 +++$+++ u6712 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What do you mean?
L398804 +++$+++ u6705 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ Getting there.  It's more sensitive than a joy-stick.  Your video-character can respond as fast as you can.  But what can I do for you?
L398803 +++$+++ u6712 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Does that thing work?
L398832 +++$+++ u6705 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ And maybe you've been taking too many drugs.
L398831 +++$+++ u6706 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the game.
L398830 +++$+++ u6705 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ He?
L398829 +++$+++ u6706 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Maybe he's not dead.
L398828 +++$+++ u6705 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ Well, brain-dead anyway.  Coma patient. It's really not all that important.
L398827 +++$+++ u6706 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Dead?
L398824 +++$+++ u6705 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ It's the game's logic core.  We actually patterned it after human brainwaves.  I mean, there's a personality in there. That's what makes it so incredible.
L398823 +++$+++ u6706 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ But how can it change every time?
L398822 +++$+++ u6705 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ Good question.  See, that's where the fun comes in.  ARCADE changes it every time. He's a machine without a soul. Once you give him a soul, he stops being a threat.
L398821 +++$+++ u6706 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ How do you do that?
L398820 +++$+++ u6705 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ Level Ten.  That's where you've got to unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've found.
L398819 +++$+++ u6706 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ What's the question mark?
L398818 +++$+++ u6705 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ The next half of the game takes place in ARCADE's brain, The City of Truth. It's urban scenarios, lots of metal and concrete. Screamer comes faster here.  On Level Four you can get a free life if you wait until the last possible second before exiting that world.  Gotta time it right though.
L398810 +++$+++ u6705 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ Sure.  Every game's got 'em.  I'll start with the schematics.  I can print these up if you want.
L398809 +++$+++ u6706 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ We vere thinking there might be tricks. You know, surprises that you'd worked into the game...
L398806 +++$+++ u6705 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ Yeah, who isn't.
L398805 +++$+++ u6706 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ We're having some problems with ARCADE...
L398789 +++$+++ u6706 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ There's something wrong with ARCADE. The game's alive somehow...
L398788 +++$+++ u6709 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ DIFFORD +++$+++ Talk to me.
L398787 +++$+++ u6709 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ DIFFORD +++$+++ Why don't we take this into my office.
L398786 +++$+++ u6706 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Neither are we.  Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford.
L398785 +++$+++ u6709 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ DIFFORD +++$+++ If this is a joke, I'm not laughing.
L398783 +++$+++ u6709 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ DIFFORD +++$+++ You don't like it?
L398782 +++$+++ u6706 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ It's the game, ARCADE.
L398781 +++$+++ u6709 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ DIFFORD +++$+++ Now what seems to be the problem?
L398780 +++$+++ u6709 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ DIFFORD +++$+++ Security camera.  Pulled your files before I came down. Be careful what you say, kids ... I know where you live.
L398779 +++$+++ u6706 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ How'd you know it was us?
L398778 +++$+++ u6709 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ DIFFORD +++$+++ Nick, Alex, how are we today?
L398974 +++$+++ u6706 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ But you always lie, so you didn't come from there.  That means the city on the left must be the City of Truth.
L398973 +++$+++ u6713 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ STILTS +++$+++ I came from the city on the left.
L398972 +++$+++ u6706 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Liar.  Did you come from the city on the left, or the city on the right?
L398683 +++$+++ u6713 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ STILTS +++$+++ Actually, no.  I was just telling Nick, here, that my t.v.'s busted...
L398682 +++$+++ u6706 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Did you play ARCADE last night?
L398681 +++$+++ u6713 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ STILTS +++$+++ What's her problem?
L398680 +++$+++ u6706 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ ALEX +++$+++ Everybody's sick, huh?  It's fifteen after.  We always meet here, you know that.
L398679 +++$+++ u6713 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ STILTS +++$+++ Sick?
L398599 +++$+++ u6713 +++$+++ m447 +++$+++ STILTS +++$+++ He's probably outside.  You know how he is. Gets bored...
