L281790 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ Most people would show some sign of fear with a gun in their face.
L281789 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ Maybe he was a lousy shot.
L281788 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ Seven years ago I interviewed a guy. He said he saw two men fighting in an alley with swords.  One cut off the others head.  He shot the surviving guy twenty times and he got right back up and stabbed him.
L281787 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ It's late.
L281786 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ That doesn't mean you don't know what's going on.  You're connected to this guy somehow.  He's after you -- just like the others were.
L281785 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ I'm sorry about that -- but I had nothing to do with it.
L281784 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ No -- it isn't.  A cop died today and the other is barely holding on.  I want some answers, Nash.
L281783 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ Good evening, Lieutenant.
L281459 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ Get outta here.
L281458 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ Lieutenant, you're really frightening me.
L281457 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ No.  I'm telling you right now, the next person's head that comes off is gonna be yours.
L281456 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ Is that it?
L281455 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ I'm gonna nail you, Nash.  That's a promise.
L281443 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ He doesn't look familiar -- but then he'd probably be easier to identity with his head.
L281442 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ You sure?
L281441 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ No.
L281440 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ I brought you here to talk about him. Do you know him?
L281439 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ No.
L281438 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ You didn't bring me here to talk about her.
L281437 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ She was a good woman.
L281435 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ And Brenda?
L281434 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ Around.
L281433 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ Where have you been for the last seven years?
L281432 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ No.  I don't scare easy.
L281431 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ Doesn't it scare you walk through the park at night?
L281430 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ Central Park.
L281429 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ Tell me again.  Where'd you go?
L281428 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ I already told you.  I took a walk.
L281427 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ Where were you last night around nine?
L281425 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ That's what I figured.  Well, I have a little home coming present for you.
L281424 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ A few days ago.
L281423 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ When did you get back?
L281420 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ Congratulations.
L281419 +++$+++ u5849 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ BEDSOE +++$+++ Lieutenant.
L281418 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ Detective Bedsoe.
L281626 +++$+++ u5851 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAVANAUGH +++$+++ No -- after you.
L281625 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ You can go first.
L281619 +++$+++ u5851 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAVANAUGH +++$+++ You always get to go first.
L281618 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ That doesn't matter.
L281617 +++$+++ u5851 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAVANAUGH +++$+++ I stood up first.
L281616 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ No -- I will.
L281615 +++$+++ u5851 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAVANAUGH +++$+++ I'll go first.
L281602 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ It's done.
L281601 +++$+++ u5851 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAVANAUGH +++$+++ Well?
L281581 +++$+++ u5851 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAVANAUGH +++$+++ The only thing you can do.  You must end it.
L281580 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ No.  What am I to do?
L281579 +++$+++ u5851 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAVANAUGH +++$+++ That was two hundred and fifty years ago -- and the pain still scars your heart.  Would you live that pain again?
L281578 +++$+++ u5851 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAVANAUGH +++$+++ So, you do this for yourself?  What about her?  You cannot not have a relationship, Macleod.  You've told me of your wife, Heather, and how you loved her. Romeriz warned you then, but you would not listen.  You watched her grow old and die -- and there was nothing you could do.
L281577 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone.
L281576 +++$+++ u5851 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAVANAUGH +++$+++ You've been seeing her for over a month now.  Have you learned nothing from the past?
L281575 +++$+++ u5851 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAVANAUGH +++$+++ You.
L281574 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ What worries you?
L281573 +++$+++ u5851 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAVANAUGH +++$+++ Yes.
L281562 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ Then she should be an excellent dancer.
L281561 +++$+++ u5851 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAVANAUGH +++$+++ She's the King's cousin.
L281560 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ To ask her to dance.
L281557 +++$+++ u5851 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAVANAUGH +++$+++ You may be living -- but this suit is killing me.
L281556 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ Living.  Remember?
L281555 +++$+++ u5851 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAVANAUGH +++$+++ What are we doing here?
L281503 +++$+++ u5851 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAVANAUGH +++$+++ Me?  Of course.
L281502 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ Not long.  We should arrive in the morning.  Are you going to be alright?
L281501 +++$+++ u5851 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAVANAUGH +++$+++ How long is the voyage?
L281500 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ France.
L281499 +++$+++ u5851 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAVANAUGH +++$+++ The sea and I don't agree with each other.  Where we off to?
L281498 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ You're looking a wee bit green, Thomas.
L281380 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ I do not know.  I pray that I shall never have to raise my sword against one that I call friend.
L281379 +++$+++ u5851 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAVANAUGH +++$+++ If it came down to it what would you do?
L281378 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ That is a thought that doesn't please me.
L281377 +++$+++ u5851 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAVANAUGH +++$+++ We cannot write our destiny, Macleod. In the end it could be you and me.
L281376 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ As friends -- always as friends.
L281375 +++$+++ u5851 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAVANAUGH +++$+++ I'm sure they will.
L281374 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ For being a friend when I needed one. I hope our paths cross again.
L281373 +++$+++ u5851 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAVANAUGH +++$+++ For what?
L281372 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ Thank you, Thomas.
L281371 +++$+++ u5851 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAVANAUGH +++$+++ Then it's worth the journey.
L281370 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ Maybe myself.
L281369 +++$+++ u5851 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAVANAUGH +++$+++ And what do you think you will find in another land?
L281368 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ England.  There is nothing for me here anymore.
L281367 +++$+++ u5851 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAVANAUGH +++$+++ Leaving what?
L281366 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ I'm leaving.
L281362 +++$+++ u5851 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAVANAUGH +++$+++ I see.  You don't care about life anymore.
L281361 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ That is what bothers me.
L281360 +++$+++ u5851 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAVANAUGH +++$+++ Do you not hear the wind in the trees?  The songs of the birds.  The horses breath?  There is a whole world around you. Alive.  Living.  Feel it -- become part of it.  Live your life, Highlander.  It's going to be a long one.
L281359 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ Yes.
L281358 +++$+++ u5851 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAVANAUGH +++$+++ That's all?
L281357 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ The river.
L281356 +++$+++ u5851 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAVANAUGH +++$+++ What else?  What else do you hear right now?
L281355 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ I hear you.
L281354 +++$+++ u5851 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAVANAUGH +++$+++ Life.  You've stopped living it.  You look, but you do not see.  You listen but, you do not hear.
L281353 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ You?
L281352 +++$+++ u5851 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAVANAUGH +++$+++ Are you always this pleasant?  You know what you're problem is?
L281351 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ Can't you enjoy it quietly?
L281350 +++$+++ u5851 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAVANAUGH +++$+++ It is a beautiful day.  I am merely enjoying it.
L281349 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ Sing.
L281348 +++$+++ u5851 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAVANAUGH +++$+++ What?
L281347 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ Must you do that?
L281311 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ Perhaps -- but if I must face it, let it find me, for I shall search for it no more.
L281310 +++$+++ u5851 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAVANAUGH +++$+++ You cannot run from your destiny, Conner.
L281308 +++$+++ u5851 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAVANAUGH +++$+++ Aye -- yet one such as I who has wandered this world for nearly nine centuries can remember back to other days of change.  Days of Robin of the Hood and Arthur Pendragon.  They were real enough once, but they drifted into men's dreams and became legend - - as we shall do one day.
L281307 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ The days of magic are ending.  The world is changing.
L281306 +++$+++ u5851 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAVANAUGH +++$+++ There will be more to the prize than that.  Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good.
L281305 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ The prize?  So much blood so that in the end the one that remains will be mortal again.  So much pain so that the winner can grow old and have children.  The prize hardly seems worth the cost of it.
L281297 +++$+++ u5851 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAVANAUGH +++$+++ Indeed you did.  And now it is time for you to pass on to others what you learned from him.
L281296 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ I learned my fill from Romeriz.
L281295 +++$+++ u5851 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAVANAUGH +++$+++ Thomas Cavenaugh.  I am a teacher of sorts.  Like Romeriz I help those newly acquainted with our life.
L281294 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ Who are you?
L281293 +++$+++ u5851 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAVANAUGH +++$+++ We too are brothers, Macleod.  In fact, you have more family than you think.
L281292 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ No.  He was my brother.  He died at anothers hand.
L281291 +++$+++ u5851 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAVANAUGH +++$+++ You?
L281290 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ Aye.
L281289 +++$+++ u5851 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAVANAUGH +++$+++ I know that weapon.  It belonged to Juan Romeriz.  He's dead?
L281288 +++$+++ u5851 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAVANAUGH +++$+++ Caution shows wisdom.
L281287 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ Since we hardly know each other, I'm sure you'll understand if I hold one to it for awhile.
L281286 +++$+++ u5851 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ CAVANAUGH +++$+++ You'll have no need for that, Highlander.
L281250 +++$+++ u5853 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ FARMER +++$+++ How?
L281249 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ I would like to say goodbye.
L281248 +++$+++ u5853 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ FARMER +++$+++ Agreed.
L281247 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ It is.  Do not ask me how.  I do not know.  I must leave, for if I stayed others would surely hear of this and worse than they will come.
L281246 +++$+++ u5853 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ FARMER +++$+++ This cannot be.
L281238 +++$+++ u5853 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ FARMER +++$+++ I know that for six months you've worked hard and asked for little. That you're a good and honest man. What more need I know?
L281237 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ Your words are kind and they flatter me -- but I think of her as a sister. Besides, you hardly know me.
L281236 +++$+++ u5853 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ FARMER +++$+++ She'll soon be of age.
L281235 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ She's a treasure she is.
L281234 +++$+++ u5853 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ FARMER +++$+++ I think my Sarah fancies you, Conner.
L281231 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ I think you just like to eat dirt.
L281230 +++$+++ u5853 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ FARMER +++$+++ What do you think?
L281229 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ Can you really tell from doing that?
L281228 +++$+++ u5853 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ FARMER +++$+++ It will be a good harvest this year.
L281188 +++$+++ u5854 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ HOODED MAN +++$+++ I lied.
L281187 +++$+++ u5868 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ VIEIRA +++$+++ We had a bargain.  You promised.
L281180 +++$+++ u5868 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ VIEIRA +++$+++ How?
L281179 +++$+++ u5854 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ HOODED MAN +++$+++ Your life.
L281178 +++$+++ u5868 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ VIEIRA +++$+++ And what would'st I gain from this bargain?
L281177 +++$+++ u5854 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ HOODED MAN +++$+++ I've come to strike a bargain with you.  I wish to learn the power of changing.
L281176 +++$+++ u5854 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ HOODED MAN +++$+++ Would'st you harm one who comes to aid you?
L281175 +++$+++ u5868 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ VIEIRA +++$+++ How comes it your are not afraid?
L281597 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ Because, it's for the best.  There are somethings that are better left unexplained.
L281596 +++$+++ u5855 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ ISABELLE +++$+++ Why are you doing this?
L281595 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ Where I'm going you cannot follow.
L281594 +++$+++ u5855 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ ISABELLE +++$+++ Then take me with you.
L281593 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ Aye.
L281592 +++$+++ u5855 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ ISABELLE +++$+++ Do you love me, Conner?
L281591 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ I cannot explain.
L281590 +++$+++ u5855 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ ISABELLE +++$+++ Why?
L281589 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ You'll no see me again.
L281588 +++$+++ u5855 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ ISABELLE +++$+++ Leaving?  For how long?
L281587 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ I'm leaving in the morning.
L281586 +++$+++ u5855 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ ISABELLE +++$+++ Why not?
L281585 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ I cannot stay.
L281570 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ Because it's the past -- and things that are in the past are best left there.
L281569 +++$+++ u5855 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ ISABELLE +++$+++ Why is it you never talk to me about Scotland -- your life there.
L281568 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ Sometimes.
L281567 +++$+++ u5855 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ ISABELLE +++$+++ The past?
L281566 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ Different places.
L281565 +++$+++ u5855 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ ISABELLE +++$+++ Where do you go when your mind drifts?
L281564 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ Aye?
L281277 +++$+++ u5856 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Paul.  I thought we agreed.  No press.
L281276 +++$+++ u5864 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ REPORTER +++$+++ No -- we're from Strange facts and mysteries.  It's a syndicated show out of..
L281275 +++$+++ u5856 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ You guys are from the British museum, right?
L281274 +++$+++ u5864 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ REPORTER +++$+++ What are you hoping to find inside?
L281273 +++$+++ u5856 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Huge.
L281272 +++$+++ u5864 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ REPORTER +++$+++ Any idea how big the cavern is on the other side?
L281271 +++$+++ u5856 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Electro magnetic soundings indicate we've only got a few inches of rock left before we reach the main chamber.
L281822 +++$+++ u5856 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Sounds very -- normal.
L281821 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ Now I can start to live.  To feel. To grow old and live each day without the promise of another.
L281820 +++$+++ u5856 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ What now?
L281802 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ Conner?
L281801 +++$+++ u5856 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Be careful, Conner.
L281800 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ Get out.
L281799 +++$+++ u5856 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ He's in there!
L281782 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ He will not stop until it is over.
L281781 +++$+++ u5856 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Must you fight him?
L281780 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ It will end tonight.
L281779 +++$+++ u5856 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Where will you go now?
L281778 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ He is immortal -- yes -- but he is not like me.  We are the last of our kind.  The last of the Calans.  I do not know what purpose we were put here for.  I only know that if he wins the world will suffer for it.
L281777 +++$+++ u5856 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ And the other one -- he is like you?
L281776 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ You wanted the truth -- now you have it.
L281772 +++$+++ u5856 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ You?
L281771 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ It came from your great, great, great grandmother, Isabelle Tourez, who lived in Paris and died on the guillotine in 1789 -- alone -- and unmarried.  The ring was given to her by someone who loved her -- but knew that it could never be.
L281770 +++$+++ u5856 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ How did you know that?
L281769 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ --the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word:  Courage.
L281768 +++$+++ u5856 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ On the back it has--
L281767 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ I've seen it.
L281766 +++$+++ u5856 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Would you like to see it?
L281761 +++$+++ u5856 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Not unless they're immortal.
L281760 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ How could that be?  People don't live for three hundred years.
L281759 +++$+++ u5856 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ --for three hundred years.
L281758 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ That would mean they'd been trapped in there--
L281757 +++$+++ u5856 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Yes -- if they were trying to get in -- but what if they weren't?  What if they were trying to get out?
L281756 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ If they pushed the rocks you would have found them on the other side of the cavern wall.
L281755 +++$+++ u5856 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern?  They were wedged in tight.  They couldn't get a grip on them.  They would have had much more strength pushing on them.
L281754 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ So?
L281753 +++$+++ u5856 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Let me ask you something else.  At the excavation site in Scotland, the tunnel leading into the cavern had collapsed.  The day we found the body someone had moved the rocks, making a hole in the collapsed section.  What bothers me is that we found the rocks from the hole on our side of the tunnel wall.
L281752 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ You don't really believe this do you?
L281751 +++$+++ u5856 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Because I don't feel like sitting in a rubber room for forty-eight hours.
L281750 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ Why not?
L281749 +++$+++ u5856 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ No.
L281748 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ Have you told Lieutenant Bedsoe your theory?
L281741 +++$+++ u5859 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ MCCLEOD +++$+++ Why don't you tell me.
L281740 +++$+++ u5856 +++$+++ m388 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ --the Calan.  Do you know who they are?
