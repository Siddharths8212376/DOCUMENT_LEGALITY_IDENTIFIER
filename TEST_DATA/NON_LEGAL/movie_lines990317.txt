L522870 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ That’s right. Imagine facing it alone.
L522869 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Not you. You’re not disgusting. You’re lovely. Just the idea that they’d bring an escort. I mean, a stranger who, um, didn’t...who never.... I mean, someone’s dead.
L522868 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I think that’s disgusting.
L522867 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Not the way you’re thinking. The women wanted me there for support. You can understand that.
L522865 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ A wedding.
L522864 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ A weekend?
L522863 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Have you ever done anything like this before?
L522860 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I do?
L522859 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ You stand on your tiptoes.
L522858 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ What is?
L522857 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ It’s cute.
L522856 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ What?
L522852 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock.
L522851 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Who are they?
L522850 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I’m desperate to start but I don’t have an addictive personality. Except for approval. That, I can’t get enough of.
L522849 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ You quitting?
L522848 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ It’s okay. Hell, I’ve never paid for it. But please don’t feel like you have to explain yourself to me.
L522847 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ That won’t be an issue, believe me. I find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant.  No offense.
L522846 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Great, with the occasional stabs of shame. Now, listen, this covers the weekend, but as we discussed, if you want to be intimate, we talk money before anything happens.
L522845 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ How does it feel to get that much money just for being you?
L522844 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ On the nose.  I tell you what, because you’re so cute, I’ll take care of our incidentals.
L522843 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Six thousand, right?
L522842 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I’m compulsive and weird?
L522841 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Why?
L522840 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ No, count it, anyway.
L522826 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ You’re too good for him.
L522825 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ What does your gut say?
L522824 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I don’t know.
L522823 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ What did he say exactly? I mean, you don’t think he wants me back?
L522820 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Of course he is. I’m here with my new man.  I love it! Your magic’s already working. Let the suffering begin.
L522819 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ He was pretty drunk, but I think he’s still crazy about you.
L522818 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Jeffrey knows love like he knows macramé.
L522817 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Love.
L522816 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Well, he looks miserable. What were you talking about?
L522812 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Oh, yeah.  So we split it. You know, as in “share.” People do that.
L522811 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ The Knicks game? We both wanted the last hot dog?
L522735 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I don’t do naked. My sister? She does naked.
L522734 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ You know, they say you can tell everything you need to know about a person from the way they act when they’re naked.
L522732 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Both.
L522731 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm--  Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go!
L522730 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Mmm.
L522725 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Really?  Don’t get too attached.
L522724 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Mission accomplished.
L522723 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Yeah, but I feel like crap. And if you feel like crap, it’s way better to look hot while you’re doing it.
L522722 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ You’re funny.
L522721 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Don’t patronize me. They’ve clearly been at this a while.
L522719 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ You have feet?
L522718 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What color are my shoes?
L522716 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Exactly. I want us to look like we fit, but not like we’re trying too hard to look like we fit.  It’s welcome cocktails, not prom. With this level of matchy-matchy, we should be drinking peach schnapps under a bleacher somewhere.
L522715 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ You think we look like we’re trying too hard.
L522704 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Kat.
L522703 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Hi. Hey.
L523257 +++$+++ u7732 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ TJ +++$+++ I’m so sorry.
L523256 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ You knew?
L523255 +++$+++ u7732 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ TJ +++$+++ Oh, no. He told you.
L523230 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Dad made me go over and apologize the next day.
L523229 +++$+++ u7732 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ TJ +++$+++ Like fifteen.
L522777 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Therapist.
L522776 +++$+++ u7732 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ TJ +++$+++ What’s he do anyway?
L522772 +++$+++ u7732 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ TJ +++$+++ I wasn’t saving you from him. I was saving you from yourself.
L522771 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ You didn’t have to do that.
L522769 +++$+++ u7732 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ TJ +++$+++ Sure. You’ve got to play them against each other. Otherwise they think you’re easy.
L522768 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ You have more than one gynecologist?
L522767 +++$+++ u7732 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ TJ +++$+++ Kat Ellis! We live two hundred miles away from each other but I have to fly all the way to London to see you. You haven’t visited me once in D.C. Where the hell have you been? I have gynecologists that call more often.
L523086 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Of course, don’t be silly.
L523085 +++$+++ u7731 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ You want me to let him in?
L523084 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Yes? No. What?  Save the patter for the tourists.
L523083 +++$+++ u7731 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ You want I nut him in the boat?
L523082 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Not exactly. I wear it.  On my right hand. And only rarely.
L523081 +++$+++ u7731 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ You pawned it.
L523080 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Give it back? Are you nuts?
L523079 +++$+++ u7731 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ The one I made for you is the cherries. You hang onto it or give it back?
L523077 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I get all the glamour jobs.
L523076 +++$+++ u7731 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ I heard you were back in town, kitty cat. You’re here for the highland flings, I bet.
L523075 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Hey, Sal.
L523318 +++$+++ u7733 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Then for once in your life, do something for yourself.
L523317 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Yeah.
L523314 +++$+++ u7733 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Oh, well, then. It probably won’t work out.
L523313 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ It’s complicated, Dad.
L523312 +++$+++ u7733 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ So why’d you let him go?
L523054 +++$+++ u7733 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Ahoy!
L523053 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ That’s not true. We checked for leaks a few years back.  Good morning.
L522746 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Meet Nick.
L522745 +++$+++ u7733 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Hi, kiddo.
L522744 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Dad!
L522996 +++$+++ u7734 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ WOODY +++$+++ Hard.
L522995 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ She’s drunk. -er than me. But I didn’t really dump you, did I?
L522992 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I haven’t thought about that in years.
L522991 +++$+++ u7734 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ WOODY +++$+++ I always wondered what happened with us.
L522987 +++$+++ u7734 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ WOODY +++$+++ Close. Sydney. Turns out, I missed the rain.
L522986 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I thought you were living in San Francisco. Or was it Nepal?
L522985 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ “...but it’s getting there. “
L522984 +++$+++ u7734 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ WOODY +++$+++ “Not yet...”
L522981 +++$+++ u7734 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ WOODY +++$+++ Just drunk enough.
L522980 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I’m worried. Amy’s not good at drinking. She gets sooo drunk sooo fast. Does free alcohol get you less drunk or more drunker?  Is it ‘drunker’ or ‘drunker-er’?
L523173 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Will do.
L523172 +++$+++ u7733 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Hey, Sigmund, you think you could rustle up the bride and tell her to join the party?
L523166 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ --and The ass of The man who adores her.
L523165 +++$+++ u7733 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Best thing about being a dad is when your kid starts kicking your ass--
L523163 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I say that feeling compelled to do the opposite of your parents is as enslaving as emulating them.
L523162 +++$+++ u7733 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ What do you say to that?
L523159 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What would you say if I told you I was a member of an elite task force employed to safeguard our nation’s most precious resource: your daughter.
L523158 +++$+++ u7733 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ What is it you do again?
L523052 +++$+++ u7733 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ At least somebody’s using the damn thing.  I was gonna fix her up but we took one trip and the kids fought so much, we never launched her again.
L523051 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I am now, sir.
L522752 +++$+++ u7733 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Is there any other way to take it?
L522751 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I’m guessing MacCallum, 18 years.  Neat, with a water-back.
L523829 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Means you keep me using my head, and that's good!
L523828 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ What do that mean?
L523827 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Whewwww! You sure keep my mind jumping, boy!
L523826 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Yes, mam...
L523825 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ And so you did your job, right?
L523824 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Nothin'...
L523823 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ I can't answer that for you -- but it's no fault of your own that you don't know where your father is now. You tell me what you did that kept you from finding your father.  Come on, tell me...
L523822 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ But where is my daddy!?
L523821 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ But you did all you could, David. Not many little boys could've gone on such a journey as you did.
L523820 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ What do I tell my mama when I get home? I didn't find him and that's what I wanted to do.
L523819 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Well, you shouldn't worry about him too much, David.
L523818 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Yes mam...
L523817 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ You think about your father a lot, don't you?
L523816 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ My daddy likes to look into the dark, even when there ain't nothin to see -- it's what you hear he say.
L523815 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ What are you looking at, out there? There's nothing to see.
L523814 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Not now, David, it's time for bed. You have a long trip ahead of you in the morning...
L523813 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ I been like that myself, when I thought nobody was gonna believe me...  You wanna hear another story?!
L523812 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ You could? How?
L523811 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ He was real scared nobody would believe him -- I could tell, even when he first stood up.
L523810 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ You know, that was a good thing you did for Clarence, in class today. I believed his story, but I was afraid the other children wouldn't...
L523809 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Oh... . You right, that's all that was worryin' me right then...
L523808 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Because all you could think of was getting away from the guard.
L523807 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ ... So me and Sounder, ran right by the men that was the prisoners, and crawled under the fence! That's when I cut my hand on the glass. It hurt like mad! But I kept runnin', and then I didn't feel no more hurtin' till I stopped runnin'!  Why was that, Miss Johnson?
L523806 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ It was the best thing I ever been to, Miss Johnson!
L523805 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Well, how did you like the class, David?
L523773 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ I have a mother and her name is Rebecca -- My father's name is Nathan Lee Morgan, and...
L523772 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Now don't you think it's time you told me all about yourself?
L523771 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ He'll get his place too -- now off with your clothes and into bed.
L523770 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ What about Sounder?
L523769 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ And you're a tired little boy. I'll make up the cot and you must get some sleep.
L523768 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ You're a friendly lady, Miss Johnson.
L523758 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Why don't you sit and I'll read you something he said.
L523757 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ What he talk 'bout?
L523756 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Dr. William E. B. Dubois. 
L523755 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ What's his name?
L523754 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Here's one by a man that's very much alive.
L523753 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Sure--
L523752 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Don't you teach in your school 'bout folk who ain't dead?
L523751 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Colored.
L523750 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ And the other people you told me 'bout, they is all colored folk?
L523749 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ That's where we came from first.
L523748 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ That's where we come from first?
L523747 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Here it is, right here.
L523745 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Where is Africa, Miss Johnson?
L523744 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ They lived a long time ago -- before you and I were born.
L523743 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ That's right--
L523742 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ And you say all them people is dead now?
L523738 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ I try...
L523737 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ You got a pretty house, Miss Johnson!
L523736 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ I don't live far from here. You and your dog can come home with me and have yourself a hot meal and then we'll talk about how to get you back home.
L523735 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Thank you, Miss Johnson.
L523734 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ That does it...
L523733 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Uh huh...
L523732 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Did your mother know you were going to see your father?
L523731 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Me and Sounder went to this prison camp to see my Daddy and the police guard runs us away and I fell on some glass.
L523730 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ It's a good thing your hand did not become infected -- how did you cut it like this?
L523729 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Sometime, but not like this.
L523728 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ You keep looking around, David. Don't you go to school?
L523726 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Let me see it...
L523725 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ David Lee Morgan. My dog's name is Sounder.  That feels better.
L523724 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ My name is Camille -- Camille Johnson and I'm the Supervisor of this school. What's your name?
L523723 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Here, you put your hand under the water and I'll pump for you.
L523722 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ I don't know, he's in a prison camp.
L523721 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Is he here in Borderdale?
L523720 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ No, mam... I come from way back there. Me and my dog was tryin' to find my daddy and we got lost.
L523719 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ You don't live around here, do you?
L523718 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ I just wanta wash my hand. It's got blood where I hurt it.
L523798 +++$+++ u7738 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Yes mam...

L523796 +++$+++ u7738 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ No, Miss Johnson...
L523795 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ Clarence, would you tell us a story that was not true, after telling us it was?
L523787 +++$+++ u7738 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ She was dirty and wet...
L523786 +++$+++ u7735 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CAMILLE +++$+++ How was your sister after you pulled her out of the water?
