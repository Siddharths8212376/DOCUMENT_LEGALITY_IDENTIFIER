L362834 +++$+++ u6435 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ No, I mean:  I'm telling you this, now. You see?  You see I want to make everything clear and clean...and apologize for me....for all the stupid things I've done....that will eat me up....

L362073 +++$+++ u6445 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ When they want us done, they'll call in the Harvard S.W.A.T team or some shit.
L362072 +++$+++ u6436 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JULIA +++$+++ We're not going out two days before we set the record, it's not gonna happen.
L362057 +++$+++ u6445 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Saucy-saucy.
L362056 +++$+++ u6436 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JULIA +++$+++ I'll get it because I'm a good actress, Richard.
L362055 +++$+++ u6445 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ If we beat the record, you might get a call back --
L362054 +++$+++ u6436 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JULIA +++$+++ No.  But I probably will get a call back.
L362053 +++$+++ u6445 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Was it a call back?
L362038 +++$+++ u6445 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Not as much as I used to.  Ever since we started, I haven't really gone in to school that much because I've been getting more and more auditions --
L362037 +++$+++ u6436 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JULIA +++$+++ Do you still have to do homework?
L362640 +++$+++ u6449 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ I don't wanna do it.  Why can't one of you do it --
L362639 +++$+++ u6436 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JULIA +++$+++ You have to go, Stanley.  You're the smartest.
L362069 +++$+++ u6436 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JULIA +++$+++ No they don't --
L362068 +++$+++ u6449 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ They look pretty smart, I think.
L362052 +++$+++ u6436 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JULIA +++$+++ Movie Of The Week.  I went up for one this morning with Alan Thicke and Corey Haim --
L362051 +++$+++ u6449 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ What's MOW?
L362050 +++$+++ u6436 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JULIA +++$+++ Commercials, a sitcom, an MOW or something.
L362046 +++$+++ u6449 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ Like what?
L362045 +++$+++ u6436 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JULIA +++$+++ You should get one, I'm serious, you could get a lot of stuff out of this --
L362044 +++$+++ u6449 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ STANLEY +++$+++ No.
L362043 +++$+++ u6436 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ JULIA +++$+++ Do you have an agent, Stanley?
L362520 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Shut the fuck up.
L362519 +++$+++ u6437 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ KLIGMAN +++$+++ Let me call you a car, Linda.
L362518 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I have to go.
L362517 +++$+++ u6437 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ KLIGMAN +++$+++ Linda --
L362516 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Now you must really shut the fuck up, please. Shut The Fuck Up.
L362515 +++$+++ u6437 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ KLIGMAN +++$+++ You need to sober up.
L362514 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.
L362513 +++$+++ u6437 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ KLIGMAN +++$+++ I'm trying to help, Linda --
L362512 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Shut the fuck up.
L362511 +++$+++ u6437 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ KLIGMAN +++$+++ Linda, you just have to take a moment and breath and one thing at a time --
L362510 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ This is so over-the-top and fucked-up I can hardly stand it.
L362509 +++$+++ u6437 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ KLIGMAN +++$+++ -- unless Frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that's what will happen.
L362508 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ -- that can't happen.  Earl doesn't want him to have the money, the things.
L362507 +++$+++ u6437 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ KLIGMAN +++$+++ The money would go to Frank.  The court would put the money in the hands of a relative --
L362506 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ What does that mean?
L362505 +++$+++ u6437 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ KLIGMAN +++$+++ Well.  Considering that there's no one else mentioned in the will...we'd have to go to the laws of intestacy, which is -- as if someone died without a will --
L362504 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Where will the money go?
L362503 +++$+++ u6437 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ KLIGMAN +++$+++ You don't have to change the will, if what you want to do is get nothing you can renounce the will when it's time.
L362502 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I can't.
L362501 +++$+++ u6437 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ KLIGMAN +++$+++ Adultery isn't illegal -- it's not something that can be used in a court to discredit the will or -- Linda. Linda. Calm down.
L362500 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ This is not any fucking medication talking, this isn't -- I don't know. I don't know -- Can you give me nothing? You have power of attorney, can you see him, can you, in this final fucking moment, go see him and make sure --- change the fucking will -- I don't want any money, I couldn't live with myself, this thing I've done -- I've fucking done so many bad things -- I fucked around.  I fucked around on him, I fucking cheated on him, Alan. You're his lawyer, our laywer, THERE, I'm his wife, we are married. I broke the conract of marriage, I fucking cheated on him, many times over, I sucked other men's cocks and fuck - fuck - fuck - ....fuck.... Other Things I've Done..
L362499 +++$+++ u6437 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ KLIGMAN +++$+++ What kind of medication are you on right now, Linda that's --
L362498 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I don't want him to die, I didn't love him when we met, and I've done so many bad things to him that he doesn't know, things I want to confess to him, but now I do: I love him. I love him so much and I can't stand -- he's going.
L362490 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ No, no....no, you see...I never loved him. I never loved him, Earl.  When I started, when I met him, I met him and I fucked him and I married him because I wanted his money, do you understand?  I'm telling you this now...this I've never told anyone...I didn't love him. And now....I know I'm in that will, I know, I was there with him, we were all there together when we made that fucking thing and all the money I'II get -- I don't want it -- Because I love him so much now...I've fallen in love with him now, for real, as he's dying, and I look at him and he's about to go, Alan, he's dead...he's moments...  I took care of him through this, Alan. And What Now Then?
L362489 +++$+++ u6437 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ KLIGMAN +++$+++ You can't change his will.  Only Earl can change his will.
L362488 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ -- I have something to tell you. I have to tell you something. I want to change his will, can I change his will?...I need to ---
L362487 +++$+++ u6437 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ KLIGMAN +++$+++ Linda, you're safe.  Ok. It's alright. You're my friend.  You and Earl are my clients and what you need to talk about won't leave this room, you have something you have to say --
L362486 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Like a shrink, like if I go to see a shrink, I'm protected, I can say things -- fuck -- I don't know what I'm doing --
L362485 +++$+++ u6437 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ KLIGMAN +++$+++ Not exactly, Linda. I'm not sure where you're going with this --
L362484 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ If I talk to you...y'know...if I tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? You can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? Attornery-client, you understand?
L362483 +++$+++ u6437 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ KLIGMAN +++$+++ Are you on drugs right now?
L362482 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ No...I just... I'm so fucked up here Alan, I don't know...there's so much...so many things --
L362481 +++$+++ u6437 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ KLIGMAN +++$+++ You don't want any water?
L362737 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Tell him I'm sorry, ok, yes, you do that, now, I'm sorry, tell him, for all the things I've done...I fucked up and I'm sorry.... And I'm Gonna Turn Away And Walk Now And Not Look At Him Not See My Man, My Earl, I'll leave now...and tell him it's ok and I'm ok. The whole thing was ok with me -- and I know.
L362736 +++$+++ u6443 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ ....it's alright....
L362735 +++$+++ u6438 +++$+++ m428 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ listen...listen to me now, Phil: I'm sorry, sorry I slapped your face. ...because I don't know what I'm doing... ...I don't know how to do this, y'know?
