L654794 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ He didn't have to kill himself, Kelly. He could have gone out and gotten a job. Christ, he could've found another rich woman... He never had a problem tucking my friends when we were married.
L654793 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ No you don't.
L654792 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes...
L654791 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I miss Dad.
L654790 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Kelly.  What is it?
L654788 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ No thanks to you.
L654787 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ I would hardly say you look like trash.
L654786 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ My friends buy me clothes, so I don't look like trash.
L654785 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ You notice my new jumper?
L654784 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Okay, what's the matter?
L654783 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Whichever one I want.
L654782 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Which one of your "bodyguards" is that?
L654720 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Sam!  Hi!
L654719 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Hi, Mon.
L654718 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Is that Sam Lombardo?
L655455 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Um-huh.  And guess what else?  I have toys.
L655454 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You think that's wise?
L655453 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I'm running away.
L655441 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ No little girl can ever make me come.
L655440 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I love you.  Now give me the line.
L655439 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Say you love me.
L655438 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ That's not your line.
L655437 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ That never seemed to worry you at the Glades.
L655319 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Okay.  I love you too.
L655318 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ So if they're tapping your phone, we're dead.  Stay in the guest house.  Skip the graduation parties.  You'll never see Duquette.  Okay?  I love you.
L655317 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ But what if they find out... God, they'd put you in the gas chamber...
L655316 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's valium or something.  In another week you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're rich.
L655315 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I don't know.  I want to see you...
L655314 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ And you believe her?
L655313 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I don't know... I think it was something else... Suzie says the bust was bullshit...
L655312 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Yeah, he got her busted for possession...
L655311 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I can't help it.  He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him?  She's not that way.  I think he did something...
L655310 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Duquette.  Forget him...
L655309 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I'm really serious.  That cop, he keeps watching me.
L655308 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ God, I've been calling you.
L655307 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Hello.
L655306 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Hello?
L655248 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ There was no way.  That cop would've gotten her to tell him... everything. She was weak and dumb...
L655247 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm sorry, Kelly.  I'm sorry it had to happen like this.  She was losing it...
L655186 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Okay.  I want you to hear this too. We've got to be cool.  All of us. People think I'm rich, for Christ's sake.   I'm doing what rich guys do.  I'm spending my money.  It's more suspicious if I sit around doing nothing.  Now don't let this cop fuck with your minds.
L655185 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I'm here.
L655181 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Then do it.  I need you on this Kelly. Do it tonight.  We'll figure something out... Okay?
L655180 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ You know what it takes.
L655179 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you.  You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes...
L655178 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Why can't you come...
L655177 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left this garbled message on my machine.  Can you calm her down?
L655176 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Yes.
L655175 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Kelly.  Is Suzie there?
L655105 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Stick?
L655104 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ We have to stick with the plan.
L655103 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Do it to ourselves?
L655102 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ The only way we're gonna blow this now, is if we do it ourselves...
L655100 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Hey, come on... We've got to have at least one victory party.
L655099 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ From now on, if we're seen together, it's got to be accidental.  I thought that was understood...
L655095 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Of course I'm crazy.  Ask my mom.
L655094 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ God, you scared the shit out of me.  You must be crazy coming here.
L655089 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ About six and a half million dollars.
L655088 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ How much?
L655086 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ So you got my mom's money.
L655085 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
L655074 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Look, Kelly... I'm sorry... I know what you've been through... I should've seen something like this coning.
L655073 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Drop dead... You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off? She's trying to break my trust.  How do you like that?  I can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you...
L655072 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Kelly...
L654754 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Mr. Lombardo.  We're running kind of late.  How about if Nicole goes on to the Mansons?  You could give me a ride when you find the ticket.
L654753 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ All right.  I'll have to look for it.
L654752 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.
L654751 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Jeez, that thing... Can't you...
L654750 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Aren't  you forgetting something?  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.
L654749 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ So, where you off to now?
L654743 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ In back of the garage.
L654742 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Where's the hose?  We can set up.
L654740 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ No I didn't.  Check out the Jeep.  It's nice and dirty for you.  But you might want to wait a minute. The Mercedes is leaving.
L654739 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Look, he forgot.  I knew it.
L654717 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I won't.
L654716 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Don't forget the car wash.
L654706 +++$+++ u8912 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Deal.  You know, I just looked out front.  My ride wasn't there.  You suppose you could give me one?
L654705 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Okay, try me on Sunday.  I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday.  You guys can wash the mud off.
L655046 +++$+++ u8913 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KEN +++$+++ Just like that?  These people ruined your life, bro.
L655045 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Just like that?
L655044 +++$+++ u8913 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KEN +++$+++ You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.
L655043 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay.  I lost the house.  It's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.
L655042 +++$+++ u8913 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KEN +++$+++ Come on, let loose!
L654899 +++$+++ u8913 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KEN +++$+++ Fair enough.  Let's go make a statement.
L654898 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I just want my life back...
L654897 +++$+++ u8913 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KEN +++$+++ Good.  So what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep.  We're going to insist they take a statement. We're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back.  They're walking a fine line here. Defamation of character, malicious prosecution...
L654896 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ There's nothing for them to get.
L654895 +++$+++ u8913 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KEN +++$+++ Sound nice?  It's a fucking drug rehab farm.  It's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp.  Meanwhile, you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury.  Shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet.  Reason?  They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty.  Now tell me I'm right.
L654894 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Nellie Gail Ranch...
L654893 +++$+++ u8913 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KEN +++$+++ For you to be getting this kind of heat, for what they have on you... It doesn't add up.  Sandra Van Ryan's got 'em running scared.  And I'll tell you something else, you rush, you get careless.
L654892 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What's that supposed to mean?
L654891 +++$+++ u8913 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KEN +++$+++ You're not in bad shape, really.  I know you think you are, but you're not.  Let me tell you why.  Sandra Van Ryan.
L654890 +++$+++ u8913 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KEN +++$+++ Not in here.  Chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes.
L654889 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Can't you take that stupid thing off?
L654888 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I know how deep her pockets are, Ken.  I thought I might be able to save my fucking house with an equity loan. Guess who's on the board of directors at the bank?
L654887 +++$+++ u8913 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KEN +++$+++ Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all I'm saying.
L654886 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Forget it.
L654885 +++$+++ u8913 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KEN +++$+++ You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan...
L654884 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Good thinking.
L654868 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Ken.  I'm in some trouble.  I need an attorney and you're the only one I know. So I figured I'd start here.
L654867 +++$+++ u8913 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ KEN +++$+++ But check this...
L655350 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Suzie Toller is dead.  You don't want Kelly to be next, then take my advice. Stay out of my way.
L655349 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ You can't...
L655348 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I'm placing your daughter under arrest.
L655347 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Where she lives.  In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about?
L655346 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Where is she?
L655345 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Detective Duquette, Ms. Van Ryan.  Let me in.  Now.
L655344 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ Who is it?
L654805 +++$+++ u8917 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SANDRA +++$+++ That's right.
L654804 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo.
L655406 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Hey, Ray.  Guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and Sam's?
L655405 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Sam, for godsake.
L655402 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Shoulda, coulda, woulda...  Get him in the water.
L655401 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You... I should've killed you myself. should never have left it up to him...
L655168 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ That's right.  That was his name.
L655167 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Davy.
L655164 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Shut up.
L655163 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Don't you see what this means?  You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money?  You, the pill-head with the rap sheet?
L655162 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Get away from me.
L655159 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Suzie, Suzie... This is me, Ray, you're talking to.  We both know you don't have shit, never have had shit, never will have shit...
L655158 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ I don't mean who you're thinking.  I have other friends...
L655157 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Is that what you think?  You have friends?  Is that what they told you?
L655156 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ I don't have to listen to this.  And you can't shove me around.  I have friends now...
L655155 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You, Kelly, Sam.
L655154 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What triangle?
L655153 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts.  Somebody's got to go.
L655152 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ About what?
L655151 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Well, you're half right.  Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.
L655150 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ That's cop bullshit.
L655149 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Yeah, they're bad for your health.  I'm tryin' to look out for you...
L655148 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ You got something against cigarettes?
L655147 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You ought to watch it with that shit, Suzie.  You get busted again, you go back in a two-tine loser.
L654971 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Then he'll be back at Blue Balls?
L654970 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ It doesn't look like it.
L654969 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Will they?
L654968 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ No.
L654966 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ So Suzie, you called us, remember?
L654965 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ It's Celine.  He's okay.  He had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are.
L654963 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ I did.  At Blue Balls.
L654962 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Meet my partner, Gloria Perez.
L655397 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Come off it, man... It was an accident.
L655396 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ That how you planned it?  You take cut Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then dump me in the ocean...
L655395 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Jesus, man... You okay?
L655394 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Yeah, or get me drowned.
L655393 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of you yet.
L655392 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?
L655391 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Yes, we call it a winch.  And these are shrouds, and these are stays.
L655390 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You mean this thing?
L655373 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Kelly was supposed to be framed, not killed.  What I'm telling you is, I don't like surprises.
L655372 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Did you become squeamish about these things before or after you bludgeoned little Suzie Toller to death with a wine bottle?  Jesus, man. It couldn't have worked out better. They're convinced Kelly whacked Suzie. I can't talk 'em out of it.  We should be celebrating.  This thing worked out just like you said, only better.
L655371 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Well, shit, you're the cop, they don't teach you to disarm people, shoot them in the leg or something?  You weren't supposed to kill her for Christ's sake.
L655370 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Hey, what did you want me to do, die?
L655369 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ The bitch shot me, is what happened.
L655368 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Yeah, well, you fixed that.  What the hell happened, anyway?
L654925 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Sit down, Lombardo.
L654924 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Fuck you.  This is bullshit.  I'm outta here.
L654923 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ With a thirty-five inch bustline in a wet T-shirt with no bra...
L654922 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ It is and I don't.  Ordinarily...  But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...
L654921 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ But you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her.  Isn't that against the rules?
L654916 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ That's right.
L654915 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ But she ran away.
L654912 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Yes.  Mainly to turn her toward the door.  I told her we would talk on Monday, in the office.
L654911 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ And she began to cry.  And you put an arm around her.
L654910 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I could, but it's confidential.  Look, the point is, we didn't talk.  I told her this was not an appropriate time or place.
L654909 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.
L654908 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Yes.
L654907 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ And she wanted to talk.
L654906 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Yes.
L654905 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt.
L654904 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Like I said, I hadn't really expected to use it.  Anyway, I'm going through a drawer.  I hear a car.  I look out the window.  I see Nicole driving away.  I leave my room, and there's Kelly.
L654903 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ The one you bought at school.
L654902 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I had to go look for this coupon.
L654901 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Story's the same, Detective...
L654900 +++$+++ u8914 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Why don't you tell us one more time, how Kelly came to be with you, alone in your house.
L655452 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I think there's some things you do, you don't want to see yourself doing them.
L655451 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Walter.  He's been aimin' that Brownie through knotholes for years.  I saw these, I knew he'd finally struck gold.  I can't decide which came out better, that little straw Kelly's got up her nose, or that vibrator you've got up her ass.  What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?
L655450 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ How...
L655449 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Well, I'd need the famous Lombardo charm, not that you'd have to do anything you haven't done already.
L655448 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ We?
L655447 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it.  What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back?
L655444 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Trust me, the guy's dirty.  He'll like it.  Especially the part about offing me.  Now get out of here.  Go make yourself a new friend.
L655443 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Yeah, real funny.  You're wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot.
L655442 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Seems to like some of the same places you do.  Funny you never met.
L655420 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Fuck the winch.  I wanna drive.
L655419 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ What's wrong?
L655415 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ That was the same thing Ray said.
L655414 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ What?
L655413 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ But then it is better this way, don't you think?  No loose ends.
L655412 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ But then you knew what he was like all along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on...
L655411 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ The guy was history when he killed Kelly.  You knew that.
L655410 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ That was about as grim as it gets.
L655242 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ No, no.  Look, I probably should have told you a little more, about the part I intended to play.  We'll go through it all again tonight.
L655241 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Are you mad at me?
L655240 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I was worried about you, Suzie.  I decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up.
L655191 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Good.  Just keep telling yourselves that, the only people who can fuck this up is us.
L655190 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Yeah, right.
L655188 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Shut up.  Don't fall apart.  The only people who can blow this is us. Remember?
L655187 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ But I..
L655184 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Put Kelly on too.
L655183 +++$+++ u8918 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SUZIE +++$+++ Sam...
L655097 +++$+++ u8916 +++$+++ m606 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Jesus.  Two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change.
