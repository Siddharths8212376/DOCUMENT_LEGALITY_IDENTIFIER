L170986 +++$+++ u796 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ AMBER +++$+++ Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant.

L170821 +++$+++ u797 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ ANNETTE +++$+++ Oh... How quickly they grow up.  Hey, if they ask you to take off your shirt, get the money first.
L170820 +++$+++ u796 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ AMBER +++$+++ They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.

L171138 +++$+++ u806 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ Amber, I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant.
L171137 +++$+++ u796 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ AMBER +++$+++ Mrs. Clark, why are you doing this to me? Why're you pretendin' you don't know what's goin' on?

L171246 +++$+++ u803 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ GLADYS +++$+++ Listen, little missy, this cost your dad a pretty penny. Now get your ass up there and show me some teeth.
L171245 +++$+++ u798 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ My dress'll reek.
L171244 +++$+++ u803 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ GLADYS +++$+++ Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico.
L171243 +++$+++ u798 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ BECKY +++$+++ It smells funny. Like gasoline.
L171242 +++$+++ u803 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ GLADYS +++$+++ C'mon, Rebecca, you wanted it. Now get up there. Ride it side-saddle if you have to -- like a horse. C'mon, now.

L171336 +++$+++ u800 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ People, people -- wait, wait a minute, here. Uh, while we haven't ruled out sabotage from neighboring state pageants -- Iowa, Wisconsin, North Dakota...
L171317 +++$+++ u800 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ Mm-hm.
L171316 +++$+++ u814 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Okay?
L171315 +++$+++ u800 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ That's right.

L171313 +++$+++ u800 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ COLLEEN +++$+++ Correction. This spunky monkey on my right is Terry Macey. And we are your Minnesota American Teen Princess State Board.
L171312 +++$+++ u814 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ I'm a mirror.
L170718 +++$+++ u803 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ GLADYS +++$+++ "Can I? I'm Amer-I-Can!" People ask me where I get this. I don't know, it's... maybe a gift from God or somethin'.
L170717 +++$+++ u801 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ DOCUMENTARIAN +++$+++ Can you remember the theme of your favorite pageant?
L170716 +++$+++ u803 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ GLADYS +++$+++ "U.S.A. is A-okay."
L170715 +++$+++ u801 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ DOCUMENTARIAN +++$+++ And the year before that?
L170714 +++$+++ u803 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ GLADYS +++$+++ Last year? It was, "Buy American."
L170713 +++$+++ u801 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ DOCUMENTARIAN +++$+++ So what was the theme of the pageant last year?
L170690 +++$+++ u803 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ GLADYS +++$+++ Oh yah-sure, I know what some of your big city, no bra wearin', hairy- legged women's libbers say, "Pageants are old-fashioned" and, uh, and "demeaning" to the girls --
L170689 +++$+++ u801 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ DOCUMENTARIAN +++$+++ Do you think that most people would say that teenage beauty pageants are a good idea?
L171229 +++$+++ u813 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ PREGNANT FRY GIRL +++$+++ I wonder how she's gonna fix that one.
L171228 +++$+++ u802 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ FRY GIRL #1 +++$+++ What a surprise. Gladys Leeman's finally gonna go to State. And she'll probably ride on Becky's ass all the way to Nationals, too.
L170791 +++$+++ u802 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ FRY GIRL #1 +++$+++ Yeah.
L170790 +++$+++ u813 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ PREGNANT FRY GIRL +++$+++ Yeah. And they say smokin' is bad for your health.
L170789 +++$+++ u802 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ FRY GIRL #1 +++$+++ Girls check in, but they don't check out.
L170788 +++$+++ u813 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ PREGNANT FRY GIRL +++$+++ This pageant's like a roach motel.
L170787 +++$+++ u802 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ FRY GIRL #1 +++$+++ Yah -- yah. Everyone says this is a big accident? She got iced because she wins everything, and this time someone didn't want her to win.
L170786 +++$+++ u813 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ PREGNANT FRY GIRL +++$+++ Tammy Curry?
L170785 +++$+++ u802 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ FRY GIRL #1 +++$+++ ...Oh, yeah-right. I ain't gonna be in no goddamn pageant! Look what happened to that dork-ass farm girl.
L171275 +++$+++ u803 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ GLADYS +++$+++ Let go! Let go of me. Oh my God, it's COPS!
L171274 +++$+++ u808 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ That's enough!
L171273 +++$+++ u803 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ GLADYS +++$+++ Becky was my only shot at state!
L171272 +++$+++ u808 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ So help me, Gladys.
L171269 +++$+++ u803 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ GLADYS +++$+++ Guess it wasn't a garage sale as much as it was a bake sale. Ah- hahahahahahahaha!
L171268 +++$+++ u808 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Gladys! Stop it!
L171267 +++$+++ u803 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ GLADYS +++$+++ Hey, Ted, sorry. I didn't know your family was in the garage when I set it on fire!
L171234 +++$+++ u808 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Yah -- Gladys had me order that swan special made from Mexico  in case Becky won. I do a lotta business with those people. I always offer to pay 'em in tacos.  Whoo, they love that.
L171233 +++$+++ u803 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ GLADYS +++$+++ Hey! Turn that float around. You think a swan's gonna swim ass first up Main Street?
L170838 +++$+++ u808 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Yeah, yeah, the Jew.
L170837 +++$+++ u803 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ GLADYS +++$+++ Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
L170836 +++$+++ u808 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Yah -- she's damn near as good as that little black fella -- with the glass eye.
L170830 +++$+++ u808 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Oh, all right  How soon they forget where all this comes from.
L170829 +++$+++ u803 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ GLADYS +++$+++ Lester?
L170826 +++$+++ u803 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ GLADYS +++$+++ We're not in the showroom, Dear.
L170825 +++$+++ u808 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Hey, ya like it? Open it... Yah -- the globe. Pull at the equator there.
L170824 +++$+++ u803 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ GLADYS +++$+++ Oh, Lester. He loves his weather, y'know.
L170823 +++$+++ u808 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ ...You betcha. S'posed to be colder- n-a witches tit tonight...
L171261 +++$+++ u803 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ GLADYS +++$+++ I swear to God she can't do anything by herself.
L171260 +++$+++ u806 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ Enid ate a whole pan!
L171259 +++$+++ u803 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ GLADYS +++$+++ This is -- what?
L171258 +++$+++ u806 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ We need more bars!
L171257 +++$+++ u803 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ GLADYS +++$+++ What!
L171256 +++$+++ u806 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ Uh, Gladys?
L171255 +++$+++ u803 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ GLADYS +++$+++ Okay, I designed the float, you know. And, what's gonna happen here is that this is going to look like a glistening lake beneath the swan.
L171015 +++$+++ u803 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ GLADYS +++$+++ Number one, American Teen Princess' don't cross their legs like streetwalkers.
L171014 +++$+++ u806 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ Okay, everybody, listen up!
L171013 +++$+++ u803 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ GLADYS +++$+++ So, remember the three most important parts of a good interview...
L170781 +++$+++ u806 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ Yeah.
L170780 +++$+++ u803 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ GLADYS +++$+++ You know that sometimes it's hard to understand God's great plan.
L170779 +++$+++ u806 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ It's always hard to see the young ones called home, especially on an exploding thresher. It's just so odd and gross.
L170778 +++$+++ u803 +++$+++ m51 +++$+++ GLADYS +++$+++ Well, you know, I think everyone's doing really well considering the fact that she was so young.
