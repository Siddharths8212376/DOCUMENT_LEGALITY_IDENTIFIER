L340897 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ No!
L340806 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ Forget about him being God, he's thirty feet long, he <u>is</u> a miracle of nature, who somehow made his way to Maine.  This is a grand beast. <u>A</u> <u>grand</u> <u>dragon</u>.  An attempt should at least be made to capture him alive.
L340805 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ Gee, that would really disappoint me.
L340779 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ So profound and fat.
L340778 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ You probably <u>do</u> want to be killed by it, that was you trying to meet your maker.
L340777 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ Then do it!!
L340776 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ I can arrest you!!
L340683 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ Raincheck.
L340682 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ That <u>sounds</u> good but underneath it's hurtful.  Nightcap?
L340681 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ I'm tired, Hector.  I know this because you're beginning to not bug me.
L340680 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ Sobek.  Half man, half croc, oldest God--
L340679 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ He didn't eat the kid cause he'd just swallowed a bear.
L340678 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ Just spit him back out.  Some shall live, some shall die, arbitrarily, sound like any higher power we know?
L340666 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ It came from across the lake.
L340665 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ What's that?
L340621 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ <u>Bite</u> <u>my</u> <u>bishop</u>.
L340620 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
L340619 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ Maybe he doesn't play well with others.
L340613 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong flushed him down a toilet.
L340612 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ Asia?  How... how could he get here?
L340604 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ I have no interest in ever looking at you, Hector.  Could you please cut me down?
L340603 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ Promise you won't kill me, first.
L340581 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ You don't want to cut me down. 'Cause I'll kill you.
L340580 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ This is a setback.
L340577 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ I used to have this recurring nightmare that I was headless.
L340576 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ His head was just... bitten off.
L340575 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ Whenever somebody dies I consider it such a waste that I didn't know him better.
L340574 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ Yup.
L340573 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ Was he a good man?
L340527 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log.
L340526 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck.
L340518 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ What I'm saying is <u>if</u> it's a crocodile that cut a man in half he would have to be over twenty feet which would make him well over a hundred years old, it would be unthinkable to destroy him.
L340517 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ Is this a trick?
L340516 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ Crocodiles don't sever with their teeth, their molars are blunt.
L340515 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ Again.  Not to be disruptive.  Do we have a problem with it dying?
L340511 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ No crocodile has ever--
L340510 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ That "Walt" guy got hit underwater--
L340509 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ They don't really attack underwater and--
L340508 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ Again, I don't mean to be annoying with my questions.  But if it <u>is</u> a crocodile which I don't think it is.  And if they <u>do</u> charge these baby hatchling sounds...  why exactly would you want to be underwater at the time?  With you it makes sense.
L340490 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ This could end up saving your life,--
L340489 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ I coulda shot you, you--
L340488 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ I keep telling you, they <u>can</u> come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night--
L340487 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ A spring trap!
L340486 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ I'm laying a spring trap!
L340485 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ You're crawling around like a--
L340484 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ What are <u>you</u> doing?!
L340483 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ What the hell are you doing?!!
L340482 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ Jesus Christ!!
L340461 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ Deep down, gut check.  I'm growing fond of <u>you</u> and it's liberating to say so.
L340460 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ I do <u>not</u> like you.
L340459 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ And you like me.
L340458 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ You listen to me.  The only reason I'm letting you be part of this is 'cause you got the helicopter and the radar--
L340457 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ No!!  Out!
L340456 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ Could <u>she</u> stay, we've tentatively scheduled intercourse.
L340455 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ Everybody out, back to your tents, <u>now</u>!
L340454 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ They come on land and they're brazen.  They're also attracted to noise, you can see I make a lot of it.
L340453 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ <u>No</u>!!  What's with digging the holes?
L340452 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ Cocktail?
L340451 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ We are here on official business.
L340437 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ Species, keystones affect the entire ecosystem, that could explain all these worms, the water. You've got a crocodile.  Bury your friend.
L340436 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ Keystone what?
L340435 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ Well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species.
L340434 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ We'd only just met.
L340409 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ If he's eaten in the area, he shouldn't be far away.  Crocs hang around the food source.
L340408 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ Around here.  Yeah.
L340405 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ They can survive winter.  As long as their nostrils don't freeze, they survive,  am I foolish to explain things, he had such trouble with my name?
L340404 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ And what would he do come winter?
L340403 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ They have saltwater glands, they can swim across oceans, it's only a matter of time.
L340402 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ I really don't mean to be discourteous.  But how is it a person could come to believe that a crocodile is in New England?
L340395 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ C'mon, we're losing light,  why does the big one heckle me?
L340394 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ Mr. Cyr!
L340393 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ They've been migrating north, Kelly, this lake connects to the ocean,--
L340388 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ I apologize, I just don't want to lose the light, we've got time for a quick scout,  you've had work done.
L340387 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ Wait just a second.  You don't just fly in here and start barking orders.
L340386 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ I'll need any and all topographic studies.
L340385 +++$+++ u6259 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KEOUGH +++$+++ --<u>Who</u> <u>is</u> <u>he</u>?
L340937 +++$+++ u6257 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Just those two.
L340936 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?
L340935 +++$+++ u6257 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off.
L340934 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ You talk to Bickerman?
L340933 +++$+++ u6257 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You take care.
L340912 +++$+++ u6257 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah and every time we think there's no more danger--
L340911 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ <u>No</u>.  Look.  He's got nothing left.
L340884 +++$+++ u6257 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Tranq guns down, rifles up!
L340883 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ Where is he?
L340867 +++$+++ u6257 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You shoot on my order.  If he charges, I'll be yelling "go" which means drivers take off.  And drive fast, they can move on land.  You set?
L340866 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ Thank you, Jack.
L340865 +++$+++ u6257 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Almost here, Hector.  Don't forget to lift up the cow.
L340854 +++$+++ u6257 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Okay.  Lead him in.  Okay, everybody up on the trucks. We aim for the stomach or side... there's little chance the darts will pierce his hide.  <u>Everybody</u> <u>up</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>trucks</u>.
L340853 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ Radar, he's underwater.  But he's definitely coming.
L340852 +++$+++ u6257 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Can you confirm visually or just radar?
L340851 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ Thirty meters or so.  Moving slow, but straight toward Elsie.
L340850 +++$+++ u6257 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Where?  Where?
L340848 +++$+++ u6257 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You do?
L340847 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ I got something on the screen.
L340838 +++$+++ u6257 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ We're ready.
L340837 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ You ready on shore?
L340836 +++$+++ u6257 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ The more he thrashes, the better.
L340835 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ Right.
L340834 +++$+++ u6257 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Keep enough tension to hold him up, Hector, we don't know if he can swim.
L340823 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ That's actually the easy part.
L340822 +++$+++ u6257 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ And again.  How would you get him on land?
L340818 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ We both know what they'll do.
L340817 +++$+++ u6257 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ So maybe Wildlife will try to save him, they're more equipped to--
L340816 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ Jack.  We've all seen it.  He's probably a hundred and fifty years old, he's bigger than an elephant.
L340815 +++$+++ u6257 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No way.
L340810 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ Look.  I know I'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it.  They have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed,--
L340809 +++$+++ u6257 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ <u>Forget</u> <u>it</u>.
L340808 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ I have enough flaxedil with me to put him out.  And I think I know a way to--
L340807 +++$+++ u6257 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Well, you can try talking them into that, if--
L340773 +++$+++ u6257 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ 'Cause he just ate a cow, you stupid--
L340772 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ Let's not overlook he didn't eat me, maybe--
L340768 +++$+++ u6257 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Hey!!
L340767 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ Bastard bit my chopper.
L340766 +++$+++ u6257 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ This time, <u>I'm</u> gonna kick your ass.
L340629 +++$+++ u6257 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Get the gun.
L340628 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ He never said "go".
L340627 +++$+++ u6257 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Get your big gun and guard the shore.  Hector.  Go to your tent.
L340626 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ At school they'd always say "go" first.
L340930 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ And Hank.  I know you weren't really trying to hit him.
L340929 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Yeah.  Thanks to you.
L340928 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ He's gonna live?
L340919 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Yeah, you got bit.  I'm gonna fix it.
L340918 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ Guess I finally got bit.
L340917 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ You're gonna be okay.
L340914 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ You're not okay, your leg's a mess.
L340913 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ I'm okay.
L340814 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ We lure him on land and pump him with the drugs.
L340813 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ And how would we neutralize him?
L340804 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ They won't.  He's taken human life, the mission will be to put him down.
L340803 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ They could try to tranq him on land.
L340802 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ They're not going to be able to snag him in pitmans.  Tranq him in water, he drowns.
L340796 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ Could we have intercourse?
L340795 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ What?
L340794 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ Yes.  You may.  But maybe... I don't know...
L340793 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?
L340792 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ Eh.  Fuck it.
L340791 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ No.
L340790 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ Didn't even <u>sound</u> good?
L340789 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Oh, bullshit.
L340788 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--
L340787 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I'm no psychiatrist.  But I would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than--
L340786 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ With crocodiles... everything's even.
L340785 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ <u>Nothing's</u> real.  I'm rich, people are automatically my friends, sycophants ooze out like oil slicks and and and--
L340784 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Excuse me?
L340783 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ Nothing's real.
L340782 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Hector.  What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on.
L340781 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ You think I'm <u>that</u> nuts?
L340780 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ <u>Did</u> you want to be killed by it?
L340775 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ I'm a civilian!  You don't have any authority--
L340774 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ <u>Jack</u>!
L340611 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Scales were oval.  It was an <u>Asian</u> crocodile.
L340610 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ Are you sure?
L340609 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ He was an Indo-pacific.
L340525 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ As if.  Will you miss me?
L340524 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ What?  Oh as <u>if</u> I'm interested.
L340523 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ Two years married, divorced, used to be a lawyer, quit, I'm still waiting on his sperm count.
L340514 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I'm just saying last resort.
L340513 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ And what if I tranq him Kelly?  He drowns.  You think about that?
L340512 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ You <u>should</u> take a flax pole.
L340425 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation.
L340424 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ Such the flirt.
L340421 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ What's going on?
L340420 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ None of us actually <u>saw</u> anything.  I realize this Sir, but something flipped us over, I doubt very much it was a mink.
L340412 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ <u>Hector</u>.
L340411 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ 'Cept he wasn't before, was he?  You know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. You're fat.
L340410 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ But they're nighttime hunters, Hector, he'd probably be on land now anyway.
L340401 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ Even so, you're allowed to boast. You look thin by the way, I've mentally undressed you, I can see your ribcage.
L340400 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ I never had sex with you!
L340399 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ If he's here, I'll find him.  Did she tell you we had sex together?
L340397 +++$+++ u6256 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ HECTOR +++$+++ That hurt my feelings.
L340396 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Hector.  The big one has no sense of humor.  And since <u>he's</u> the one who decides whether you get to play, try not to be your obnoxious self.
L340969 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Good thinking.
L340968 +++$+++ u6257 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ That was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I'll be able to tell him if you can.
L340967 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Probably not.
L340966 +++$+++ u6257 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Worth a try.  We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?
L340965 +++$+++ u6258 +++$+++ m418 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ You think?
