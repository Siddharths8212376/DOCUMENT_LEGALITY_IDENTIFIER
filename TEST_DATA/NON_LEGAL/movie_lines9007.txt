L108460 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ And Danny Zorn, what was that?
L108459 +++$+++ u612 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ Why not? It was just money.
L108458 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
L108457 +++$+++ u612 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.
L108456 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ 'Why' would be enough for me.
L108455 +++$+++ u612 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.
L108454 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
L108453 +++$+++ u612 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ Sit down.
L108435 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ I'm sorry, Ward.
L108434 +++$+++ u612 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
L108433 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ Don't know.
L108432 +++$+++ u612 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for?
L108429 +++$+++ u612 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ No... It must have been Bourne.
L108428 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ Did he say anything to you?
L108427 +++$+++ u612 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ Oh, God... It must have been Bourne.
L108426 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ They found Danny Zorn's body. Dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time.
L108425 +++$+++ u612 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ What?
L108415 +++$+++ u612 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ I wasn't sleeping.  You OK?
L108414 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ Sorry to wake you.
L108317 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ Well, whatever he's doing, I've had enough -- this is now a search and destroy mission.  I want the Berlin police fully briefed and --  -- get this out to all the agencies.
L108316 +++$+++ u612 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ It's hard to swallow.  The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick.  What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...
L108315 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ So what's he doing? You believe him?
L108253 +++$+++ u612 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ There are no answers. There's either Jason Bourne alive or Jason Bourne dead. And I for one would prefer the latter. And what about her?  You just send her out to this lunatic with no protection?
L108252 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ Don't you want answers?
L108251 +++$+++ u612 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate him.
L108250 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.
L108249 +++$+++ u612 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We need snipers, DOD, whatever they got. Snipers?
L108099 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ And you do? From the moment he left Treadstone, he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him...
L108098 +++$+++ u612 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ You don't know what you're getting into here.
L108097 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family.
L108096 +++$+++ u612 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ Berlin!
L108062 +++$+++ u612 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ So what's your theory?  Conklin's reaching out from the grave to protect his good name?  The man is dead.
L108061 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!
L108060 +++$+++ u612 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ Conklin might've been a nut, but he wasn't a mole. You have me his calendar for a couple of days, I'll prove he killed Lincoln.  This is supposed to be definitive?
L108059 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ May I finish?
L108058 +++$+++ u612 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ We were throwing money at him. Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark.
L108057 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ Excuse me.
L108056 +++$+++ u612 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ Do you know what his budget was?
L108055 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ ...At the time of his death, Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars.
L108054 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ ...this is Conklin's computer.
L108053 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ ...Ivan Mevedev -- senior financial manager -- worked for one of the new Russian petroleum companies, Pecos Oil. He claimed to know where the money landed. We believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the Agency... This...
L108044 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ I think I do. We had a deal going down in Berlin last week. During the buy, both our Field Agent and the seller were killed. We pulled a fingerprint from a timing charge that didn't go off.  They were killed by Jason Bourne.
L108043 +++$+++ u612 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows?
L108042 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ And Bourne? Where's he now?
L108041 +++$+++ u612 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ I've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. I've shoveled shit on four continents. I'm due to retire next year and believe me, I need my pension, but if you think I'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go to hell. Marshall too.  It had to be done.
L108040 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ So you had Conklin killed.  I mean, if we're cutting the crap...
L108039 +++$+++ u612 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ What happened? Jason Bourne happened.  You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left.
L108038 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ I want to know what happened.
L108037 +++$+++ u612 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?
L108036 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ Let's talk about Conklin.
L108035 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ He does. I've been down to the archives. I have the files, Ward.
L108034 +++$+++ u612 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
L108033 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ I want to know about Treadstone.
L108032 +++$+++ u612 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ And what are we looking for?
L108030 +++$+++ u612 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade.
L108029 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ That's not gonna fly.
L108028 +++$+++ u612 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ Never heard of it.
L108027 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ Treadstone.
L108339 +++$+++ u627 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ZORN +++$+++ Okay... 
L108338 +++$+++ u612 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ Show me again...
L108337 +++$+++ u627 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ZORN +++$+++ Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?
L108336 +++$+++ u612 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ Who else knows about this?
L108335 +++$+++ u627 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ZORN +++$+++ Including Landy...  She had access to the archives.
L108334 +++$+++ u612 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ Lots of people...
L108333 +++$+++ u627 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ZORN +++$+++ Something's been going on here in Europe. And it's still going on. Post Conklin. Who's been in Berlin?
L108332 +++$+++ u612 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ Keep going...
L108331 +++$+++ u627 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ZORN +++$+++ Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this?
L108330 +++$+++ u612 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ Jesus...
L108329 +++$+++ u627 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ZORN +++$+++ Is it a slam dunk? No, but...
L108328 +++$+++ u612 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ It was staged?
L108327 +++$+++ u627 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ZORN +++$+++ There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here...  First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know.
L108326 +++$+++ u612 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ And?
L108325 +++$+++ u627 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ZORN +++$+++ You put a four-gam Kel on here and it's gonna take out power to the building. You know that. What you can't know, is if it's gonna blow the room with it.
L108324 +++$+++ u612 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ What do you have, Danny?
L108323 +++$+++ u627 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ZORN +++$+++ I did my box work, but I wanted to show you before I showed Landy. I came out here last night because none of this was making any sense. I mean, I'm with you on this, Conklin was a nut, but a traitor? I just can't get there.
L108322 +++$+++ u627 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ZORN +++$+++ The sooner the better.
L108321 +++$+++ u612 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ She say what time I should call?
L108319 +++$+++ u612 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ABBOTT +++$+++ Thanks.
L108318 +++$+++ u627 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ ZORN +++$+++ Sir...
L108515 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L108514 +++$+++ u616 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ IRENA +++$+++ Is this really happening?
L108513 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ I have to go now.
L108512 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ No.  Because you don't want to know how it feels.
L108511 +++$+++ u616 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ IRENA +++$+++ Because you're afraid!
L108510 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ I can't let you do that either.
L108509 +++$+++ u616 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ IRENA +++$+++ I should kill you... if it's true you should die... I should kill you now!
L108508 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Look at me.
L108507 +++$+++ u616 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ IRENA +++$+++ YOU'RE A LIAR!
L108506 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ You know I'm not.
L108505 +++$+++ u616 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ IRENA +++$+++ You're a liar.
L108504 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ It doesn't matter. Your life is hard enough.
L108502 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ I don't want you to forgive me.
L108501 +++$+++ u616 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ IRENA +++$+++ How... how can... how can you be here and say this?
L108500 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ They loved you.  And I killed them.
L108499 +++$+++ u616 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ IRENA +++$+++ You killed them.
L108498 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ It was my job. My first time. Your father was supposed to be alone. But then your mother, she came out of nowhere...  I had to change my plan.  You understand me?  You don't have to live like that anymore. Thinking that.
L108497 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ I killed them.
L108496 +++$+++ u616 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ IRENA +++$+++ Then what?
L108495 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ That's not what happened to your parents.
L108494 +++$+++ u616 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ IRENA +++$+++ Yes...
L108493 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it?
L108491 +++$+++ u616 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ IRENA +++$+++ What?
L108490 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ I would want to know.  I would want to know that my mother didn't kill my father. I would want to know that she didn't kill herself.
L108489 +++$+++ u616 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ IRENA +++$+++ No, I do.
L108488 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ No. It's because you don't know how they died.
L108487 +++$+++ u616 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ IRENA +++$+++ It's nothing. It's just a picture.
L108486 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ It's nice.  Does this picture mean anything to you?  Hmm?
L108485 +++$+++ u616 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ IRENA +++$+++ Okay.
L108484 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Of all the people in the world, you're the only one I have anything to offer.  That's why I came here.
L108482 +++$+++ u616 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ IRENA +++$+++ I speak English.
L108481 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Sit. Can you...  [The chair. Have the chair.]
L108193 +++$+++ u618 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ JARDA +++$+++ -- take the back -- get another car --
L108192 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ -- what? --
L108191 +++$+++ u618 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ JARDA +++$+++ -- my coat -- but we should --
L108190 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ -- car keys?
L108184 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ How long? How long do I have -- 
L108183 +++$+++ u618 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ JARDA +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L108182 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ You called it in?
L108179 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ I did.
L108178 +++$+++ u618 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ JARDA +++$+++ She really did that? Told you not to kill me?  I had a woman once. But after a while, what do you talk about? I mean, for us. The work. You can't tell them who you are...
L108176 +++$+++ u618 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ JARDA +++$+++ I don't know! Why would I lie?
L108175 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ What's going on in Berlin?
L108174 +++$+++ u618 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ JARDA +++$+++ I don't know who that is.
L108173 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Pamela Landy?
L108172 +++$+++ u618 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ JARDA +++$+++ A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.
L108171 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Who sent you to Greece?
L108170 +++$+++ u618 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ JARDA +++$+++ I don't know.
L108169 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me?
L108166 +++$+++ u618 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ JARDA +++$+++ Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked out.
L108165 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Try again.
L108164 +++$+++ u618 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ JARDA +++$+++ He's dead.
L108163 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Conklin.
L108162 +++$+++ u618 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ JARDA +++$+++ What do you want?
L108161 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ She wouldn't let me.  She's the only reason you're alive.
L108160 +++$+++ u618 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ JARDA +++$+++ So why didn't you kill me then?
L108158 +++$+++ u618 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ JARDA +++$+++ I like it here.  Last time I saw you was Greece. You had a good spot.
L108157 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ You still should've moved.
L108155 +++$+++ u618 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ JARDA +++$+++ Sorry. Old habits.
L108154 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Front. Use your teeth.
L108152 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Drop it.
L108151 +++$+++ u618 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ JARDA +++$+++ Felt a little light.
L108150 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ I emptied it.
L108413 +++$+++ u619 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
L108412 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ God, I miss you. I don't know what to do without you.
L108411 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ I only dream about people who are dead.
L108410 +++$+++ u619 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ You do?
L108409 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ I know it's a dream.
L108408 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ It might have.
L108407 +++$+++ u619 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.
L108406 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ I did.
L108405 +++$+++ u619 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ But you found another choice.
L108404 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ I wanted to kill him.
L107970 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Tell me later.
L107969 +++$+++ u619 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ I love you, too.
L107967 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ There's no choice.
L107966 +++$+++ u619 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this.
L107965 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone.
L107964 +++$+++ u619 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ There must be another way!
L107963 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ If he crosses the bridge, it is.
L107962 +++$+++ u619 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ What if it's not who you think it is?
L107961 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
L107960 +++$+++ u619 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Where are you going?
L107959 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ You keep going to the shack. I'll meet you there in an hour.
L107958 +++$+++ u619 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ -- hang on --
L107957 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ -- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready --
L107956 +++$+++ u619 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ -- it's just him? --
L107955 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ -- not yet --
L107954 +++$+++ u619 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Jesus! --  -- is he back there? --
L107953 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ -- make the left -- toward the bridge --
L107952 +++$+++ u619 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ -- where? -
L107951 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Switch! You drive!
L107950 +++$+++ u619 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ What?
L107949 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ You drive.
L107948 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ -- there's places -- we can't afford to be wrong!
L107947 +++$+++ u619 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ -- where's left to go? --
L107946 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --
L107945 +++$+++ u619 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ I don't want to move again... I like it here.
L107944 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ We can't wait to be sure.
L107943 +++$+++ u619 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ ...but you're not -- you're not sure...
L107942 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai -- silver --
L107941 +++$+++ u619 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Where --
L107940 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ No. Not this. This is real.  And he's right there... 
L107939 +++$+++ u619 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ That's crazy.
L107938 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?
L107937 +++$+++ u619 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ So...
