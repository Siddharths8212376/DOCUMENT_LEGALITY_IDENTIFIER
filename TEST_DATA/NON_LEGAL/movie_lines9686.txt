L129845 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Well, I've been accused of many things, Mrs. Mulwray, but never that.
L129844 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Why?... What on earth for?  Look, Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man.
L129843 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ I should talk this over with your husband.
L129842 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ I don't want to drop it.
L129841 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Yes, Mr. Gittes?
L129840 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Mrs. Mulwray?
L129839 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ So let's just drop the whole thing. Sugar?  Lemon?
L129838 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ I said I'll drop it.
L129837 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ What?
L129836 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it. I'll drop the lawsuit.
L129835 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ I'm just trying to make a living, and I don't want to become a local Joke.
L129834 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Anyway... I... the point is, Mrs. Mulwray.  I'm not in business to be loved, but I am in business, and believe me, whoever set up your husband, set me up. L.A.'s a small town, people talk.
L129833 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ That's not his apartment.
L129832 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Actually he's not. And he's moved from his apartment at the El Macando.
L129831 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ My husband's at the office.
L129830 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Yeah. Fine, thank you.
L129829 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Iced tea.
L129828 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ What are you having?
L129827 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Would you like something to drink?
L129773 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Now wait a minute, Mrs. Mulwray...
L129772 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And since you agree with me we've never met, you must also agree that I haven't hired you to do anything. Certainly not spy on my husband. I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes. Well, you're going to get it.
L129771 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Not that Mulwray?
L129789 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Get me the Times. Whitey Mehrholtz.  And how about that snotty broad?  What does she think, she's perfect? Coming in waving her lawyers and her money at me – so goddam smug. She's no better than anybody else in this town.
L129788 +++$+++ u4486 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ Yes, Mr. Gittes.
L129787 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Sophie.
L129757 +++$+++ u4486 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ Yes, Mr. Gittes.
L129756 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Sophie.
L129755 +++$+++ u4486 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ But, Mr. Gittes.
L129754 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Sophie, go to the little girl's room for a minute.
L129706 +++$+++ u4486 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ He's in the dark room.
L129705 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Walsh here?
L130642 +++$+++ u4491 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ WALSH'S VOICE +++$+++ Jesus, that's in Chinatown, ain't it?
L130641 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Sophie... is Walsh there?... yeah, listen, pal, Escobar's going to try and book me in about five minutes... relax, I'll tell you. Wait in the office for two hours. If you don't hear from me, you and Duffy meet me at 1712 Alameda.
L129714 +++$+++ u4491 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ WALSH'S VOICE +++$+++ It's on your desk. Say, you hear the one about the guy who goes to the North Pole with Admiral Byrd looking for penguins?
L129713 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Oh yeah? You pick up the watch?
L129712 +++$+++ u4491 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ WALSH'S VOICE +++$+++ I think I got something.
L129711 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Listen, we can't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something.
L129710 +++$+++ u4491 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ WALSH'S VOICE +++$+++ What'd you expect? That's his job.
L129709 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Jesus Christ, this guy's really got water on the brain.
L129708 +++$+++ u4491 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ WALSH'S VOICE +++$+++ Three reservoirs. Men's room of a Richfield gas station on Flower, and the Pig 'n Whistle.
L129707 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Where'd he go yesterday?
L130006 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ 'Those people?' Miss Sessions.
L130005 +++$+++ u4478 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ IDA'S VOICE +++$+++ You'll find one of those people.
L130004 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ The obituary column?
L130003 +++$+++ u4478 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ IDA'S VOICE +++$+++ No, Mr. Gittes. Just look in the obituary column of today's Times...
L130002 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ ...Why don't you give me your address and we can talk this over?
L130001 +++$+++ u4478 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ IDA'S VOICE +++$+++ Oh no.
L130000 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both.
L129999 +++$+++ u4478 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ IDA'S VOICE +++$+++ Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out I want somebody to know I didn't know what would happen.
L129998 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Shut the fuck up!  ...Yes I remember nothing, Miss Sessions, just going over a detail or two with my associates... you were saying?
L129997 +++$+++ u4478 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ IDA'S VOICE +++$+++ I was the one who pretended to be Mrs. Mulwray, remember?
L129996 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ When did you come in?
L129995 +++$+++ u4478 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ IDA'S VOICE +++$+++ Well, I'm a working girl, Mr. Gittes. I didn't come in to see you on my own.
L129994 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Isn't everybody? What can I do for you, Miss Sessions?
L129993 +++$+++ u4478 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ IDA'S VOICE +++$+++ Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?
L129992 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe we've had the pleasure.
L129991 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Okay.
L129990 +++$+++ u4487 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ SOPHIE'S VOICE +++$+++ Miss Ida Sessions again. She says you know her.
L129981 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Don't know her. Take a number.
L129980 +++$+++ u4487 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ SOPHIE'S VOICE +++$+++ Ida Sessions.
L129979 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Who?
L129978 +++$+++ u4487 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ SOPHIE'S VOICE +++$+++ A Miss Sessions calling.
L129977 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Yeah, Sophie.
L130352 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ We understand, c'mon, sweetheart.
L130351 +++$+++ u4482 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ PALMER +++$+++ Just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building. It's nearly bedtime.
L130350 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?
L130349 +++$+++ u4482 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ PALMER +++$+++ I don't think so. Be happy to show you.
L130348 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
L130347 +++$+++ u4482 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ PALMER +++$+++ Oh, good.
L130346 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ That's exactly what we wanted to hear.
L130345 +++$+++ u4482 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ PALMER +++$+++ We don't reveal the names of our guests as a matter of policy. I know you'd appreciate that if your father came to live with us.
L130344 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Just to be certain, I wonder if you could show us a list of your patients?
L130343 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Don't be sorry, neither does Dad. Wanted to make sure though, didn't we, honey?
L130342 +++$+++ u4482 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ PALMER +++$+++ I'm sorry. We don't.
L130341 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Do you accept anyone of the Jewish persuasion?
L130340 +++$+++ u4482 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ PALMER +++$+++ Of course.
L130339 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ There's just one question.
L130338 +++$+++ u4482 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ PALMER +++$+++ Perhaps if we could meet your father.
L130337 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Naturally, I want the best for him, money is no object.
L130334 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Nothing to do with Dad. It's me, actually.
L130333 +++$+++ u4482 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ PALMER +++$+++ Oh my goodness.
L130123 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ I don't want to nail you. I just want to know who put you up to it. I'll give you a few days to think it over.  Call me. I can help. Who knows? Maybe we can lay the whole thing off on a few big shots and you can stay head of the department for the next twenty years.
L130122 +++$+++ u4492 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ YELBURTON +++$+++ Yes...
L130121 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Hard working, have a wife and kids...
L130120 +++$+++ u4492 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ YELBURTON +++$+++ Yes...
L130119 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ You're a married man, am I right?
L130118 +++$+++ u4492 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ YELBURTON +++$+++ Mr. Gittes, my field men are out and I can't give you an exact location...
L130117 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ That's like saying they're in Arizona.
L130116 +++$+++ u4492 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ YELBURTON +++$+++ I said, the northwest valley.
L130115 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Yeah, a little runoff. Where are those orchards?
L130114 +++$+++ u4492 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ YELBURTON +++$+++ Wait. Please sit down, Mr. Gittes. We're... well, we're not anxious for this to get around, but we have been diverting a little water to irrigate avocado and walnut groves in the northwest valley. As you know, the farmers there have no legal right to our water, and since the drought we've had to cut them off. The city comes first, naturally.  But, well, we've been trying to help some of them out, keep them from going under. Naturally when you divert water you get a little runoff.
L130113 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Well, Whitey Mehrholtz over at the Times will. Dumping thousands of gallons of water down the toilet in the middle of a drought.  That's news.
L130112 +++$+++ u4492 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ YELBURTON +++$+++ Mr. Gittes! That's an outrageous accusation.  I don't know what you're talking about.
L130111 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Well, look at it this way, Mr. Yelburton.  Mulwray didn't want to build a dam and he had a reputation that was hard to get around, so. you decided to ruin it. Then he found out that you were dumping water every night. Then he was drowned.
L130110 +++$+++ u4492 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ YELBURTON +++$+++ Mr. Gittes, you're not making a bit of sense.
L130109 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Neither do I, actually. But you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me.
L130108 +++$+++ u4492 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ YELBURTON +++$+++ I don't understand.
L130107 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ I never was.
L130106 +++$+++ u4492 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ YELBURTON +++$+++ Only when you breathe... don't tell me you're still working for Mrs. Mulwray?
L130105 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Only when I breathe.
L130104 +++$+++ u4492 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ YELBURTON +++$+++ You ought to be more careful. That must really smart.
L130103 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ I cut myself shaving.
L130102 +++$+++ u4492 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ YELBURTON +++$+++ Oh yes. Hollis was the best department head the city's ever had. My goodness, what happened to your nose?
L130101 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Yeah, must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances.
L130100 +++$+++ u4492 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ YELBURTON +++$+++ Mr. Gittes, sorry to keep you waiting. These staff meetings, they just go on and on.
L129819 +++$+++ u4492 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ YELBURTON +++$+++ Hope so. He's working for us.
L129818 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you.  Do you know Claude Mulvihill here?
L129814 +++$+++ u4492 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ YELBURTON +++$+++ Help yourself.
L129813 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Mind if I take one of your cards? In case I want to get in touch with you again.
L129812 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Well, tell him I'll be back.
L129811 +++$+++ u4492 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ YELBURTON +++$+++ I'm sorry, I --
L129810 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ You don't happen to know where Mr. Mulwray's having lunch?
L129809 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Maybe he takes it very seriously.
L129808 +++$+++ u4492 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ YELBURTON +++$+++ He never even kids about it.
L129807 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ And Mulwray isn't?
L129806 +++$+++ u4492 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ YELBURTON +++$+++ After all, you work with a man for a certain length of time, you come to know him, his habits, his values, and so forth. Well either he's the kind who chases after women or he isn't.
L129804 +++$+++ u4492 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ YELBURTON +++$+++ I wonder if you'd care to wait in my office?
L129803 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
L129802 +++$+++ u4492 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ YELBURTON +++$+++ Can I help you?  Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the Department.
L129770 +++$+++ u4493 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ YOUNG WOMAN +++$+++ That's what I thought. You see, I'm Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray. You know, Mr. Mulwray's wife.
L129769 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Never.
L129768 +++$+++ u4493 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ YOUNG WOMAN +++$+++ Never?
L129767 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Well, no.
L129766 +++$+++ u4493 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ YOUNG WOMAN +++$+++ Have we ever met?
L129765 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Well... I think I... I would've remembered.
L129764 +++$+++ u4493 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ YOUNG WOMAN +++$+++ Do you know me?
L129763 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Yes?
L129762 +++$+++ u4493 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ YOUNG WOMAN +++$+++ Mr. Gittes?
L129969 +++$+++ u4488 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ THE BOY +++$+++ Comes in different parts of the river. Every night a different part.
L129968 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ When it comes? What'd you tell him?
L129967 +++$+++ u4488 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ THE BOY +++$+++ When it comes.
L129966 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ What about the water?
L129965 +++$+++ u4488 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ THE BOY +++$+++ The water.
L129963 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Didn't you talk to a man here... few days ago... wore glasses... he...
L129962 +++$+++ u4488 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ THE BOY +++$+++ Si.
L129961 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Speak English?... Habla Ingles?
L129957 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Yeah, well he ain't gonna drown in a damp riverbed either, I don't care how soused he was. That's like drowning in a teaspoon.
L129956 +++$+++ u4479 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ MORTY +++$+++ It's not completely dry.
L129955 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ It's bone dry, Morty.
L129954 +++$+++ u4479 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ MORTY +++$+++ Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what's wrong with that?
L129953 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ The L.A. River?
L129952 +++$+++ u4479 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ MORTY +++$+++ Yeah, got dead drunk, passed out in the bottom of the riverbed.
L129951 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Come again?
L129950 +++$+++ u4479 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ MORTY +++$+++ Drowned, too.
L129949 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Yeah.
L129944 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ So how are you, Morty?
L129943 +++$+++ u4479 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ MORTY +++$+++ That's a long fall.
L129942 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Yeah. Banged up pretty bad.
L129941 +++$+++ u4479 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ MORTY +++$+++ Yeah? Ain't that something? Middle of a drought, the water commissioner drowns. Only in L.A.
L129940 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Nothin', Morty, it's my lunch hour, I thought I'd drop by and see who died lately.
L129939 +++$+++ u4479 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ MORTY +++$+++ Jake, what're you doin' here?
L130496 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Well, tell you what, pal. If Ida wants to see me she can call me at my office.
L130495 +++$+++ u4489 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ VOICE ON PHONE +++$+++ Sure you do.
L130494 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Yeah?... I do?
L130492 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Who?
L130491 +++$+++ u4489 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ VOICE ON PHONE +++$+++ Ida Sessions wants to see you.
L130490 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Yeah.
L130489 +++$+++ u4489 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ VOICE ON PHONE +++$+++ Gittes?... Gittes?
L129694 +++$+++ u4480 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ MRS. MULWRAY +++$+++ Money doesn't matter to me, Mr. Gittes.
L129693 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ This type of investigation can be hard on your pocketbook, Mrs. Mulwray. It takes time.
L129690 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Water and Power?
L129689 +++$+++ u4480 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ MRS. MULWRAY +++$+++ Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.
L129688 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ All right, what's your husband's first name?
L129687 +++$+++ u4480 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ MRS. MULWRAY +++$+++ But I have to know.
L129686 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ I'm sure he loves you, too. You know the expression, let sleeping dogs lie? You're better off not knowing.
L129685 +++$+++ u4480 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ MRS. MULWRAY +++$+++ But...
L129684 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Then go home and forget about it.
L129683 +++$+++ u4480 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ MRS. MULWRAY +++$+++ ...Yes of course.
L129682 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Mrs. Mulwray, do you love your husband?
L129680 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Now, what makes you certain he is involved with someone?
L129679 +++$+++ u4480 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ MRS. MULWRAY +++$+++ Of course not.
