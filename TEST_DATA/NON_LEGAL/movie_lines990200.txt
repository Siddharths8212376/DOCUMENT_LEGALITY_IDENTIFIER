L442974 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Do what I say. Please.
L442973 +++$+++ u7056 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ IMAM +++$+++ I would rather we all stay--
L442972 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Don't stop, just slow down.  Little more space 'tween us and them.
L442971 +++$+++ u7056 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ IMAM +++$+++ What?
L442970 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Imam. Slow down.
L442870 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ No, I'm not. But <u>he</u> can.
L442869 +++$+++ u7056 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ IMAM +++$+++ And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?
L442868 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ They're afraid of our light. That means we don't have to be so afraid of them.
L442826 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Riddick?
L442825 +++$+++ u7056 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ IMAM +++$+++ Hasan?
L442803 +++$+++ u7056 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ IMAM +++$+++ Quiet, please. Everyone.
L442802 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ I saw the cut-marks on the bones. Wasn't a natural die-off.
L442655 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ For now.
L442654 +++$+++ u7056 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ IMAM +++$+++ One is all?
L442541 +++$+++ u7056 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ IMAM +++$+++ We're all on the same hajj now.
L442540 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Frightening thought.
L442539 +++$+++ u7056 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ IMAM +++$+++ Chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime should there be a great hajj -- a great pilgrimage. To know God, better, yes, but to know yourself as well.
L442538 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ You were on a pilgrimage? To New Mecca?
L442537 +++$+++ u7056 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ IMAM +++$+++ "Some prophet guy." And a city man. But he had to travel to the desert -- where there was quiet -- to hear the words of God.
L442536 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ Some prophet guy?
L442535 +++$+++ u7056 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ IMAM +++$+++ You know who Muhammad was?
L442534 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ So quiet. You get used to the sounds of the ship, then....
L442510 +++$+++ u7056 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ IMAM +++$+++ One of the Christian habits we <u>didn't</u> adopt -- perhaps unfortunately. We'll have to wait.
L442509 +++$+++ u7055 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ FRY +++$+++ I don't suppose....
L443098 +++$+++ u7056 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ IMAM +++$+++ It's more a place where souls are found, Mr. Riddick.
L443097 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
L443096 +++$+++ u7056 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ IMAM +++$+++ New Mecca....
L443033 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ KEEP GOING OR I WILL!
L443032 +++$+++ u7056 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ IMAM +++$+++ SULEIMAN!
L443031 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Get the girl back under. Keep going.
L443030 +++$+++ u7056 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ IMAM +++$+++ Suleiman!
L443017 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Give my blessing to the girl. She needs a spare.
L443016 +++$+++ u7056 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ IMAM +++$+++ He will be with us. Nonetheless.
L443015 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ 'Cuz you don't spend half your life in lock-down with a horse-bit in your mouth and not believe. And you surely don't start out in a liquor store trash bin with an umbilical cord wrapped around your neck and not believe. Oh, absolutely I believe in God. And I absolutely hate the fucker.
L443014 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ You <u>don't</u> see.
L443013 +++$+++ u7056 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ IMAM +++$+++ I see. Well, even if you don't believe in God, it doesn't mean He won't be --
L443012 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ And pointless.
L443011 +++$+++ u7056 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ IMAM +++$+++ Blessing you like the others.  It's painless.
L443010 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ What're you doin'?
L442996 +++$+++ u7056 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ IMAM +++$+++ You mean....
L442995 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Which half?
L442994 +++$+++ u7056 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ IMAM +++$+++ Where's Mr. Johns?
L442933 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ There is no "safe."
L442932 +++$+++ u7056 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ IMAM +++$+++ Well...we must keep her close, then. Here, she'll be safe if we put her between --
L442714 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Has anyone checked the coring room?
L442713 +++$+++ u7056 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ IMAM +++$+++ Has anyone seen the young one? Ali?
L442941 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Listen to her? <u>Her</u>? When she was willing to sacrifice us all?
L442940 +++$+++ u7056 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ IMAM +++$+++ She's the captain, we should listen to --
L442917 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ He's running us 'round in circles. Look for yourself. Look!
L442916 +++$+++ u7056 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ IMAM +++$+++ We crossed our own tracks.
L442867 +++$+++ u7056 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ IMAM +++$+++ Please...this solves nothing...please....
L442866 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this.
L442851 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Those suns gotta come back <u>sometime</u>. And if these animals really are phobic about light, we just sit tight till then.
L442850 +++$+++ u7056 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ IMAM +++$+++ I had the impression...from the model... that the two planets were moving as one. That there would be...a lasting darkness.
L442651 +++$+++ u7056 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ IMAM +++$+++ The child heard you before any of us could even....
L442650 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ We got you...it's okay, it's okay...we got you now....
L442584 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ I'm born-again.
L442583 +++$+++ u7056 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ IMAM +++$+++ "God is Great," yes?
L442512 +++$+++ u7056 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ IMAM +++$+++ All deserts have water, somewhere. God shall lead us there.
L442511 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ For what? There is no water. You understand that, don't you?
L442903 +++$+++ u7059 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ PARIS +++$+++ Oh, so I'm disposable?
L442902 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ She's the pilot, she should stay close to the cells.
L442817 +++$+++ u7059 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ PARIS +++$+++ Not staying in here another....
L442816 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Very big beads.
L442704 +++$+++ u7059 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ PARIS +++$+++ Like an emergency life-raft, right?
L442703 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Well, just a skiff. Disposable, really.
L442670 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Didn't say that. But least this way I don't have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin' up.
L442669 +++$+++ u7059 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ PARIS +++$+++ So just like that. Wave your little wand and he's one of us now.
L442515 +++$+++ u7059 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ PARIS +++$+++ Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern India. Very rare.
L442514 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ What the hell are these?
L442507 +++$+++ u7059 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ PARIS +++$+++ I'll need a receipt for that.  For all these.
L442506 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ A toast to whatever he just said.
L442503 +++$+++ u7059 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ PARIS +++$+++ Be surprised what these will fetch in the Taurus system. Here. This Wooten here -- easy, easy. Very rare.
L442502 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ King Tut's tomb....
L442477 +++$+++ u7059 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ PARIS +++$+++ Anyone else having breathing problems? Aside from me?
L442476 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ ...then we saw this.
L442984 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Like who, Mr. Chrislam?
L442983 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum.
L442982 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Aw, don't tell me you're growin' scruples.
L442980 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Oh, you're a piece of art, Johns. They oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere. Or forget the museum -- maybe they should just hang you.
L442979 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ What's one more to you? Like <u>this</u> is the one that sends you to Hell?
L442978 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ What, you 'spect <u>me</u> to do it?
L442977 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Then let's not name the Thanksgiving turkey, okay? I assume you still got a shiv.
L442976 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ What do you care?
L442975 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ What's her name, anyway?
L442969 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Don' look, don' look, don' look....
L442968 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ So which one caught your eye?
L442967 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just keep 'em off our scent.
L442966 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Nice embellishment.
L442965 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ <u>Trawl</u> with it. There's a cable on the sled. We can drag the body behind us.
L442964 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum.
L442963 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.
L442962 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.
L442961 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies. It's called "triage," okay?
L442958 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ What if you're one of five?
L442957 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Not if I'm the one.
L442956 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Six of us left. If we could get through that canyon and lose just one, that'd be quite a fucking feat, huh? A good thing, right?
L442955 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Just realized that, huh?
L442954 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Ain't all of us gonna make it.
L442931 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ They been nose-open for her ever since we left. They go off blood.
L442930 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Aw, this can't be happening to me....
L442927 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ No. She's not.
L442926 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ What're you jaw-jackin' about? Girl's not cut.
L442923 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ About the girl.
L442922 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ About how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!
L442897 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Hard to tell, sometimes...even for me... but looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin' each other's gonads off. Thought we'd swing wide. Okay by you?
L442896 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Such as.
L442876 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Looks clear.
L442875 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Well, what's it look like now?
L442874 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Said "looks clear."
L442873 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ <u>Fuck me</u>. You said "clear."
L442865 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ How 'bout a cut in your gut?
L442864 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
L442863 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Think about that reward, Johns.
L442810 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Wanna rag your fat mouth?
L442809 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Well, you got the big gauge.
L442808 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ I'd rather piss glass.
L442734 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Not afraid of the dark, are you?
L442733 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Are you fuckin' kidding me?
L442667 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ If you were me, I'd kill us both. C'mon, you wanna sit at the grown-up table or not?
L442666 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ My recommendation: Do me. Don't take the chance that I'll get shiv-happy on your wannabe ass. Ghost me, Riddick. Would if I were you.
L442665 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Only if we both get outta this alive. And there may be a way.
L442664 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ You'd cut me loose, Boss?
L442663 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Truth is, Riddick, I'm tired of this head-up shit. I wanna be free of you as much as you wanna be free of me.
L442662 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ For what? The honor of goin' back to some asshole of a cell?
L442661 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Here's the deal. You work without the chains, without the bit -- without the shivs. You help us get off this rock....
L442660 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Say that again.
L442659 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ Want you to remember this moment, Riddick. The way it coulda gone and didn't.
L442657 +++$+++ u7057 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ JOHNS +++$+++ We're movin'. And I'm just wondering if I shouldn't lighten the load right now.
L442656 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Found somethin' worse than me, huh?
L442547 +++$+++ u7062 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ Well, just keep your bloody-fuckin' eyes open. Don't want that ratbag sneakin' up on me bloody-fuckin' arse.
L442546 +++$+++ u7059 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ PARIS +++$+++ Amazing how you can do without the essentials of life -- so long as you have the luxuries.
L442529 +++$+++ u7059 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ PARIS +++$+++ So much for my cocktail hour.
L442528 +++$+++ u7062 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ So much for your nightfall.
L442519 +++$+++ u7059 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ PARIS +++$+++ Well, what's the need, anyway? If he's gone, he's gone. Why should he bother us?
L442518 +++$+++ u7062 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ 'Cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these things, be my guess.
L442517 +++$+++ u7059 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ PARIS +++$+++ Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very <u>very</u> rare, since the tribe's extinct.
L442516 +++$+++ u7062 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ ZEKE +++$+++ An' this?
L442726 +++$+++ u7061 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ SHAZZA +++$+++ Startin' to acclimate, anyhow. Take it.
L442725 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ What, it's broken?
L442724 +++$+++ u7061 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ SHAZZA +++$+++ Take it.
L442723 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Just wanted his O-2.  Though I notice he tried to ghost my ass. When he shot up that stranger instead.
L442722 +++$+++ u7061 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ SHAZZA +++$+++ You were tryin' to kill him too.
L442710 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ I know you don't uncrate your emergency ship unless there's a fucking emergency.
L442709 +++$+++ u7061 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ SHAZZA +++$+++ Maybe they had weight limits, you don't know.
L442708 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ What, you don't really think they left with their clothes on the lines? Photos on the walls?
L442684 +++$+++ u7060 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ RIDDICK +++$+++ Doesn't need to be. Use this to get back up to the Sol-Track Shipping Lanes, stick out a thumb. You'll get picked up.  Right?
L442683 +++$+++ u7061 +++$+++ m472 +++$+++ SHAZZA +++$+++ Not a star-jumper.
L443797 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ That's correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy.
L443796 +++$+++ u7063 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ Seal the cave?
L443714 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ Well? For a time the ancients kept humans as household pets.	Until the Lawgiver proved that man could not be tamed. Keep digging Cornelius. You'll find evidence of the master of this house: an ape.
L443713 +++$+++ u7063 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ No sir, I haven't forgotten.
L443712 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ Your conclusion is premature. Have you forgotten your Scripture? The Thirteenth Scroll?  'And Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden, and chained him to a tree, and the children made sport of him.'
L443711 +++$+++ u7063 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ A doll alone proves nothing. True. But the doll was found beside the jawbone of a man -- and no trace of simian fossils has turned up in this deposit.
L443702 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ To begin with, your methods of dating the past are crude, to say the least. There are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations.
L443701 +++$+++ u7063 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ I apologize.
L443700 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ Don't speak to me in absolutes. The evidence is contestable.
L443699 +++$+++ u7063 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ Indeed, the very fact that these tools are unknown to us could suggest a culture in certain ways almost equal to our own. Some of the evidence is uncontestable ...
L443678 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ I've seen some of your fossils and artifacts. They're worthless.
L443677 +++$+++ u7063 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
L443676 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ I ask you to reconsider the rash course you've taken. If you're convicted of heresy, the most you'll get is two years. But if you persist in pointing guns in my direction, you'll hang for high treason.
L443674 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden Zone.  I see you brought along the female of your species.  I didn't realize a man could be monogamous.
L443673 +++$+++ u7063 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ How did you know we'd come here?
L443520 +++$+++ u7063 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ Yes, sir, so it was -- thanks to you. But not before I discovered evidence of a simian culture that existed long before the Sacred Scrolls were written ...
L443519 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ He exceeded his orders. His travel permit was promptly revoked.
L443377 +++$+++ u7063 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ Certainly, sir. It's a pleasure to see you again.
L443376 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
L443375 +++$+++ u7063 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.
L443374 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?
L443373 +++$+++ u7063 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ Dr. Zaius --
L443319 +++$+++ u7063 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ Certainly, sir. I'll get my notes and come right over.
L443318 +++$+++ u7073 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ ZAIUS +++$+++ Cornelius, if you have a moment today, I'd like to discuss this expedition of yours in more detail.
L443774 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Good luck then.
L443773 +++$+++ u7063 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ They can't convict us of that. You proved our innocence. Besides...  ... his culture is our culture.
L443751 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ And now you know the truth.  Cornelius has beaten you, Doctor. He proved it. Man preceded you here. You owe him your science, your language, whatever knowledge you have.
L443750 +++$+++ u7063 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ That was different. We thought you were .... inferior.
L443718 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Reconstructing a life. Care to have a look?
L443717 +++$+++ u7063 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ What are you doing there?
L443716 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Yes. I have to agree. From all you've found so far, his position's as good as yours.
L443685 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ No. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I can pay you back.
L443684 +++$+++ u7063 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ Taylor, I'd rather you -
L443670 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Shut up.
L443669 +++$+++ u7063 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ Taylor, you're not in command here. Put down that gun.
L443668 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ If there's any shooting, Dr. Zaius, you'll be the first to die. Depend on it.
L443662 +++$+++ u7063 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ Right now, if you like.
L443661 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ When are you going to show me what's in the cave?
L443651 +++$+++ u7063 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ No one really knows. It's an ancient taboo. Set forth in the Sacred Scrolls. The Lawgiver pronounced the area deadly.
L443650 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ You've never told me why this region's called the Forbidden Zone.
L443647 +++$+++ u7063 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ It empties into a sea some miles from here. That's where the cave is.
L443646 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Where does the river lead?
L443625 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ I know ... Nevertheless, I thank you for saving us. You'll be in trouble for going there.
L443624 +++$+++ u7063 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no vegetation. Nothing.
L443623 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Nothing much. The remnants of a life raft. Maybe a small flag. The emblem of my countrymen.
L443622 +++$+++ u7063 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ It's a long detour to Dead Lake. What would we find?
L443621 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ You still don't believe me, do you?
L443620 +++$+++ u7063 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ To the diggings I worked at a year ago. It's a three day ride across the eastern desert, near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours.
L443617 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone. That's what  we'll try for. What about you?
L443616 +++$+++ u7063 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ As you wish.
L443613 +++$+++ u7072 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ TAYLOR +++$+++ Just the same, I want one.
L443612 +++$+++ u7063 +++$+++ m473 +++$+++ CORNELIUS +++$+++ The best. But we won't need them.
