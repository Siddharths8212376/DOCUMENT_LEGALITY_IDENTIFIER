L396329 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Personally, I don't know what Mr. Cedar's raving about. From what I can see, no matter what system of government we have, there will always be leaders and always be followers.
L396328 +++$+++ u2172 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Please, Mr. Cedar!  Proceed.
L396325 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Oh yes, I was getting to that, Your Honor.
L396324 +++$+++ u2172 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Mr. Deeds, you haven't yet touched upon a most important thing. This rather fantastic idea of yours to want to give away your entire fortune. It is, to say the least, most uncommon.
L396303 +++$+++ u2172 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Not at all.
L396302 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Now about the Falkner sisters. That's kind of funny. I mean about Mr. Cedar going all the way to Mandrake Falls to bring them here. Do you mind if I talk to them?
L396295 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Oh, yes. Yes. About my throwing those people out of my house. Mrs. Pomponi told the truth. I did throw them out because I didn't want the party in the first place. I didn't invite anybody. Mrs. Pomponi did all that. They just came to see what kind of a freak the "Cinderella Man" was. I don't know how people like that are supposed to act, Your Honor, but if that Pomponi woman is an example, I'll stick to simple folks. She just came in, talked my ear off, and took charge of everything. If I were a friend of hers, I'd have her examined.
L396294 +++$+++ u2172 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Mr. Deeds, do you recall forcibly ejecting people from your home?
L396285 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ An O-filler. You fill in all the spaces in the O's, with your pencil.  I was watching you.
L396284 +++$+++ u2172 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ A what?
L396282 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Well, I don't know where to begin. There's been so many things said about me that I—
L396281 +++$+++ u2172 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Proceed.
L396280 +++$+++ u2172 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Take the stand!
L396279 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ I'd like to get in my two cents' worth.
L396278 +++$+++ u2172 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Yes?
L396277 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Your Honor—
L395446 +++$+++ u2182 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ Over at that big round table. The one that looks like a poodle.
L395445 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Oh, the poet? Where?
L395444 +++$+++ u2182 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ Brookfield just came in.
L395441 +++$+++ u2182 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L395440 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ I write poetry.
L395439 +++$+++ u2182 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L395438 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ I'm a writer myself, you know.
L395437 +++$+++ u2182 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L395436 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?
L395435 +++$+++ u2182 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ WAITER +++$+++ Huh? On, no. Nobody important.
L395513 +++$+++ u2177 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MORROW +++$+++ Fun?  Say, listen, I'll take you on a bender that will live in your memory as a thing of beauty and joy forever.  Boy! Boy! My headpiece!
L395512 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ That ought to be fun.
L395511 +++$+++ u2177 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MORROW +++$+++ Yes. I mean the real McCoy. Listen, you play saloon with me, and I'll introduce you to every wit, every nit-wit, and every half-wit in New York. We'll go on a twister that'll make Omar the soused philosopher of Persia[7] look like an anemic on a goat's milk diet.
L395510 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Binge?
L395509 +++$+++ u2177 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MORROW +++$+++ Well, you'll not only see those, but before the evening's half through, you'll be leaning against the Leaning Tower of Pisa - you'll mount Mt. Everest. I'll show you the Pyramids and all the little Pyramiddes, leaping from sphinx to sphinx. Pal, how would you like to go on a real, old-fashioned binge?
L395508 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ I'd kind of like to see Grant's Tomb - and the Statue of Liberty.
L395507 +++$+++ u2177 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MORROW +++$+++ Fine, fine. Swell, You just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and I'd like to reciprocate. Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet—  —thanks - and I'll show you sights that you've never seen before.
L395506 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights.
L395505 +++$+++ u2177 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MORROW +++$+++ Oh, what a magnificent deflation of smugness. Pal, you've added ten years to my life!  A poet with a straight left and a right hook - delicious! Delicious!  You're my guest from now on - forever and a day - even unto eternity!
L395504 +++$+++ u2177 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MORROW +++$+++ The difference between them and me is I know when I've been a skunk. You take me to the nearest news- stand and I'll eat a pack of your postcards raw. Raw!
L395503 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ That's all right. I got it off my chest.
L395502 +++$+++ u2177 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MORROW +++$+++ Say fellow, you neglected me - and I feel very put out.  Look, sock it right there, will you? Lay one right on the button,[6] but sock it hard.
L395135 +++$+++ u2178 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MRS. MEREDITH +++$+++ I don't care how much it is. You sit right there and eat your lunch. You haven't touched a thing.
L395134 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Hear what he said? You know how much twenty million is?
L395130 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ I'm kind of nervous. I've never been away from Mandrake Falls in my life. Kind of like to see Grant's Tomb, though.
L395129 +++$+++ u2178 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MRS. MEREDITH +++$+++ Well, we could borrow a couple from Mrs. Simpson. You know, she went to Niagara Falls last year.
L395122 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Now you keep out of this!
L395121 +++$+++ u2178 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MRS. MEREDITH +++$+++ He's got a lot of foolish notions - about saving a lady in distress.
L395120 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Don't pay any attention to her.
L395119 +++$+++ u2178 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MRS. MEREDITH +++$+++ No, he's too fussy for that. That's what's the matter with him. There are lots of nice girls right here in Mandrake Falls who're dying to be married—
L395097 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Of course they're going to stay.  She's got some fresh orange layer cake. You know, with the thick stuff on the top?  Sure, they don't want to go to the hotel.
L395096 +++$+++ u2178 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MRS. MEREDITH +++$+++ How about lunch? Are the gentlemen going to stay - or not?
L395084 +++$+++ u2178 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MRS. MEREDITH +++$+++ You gentlemen going to stay for lunch?
L395083 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ New mouthpiece. Been waiting two weeks for this. Kids keep swiping them all the time. They use 'em for bean shooters.  What can I do for you gentlemen?
L395073 +++$+++ u2178 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MRS. MEREDITH +++$+++ I don't know.
L395072 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Who are they?
L396035 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Oh. Oh!
L396034 +++$+++ u2179 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ SVENSON +++$+++ South Dakota - but on the top.
L396033 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ South Dakota - north?
L396032 +++$+++ u2179 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ SVENSON +++$+++ South Dakota north.
L396031 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Where is your farm?
L396030 +++$+++ u2179 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ SVENSON +++$+++ Yes, ma'am.
L396029 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Farmer?
L396028 +++$+++ u2179 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ SVENSON +++$+++ Christian Svenson.
L396027 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ What is your name?
L395845 +++$+++ u2175 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MABEL +++$+++ Thank you so much. Good night.
L395844 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Goodnight. Don't worry. I won't keep her out late.
L395840 +++$+++ u2175 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MABEL +++$+++ Oh yes, I think it'd be a swell night to go for a walk. A nice long one.
L395839 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ It would be a nice night to go for a walk, don't you think?
L395838 +++$+++ u2175 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MABEL +++$+++ Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
L395837 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it?
L395831 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Sure. They got on my nerves, so I threw 'em out.
L395830 +++$+++ u2175 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MABEL +++$+++ You mean—  —by the neck or something?
L395822 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Is Mary home?
L395821 +++$+++ u2175 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MABEL +++$+++ Yeah. What?
L395820 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Is she home?
L395819 +++$+++ u2175 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ MABEL +++$+++ Huh? Oh, yes - yes, of course. Her sister. Yes, I've been her sister for a long time.
L395818 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ You're Mabel - her sister - aren't you?
L395975 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ No!  What do you want!!
L395974 +++$+++ u2183 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Shall I call the police, sir?
L395957 +++$+++ u2183 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L395956 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Pack my things, Walter. I'm going home.
L395932 +++$+++ u2183 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Yes, sir. Very good, sir. Here it is right here, sir. There, sir.
L395931 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ An hour? What's an hour! You know how time flies, Walter. My tie? Get it.
L395930 +++$+++ u2183 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ But she isn't due for an hour, sir.
L395929 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Anything happened? I've got to get dressed! I can't meet her like this!
L395928 +++$+++ u2183 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Yes, sir. What is it, sir? Anything happened3
L395776 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Yeah.
L395775 +++$+++ u2183 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Me, sir?
L395774 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ You try it.
L395773 +++$+++ u2183 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Why, that's an echo, sir!
L395772 +++$+++ u2183 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ What, sir?
L395771 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Hey, did you hear that?
L395769 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Get out.  The evil finger's on you. Get out!
L395768 +++$+++ u2183 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ But she's on the telephone—
L395767 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ What do you mean by coming in here when I'm playing?
L395766 +++$+++ u2183 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Madame Pomponi. She says everything is all set for the reception.
L395765 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Who?
L395764 +++$+++ u2183 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Madame Pomponi is on the telephone, sir.
L395575 +++$+++ u2183 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Very good, sir.  Oh, I beg pardon. A telegram came for you, sir.  I'll get you some black coffee, sir.
L395574 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Better bring me some coffee, Walter.
L395573 +++$+++ u2183 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ You kept searching me last night, sir. Going through my pockets. You said you were looking for a rhyme for Budington.
L395572 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Looking for?
L395571 +++$+++ u2183 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Yes, sir. I beg pardon, sir, but did you ever find what you were looking for, sir?
L395570 +++$+++ u2183 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ But how'll I put on the slipper, sir?
L395569 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Please!
L395566 +++$+++ u2183 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ The ones who brought you home, sir. They said you and another gentleman kept walking up and down the streets, shouting: "Back to nature! Clothes are a blight on civilization! Back to nature!"
L395565 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ What two policemen?
L395564 +++$+++ u2183 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ That's what the two policemen said, sir.
L395563 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Oh, don't be silly, Walter. I couldn't walk around in the streets without any clothes. I'd be arrested.
L395562 +++$+++ u2183 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ As a matter of fact, you came home without any clothes. You were in your - uh - shorts. Yes, sir.
L395561 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ I did what!
L395560 +++$+++ u2183 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ You came home last night - without them.
L395559 +++$+++ u2183 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ You have no pants, sir.
L395558 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ What do you mean? I remember everything!  Hand me my pants - I wrote her phone number on a piece of paper.
L395557 +++$+++ u2183 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ I'd venture to say, sir, you don't remember much of anything that happened last night, sir.
L395556 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ I'd better call her up and apologize. I don't remember taking her home last night.
L395555 +++$+++ u2183 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Oh, I do too, sir.
L395554 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ She was a lady in distress. She wouldn't let me help her. Got a lot of pride. I like that.
L395553 +++$+++ u2183 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Miss Dawson, sir? No, sir. No Miss Dawson has called, sir.
L395552 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Oh. Oh!  Has Miss Dawson called yet?
L395551 +++$+++ u2183 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Yes, sir. It makes the head feel smaller.
L395550 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Prairie? Oysters?
L395549 +++$+++ u2183 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ A Prairie Oyster, sir.[10]
L395548 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ What's that?
L395547 +++$+++ u2183 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L395544 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ I just wanted to make sure.
L395543 +++$+++ u2183 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L395542 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ You're Walter, aren't you?
L395541 +++$+++ u2183 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Mr. Deeds - Mr. Deeds, sir - you really must get up. It's late!
L395382 +++$+++ u2183 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ That was something I was never able to find out, sir.
L395381 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Twenty! What did he do with them?
L395380 +++$+++ u2183 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.
L395379 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?
L395378 +++$+++ u2183 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Every man to his taste, sir.
L395377 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ He talks about women as if they were cattle.
L395347 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Excuse me. What did you say?
L395346 +++$+++ u2183 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ No, sir.
L395343 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Imagine that - holding the ends of my pants!
L395342 +++$+++ u2183 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L395341 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ Get up from there. I don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants. Get up from there!
L395340 +++$+++ u2183 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Why, I'm assisting you, sir.
L395339 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ What do you think you're doing?
L395332 +++$+++ u2183 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L395331 +++$+++ u2173 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ LONGFELLOW +++$+++ What - tails?  Why, that's a monkey suit![5] Do you want people to laugh at me?  I never wore one of those things in my life.
L395330 +++$+++ u2183 +++$+++ m140 +++$+++ WALTER +++$+++ Tails tonight, sir?
L400278 +++$+++ u2184 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ ALTHEA +++$+++ "There's no shame in getting a little therapy", right, Doc?
L400277 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ You can go out there if you like...
L400274 +++$+++ u2184 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ ALTHEA +++$+++ -- When I was in high school, the thing I wanted most, when I was stuck in class, the thing I was always desperately in pursuit of -- was a hall pass. That's all I wanted. I loved moving freely around the school while everybody else was trapped in there... And that's how I feel right now... Like I have some giant, all- day hall pass.
L400273 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Take your time.
L400272 +++$+++ u2184 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ ALTHEA +++$+++ I know my time's up, but I've got to get this out while I've got hold of it --
L400267 +++$+++ u2184 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ ALTHEA +++$+++ He said he wasn't coming back. He said it wasn't working for him any more. That it hadn't "worked for him" for quite a while... You know what I regret the most? I'm sorry I let him make the kids take his name. He was an acquirer.  He liked to acquire things.
L400266 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Doubtful. What did he say?
L400265 +++$+++ u2184 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ ALTHEA +++$+++ It's happened before.  I'm shocked by how little I'm feeling. I can't understand it.  I'll probably have a complete depressoid collapse soon, won't I?
L400264 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ You must have been concerned.
L400263 +++$+++ u2184 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ ALTHEA +++$+++ We argued on Sunday. He went to work on Monday and stayed in the city during the week, like always. But on Thursday, when he normally comes home, he didn't. Didn't call either. Not till Saturday afternoon.
L400262 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ What happened?
L400261 +++$+++ u2184 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ ALTHEA +++$+++ It's irrelevant. It had nothing to do with what happened.
L400260 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ One hundred books?
L400259 +++$+++ u2184 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ ALTHEA +++$+++ Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99.
L400258 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Uh-huh. What are they?
L400257 +++$+++ u2184 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ ALTHEA +++$+++ I had ordered some books. "The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written."
L400256 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about.
L400255 +++$+++ u2184 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ ALTHEA +++$+++ -- The argument had nothing to do with it.
L399753 +++$+++ u2184 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ ALTHEA +++$+++ Yes. Jeremy will be home for the weekend. And you can meet the kids.
L399752 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Really? You think so?
L399751 +++$+++ u2184 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ ALTHEA +++$+++ I said... you must come out to the house for dinner on Thursday.
L399750 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Hmm?
L399749 +++$+++ u2184 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ ALTHEA +++$+++ Mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm.
L399748 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Good kids.
L399747 +++$+++ u2184 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ ALTHEA +++$+++ They said if I didn't get help, they wouldn't deal with me any more.  What do you think about that?
L399746 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ How did they threaten you?
L399745 +++$+++ u2184 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ ALTHEA +++$+++ It's the kids, you know, not Jeremy. He had nothing to do with this -- except pay, of course. He's always willing to pay. He's extremely generous.  I'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me.
L399744 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ I'm not sure. But I think they're worried about you.
L399743 +++$+++ u2184 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ ALTHEA +++$+++ Why are they ganging up against me?
L399742 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Me more than most.
L399741 +++$+++ u2184 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ ALTHEA +++$+++ What do they want from me?  What have I done that's so wrong?  They act as though they don't have their own peculiar things... They do! Believe me. Everybody's got something...  Even you probably have things.
L400341 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ A friend?
L400340 +++$+++ u2185 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ COOK +++$+++ Her friend from the city came and took her out to dinner. First time in a long time she's been willing.
L400332 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ No. It's sort of spur of the moment.
L400331 +++$+++ u2185 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ COOK +++$+++ Were you supposed to have a session?
L400330 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Hello, Mr. Cook. I was wondering if Sofie was around?
L399772 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Generally that doesn't work out so well. It sends the wrong message to people who need to make a change.
L399771 +++$+++ u2185 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ COOK +++$+++ I'm not sure she'll come. She's in a mood. Do you ever go to somebody's house?
L399770 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Sure. Why don't you bring her up to my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon.
L399769 +++$+++ u2185 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ COOK +++$+++ Oh... a lot of things. Several different factors. Will you see her, Doctor Mumford?
L399768 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Why's that?
L399767 +++$+++ u2185 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ COOK +++$+++ Yeah, I got that. Some people think it's all in their heads.  It's been so bad she's had to move back here to Mumford and live with us. And I'm not sure that's the best thing, either...
L399766 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it.
L399765 +++$+++ u2185 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ COOK +++$+++ That's it -- syndrome. So you know all about it?
L399764 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Syndrome... Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
L399763 +++$+++ u2185 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ COOK +++$+++ We're not sure. She's been to all kinds of doctors in the city and they've said different things. Some of 'em are callin' it --  -- Epstein-Barr virus, and the rest are callin' it... Chronic Fatigue Symptom...
L399762 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ What's that?
L399761 +++$+++ u2185 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ COOK +++$+++ It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta problem.
L399760 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L399759 +++$+++ u2185 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ COOK +++$+++ I know I shoulda come to your office. I was gonna, actually, but then when you walked in here today...
L399758 +++$+++ u2185 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ COOK +++$+++ Could you come with me please?
L399757 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Mr. Cook.
L399756 +++$+++ u2185 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ COOK +++$+++ Dr. Mumford.
L400600 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ Not any more.
L400599 +++$+++ u2186 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ CORRECTIONAL OFFICER +++$+++ But you do therapy?
L400598 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ No, not really.
L400597 +++$+++ u2186 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ CORRECTIONAL OFFICER +++$+++ You're the shrink, aren't you?
L400596 +++$+++ u2196 +++$+++ m141 +++$+++ MUMFORD +++$+++ I'm fine.
