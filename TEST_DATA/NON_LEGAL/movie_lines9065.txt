L222199 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ You will.  What do you want, Victor?
L222198 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I'll have to do better than that.
L222197 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.
L222196 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ And you?
L222195 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Father's so proud.
L222194 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Quite a send-off, isn't it?
L222193 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Smell the air. Wonderful.
L222178 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Give me that child before you fill his head with drivel!
L222177 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Don't listen, Willie. Progress is a feast to be consumed. Women would have you believe you must walk before you can run. Or run before you can waltz!
L222174 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ He needs to vent his outrage to the skies! Make yourself heard, Willie! Learning to walk is not an easy thing! Why should it be so?
L222173 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Oh, do give him here! He needs to be comforted and held!
L222172 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ The world is a dizzying place.
L222171 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Victor, have a care! You'll make him dizzy!
L222167 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ He left a beautiful gift in her place. A baby boy. To cherish and love as our very own. Your brother
L222166 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ God took her from us.
L222165 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him.  I cannot do that alone.
L222164 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ What kind of God is He to will this?
L222163 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ It's not ours to decide. All that live must die. It's God's will.
L222162 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ How could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her?
L222145 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Nothing can. Not ever.
L222144 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Are you sure it can't hurt us?
L222142 +++$+++ u972 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Aren't you?
L222141 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Don't cry, Elizabeth.
L222754 +++$+++ u975 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ GRIGORI +++$+++ Aye, Captain.
L222753 +++$+++ u982 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALTON +++$+++ He died. Raving about phantoms. He was mad, poor devil.  Gather a detail. Have the body removed from my cabin.
L222752 +++$+++ u975 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ GRIGORI +++$+++ This ice will break yet.  How's our guest?
L222751 +++$+++ u982 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALTON +++$+++ A warming wind.
L222109 +++$+++ u975 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ GRIGORI +++$+++ Then you run the danger of pushing them to mutiny.
L222108 +++$+++ u982 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALTON +++$+++ They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.
L222107 +++$+++ u975 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ GRIGORI +++$+++ Captain, I implore you. The men are frightened and angry. They want your assurance.
L222085 +++$+++ u982 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALTON +++$+++ It wouldn't dare.
L222084 +++$+++ u975 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ GRIGORI +++$+++ It's going to ram us.
L222354 +++$+++ u981 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALDMAN +++$+++ Oh God.
L222353 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Professor?
L222337 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Thank goodness. We'd be out of work.
L222336 +++$+++ u981 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALDMAN +++$+++ No. But someday.
L222335 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?
L222334 +++$+++ u981 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALDMAN +++$+++ I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.
L222333 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?
L222332 +++$+++ u981 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALDMAN +++$+++ I'm quite serious. Look at all the charity and clinic work we do. Up until thirty years ago, the concept of vaccine was unheard of.
L222745 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Let it go.
L222744 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ All that I once loved lies in a shallow grave. By my hand.
L222697 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I owe you that. Done.
L222696 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Only if you'll tell me who he is.
L222695 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I'll be back as soon as I've got her far away and safe. We'll hunt this fiend down together.
L222694 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her.
L222693 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Are you sure you'll be all right?
L222646 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I didn't find what I was looking for.
L222645 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ What happened up there?
L222553 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ This. My home. My family.  If not for you, I'd be dead in a burial pit somewhere.
L222552 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ For what?
L222551 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Thank you, Henry.
L222550 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Quite a place.
L222435 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Victor. This place looked like a charnel house. What went on here?
L222434 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ No. They don't.
L222433 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ It's the down-and-outs I pity most. Those who can't fend for themselves. They'll be dead by the thousands before this is done. They don't stand a chance out there.
L222432 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Nothing in moderation, Frankenstein.
L222431 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Everything in moderation, Clerval.
L222430 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ We catch a few hours sleep where we can. Usually here at your bedside.
L222429 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ You've been going round-the-clock?
L222428 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Mine and Professor Krempe's.  We've been trading off nursing you in shifts. The rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims. It's his turn for that just now.
L222427 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Is that your diagnosis?
L222426 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ We feared cholera. Turned out to be pneumonia, brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm.
L222425 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ A... week?
L222424 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Thank God your fever broke.  Slowly, now. Just a sip.  I've been worried we might lose you. It's been touch-and-go for a week.
L222401 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ You'll be leaving then.  Just as well. You never were cut out for this, Henry. Goodbye.
L222400 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
L222399 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Yes? And?
L222398 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases a day now. Classes have been suspended. University's shut down.
L222397 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ This is a bad time, Henry. I'm busy just now. What do you want?
L222379 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Few months perhaps. I'm gathering the raw materials even now.
L222378 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ How much longer?
L222377 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ That is my concern.  I'm involved in something just now. I want to finish it in Waldman's memory.
L222376 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ We all know how hard you took Waldman's death. Even Krempe is sympathetic. But it is time to move on. It is time to concern yourself with life.
L222375 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I've been preoccupied.
L222374 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Victor. This has got to stop.  Nobody's seen you in months. You haven't attended a single class.
L222369 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ There are sick people who need our help. Here and now. Not in some future time. Consider that.
L222368 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ No. He had more important work.
L222367 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
L222366 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent his life trying to help people!
L222365 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ That's blasphemy!
L222364 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I resent God's monopoly.
L222363 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ You can't. Death is God's will!
L222362 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Why Waldman? He of all people should have cheated death!
L222361 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ You're making a scene!
L222360 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ It was wrong, Henry! It shouldn't have happened! The bastard deserves to die.
L222359 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Keep your voice down. You don't know what you're saying.
L222358 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Good. I'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap.
L222357 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ They'll hang him all the same.
L222356 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
L222355 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ They just caught the man who did it.
L222343 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Nothing in moderation, Clerval.
L222342 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ And here's to Him. Everything in moderation, Frankenstein.
L222339 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Somebody has to!
L222338 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Only you would think of that!
L222289 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ But you haven't listened, Never in history has so much seemed possible. We're on the verge of answers undreamt of... but only if we have the courage to ask the questions.
L222288 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ ...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox has been virtually eliminated. I've heard this speech before.
L222287 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ These are exciting times, Henry. We're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. He wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought
L222286 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Now you've got him started.
L222278 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ It's a letter to my father.
L222277 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.
L222276 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ You're a comfort to me, Henry.
L222275 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ The entire school heard it. It wasn't something one could miss.
L222263 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Do me a favor then...  ...keep them to yourself.
L222262 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Quite a few.
L222261 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Can you think of a better reason?
L222260 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Rich old ladies and their daughters?
L222253 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Come now. Magnus? Agrippa? Next thing you know, you'll be teaching toadstools to speak.
L222252 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Do you really think I'm mad?
L222251 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I know. You have a way of making an impression.
L222250 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Victor, Victor Frankenstein.
L222249 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Henry Clerval.
L222248 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Of course I am. It pays to humor the insane.
L222247 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Are you having me on?
L222246 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ As a march hare.
L222245 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I am not mad.
L222243 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Very well then.
L222242 +++$+++ u976 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I was just clearing my throat.
L222589 +++$+++ u977 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ JUSTINE +++$+++ I have no knowledge of that.
L222588 +++$+++ u979 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ PROSECUTOR +++$+++ So you have claimed. Yet you have no explanation for this.  The locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder. The locket you so coveted.  How did it come to be in your possession?
L222587 +++$+++ u977 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ JUSTINE +++$+++ Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my mind.
L222586 +++$+++ u979 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ PROSECUTOR +++$+++ Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?
L222585 +++$+++ u977 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ JUSTINE +++$+++ I have always loved him.
L222584 +++$+++ u979 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ PROSECUTOR +++$+++ And is it true, Miss Moritz, that you love Victor Frankenstein? That your heart was broken?  Answer the question. Do you love Victor Frankenstein?
L222583 +++$+++ u977 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ JUSTINE +++$+++ Yes. I took refuge in the barn. Wouldn't you? Lost in the storm? Freezing and wet? I was exhausted and could search no longer.
L222324 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Despite the lack of challenge.
L222323 +++$+++ u978 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ KREMPE +++$+++ You seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum.
L222239 +++$+++ u978 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ KREMPE +++$+++ Of Geneva.  Tell me, Mr. Frankenstein of Geneva. Do you wish to study medicine? Or mysticism?
L222238 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Victor Frankenstein, sir.  Of geneva.
L222237 +++$+++ u978 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ KREMPE +++$+++ What is your name?
L222236 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...
L222235 +++$+++ u978 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ KREMPE +++$+++ Paracelsus?
L222234 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect. Paracelsus, for one.
L222233 +++$+++ u978 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ KREMPE +++$+++ Philosophical?
L222232 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ But surely, Professor, you don't intend we disregard the more... philosophical works.
L222231 +++$+++ u978 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ KREMPE +++$+++ In science, the letter of fact is the letter of law. Our pursuit is as dogmatic as any religious precept. Think of yourselves as disciples of a strict and hallowed sect. Someday you may be priests... but only if you learn the scripture chapter and verse.  Any questions?
L222341 +++$+++ u981 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALDMAN +++$+++ Oh, now you have gone too far. There's only one God, Victor.
L222340 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I tell you what we need, my friends. Forget the symptoms and diseases. What we need is a vaccine for death itself.
L222326 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ The strain was evident.
L222325 +++$+++ u981 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALDMAN +++$+++ Victor. He was trying to be gracious.
L222320 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system?
L222319 +++$+++ u981 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALDMAN +++$+++ Re-configure the leads?
L222306 +++$+++ u981 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALDMAN +++$+++ Our profession needs talent like yours. Destroy your career over an issue of pride? What a waste.
L222305 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Why?
L222304 +++$+++ u981 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALDMAN +++$+++ "...a sincere and heartfelt apology which you will then read aloud to him before the assembled student body and faculty.
L222303 +++$+++ u981 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALDMAN +++$+++ Nonsense. Tonight you will draft an apology to Professor Krempe...
L222302 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I doubt that decision is still mine to make.
L222301 +++$+++ u981 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALDMAN +++$+++ It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous.  Nature can be wonderful and terrible. Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. We must proceed cautiously. Assess as we go.  What I do on my own time is my own business. The same holds true for you. You wish to expand your mind? Fine, do so. You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the expense of your normal studies.
L222300 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views!
L222299 +++$+++ u981 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALDMAN +++$+++ Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.
L222298 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ It's utterly fantastic! This is the sort of thing I'm talking about! We should be learning this!
L222297 +++$+++ u981 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALDMAN +++$+++ Electricity.
L222294 +++$+++ u981 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALDMAN +++$+++ I once saw it done, as a boy in Canton. My parents were missionaries. The cure was nothing short of miraculous.  I've never forgotten it. Been fascinated ever since.
L222293 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Preposterous.
L222285 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ No, I embrace it... as something to be used or discarded as we advance the boundaries of what is known.
L222284 +++$+++ u981 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALDMAN +++$+++ You disdain accepted wisdom?
L222283 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ To say the least. I came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new.
L222282 +++$+++ u981 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALDMAN +++$+++ You have a way of provoking his.  I've been watching you. You seem impatient with your studies.
L222281 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Krempe has a way of provoking my temper.
L222280 +++$+++ u981 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALDMAN +++$+++ Victor, explain yourself.
L222279 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Professor Waldman.
L222131 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ My name is Frankenstein...
L222130 +++$+++ u982 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALTON +++$+++ Who are you?
L222129 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ We are kindred, you and I. Men of ambition. Let me tell you all that I have lost in such pursuits. I pray my story will come to mean for you all that is capricious and evil in man.
L222128 +++$+++ u982 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALTON +++$+++ Madness?
L222127 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Do you share my madness?
L222126 +++$+++ u982 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALTON +++$+++ Lives are ephemeral. The knowledge we gain, the achievements we leave behind... those live on.
L222125 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ You'd persist at the cost of your own life? The lives of your crew?
L222124 +++$+++ u982 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALTON +++$+++ Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune.
L222123 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Your men are right to be afraid.
L222122 +++$+++ u982 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALTON +++$+++ You know of it?
L222121 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Creature? A... human like creature?
L222120 +++$+++ u982 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALTON +++$+++ I can't say I blame them. We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature.
L222119 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I heard.
L222118 +++$+++ u982 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALTON +++$+++ Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
L222117 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Ah. An explorer.
L222116 +++$+++ u982 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALTON +++$+++ There's a startling question, coming from you.  I'm captain of this ship. We sailed from Archangel a month ago, seeking a passage to the North Pole.
L222115 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ How is it you come to be here?
L222114 +++$+++ u982 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALTON +++$+++ Are you a physician?
L222113 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple diagnosis.
L222112 +++$+++ u980 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I'm... dying.
L222111 +++$+++ u982 +++$+++ m63 +++$+++ WALTON +++$+++ You're awake. I've prepared some broth. It'll help restore you.
