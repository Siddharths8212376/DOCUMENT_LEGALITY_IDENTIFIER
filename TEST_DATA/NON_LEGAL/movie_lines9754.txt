L167431 +++$+++ u4869 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ VI +++$+++ Well, I'm only trying to get you outta this.  I told them you were in Vietnam, you always had good jobs, you were with Goldwater at the '64 convention, but you had marital problems...
L167430 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ You did what?  Who did you talk to? What for?
L167429 +++$+++ u4869 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ VI +++$+++ I talked to the FBI, I told them about you, they said if you just come outta the bank it's gonna be okay.
