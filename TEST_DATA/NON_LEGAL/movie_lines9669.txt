L124641 +++$+++ u4407 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ So I've noticed.
L124640 +++$+++ u4405 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ FERGUS +++$+++ But I won't. We're more polite around these parts.
L124639 +++$+++ u4407 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Could you?
L124638 +++$+++ u4405 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ FERGUS +++$+++ Well, I could say the same about you.
L124637 +++$+++ u4407 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ No. It's the truth.
L124636 +++$+++ u4405 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ FERGUS +++$+++ You trying to hurt my feelings?
L124635 +++$+++ u4407 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Nope. Not handsome at all.
L124634 +++$+++ u4405 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ FERGUS +++$+++ No?
L124633 +++$+++ u4407 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup.
L124632 +++$+++ u4405 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ FERGUS +++$+++ What's that?
L124630 +++$+++ u4407 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Only joking.
L124629 +++$+++ u4405 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ FERGUS +++$+++ No fucking way.
L124628 +++$+++ u4407 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Now, if you took the ropes off, I'd be able to feed myself.
L124608 +++$+++ u4405 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ FERGUS +++$+++ Can't we take it off?
L124607 +++$+++ u4407 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Please, man, I'm suffocating in here.
L124602 +++$+++ u4407 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ I can smell her perfume.
L124601 +++$+++ u4405 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ FERGUS +++$+++ How did you know it was her?
L124598 +++$+++ u4405 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ FERGUS +++$+++ My pleasure.
L124597 +++$+++ u4407 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Thank you, handsome.
L124595 +++$+++ u4407 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Yeah. And the brown eyes.
L124594 +++$+++ u4405 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ FERGUS +++$+++ Am I?
L124593 +++$+++ u4407 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ You're the one about five ten with the killer smile and the baby face.
L124592 +++$+++ u4405 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ FERGUS +++$+++ So, what do I look like?
L124591 +++$+++ u4407 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ I seen your fucking face.
L124590 +++$+++ u4405 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ FERGUS +++$+++ How is it a farce?
L124589 +++$+++ u4407 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ This is a farce, man.
L124588 +++$+++ u4407 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Can't eat through a canvas bag.
L124587 +++$+++ u4405 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ FERGUS +++$+++ What do you mean you can't?
L124586 +++$+++ u4407 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Can't.
L124585 +++$+++ u4405 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ FERGUS +++$+++ Eat something, would you?
L124559 +++$+++ u4405 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ FERGUS +++$+++ Yeah.
L124558 +++$+++ u4407 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Fuck you.
L124799 +++$+++ u4407 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ He believes in the future --
L124798 +++$+++ u4408 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JUDE +++$+++ I said shut the fuck up --

L124796 +++$+++ u4408 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JUDE +++$+++ You're heading for trouble, Fergus --

L124794 +++$+++ u4407 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Have you no feelings, woman?
L124606 +++$+++ u4407 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Nice lady.
L124605 +++$+++ u4408 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JUDE +++$+++ It was fun while it lasted.
L124604 +++$+++ u4407 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Thought you liked me, bitch.
L124603 +++$+++ u4408 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JUDE +++$+++ See, if we took the hood off, we'd have to shoot you. As it is, you've got a fifty-fifty chance.
L124555 +++$+++ u4407 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Whatever you say, Jude...
L124554 +++$+++ u4408 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JUDE +++$+++ Come and get me, soldier --
L124553 +++$+++ u4408 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JUDE +++$+++ People. They could be looking.
L124552 +++$+++ u4407 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ I never know nothing.
L124551 +++$+++ u4408 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JUDE +++$+++ You never know.
L124550 +++$+++ u4407 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Who gives a fuck.
L124549 +++$+++ u4408 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JUDE +++$+++ Not here.
L124547 +++$+++ u4408 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JUDE +++$+++ Tell me, Jody
L124546 +++$+++ u4407 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ And you know what?
L124545 +++$+++ u4408 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JUDE +++$+++ You didn't?
L124544 +++$+++ u4407 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Never pissed holding a girl's hand, Jude.
L124543 +++$+++ u4408 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JUDE +++$+++ You'd know I wouldn't run off.
L124542 +++$+++ u4407 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ What if I did?
L124541 +++$+++ u4408 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JUDE +++$+++ You don't know me, do you?
L124540 +++$+++ u4407 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Don't run off, Jude.
L124538 +++$+++ u4407 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ No, fuck the bear. The name. Jude. And it's June. Jude in June.
L124537 +++$+++ u4408 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JUDE +++$+++ The teddy bear?
L125582 +++$+++ u4409 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ MAGUIRE +++$+++ Give me the fucking shooter!
L125581 +++$+++ u4408 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JUDE +++$+++ You're crazy --
L125580 +++$+++ u4409 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ MAGUIRE +++$+++ Give me the shooter, Jude --
L125577 +++$+++ u4408 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JUDE +++$+++ No, we are.
L125576 +++$+++ u4409 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ MAGUIRE +++$+++ That fucker's dead --
L125384 +++$+++ u4409 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ MAGUIRE +++$+++ That true, Fergus? You in love?
L125383 +++$+++ u4408 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JUDE +++$+++ Leave him alone, Peter. He's in love.
L124834 +++$+++ u4409 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ MAGUIRE +++$+++ Shut the fuck up, Jude.
L124833 +++$+++ u4408 +++$+++ m292 +++$+++ JUDE +++$+++ You're crazy. Don't let him, Peter.
L126767 +++$+++ u4425 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ TEX +++$+++ First her husband, now her -- she hoodwinked you! She batted all them big eyes and you went 'n fell for it - like a egg from a tall chicken! Here!  You want? Here -- it's yours!
L126766 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L126765 +++$+++ u4425 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ TEX +++$+++ You greenhorn -- you half-witted, thick-skulled, hare-brained, greenhorn! They wuz both too smart for us!
L126764 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ You know what I mean -- the envelope with the stamps. I want it.
L126763 +++$+++ u4425 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ TEX +++$+++ The letter? The letter ain't worth nuthin'.
L126762 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ All right -- where's the letter?
L126690 +++$+++ u4425 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ TEX +++$+++  I'll tell you what, fella -- you want t' find me, you jus' turn 'round -- from now on I'll be right behind you. 
L126689 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Where are you, ol' buddy?
L126688 +++$+++ u4425 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ TEX +++$+++ Now Dyle, you listen to me -- my mama didn't raise no stupid children. I know who's got the money 'n I ain't disappearing till I got my share -- 'n' my share's growin' a whole lot bigger ev'ry day.
L126934 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ What makes you think they're even interested? It's only a quarter of a million -- it'll cost more than that to fix up their bookkeeping. As a taxpayer --
L126933 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Never mind -- I'll go by myself.
L126932 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Reggie -- listen to me --
L126931 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Then say it.
L126930 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I heard you, I heard you.
L126929 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I said, tell me to go to the --
L126928 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ All right, prove it to me -- tell me to go to the Embassy first thing in the morning and turn in those stamps.
L126927 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ What a terrible thing to say. How could you even think that?
L126926 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ The truth, now -- was it my hide -- or the stamps?
L126925 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ And that's all the gratitude I get for saving your hide.
L126924 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I'm sorry I thought you were the murderer, Adam -- how did I know that he was as big a liar as you are?
L126922 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Here, give it to me.
L126921 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ You didn't have to chase me so hard --
L126900 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ There's not a reason on earth why you should.
L126899 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Can I really believe you this time, Adam?
L126898 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Reggie -- trust me once more -- please.
L126897 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ You lied to me so many times --
L126896 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Reggie -- listen to me!
L126893 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Don't be a fool! He's Carson Dyle!
L126892 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ He's -- with the C.I.A. -- I've seen him at the Embassy.
L126881 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ No!
L126880 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Reggie -- please believe me!
L126879 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Then who did? You're the only one left.
L126878 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ But I didn't kill anybody.
L126877 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I'm through listening to you!
L126876 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Reggie -- why won't you listen?
L126848 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Don't be an idiot!
L126847 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ But Tex didn't -- he still thought -- !
L126846 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I'm not Dyle -- you know that!
L126845 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Why? So you can kill me too? Tex is dead, I've seen him! He said Dyle did it!
L126844 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Reggie -- stop!
L126756 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Look.
L126755 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Tex? You mean he's here, too?
L126754 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ It's all right -- I don't think Tex does, either.
L126753 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ It's hopeless -- I don't even know what we're looking for.
L126752 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Stop grousing. If we find the money I'll buy you an international conference all your own. Now start looking. You take this side and I'll poke around over there.
L126751 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.
L126750 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I know, but this is all we've got left.
L126749 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ But Charles' appointment was last week, not --
L126748 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Five o'clock -- Thursday -- the Garden -- it's got to be something around here.
L126747 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Now what?
L126746 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ It's Thursday today -- and it's almost five -- come on!
L126745 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ as outlined in report number three- nine-stroke-five-two of the Western Hemisphere Conference held on March 22 --  no wait! It was last Thursday, five o'clock at the Jardin des Champs- Élysées! Adam -- that was it! The garden!
L126742 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Well -- it was a place -- a street corner, I think. But I don't --  Hold it. I'm on.
L126741 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ There is? Well, I can't say I think very much of a silly law like that. Think, Reggie -- please think -- what was written in Charles' notebook?
L126740 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Of course there is!
L126739 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money.
L126738 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ That money's not ours, Adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
L126737 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Think, Reggie, you've got to think -- it may be what we're looking for.
L126736 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I think it only said where -- but I can't --
L126735 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ With whom? Where?
L126734 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had -- on the day he was killed.
L126733 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Can you remember anything at all?
L126732 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ You're right. I remember Grandpierre looking through it. But there was nothing in it -- at least, nothing that the police thought was very important.
L126729 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Nothing's wrong. I think I found something. I was snooping around Tex's room and I found this in the waste basket. I've stuck it back together.
L126728 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ No, it's all right. What's wrong, Adam?
L126727 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Reggie -- I think I've found --  are you on?
L126720 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ No -- last time I said "I love you, Alex."
L126719 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Yes, you told me.
L126718 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I love you, Adam.
L126717 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Go to bed. You've got to be at work in the morning. There's nothing more we can do tonight.
L126716 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Well, I guess that's it -- dead end.
L126715 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Heroin -- peppermint-flavored heroin.
L126714 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ The tooth powder. Wait a minute -- could you recognize heroin just by tasting it?
L126713 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ It still doesn't make sense, but it isn't worth any quarter of a million either. Have we forgotten anything?
L126710 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ The letter --
L126709 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ To the apartment -- it matches mine perfectly.
L126708 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Electric razor -- comb -- steamship ticket -- fountain pen -- four passports -- toothbrush -- wallet --  key -- what about that?
L126704 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I mean, it's there, Reggie. If only we could see it. We're looking at it right now.
L126703 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Lord, you're stubborn.
L126702 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Let's look anyway.
L126701 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ But everyone and his Aunt Lilian's been through that bag. Somebody would have seen it.
L126699 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I sure am. Get it.
L126698 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Lord, you're stubborn.
L126697 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Where's that airlines bag?
L126696 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --
L126695 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I just heard from him -- he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him -- so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got it.
L126694 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Why?
L126693 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I think we were wrong about Tex having the money.
L126692 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Open up.
L126691 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ What is it?
L126686 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ There's no time -- I'll call you in the morning.
L126685 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Adam --
L126684 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ If the police find him first they're not very likely to turn over a quarter of a million dollars to us, are they?
L126683 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ You're going to look for him -- now?
L126682 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ That wraps it up -- Tex has the money. Go back to bed -- I'll let you know when I've found him.
L126666 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Relax -- you're gaining.
L126665 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I know why you're not taken -- no one can catch up with you.
L126664 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Well -- come on.
L126663 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ When you come on, you really come on.
L126662 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ No. The doctor said it would be bad for my -- thermostat.
L126661 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Aren't you allowed to kiss back?
L126660 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ How do you think I got here?
L126659 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Oh? Did they do that sort of thing way back in your day?
L126658 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Pretty good, huh? I taught them everything they do.
L126657 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out.
L126656 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Why do you think I brought you here?
L126655 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ You don't look so bad in this light.
L126654 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ It's all right -- look.
L126653 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Adam!
L126652 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I'm not hungry -- isn't it glorious?
L126651 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ What's the matter?
L126650 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ It's lovely.
L126649 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ What about it?
L126648 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Oh, you should see your face.
L126647 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Don't you know I'm having a tough time keeping my eyes off of you?
L126646 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ What?
L126645 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.
L126644 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ No -- I guess not.
L126643 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ What would you like me to say -- that a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me than a quarter of a million dollars?
L126642 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Oh!
L126641 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ That's right.
L126640 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ All that marvelous rejection -- you knew I couldn't resist it. Now it turns out you were only interested in the money.
L126639 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ How was I leading you on?
L126638 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Don't you dare to be civil with me! All this time you were leading me on --
L126637 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I think that's what you ordered.

L126632 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Is there a Mrs. Canfield?
L126631 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ It's simple. I like what I do -- I enjoy doing it. There aren't many men who love their work as much as I do. Look around some time.
L126630 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ -- there has to be a darn good reason for living the way you do. I want to know what it is.
L126629 +++$+++ u4411 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Oh, come on!
L126839 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Yes, I'm leaving now -- goodbye.
