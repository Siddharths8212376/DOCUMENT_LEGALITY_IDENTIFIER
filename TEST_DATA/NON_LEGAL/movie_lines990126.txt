L387816 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, Paul, this is so romantic. Ian and Windthorne dueling for the right to Misery's hand. Does Ian win? Oh, don't me. It's Windthorne, right?
L387815 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I'm almost done.
L387814 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yes, Paul.
L387812 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Dome Pear-igg-non it is.
L387811 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I was fooling, silly.  You need a cigarette, because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book, and you just have one, and the match is to light it. And you need one glass of champagne.  Dome Pear-igg-non.
L387810 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You don't know?
L387809 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What things?
L387808 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You'll know very soon. I'm starting the last chapter. And when I finish, I want everything to be perfect. I'll require three things.
L387807 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, Paul. I'm dying. Does she wind up with Ian or Windthorne? You have to tell me.
L387806 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It will.
L387805 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Paul, this will be our legacy.
L387804 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I'm glad you like it.
L387803 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It WAS Windthorne. I knew it--what does that do to her love for Ian?--  --of course, if she hadn't thought Windthorne was murdered she never would have fallen in love with Ian in the first place.  Sorry, it's just that this is so wonderful.
L387801 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Maybe. Are you ready for the next chapter?
L387800 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ This is so exciting. It's Windthorne, her first love, right?
L387799 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Maybe.
L387798 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ The stranger staying at the Inn, is he someone from Misery's past?
L387797 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Three more chapters to go.
L387796 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, Paul. It's beautiful.
L387794 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It's almost done. By dawn we'll be able to give Misery back to the world.
L387793 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ But the time is now. Soon others will come.
L387792 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I know you do. I love you too, Annie.  And you're right. We are meant to be together. And I know we must die. But it must be so that Misery can live. We have the power to give Misery eternal life. We must finish the book.
L387747 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ That's disgusting.
L387746 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Be my guest.
L387745 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--
L387744 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Oh, no reason, you keep me prisoner, you make me burn my book, you drive a sledgehammer into my ankles...
L387743 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Why are you so mean, Mister you'd-be- dead-in-the-snow-if-it-wasn't-for- me?
L387742 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Why, what are you going to do?  Kill me? Take your best shot.
L387741 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Don't talk to me like that.
L387740 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I don't know, it's weird, but a couple of broken bones hasn't done a lot for my creative juices. Get the fuck out of here.
L387739 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Paul, don't you think it's time for you to start writing again? It's been over a week.
L387708 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Why would I run away? I'm a writer, Annie--it's all I am--and I've never written this well--even you said that this is my best, didn't you?
L387707 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Now don't fuss, Paul.
L387703 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about.
L387702 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Paul, my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south.
L387701 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ No, I haven't.
L387700 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You've been out of your room.
L387699 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What?
L387698 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Paul, I know you've been out.
L387689 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It is.
L387688 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true.
L387687 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Why would I want to leave? I like it here.
L387686 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ The book is almost finished. Your legs are getting better. Soon you'll be able to walk. You'll be wanting to leave.
L387685 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Why would you lose me?
L387684 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ When you first came here, I only loved the writer part of Paul Sheldon. But now I know I love the rest of him too. As much as Misery loves Ian.  I know you don't love me--don't say you do--you're a beautiful, brilliant, famous man of the world; and I'm...not a movie star type. You'll never know the fear of losing someone like you if you're someone like me.
L387683 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ The rain... sometimes it gives me the blues.
L387682 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Annie, what is it?
L387679 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I think you're right.
L387678 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Paul, this is positively the best Misery you've ever written.
L387677 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ To Misery.
L387676 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, God, what have I done? I'm so sorry, Paul. I ruined your beautiful toast. Will you ever forgive me? Here, let me pour another one.  Can we pretend this never happened? To Misery?
L387673 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It's perfect.
L387672 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Are you kidding? If anyone ever told me that one day I'd be having a candlelit dinner with Paul Sheldon in my own house, I woulda checked both legs to see which one was being pulled. Will this do?
L387671 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Absolutely. Listen, if you can't find any, it's okay. I just thought it might be nice.
L387670 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You really think so?
L387669 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Well, it certainly says you.
L387668 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years.
L387667 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Did you study decorating, or do you just have a flair?
L387666 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, I don't know. I think so. I'll go look.
L387665 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Wait, let's do this right. Do you have any candles?
L387664 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ To Misery.
L387663 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Yes, to Misery. Let me pour you some more wine.
L387662 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ A toast?
L387661 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Annie, I think we should have a toast.
L387660 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Oh.  You can't get this in a restaurant in New York.
L387659 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef.
L387658 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I've never had meatloaf this good, what do you do to it?
L387657 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh...
L387656 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It looks wonderful. And so do you.
L387655 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I hope you like it.
L387646 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, Paul. It would be an honor.
L387645 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ To celebrate Misery's return. I couldn't have done it without you.
L387641 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I'm going to play my records all day
L387640 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Whenever he played Radio City, who do you think was right there in the front row?
L387639 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Misery's alive! Misery's alive. Oh, it's so romantic--this whole house is going to be filled with romance. I'm going to put on my Liberace records--  --you do like Liberace, don't you?
L387638 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Not even a hint?
L387637 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Have to wait.
L387636 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Will she still love him with that special perfect love?
L387635 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ ...have to wait.
L387634 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, Paul, can I read each chapter when you finish? I can fill in the "n"s.  Will she be her old self, now that Ian has dug her out, or will she have amnesia...?
L387633 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Yeah, yeah...
L387632 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I've known from the very first book that Misery had to be born of nobility and I was right!
L387630 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You better. Oh, Paul, when Ian realized that the reason they'd buried Misery alive was because the bee sting had put her in that temporary coma--
L387629 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Well, is it fair? Should I keep going?
L387628 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Nothing.
L387627 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What?
L387626 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What about a bee...?
L387625 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You said you can make it so they gotta turn the page. You know, "I 'gotta' know will she live," "I 'gotta' know will he catch the killer." "I gotta see how this chapter ends." You said it. I don't usually buy that magazine. I only got it, 'cause they were interviewing you.
L387624 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I said that?
L387623 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ The "gotta." Remember, you talked about it in Playboy magazine. You said there's a million things you can't do in this world; you can't hit a curve ball, you can't fix a leaky faucet or make a marriage work-- but there's one thing you always have, and that's the power of the "gotta."
L387622 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ The what?
L387621 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You can--you have the "gotta"--
L387620 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I'm telling you, I can't.
L387619 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Don't be silly. Of course you can.
L387618 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I can't write this anymore.
L387617 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What's the matter, Paul? You haven't written a word.
L387615 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ But not you. Not with my Misery. Remember, Ian did ride for Dr. Cleary at the end of the last book, but his horse fell jumping that fence and Ian broke his shoulder and his ribs and lay there all night in the ditch so he never reached the doctor, so there couldn't have been any "experimental blood transfusion" that saved her life. Misery was buried in the ground at the end, Paul, so you'll have to start there.
L387614 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ They always cheated like that in cliff--  --chapter plays.
L387613 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ "HE DIDN'T GET OUT OF THE COCKADOODIE CAR!"
L387612 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I know that, Mister Man--they also call them serials. I'm not stupid, you know.  Anyway, my favorite was Rocket Man, and once it was a no-brakes chapter, the bad guys stuck him in a car on a mountain road and knocked him out and welded the doors shut and tore out the brakes and started him to his death and he woke up and tried to steer and tried to get out, but the car went off a cliff before he could escape and it crashed and burned and--I was so upset and excited and the next week you better believe I was first in line and they always start with the end of the last week and there was Rocket Man trying to get out, and here came the cliff and JUST BEFORE the car went off he jumped free and all the kids cheered--  --but I didn't cheer, I stood right up and started shouting, "This isn't what happened last week--have you all got amnesia?--THEY JUST CHEATED US--THIS WASN'T FAIR--"
L387611 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ --cliff-hangers--
L387610 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ That's right--when I was growing up in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays...
L387609 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ --not fair?
L387608 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Paul, what you've written just isn't fair.
L387607 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I really value your criticism, but maybe you're being a little hasty here.
L387606 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Paul, it's not worthy of you. Throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me. You can leave that in.
L387605 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What? What happened to "I'll treasure whatever you do?"
L387604 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I'm sorry, Paul. This is all wrong, you'll have to do it over again.
L387594 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Don't be silly. You'll be brilliant. Think of me as your inspiration.
L387593 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too much.
L387592 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Here, in case you think of any ideas.
L387586 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I want my pain to go 'way, Annie-- make it go 'way, please Annie--  --please...
L387585 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It'll only take a second.
L387584 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I want my pills NOW!
L387583 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Poor dear... Let's get you back in bed and I'll get them for you.
L387582 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You know goddamn well what I've been doing--I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE SUFFERING. I need my pills.
L387581 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Paul, you're dripping with perspiration, your color is very hectic--what have you been doing?
L387572 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What's the matter? I'll tell you what's the matter. I go out of my way for you. I do everything to try and make you happy. I feed you, I clean you, I dress you. And what thanks do I get? "You bought the wrong paper, Annie. I can't write on this paper, Annie." Well, I'll get your stupid paper, but you just better start showing me a little more appreciation around here, Mister Man.
L387571 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Annie, what's the matter?
L387570 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Are you sure? 'Cause if you want, I'll bring back the whole store for you.
L387569 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ No, just the paper will be fine.
L387568 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Thank you for thinking of me.  Anything else I can get while I'm in town? Any other crucial requirements that need satisfying? Would you like a tiny tape recorder? Or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers?
L387567 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I thought you'd be interested. I'd like you to be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it's written.
L387566 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, it does smudge after all--isn't that fascinating?
L387565 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ C'mere, I'll show you.
L387564 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.
L387563 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You did great, except there's just one little thing--I can't work with this paper. It's Corrasable Bond, it smudges. Maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white, long-grained mimeo.
L387562 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You--fooler...!  Did I do good?
L387561 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ It's two of the letters in my favorite nurse's name, Annie.
L387560 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ And I got a great deal on this fifty- pound clunker--on account of it's missing an "n." I told the saleslady "n" was one of the letters in my favorite writer's name.
L387558 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Great.
L387557 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Don't worry about that. You'll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work.
L387556 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I guess you don't get bothered by neighbors much.
L387553 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You do understand that this isn't the ordinary way books get written-- I mean, some people might actually consider this an oddball situation.
L387552 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.
L387551 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You just expect me to whip something off, that it?
L387550 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yes. It will be a book in my honor. For saving your life and nursing you back to health. I'll be the first one to read it.  Oh, Paul, you're going to make me the envy of the whole world...
L387549 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I know you didn't mean it when you killed her, and now you'll make it right.
L387548 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Misery's Return?
L387547 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, but Paul!  I don't think, I know! Now that you've gotten rid of that nasty manuscript, you can go back to doing what you're great at--  --you're going to write a new novel-- your greatest achievement ever-- Misery's Return.
L387546 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Work? You mean write? What in the world do you think I'd write?
L387545 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ That's the big surprise. Your new studio--after all, writers do need a place to work.
L387544 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Set what up?
L387543 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Now don't josh. This is a very big day for you, Paul. Here. You just sit tight, and I'll set everything up.
L387542 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ If I knew this was gonna be the surprise, you could've gotten me to burn all my books.
L387541 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now.
L387540 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
L387539 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ See, isn't this nice?
L387538 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Great.
L387537 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's your Novril.  How does tuna casserole sound for dinner?
L387536 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I don't know.
L387535 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year. People say it has something to do with the ozone layer. What do you think?
L387525 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ As long as it does exist, your mind won't ever be free. I think you should light the match, Paul.
L387524 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You're right. You're right. I don't know what I was thinking. I'll tell you what. It doesn't have to be published. Nobody ever has to see it. I'll just keep it for myself. No one will ever have to know it exists.
L387523 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, Paul. This isn't about money. It's about decency and purity. It's about God's values.
L387522 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You know, Annie, this book never would have survived without you. When it gets to new York, there will be a big auction, and whatever it brings we can split.  God knows you're entitled to it.
L387521 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I know this is the only copy, Paul. When you were twenty-four you wrote your first book and you didn't make a copy, because you didn't think anybody would take it seriously. But they did. And ever since you've never made any copies because you're superstitious--it's why you always come back to the Silver Creek Lodge. You told that story to Merv Griffin eleven years ago.
L387520 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ So you've indicated. Do it.
L387519 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ No big deal.
L387518 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Then light the match, Paul.
L387517 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ This isn't difficult, my agent's made dozens of copies. There's gonna be an auction on this, and every publishing house in New York is reading it now. So if you want me to burn it, fine. You're not ridding the world of anything.
L387516 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best.
L387515 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You want me to burn my book?
L387514 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yes.
L387513 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You want me to burn my book?
L387510 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yes.
L387509 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Show me the way?
L387508 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ But this time I thought clearly. I asked God about you and God said "I delivered him unto you so that you may show him the way."
L387507 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I'll get you everything you want, but you must listen first. Sometimes my thinking is a little muddy, I accept that. It's why I couldn't remember all those things they were asking me on the witness stand in Denver.
L387506 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise?
L387505 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do.
L387504 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Perfect.
L387503 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What are you doing on the floor?  It's my fault. If I'd had a proper hospital bed, this never would have happened. Here, let me help you back in.  I know this hurts, but it'll only take a few seconds. There you go. Comfy?
L387498 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ She slipped away? She slipped away? She didn't just slip away. You did it. You did it. You did it. You did it. You murdered my Misery.
L387497 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ No one--she just died--she slipped away, that's all.
L387496 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Then who did?
L387495 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I DIDN'T...
L387494 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER! And you MURDERED her!
L387493 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and Misery's spirit is still alive--
L387492 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You...you dirty bird. She can't be dead. Misery Chastain cannot be dead! How could you?
L387491 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Of course I'll like it. Misery's about to have her child. What's it gonna be, a boy or a girl? Ooh, don't tell me.
L387490 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Well, I hope you like it.
L387489 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I'd love to stay here and chat, but I'm right at the end and I gotta find out what happens.
L387488 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It boils down to respect. People just don't respect the institution of marriage any more. They have no sense of real commitment.
L387487 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Well, it's not something you should enter into lightly.
L387486 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Don't get me wrong. I'm not against marriage per se. But it would take a pretty special guy to make me want to go down the aisle again.
L387485 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ No problem.
L387484 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Yeah, thanks.
L387483 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Done?
L387482 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I'm...
L387481 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I just kept reading them over and over. I know when I finish this one-- and I've only got two chapters to go-- I'll just turn right to the front page and start reading it again.
L387479 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I don't know about you, but what I did to get through it was I dove into work--days, nights--night shifts can be lonely at a hospital. I did a lot of reading. That was hen I first discovered Misery. She made me so happy. She made me forget all my problems.  'Course, I suppose you had a little something to do with that too.
L387478 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I know how that can be.
L387477 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ For a while I thought I might go crazy.
L387474 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah, that and Misery's Child--those are the only two divine things ever in this world...
L387473 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ The Sistine Chapel?
L387472 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I'm on page three-hundred now, Paul, and it's better than perfect--it's divine. What's the ceiling that dago painted?
L387471 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ She's a fine... uh... pig is what she is...
L387470 +++$+++ u6612 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ This farm was getting kind of dreary, what with just the few cows and chickens and me--  But when I got Misery here, everything Changed--she just makes me smile so.
L387469 +++$+++ u6615 +++$+++ m441 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I'm getting to believe you.
