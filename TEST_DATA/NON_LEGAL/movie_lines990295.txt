L506850 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ You're welcome a million, Marty. Stick 'em in the bushes for now.
L506849 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
L506848 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ A tracer. You'll like it.
L506847 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ What is it?
L506846 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ Save this one for last.
L506845 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Yeah... sure.
L506844 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ One of the reasons I love you, Marty, is that you're almost as crazy as I am. Please don't set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay? Just bright colors. Can you tell the difference?
L506843 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Yeah, I know. It's great!
L506842 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ Stay near the house, for Christ's sake- someone's killing people. I have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know.
L506840 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Yeah! What is it?
L506839 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ Now I said I had something for you, as I believe you will recall.
L506834 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ Good.
L506833 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Sure.
L506832 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?
L506831 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ I don't get you.
L506830 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.
L506829 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
L506828 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm dying. I hope you're happy, because you are looking at a dying man.
L506827 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ We're gonna find out. Take it down the road a ways and back. Be careful.
L506826 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Do I need one?
L506825 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ You got a pilot's license, Marty?
L506822 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ Wait, dear boy. Just wait. Hand me those pliars.
L506821 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ What?
L506820 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ Yeah, Winesburg, Ohio, was never like that... but I got something that just might cheer you up.
L506818 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ Uh-huh. Only in her case I guess it would be Queen Shit of Turd Mountain. Hand me that adjustable.
L506817 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.
L506816 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ Your mom's not around, is she?
L506814 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ But you are, you know- you are my dear boy.
L506813 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Don't call me dear boy.
L506812 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ I'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that.
L506811 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.
L506810 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ It's just an outward symbol of everything that's inwardly wrong in this town. Not bad, huh? I read Sherwood Anderson in college. I can jive that shit all day.
L506809 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Yeah, okay, the fireworks. Jane thinks that's all I'm mad about, but it's not. Them doing that is just a... a...
L506808 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ And the fireworks. Hand me that box, Marty.
L506807 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ It isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed Brady. Now he's got them to cancel the fair.
L506739 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ A bunch of men getting ready to pretend they're Clint Eastwood... Marty, didn't anybody ever tell you that the only monsters are in comic books and drive-in movies?
L506738 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ What's going on at Owen's, Uncle Al?
L506737 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ What if it's some kind of monster?
L506736 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ Huh?
L506735 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?
L506734 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy.
L506733 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ No.
L506732 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ There's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You ever hear that one?
L506731 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Yeah.
L506730 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ You all right, Marty?
L506680 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ Let the boy finish the game, Nan.
L506679 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Mom-!
L506677 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ Piss on him. Piss on all the Red Sox.
L506676 +++$+++ u7621 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ MARTY +++$+++ Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
L506675 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager! Stone the crows!
L506977 +++$+++ u7622 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ NAN +++$+++ I will- be good, kids.
L506976 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ If you keep doing that, you're going to bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama- tell her I'll see her Thursday.
L506975 +++$+++ u7622 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ NAN +++$+++ You kids go to bed on time! You've got school tomorrow!
L506974 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ We won't!
L506973 +++$+++ u7622 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ NAN +++$+++ And don't open the door for any trick or treaters even if they come!
L506972 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ -and Babcock, I remember. Now go on!
L506971 +++$+++ u7622 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ NAN +++$+++ Remember, Al... we'll be at the Ritz-Carlton in Boston tomorrow night! Or at the funeral parlor. It's Stickney and-
L506837 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ See me around to my car, Marty, and make sure I stay out of trouble at least that long.
L506836 +++$+++ u7622 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ NAN +++$+++ So have I, actually... I wish it could always be like this.
L506686 +++$+++ u7622 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ NAN +++$+++ Yes... you've always been that to him. But if you can't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away.
L506685 +++$+++ u7624 +++$+++ m515 +++$+++ UNCLE AL +++$+++ I come here because Marty needs a friend.
L508652 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Really?
L508651 +++$+++ u7625 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ BISHOP O'HARA +++$+++ I must tell the Cardinal.  I.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.
L508650 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Perhaps.
L508649 +++$+++ u7625 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ BISHOP O'HARA +++$+++ I can't wait until next Sunday, when the choir performs again.  Did you see the people walk right in from the street? That music, that heavenly music -- it called to them.
L508648 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Well... thank you.
L508647 +++$+++ u7625 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ BISHOP O'HARA +++$+++ I haven't enjoyed Mass this much in years.  What a marvelous program. Innovative.  Inspiring.  You are to be commended.
L508646 +++$+++ u7637 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MOTHER SUPERIOR +++$+++ Oh?
L508645 +++$+++ u7625 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ BISHOP O'HARA +++$+++ Reverend Mother, I just wanted to congratulate you.
L508352 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ I said I was a nun, not an asshole.
L508351 +++$+++ u7626 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHARLENE +++$+++ What about crack?  You a user?
L508350 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Okay, so maybe I'm a nun -- so, you want to ask me something?  You want to listen, for once in your little lives? You want to pay some attention?
L508346 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Yeah, you learned a whole lot, I can tell.
L508345 +++$+++ u7626 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHARLENE +++$+++ Yeah.  We all got caught.  Shoplifting. Cuttin' school.  Cuttin' up some bitch with a blade.  So we gotta come here.  So we'll be good, in the future.  So we'll learn valuable lessons.  And I learned mine.  I will be incredibly good, I will never rip out nobody's nose-ring by accident ever again.  Can I go now?
L508339 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Well... yes.  Yes it is.
L508338 +++$+++ u7626 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHARLENE +++$+++ Yeah.  Sister Mary Pat was discussing it.  You know she thinks it's a sin.
L508337 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Really.
L509092 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ YES I'LL SING AND KNOW JOY EVERMORE
L509091 +++$+++ u7627 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHOIR +++$+++ SING!
L509090 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ And I'm tearful!
L509089 +++$+++ u7627 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHOIR +++$+++ SING!
L509088 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ But I'm fearful!
L509087 +++$+++ u7627 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHOIR +++$+++ SING! SING AND YOUR SPIRIT WILL SOAR!
L509086 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Were you tempted?
L509085 +++$+++ u7627 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHOIR +++$+++ SING!
L508735 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ HE'S SO FINE...
L508734 +++$+++ u7627 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHOIR +++$+++ Yes, Mary?
L508733 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ He's... dreamy.  He's...
L508633 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ I think they hear you!
L508632 +++$+++ u7627 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHOIR +++$+++ LET THY SPIRIT
L508631 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ You know what we're saying!
L508630 +++$+++ u7627 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHOIR +++$+++ LET THY SPIRIT
L508624 +++$+++ u7627 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHOIR +++$+++ LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
L508623 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ You know, I just might!
L508622 +++$+++ u7627 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHOIR +++$+++ LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
L508621 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ I think I hear it!
L508620 +++$+++ u7627 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHOIR +++$+++ BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH
L508619 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ But how?
L508618 +++$+++ u7627 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHOIR +++$+++ LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
L508617 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ What you say?
L508616 +++$+++ u7627 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHOIR +++$+++ LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
L508458 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ You know it.
L508457 +++$+++ u7631 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ LAWANDA +++$+++ Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?
L508456 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ How are you doing.
L508360 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Just tell him, I do love you, but I can't -- I'm a nun.
L508359 +++$+++ u7631 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ LAWANDA +++$+++ What you do?
L508358 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Hey, I know, it's hard.  But do what I do.
L508357 +++$+++ u7631 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ LAWANDA +++$+++ No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
L508356 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ And you listen to that?
L508355 +++$+++ u7631 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ LAWANDA +++$+++ Well, what about the sex stuff?  What if some dude is after you, and he's always saying stuff, commin' on sweet and mellow.  Like, oh, baby, you know you'll love it.  Oh, baby, if you loved me, you'd stay.
L508344 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Probation?
L508343 +++$+++ u7631 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ LAWANDA +++$+++ 'Cause we love it so damn much.  And cause we gotta come here.  Probation.
L508342 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Excuse me -- just what are you all doing here?  At Sunday School?
L508341 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Well... because it's in the Bible. "Thou shalt not..."  Thou shalt not.
L508340 +++$+++ u7631 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ LAWANDA +++$+++ How come?  Sister?
L508336 +++$+++ u7631 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ LAWANDA +++$+++ We were talking about the wild thing. Teen promiscuity.
L508335 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ So, hi there.  I'm... Sister Mary Clarence.  And you're... young Christians.  I guess I should assign you this passage.  What's good?  What were you talking about?
L508989 +++$+++ u7630 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ That... thing.  That nun thing.  Take it off.
L508988 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ What?
L508987 +++$+++ u7630 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Okay, Christy -- strip.
L508877 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ You can handle this.
L508876 +++$+++ u7630 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ What?
L508875 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what we talked about?  Experience?
L508874 +++$+++ u7630 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Yeah, right to the cops.  No way.
L508047 +++$+++ u7630 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ With love.
L508046 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ His ashes?
L508044 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Then stop trying to memorize it.  Hit the road.
L508043 +++$+++ u7630 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.
L508042 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ What do you want?  This is a private area!  Get lost!
L509055 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ That used to be true, Vince.  I was with you.  But something happened.  And I'm different now.  Real--different.  I've had, well, you might call it -- a religious experience.  And I've got just two words for you.  And those two words are...
L509054 +++$+++ u7641 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ I was good to you! You re nothing but no-talent garbage! You're a two-bit Tramp!
L509032 +++$+++ u7641 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ Joey -- do it.
L509031 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Right here.  Let the others go -- they have nothing to do with this.
L508940 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ I feel sorry for you, Vincent.  And I forgive you.
L508939 +++$+++ u7641 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ She's afraid.  Come on, tell the boys you're afraid.
L508931 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ I am sorry for all my sins.  And yours.
L508930 +++$+++ u7641 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ What, Vincent?  This is me, doll.  I know you.  What did you think you were doing?  Running to the cops.  Hiding out. No, no.  You're sorry now, aren't you?
L508929 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Good evening, Vincent.
L508928 +++$+++ u7641 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ Babe, what happened here?  Look at you.
L508096 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Right.  Yeah.  Forgotten.
L508095 +++$+++ u7641 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ And to say you're sorry.  About this afternoon.  And the things you said. Forgotten.  Completely.  Do you understand?  Forgotten.
L508094 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Sure.
L508093 +++$+++ u7641 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ Is that why you came up here, Christy? To thank me?
L508092 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Thanks.  A lot.
L508091 +++$+++ u7641 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ Yes?
L508090 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ No... it's fine.
L508017 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ You lying sleazeball!  The best years of my life!  What am I, garbage?  Am I lint?
L508016 +++$+++ u7641 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ Babe, it's not me!  I love you!  It's God!
L508015 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ You pig!
L508014 +++$+++ u7641 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ We can still see each other.  Just like always.  It's a different kind of sin. Smaller.
L508013 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ You bastard!
L508012 +++$+++ u7641 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ You want me to go against a priest?  Get excommunicated?  You think I'm nuts?
L508011 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ What? 
L508010 +++$+++ u7641 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ He said that if I got a divorce I'd burn in Hell.  For all eternity.
L508009 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ You said that?  And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her?  Did he say we'd be happy?
L508008 +++$+++ u7641 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ For the first time in I don't know how long.  I wanted everything done right. Open and above board.  I told Father Antonelli I was in love.  I told him it was a special love, for all the ages.
L508007 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ You did what?
L508006 +++$+++ u7641 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ I want us to be together.  Like people. Honest, decent people.  In the eyes of God.  Babe, today... I went to confession.
L508005 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Today was the deadline, Vince.
L508004 +++$+++ u7641 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ How did I get so lucky?  What is it now, five years we've been together?  Who do I thank?
L508003 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Vince...
L508002 +++$+++ u7641 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ You are so damn sexy.
L508001 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Who?  The other woman.  Your wife.
L508000 +++$+++ u7641 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ VINCE +++$+++ What did who say?
L507999 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Come on -- stay.  Just a little.  We can talk, I'll get a pizza.  Pizza in bed, we'll have fun.  And you still haven't told me what happened.  What did she say?
L508037 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ WISH HE WAS MINE.  THAT HANDSOME BOY OVER THERE, THE ONE WITH THE WAVY HAIR.
L508036 +++$+++ u7639 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ RONELLES +++$+++ D00-LANG, DOO-LANG, D00-LANG.
L508035 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ HE'S SO FINE.
L508034 +++$+++ u7639 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ RONELLES +++$+++ Yes, Betty?
L508033 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ He's so dreamy.  He's like... a Greek god.  He's the cutest guy here.    He's boss.  He's fab.  He's...
L508032 +++$+++ u7639 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ RONELLES +++$+++ Oh my! 
L508031 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ Look at that.  Get a gander.

L508675 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ And we know that, even though most people would call you a leech and a parasite, the lowest slug of humanity! We know that deep down inside, you're probably even worse.  And so you truly need our prayers.

L508604 +++$+++ u7628 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ CHRISTY +++$+++ So use it.  When we sing hymns, they're usually about rejoicing, right? Celebration.  Most music is.  So don't hold back.  Let all that joy go right into your voice.  Make me happy.  Let me hear it.  Perk out.  Perk down.
L508603 +++$+++ u7633 +++$+++ m516 +++$+++ MARY PATRICK +++$+++ All right, I am, I know it!  All my life, I've just been... upbeat. Optimistic.  Perky.  I can't help it. Even when I was little, I remember my mother used to say, "That child is pure sunshine.  She'll either be a nun -- or a stewardess."
