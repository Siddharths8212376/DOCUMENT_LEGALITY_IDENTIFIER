L246499 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I'm not going to hurt anyone.
L246498 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ Good.  That is what I hope.  I did not think you a bugger too.  I fear only that you might hurt him if he tries.
L246497 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ No!
L246496 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ You and he are not doing things?
L246495 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Well...no, not really --
L246494 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ You did not know?
L246493 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ You're telling me Mr. Whale is a homo.
L246492 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ That is why he must go to hell.  I do not think it fair.  But God's law is not for us to judge.
L246491 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ Yes!  You know?
L246490 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ A homo?
L246489 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ What is the good English?  All I know is bugger.  He is a bugger. Men who bugger each other.
L246488 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ No.  His is the worse.  The unspeakable.  The deed no man can name without shame?
L246487 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Sins of the flesh?  Everybody has those.
L246486 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ This is what the priests tell me. His sins of the flesh will keep him from heaven.
L246485 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ You're sure of that?
L246484 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ No.  I have children, grandchildren too.  I visit when I can.  But now that Mr. Jimmy cannot be left very long, I do not get away much.  Poor Mr. Jimmy.  There is much good in him, but he will suffer the fires of hell.  Very sad.
L246483 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Then you're as single as I am.
L246482 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ He is dead now, twenty years.
L246481 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Yeah?  What's your husband do?
L246480 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ Of course.  I am married still.
L246479 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ You ever been married, Hanna?
L246477 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ You proposing what I think you're proposing?  Don't you think I'm a little young for you?
L246476 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ A man who is not married has nothing.  He is a man of trouble. You need a woman.
L246475 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Oh, I don't know.  Because no girl in her right mind will have me?
L246474 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ Why?
L246473 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I'm not married.
L246472 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ Your wife?
L246471 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ You mean family?  All in Joplin, Missouri.
L246470 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ No.  We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I.  People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim.  You have people, Boone?
L246469 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go?  Movie stars?
L246468 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ Long enough.  Fifteen years.
L246467 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ How long you worked for Mr. Whale?
L246466 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ That's okay, Hanna.  I'm more comfortable in here.  It is Hanna, isn't it?
L246465 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ No.  You are a guest now.  You go in the living room.
L246464 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Tea is fine.
L246463 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ The Master is dressing.  I am to offer you a drink.  There is whiskey and there is iced tea.
L246462 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ Expect nothing fancy.
L246461 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Got a lawn this afternoon, but I'm free until then.
L246460 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ The Master wants to know if you are free for lunch.  I tell him you will be having other plans, but he insists I ask.
L246459 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Something I can do for you?
L246263 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ You do that.
L246262 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ No.  No.  I am sorry.  Forget everything I say.  Here.  I will take the tray.
L246261 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Gimme a break.  I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures.  Is that going to hurt him?
L246260 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ You will not hurt him?
L246259 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Yeah, I'm a good man.  Something make you think I'm not?
L246258 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ What kind of man are you?  Are you a good man?
L246257 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ What're you talking about?
L246256 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.
L246255 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ It's your job, lady, not mine.  I'm here so he can draw my picture.
L246253 +++$+++ u5568 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ HANNA +++$+++ The Master is waiting for you.
L246252 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Don't worry, you already paid me. I'm here because --
L246961 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow...
L246960 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ You'll feel better tomorrow.
L246959 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ When you die...be sure your brain is the last organ to fizzle --
L246958 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ All right.
L246957 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ I can undress myself, thank you.
L246954 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Pray you, undo this button.
L246953 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Need some help?
L246952 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Nothing I didn't deserve.
L246951 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Did I hurt you?
L246950 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Oh Clayton.
L246949 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ You okay?
L246940 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ No, I don't want to die alone.  But to be killed by you -- that would make death bearable.  They say you never see the one with your name on it.  But I want to see death coming at me.  I want it to be sharp and hard, with a human face.  Your face.  Think, Clayton.  You'd be my second Monster.  Almost as famous as the first.  It would be the great adventure you've yearned for. A war story for both of us to share.
L246939 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Look, if you want to die do it yourself!
L246937 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ You're crazy.
L246936 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Break my neck.  Or strangle me.  It would be oh so easy to wrap your hands around my neck and choke the life out of me.  Please, Clayton. We've come this far.
L246933 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Oh, but you have.  You undressed for me.  I kissed you.  I even touched your prick.  How will you be able to live with yourself?
L246932 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I haven't done a damn thing with you!
L246931 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Wait until I tell my friends I had you naked in my arms.  Won't they be surprised?
L246929 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Oh, but you feel good, Clayton.
L246928 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I'm not that way.  Get it through your fucking head.  I don't want to mess with you.
L246922 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Relax, Clayton.  I can't hear you. I can't hear a word.
L246921 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Just take off the fucking mask!
L246916 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ It's too tight.
L246915 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ What was that?
L246914 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ All right.  Let's take it off now.
L246911 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ There are straps in back.
L246910 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ It's from the first World War, isn't it?
L246909 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Please, Clayton.  Just for a minute.  Long enough for me to see the effect.
L246908 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I don't know.
L246907 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ For the artistic effect.  The combination of your human body and that inhuman mask.  It's quite striking.
L246906 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Why?
L246904 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Don't move.
L246903 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ What did you expect?  Bronze?
L246902 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ You are much too human.
L246901 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ What won't do?
L246900 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ No.  It won't do.
L246899 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ What'd you say?
L246898 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ So it is going to happen after all.
L246895 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Oh no, my friend.  It's digging itself up.  There is nothing in the here and now to take my mind off it.  All my diversions have abandoned me.  Parties.  Reading. Painting.  Work.  Love.  All gone to me now.
L246894 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ You survived it.  It can't hurt you now.  It's no good to dig it up.
L246893 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling? Grave where thy victory?
L246887 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Your friend?
L246886 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Barnett.  Barnett on the wire.
L246885 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ You're planning a trip?
L246884 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Oh, but it does.  Especially in light of the journey I'm about to make.
L246883 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ But that was so long ago.  It can't still bother you.
L246882 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ I don't recall.  Memories of the war, perhaps.
L246881 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I said it must be weird seeing your monsters again, and you said, "The only monsters are here."  I was wondering which here you meant.
L246880 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ James Whale.  This afternoon at the party.
L246879 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ I don't remember that one.
L246878 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ That's from your movie, right? "The only monsters are here."
L246877 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ "A perfect night for mystery and horror.  The air itself is filled with monsters."
L246876 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Storm's getting worse.
L246875 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Not at all.
L246874 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Do you mind?
L246873 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ That's where you're wrong, Clayton. You've just told one.  A very good story indeed.
L246872 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Them's the breaks, right?  No war stories for this pup.
L246871 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ I'm very sorry.
L246870 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ You know what he did when I called him?  He laughed.  He laughed so hard he practically burst a blood vessel.  Said it was a good lesson for me.  Not to try to fill his shoes.
L246868 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I didn't have the guts for it.
L246867 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ What happened?
L246866 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I figured he'd think, you know -- it was the next best thing.  Hey, I loved it too.  A chance to be a part of something important. Something bigger than yourself.
L246865 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Is that why you joined the Marines? For your father's sake?
L246864 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ The morning after Pearl Harbor, he drove down to St. Louis to reenlist.  He was so damn excited. World War II was going to be his second chance.  They told him he was too old...fat ...nearsighted.  Said he'd be more use to his country if he stayed home and looked after his family.
L246863 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ That's not the way he saw it.  To him, it was like his life never got started.  Nothing else really mattered.  Definitely not his family.
L246862 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ A very lucky thing indeed.
L246861 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over.  He missed out.
L246860 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ The Great War?
L246859 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ My old man was a Marine.  He enlisted the day he turned seventeen.
L246858 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ I see.
L246857 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ -- that I was a Marine.  Which is true.  You filled in the rest.
L246856 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ But you said --
L246855 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I never made it to Korea.
L246853 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Come now.  I'm sure you came across such situations in Korea.  A wounded comrade, or perhaps one of the enemy?  Someone for whom death would be a blessing.
L246852 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Never gave it much thought.
L246851 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Tell me something, Clayton.  Do you believe in mercy killing?
L246850 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Why not?  Give us something to do while we wait.
L246849 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ I'd like to try again.  If you're game.
L246848 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I thought you'd given up on my picture.
L246847 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ After dinner, if Hanna isn't back? Can we try a few more sketches?
L246845 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ The only memento I ever kept.  My original sketch for the Monster.
L246844 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Is that --?
L246843 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Very sporting of you, Clayton.
L246842 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Do I have any other choice?
L246841 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Sorry.  My pajamas are tailored. Would it be too distressing to continue with the towel?  No more immodest than a kilt, you know.
L246840 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ You don't have any baggy shorts? Pajama bottoms?
L246839 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ That only leaves the rest.
L246835 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ No.  Definitely not.
L246834 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ You're much wider than I am.  You won't want to attempt to get into my pants.
L246833 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.  I believe I promised you some clothes.
L246832 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Ten minutes ago.  Didn't you hear me calling?
L246831 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Oh, of course.  Clayton.  You finished your shower already?
L246824 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Good.  Let's get dry.
L246823 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?
L246822 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Just a night out.  Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter.
L246821 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ It's not like her.
L246815 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Catch my death.
L246814 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I better get you home before you catch your death from pneumonia.
L246813 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ We're not sugar.  We won't melt.
L246812 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ You don't want to wait it out? Rain should let up soon.
L246811 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Let's get out of this funk hole
L246808 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Can't you see?  It's raining!
L246807 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Run for what?
L246806 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Oh fuck.  And we left the top down. You want to run for it?
L246805 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Monsters?  The only monsters...  ...are here.
L246804 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Must have been funny for you. Seeing your monsters again.
L246803 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Neither of us really belongs here.
L246802 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Actually, no.  I feel a little out of place.
L246801 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Are you enjoying yourself?
L246735 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ David produced her last picture.
L246734 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Is that really her?
L246733 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Girl?  Oh.  Elizabeth Taylor.
L246732 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ No.  The girl.
L246731 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ David.  The friend I thought was in New York.
L246730 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Who's that?
L246729 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Nothing of importance.  Just two old men slapping each other with lilies.  Shall we have a drink?
L246728 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ What was that about?
L246707 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Exactly.  Cukor was too cheap to hire music.  There's nothing but chin-wag.  The cold dreary custard of English chin-wag.
L246706 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I don't hear anything.
L246705 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ What did I tell you?  Listen.
L246702 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Nothing would please me more.
L246701 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ If that's okay?
L246700 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ I suppose you'd like the top down.
L246698 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Do I look okay?
L246697 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Good afternoon, Clayton.
L246675 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Clayton is fine.
L246674 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Very good, Clayton.  May I call you Clayton?  Or do you prefer Boone?
L246673 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I'm game.  Sure.
L246672 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ If you don't mind driving, I'd like to take you as my guest.  There should be lots of pretty starlets to keep you amused.
L246670 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ You don't want me to sit for you anymore?
L246669 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ It was foolishness to attempt this portrait.  You cannot force what will not flow.
L246668 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ No harm done.
L246667 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ My apologies.  I had no business snapping at you.
L246663 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ I want -- I want...
L246662 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I don't get it.  First you creep me out with homo shit.  Then you hit me with war stories.  And now you're upset because I listen? What do you want?
L246661 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Just go.  Please.  Why don't you go?
L246658 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Of course I remember.  Do you think I'm so senile --
L246657 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ You asked me to model.  Remember?
L246656 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ You're very clever, Mr. Boone.  You just sit there and let me talk. What a sorry old man, you're thinking.  What a crazy old poof.  Why are you here?  What do you want from me?
L246655 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ You're the one who started it.
L246654 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Why do I tell you this?  I never told David.  I never even remembered it until you got me going.
L246653 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I didn't --
L246652 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ You will not set me on another walk down memory lane.  Not this lane. Not today.
L246648 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Something happened to him?
L246647 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Barnett.  Was that his name? Leonard Barnett.  He came to the front straight from Harrow.  And he looked up to me.  Unlike the others, he didn't care that I was a workingman impersonating his betters.  How strange, to be admired so blindly.  I suppose he loved me.  But chastely, like a schoolboy.
L246645 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ No, my dear.  The Crimean War. What do you think?  The Great War. You had a Good War, while we had --
L246644 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ This was World War I?
L246643 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ I was an officer.
L246642 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ You were a soldier?
