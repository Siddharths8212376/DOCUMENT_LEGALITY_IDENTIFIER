L118746 +++$+++ u668 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Oh, he never... well...  he's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot. He goes up there all the time.
L118745 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Does he always leave so early?
L118744 +++$+++ u668 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.
L118743 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ When will he be back?
L118742 +++$+++ u668 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.
L118741 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Where is Rick?
L118740 +++$+++ u668 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Yes, ma'am.
L118739 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Some of the old songs, Sam.
L118738 +++$+++ u668 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
L118737 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ It's been a long time.
L118736 +++$+++ u668 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Hello, Miss Ilsa. I never expected to see you again.
L118735 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Hello, Sam.
L119477 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Yes, I'm ready.  Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.
L119476 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Are you ready Ilsa?
L119258 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Of course, I'll be careful.
L119257 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Be careful.
L119254 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ -- You don't even have to say it. I'll believe. Goodnight, dear.
L119253 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Yes, Yes I know. Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I, that --
L119252 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ I love you very much, my dear.
L119251 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ No, Victor, there isn't.
L119250 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ I know how it is to be lonely.  Is there anything you wish to tell me?
L119249 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Yes, Victor, I was.
L119248 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ When I was in the concentration camp, were you lonely in Paris?
L119247 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ -- Yes?
L119246 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Ilsa, I --
L119244 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I don't know why he said that.
L119243 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Ask me?
L119242 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ He suggested I ask you.
L119241 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Did he give any reason?
L119240 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ But no intention of selling them. One would think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him, money would.
L119239 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Yes?
L119238 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Apparently he has the letters.
L119237 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?
L119236 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ To tell you the truth, I am frightened too. Shall I remain here in our hotel room hiding, or shall I carry on the best I can?
L119235 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Don't joke. After Major Strasser's warning tonight, I am frightened.
L119234 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ I must. Besides, it isn't often that a man has a chance to display heroics before his wife.
L119233 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
L119232 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Our faithful friend is still there.
L119231 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ We'll discuss it later.
L119230 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ What happened with Rick?
L119148 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ And as far away from Major Strasser as possible.
L119147 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ He does. Could we have a table close to him?
L119027 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ I meant to, but something always held me up. I love you very much, Ilsa.
L119026 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Yes, I see. When I had trouble getting out of Lille, why didn't you leave me there? And when I was sick in Marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the time, why didn't you leave me then?
L119025 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Yes, I would.
L119024 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it?
L119023 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ No, Ilsa, I won't let you stay here. You must get to America. And believe me, somehow I will get out and join you.
L119021 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ No, Victor, no.
L119020 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
L119019 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ We are only interested in two visas, Signor.
L118809 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Goodnight.
L118808 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Goodnight.
L118801 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Goodnight.
L118800 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Goodnight.
L118715 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ I will, don't worry.
L118714 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Be careful.
L118713 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ I must find out what Berger knows.
L118712 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ We have been in difficult places before, haven't we?
L118711 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Victor, I'm afraid for you.
L118710 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ This time they really mean to stop me.
L118683 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Won't you join us?
L118682 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ You are very kind.
L118661 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ If we would walk out so soon, it would only call attention to us. Perhaps Ugarte's in some other part of the cafe.
L118660 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Victor, I, I feel somehow we shouldn't stay here.
L119455 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ You're saying this only to make me go.
L119454 +++$+++ u666 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RENAULT +++$+++ I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.
L118779 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ I wasn't sure you were the same. Let's see, the last time we met --
L118778 +++$+++ u666 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RENAULT +++$+++ I can't get over you two. She was asking about you earlier, Rick, in a way that made me extremely jealous.
L118763 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ -- This is Mr. Laszlo.
L118762 +++$+++ u666 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RENAULT +++$+++ Well then, perhaps you also ---
L118761 +++$+++ u666 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RENAULT +++$+++ Oh, you've already met Rick, Mademoiselle?
L118760 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Hello, Rick.
L118695 +++$+++ u666 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RENAULT +++$+++ Well, Mademoiselle, he's the kind of a man that, well, if I were a woman and I...  were not around, I should be in love with Rick. But what a fool I am talking to a beautiful woman about another man.
L118694 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ -- Is what?
L118693 +++$+++ u666 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RENAULT +++$+++ Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --
L118692 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Rick? Who's he?
L118691 +++$+++ u666 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RENAULT +++$+++ He came from Paris with Rick.
L118690 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Yes.
L118689 +++$+++ u666 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RENAULT +++$+++ Sam?
L118688 +++$+++ u664 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ ILSA +++$+++ Captain, the boy who is playing the piano, somewhere I have seen him.
L119473 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Here it is.
L119472 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ I understand.
L119469 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were. She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?
L119468 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Yes.
L119467 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
L119466 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to explain anything.
L119465 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.
L119464 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Everything in order?
L119416 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Good. I've got the letters right here, all made out in blank.
L119415 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ No. It's all arranged.
L119414 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
L119413 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ But we made a deal.
L119412 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Keep it. You'll need it in America.
L119411 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ I brought the money, Monsieur Blaine.
L119410 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Oh, save it. We've still lots of things to do.
L119409 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Monsieur Blaine, I don't know how to thank you.
L119344 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Apparently you think of me only as the leader of a cause. Well, I am also a human being.
L119343 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ You love her that much?
L119342 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ I know a good deal more about you than you suspect. I know, for instance, that you are in love with a woman. It is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman. The first evening I came here in this cafe, I knew there was something between you and Ilsa. Since no one is to blame, I, I demand no explanation. I ask only one thing. You won't give me the letters of transit. All right. But I want my wife to be safe. I ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca.
L119341 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ You seem to know all about my destiny.
L119340 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ I wonder if you do. I wonder if you know that you're trying to escape from yourself and that you'll never succeed.
L119339 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Yes, I get the point.
L119338 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine? Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart. Each of us has a destiny, for good or for evil.
L119337 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ What of it? Then it'll be out of it's misery.
L119336 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.
L119335 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this? I mean what you're fighting for?
L119334 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Yes, rather.
L119333 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Had a close one, eh?
L119332 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Thank you.
L119331 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Well, this might come in handy.
L119203 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ My wife?
L119202 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I said, ask your wife.
L119201 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ I beg your pardon?
L119200 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
L119199 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ There must be some reason why you won't let me have them.
L119198 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.
L119197 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.
L119196 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
L119195 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs?
L119194 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman.
L119193 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
L119192 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ What of it?
L119191 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record. You ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought against the fascists in Spain.
L119190 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I'm not interested in politics. The problems of the world are not in my department. I'm a saloon keeper.
L119189 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ You must know it's very important I get out of Casablanca. It's my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great movement. You know what I have been doing. You know what it means to the work, to the lives of thousands and thousands of people that I be free to reach America and continue my work.
L119188 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Right.
L119187 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ My office.
L119186 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Well, isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential, what I have to say.
L119185 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Go ahead.
L119184 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Monsieur Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you?
L119146 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ I take that as a great compliment to Sam.  I suppose he means to you Paris of, well, happier days.
L119145 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Good evening. You see, here we are again.
L119144 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Good evening.
L118987 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.
L118986 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Good morning.
L118795 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Any time.
L118794 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ We'll come again.
L118790 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Not at all.
L118789 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.
L118777 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ We all try. You succeed.
L118776 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Thank you. I try.
L118775 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ Your work.
L118774 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ What for?
L118773 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ And I congratulate you.
L118768 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Won't you join us for a drink?
L118767 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
L118766 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.
L118765 +++$+++ u667 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RICK +++$+++ How do you do?
L118764 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ How do you do?
L118952 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Are you quite finished with us?
L118951 +++$+++ u666 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RENAULT +++$+++ I am making out the report now. We haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape.
L118948 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?
L118947 +++$+++ u666 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RENAULT +++$+++ I believe you have a message for him?
L118946 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Yes.
L118945 +++$+++ u666 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RENAULT +++$+++ By the way, Monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.
L118944 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ -- Thank you.
L118943 +++$+++ u666 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RENAULT +++$+++ Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power --
L118937 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ I was in a German concentration camp for a year. That's honor enough for a lifetime.
L118936 +++$+++ u666 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RENAULT +++$+++ And the honor of having served the Third Reich.
L118927 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.
L118926 +++$+++ u666 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RENAULT +++$+++ I am afraid not. My regrets, Monsieur.
L118922 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Thank you.
L118921 +++$+++ u666 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RENAULT +++$+++ With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
L118920 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ May we proceed with the business?
L118919 +++$+++ u666 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RENAULT +++$+++ That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
L118918 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ I slept very well.
L118917 +++$+++ u666 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RENAULT +++$+++ I am delighted to see you both. Did you have a good night's rest?
L118807 +++$+++ u666 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RENAULT +++$+++ Goodnight.
L118806 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ We'll be there.
L118805 +++$+++ u666 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RENAULT +++$+++ Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office.
L118788 +++$+++ u666 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RENAULT +++$+++ So it is. And we have a curfew here in Casablanca. It would never do for the Chief of Police to be found drinking after hours and have to fine himself.
L118787 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.
L118786 +++$+++ u666 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RENAULT +++$+++ Ricky, you're becoming quite human. I suppose we have to thank you for that, Mademoiselle.
L118772 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ This is a very interesting cafe. I congratulate you.
L118771 +++$+++ u666 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RENAULT +++$+++ Well! A precedent is being broken. Er, Emil!
L118733 +++$+++ u666 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RENAULT +++$+++ No. Two champagne cocktails, please.
L118732 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ My bill.
L118706 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Very well.
L118705 +++$+++ u666 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RENAULT +++$+++ Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.
L118687 +++$+++ u666 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RENAULT +++$+++ No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.
L118686 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ No, Captain, please.
L118681 +++$+++ u666 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RENAULT +++$+++ I was informed you were the most beautiful woman ever to visit Casablanca. That was a gross understatement.
L118680 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
L118679 +++$+++ u666 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RENAULT +++$+++ Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
L118678 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Yes. What is it you want?
L118677 +++$+++ u666 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RENAULT +++$+++ I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.
L118676 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Yes.
L118675 +++$+++ u666 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ RENAULT +++$+++ Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
L118954 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Good day.
L118953 +++$+++ u669 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ STRASSER +++$+++ For the time being.
L118942 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ You won't dare to interfere with me here. This is still unoccupied France. Any violation of neutrality would reflect on Captain Renault.
L118941 +++$+++ u669 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ STRASSER +++$+++ Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced, but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.
L118940 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ And what if you track down these men and kill them? What if you murdered all of us? From every corner of Europe, hundreds, thousands, would rise to take our places. Even Nazis can't kill that fast.
L118939 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ If I didn't give them to you in a concentration camp where you had more "persuasive methods" at your disposal, I certainly won't give them to you now.
L118938 +++$+++ u669 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ STRASSER +++$+++ You will give us the names?
L118935 +++$+++ u669 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ STRASSER +++$+++ Yes, even in Berlin. If you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts, you will have your visa in the morning.
L118934 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ Even in Berlin.
L118933 +++$+++ u669 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ STRASSER +++$+++ You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.
L118932 +++$+++ u665 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ LASZLO +++$+++ And that is?
L118931 +++$+++ u669 +++$+++ m42 +++$+++ STRASSER +++$+++ Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world. You may be in Casablanca indefinitely... or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow, on one condition.
