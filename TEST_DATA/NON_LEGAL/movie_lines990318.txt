L523633 +++$+++ u7747 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ MRS. BOATWRIGHT +++$+++ But, Charlie --
L523630 +++$+++ u7737 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Now look, Rita, I don't make the rules -- you puttin' yourself on a limb, comin' here, askin' me to do a thing like this. And I be damn if I'm going to jeopardize my job because you are in love with a little colored boy!
L523629 +++$+++ u7747 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ MRS. BOATWRIGHT +++$+++ Charlie, just because a man and his family are colored, you--
L523628 +++$+++ u7737 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I can't do it, Rita -- that's the policy here on colored prisoners, and I ain't about to change it, not even for a friend like you.
L523994 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ I'm gon' miss this ol' raggedy place.
L523993 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ What's that, son?
L523992 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ You know somethin', Daddy?
L523979 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Yes, Daddy! Yes!
L523978 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ I love you, son! Don't ever think I don't love you!  We gon' get to be friends?
L523966 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Now wait justa minute! You don't tell me what you ain't gonna do! I tell you! I say, you goin' to that school, you goin'! You hear me!
L523965 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ I won't go, Daddy! I won't go!
L523964 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Let me tell you somethin', boy! I don't care if both of my legs was cut off! I can do more work in that field, than you could in a hundred years!
L523963 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ But, Daddy, you need me here to help you in the field -- Daddy, your leg is hurt -- you can't work like you used to. Who's gonna help you!? Who's gonna do the work, Daddy?!
L523962 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ And I wanta be with you, too, but this school is somethin' that's good for you -- somethin you need, like good air to breathe, and I want you to have it, boy, and that's the way it's gonna be!
L523961 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ You just came back home, Daddy. I don't wanna leave right now -- I wanna stay home and be with you.
L523953 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ September 4 -- how far away is that?
L523952 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Dear David, if you are coming to school here, be sure to bring some warm clothes. The school term will begin September 8th, but it would be good for you to be here by the 4th or 5th of the month. I do hope everything is fine and you will be here. Give my "hello" to your family. Yours truly, Miss Camille Johnson...
L523951 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Well, ain't you gon' open and read it for us?
L523950 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ From Miss Johnson --
L523930 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ No, no, I'm all right, son... This damn leg just won't act right no more!
L523929 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ You hurt, Daddy!?
L523927 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ No, son -- they'd have to kill me before I'd let 'em do that to me again!
L523926 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ You won't be goin' to jail again, will you, Daddy?
L523925 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Wheeew! This is some hard work, but it beats goin' to jail.
L523923 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Thank you, Daddy...
L523922 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ I'm real proud of how you helped your mama to keep this place goin', David Lee.
L523902 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Soon -- but it won't be too much huntin' you'll be doin','cordin' to a good little story your mama told me last night -- you'll be goin' away from here, won't you?
L523901 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Daddy, when is we goin' huntin'?
L523895 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Great, son -- not like wakin' up in jail. For a minute or two, didn't quite know where I was, but when I saw your face lookin down on me, made me know right away the day was gonna be a good one, and it all belonged to me!
L523894 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ You feel alright today, Daddy?
L523892 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Guess I can't just lay here, then.
L523891 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ They gone to the field...
L523890 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Where's everybody?
L523889 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Mornin', Daddy...
L523888 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Mornin', son...
L523887 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Come here, son...
L523886 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Daddy, you home now... that's all I want -- I don't want nothin' else...
L523885 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Goodnight to you, son...
L523884 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Goodnight, Daddy...
L523882 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ I cleaned and oiled all your stuff while you was gone...
L523881 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ You bet we is!
L523880 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ We goin' huntin' again, Daddy !?
L523879 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ And me too, son! You shore done got to be such a big little man!
L523877 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ The rains started to come, and the prisoners were scared to run 'cause they had to wait for guards to round us up, and tell us when to move -- but we didn't mind the rain comin' 'cause it meant we would git a little rest -- we just stood there, watchin' the guards and they weapons get wet, and that made us all feel kinda good for a minute. I was laughin' all over inside -- a minute, that's all, but what a minute it was!
L523876 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ What happened afta that?
L523875 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Into the clouds and behind the mountains.
L523874 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Where did the sun go to, Daddy?
L523873 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ That musta been afta they sent me to this place call Clayburn. That was the hardest workin' camp they sent me to. The work was so hard, you had to look for somethin' to laugh about to keep from feelin' the whole pain in your body. Like one time, it was in the middle of the day, and there weren't no sun -- you hear that?
L523872 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Where was you, Daddy?
L523871 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Son, that was some trip you went on...
L523861 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Got it hurt in a dynamite blast, son. The dirty dogs had no more use for me, so they let me have time off my sentence, and let me come home.
L523860 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ What's wrong with your leg, Daddy?
L523580 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Just do like I tell you -- I'll get word to you through the visitin' preacher.
L523579 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Why, Daddy; you won't be here?
L523578 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ I don't know, son -- they won't tell us things like that -- but I don't want y'all to come here no more.
L523577 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Can you say what camp they gon' send you to, Daddy?
L523573 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ I think so...
L523572 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ It's a shame they won't let 'em come in here. If I had the strength I'd knock down these damn walls -- if I could just git my arms 'round your mama right now -- is they on this side of us, son?
L523571 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Naww -- he'll come back to you, soon as his wounds heal. This cake shore is tasty, son.
L523570 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Do you think he's dead, Daddy?
L523569 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ He'll show up one day.
L523568 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ We didn't find Sounder yet.
L523565 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ They is!? It shore is good to see you, boy!
L523564 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Mama is outside with Josie Mae and Earl.
L523563 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Hi to you, son...
L523562 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Hi, Daddy...
L523561 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Well, looka here...
L523385 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Now who says I didn't lay my mark on you, boy!
L523384 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ "You lose some of the time, what you always go afta, but you lose all the time what you don't go afta!"
L523383 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Yep. I guess you must wonder why though, what with the luck we havin', but like I always say--
L523382 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ We goin' huntin' again tomorrow ?
L523381 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ When the fall comes in these parts, the Night moon runs away like a rabbit -- you could stay out here lookin' all night, and not see a thing out yonder.
L523380 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Yes, sir...
L523379 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Readin' must be somethin' powerful, huh, son?
L523378 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Yes, sir -- I learn to write a little bit, and I can read a lot--
L523377 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ You learnin' anything at that school?
L523376 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ I wanna go -- the trip don't bother me none.
L523375 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ You had a rough time out there tonight -- so you stay home from that school tomorrow.
L523374 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Yes, sir...
L523373 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ David Lee...
L523372 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Boy, you don't make funny with your daddy like that.
L523371 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ He beat you, too, Daddy, and you had a big ol' shootin' rifle.
L523370 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ You oughta be tired, too, Sounder. That possum shore whipped the hell outta you tonight!
L523369 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Yes, sir...
L523365 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Yeah. We better git back to house now.
L523364 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ It was too dark, Daddy.
L523363 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ If anybody's to blame, it's me -- I oughta nailed him when I took that shot.
L523358 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Here, put my jacket over you.
L523357 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ It's cold, Daddy!
L523356 +++$+++ u7748 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ NATHAN LEE +++$+++ Looks that way, son. Guess the cold done drove most of 'em down to the big water country -- but if there's one left out here -- we gotta find him.
L523355 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ There ain't no possums in this woods tonight, Daddy.
L523698 +++$+++ u7742 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ GUARD +++$+++ Never heard of 'im. We gotta lotta men here...
L523697 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee Morgan?
L523696 +++$+++ u7742 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ GUARD +++$+++ Sunday...
L523695 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ When's that?
L523694 +++$+++ u7742 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ GUARD +++$+++ Gotta wait 'til visitin' days.
L523693 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Mister, can you visit anybody here?
L523559 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Nathan Lee Morgan...
L523558 +++$+++ u7742 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ GUARD +++$+++ What's your daddy's name?
L523622 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Yes, ma'am...?
L523621 +++$+++ u7746 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ MRS BOATWRIGHT +++$+++ David!
L523620 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ See you tomorrow, Miss Boatwright.
L523618 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Will you help me to find out what camp they sent my father to?
L523617 +++$+++ u7746 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ MRS BOATWRIGHT +++$+++ Yes, David...
L523616 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Miss Boatwright --
L523613 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ My father taught me...
L523612 +++$+++ u7746 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ MRS BOATWRIGHT +++$+++ David, you never cease to amaze me at how good you are in taking care of my garden.
L523984 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Thank you, Josie Mae.
L523983 +++$+++ u7741 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Naw, I'm carryin' it!
L523611 +++$+++ u7741 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Why don't you try and git you a new dog?
L523610 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ I guess I'll havta work harder to git him back like he usta be.
L523607 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Act like one!
L523606 +++$+++ u7741 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ I don't look like no possum!
L523605 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ He will... Come on, git down and act like a possum.
L523604 +++$+++ u7741 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Then why don't he holler like he usta?
L523603 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ He eats all right -- his throat ain't scarred.
L523402 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Sausage and hambones!
L523401 +++$+++ u7741 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ What's in there, David!?
L523988 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Yes, ma'm...
L523987 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Be good and be smart, little boy.
L523933 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ He can't get up, Mama!
L523932 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ What's wrong, Nathan?
L523856 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ He won't go mad -- he's just lookin' for a cooler spot.
L523855 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ It's when the heat is so bad, dogs go crazy.
L523854 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ It's the heat.
L523853 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ What's wrong with him, David?
L523847 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ But who's gonna help me here with the house and in the field?
L523846 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ She says I can come live with her while school goin' on, and come back home every time there ain't no school.
L523845 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ How can you do that? You don't live anywhere near that school.
L523844 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ She is, Mama...  When the fall comes, she wants me to come to her school.
L523843 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
L523842 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ So when I left, she gave me these books.
L523841 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Miss Johnson is a teacher, and...
L523840 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Who's Miss Johnson?
L523839 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Some books Miss Johnson gave me.
L523838 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ What's that you carryin'?
L523837 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ I guess they musta sent 'im to another camp.
L523836 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Didn't see 'im, Mama. The other men there say they didn't know Daddy.
L523835 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Did you find your father?
L523834 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ I cut it on some glass and we got lost, Mama.
L523687 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Ask your daddy to give you some word about when he'll be comin' home -- and tell 'im we love him.
L523686 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Yes, mam...
L523685 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Here's your food -- now you go straight to that place -- if you need to rest, go into a church or railroad station -- but don't go into nobody's house, you hear me?
L523684 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ I got to, Mama. I know Daddy wants to see him.
L523683 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ I wish you wouldn't take the dog with you, David -- he's likely to be a burden to you.
L523680 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Good night...
L523679 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Good night, Mama...
L523678 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Yes, son. You better get back to bed.
L523677 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Can I go day after tomorrow?
L523676 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ No, I don't and I oughtn't not to after the way you've taken over since they took him away -- and I would like for you to see 'im so you can come back and tell me about 'im.  The field's all planted, so I guess I can spare you for a little while. When do you wanta leave?
L523675 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Mama, don't I always do what you say -- every time I go to the fields to plant the corn, to Miss Boatwright's and the woods -- you tell me what to do and I do it, and you don't worry.
L523674 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ But you'll be away from home for days -- what will you do when the dark comes, where will you sleep? I can't send you away from here like that!
L523673 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ I can do it, Mama -- you know that. In the Bible stories you read to us, everybody's always goin' on a long journey. Jacob goes into a strange land where his uncle is and he don't even know where he lives, but he finds him. Everybody finds what they supposed to find.
L523672 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ So did I. I figured when the time got right, we could all take a day or two and walk up there, but it's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone.
L523671 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ No, ma'am...  Mama, I wanted Mrs. Boatwright to find out where Daddy is, so me and Sounder can go see him.
L523670 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Can't sleep?
L523627 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Good! But you don't have to tell the whole valley 'bout it! You'll get that woman in trouble!
L523626 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Mama! Mama! Miss Boatwright, say she gon' help me find where Daddy is!
L523602 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ He'll be all right, Mama. I'll make him all right.
L523601 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Poor creature...
L523598 +++$+++ u7739 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ DAVID LEE +++$+++ Listen, Mama...
L523597 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ What is it, David Lee?
L523542 +++$+++ u7750 +++$+++ m524 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ I think maybe he was scraped on the head by that shot. I don't think he's dead -- just gone somewhere to heal himself.
