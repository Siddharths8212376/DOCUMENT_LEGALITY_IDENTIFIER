L614399 +++$+++ u8460 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ A hundred and one next month.
L614398 +++$+++ u8447 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ BODINE +++$+++ She says she's Rose DeWitt Bukater, right? Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the Titanic. At the age of 17. If she'd've lived, she'd be over a hundred now.
L614370 +++$+++ u8460 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Get that outta my face.
L614369 +++$+++ u8447 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ BODINE +++$+++ You know, boss, this happened to Geraldo and his career never recovered.
L614368 +++$+++ u8460 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Shit.
L614365 +++$+++ u8460 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ You are, Lewis.  You rolling?
L614364 +++$+++ u8447 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ BODINE +++$+++ Who's the best? Say it.
L614358 +++$+++ u8447 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ BODINE +++$+++ I'm tryin' boss.
L614357 +++$+++ u8460 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday.
L614356 +++$+++ u8447 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ BODINE +++$+++ I'm in the sitting room. Heading for bedroom B-54.
L614611 +++$+++ u8458 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LIZZY +++$+++ Look, Brock, she's going to do this her way, in her own time. Don't forget, she contacted you. She's out here for her own reasons, God knows what they are.
L614610 +++$+++ u8448 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ BROCK +++$+++ That's the shape my hand's gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand? I'm not leaving here without it.
L614609 +++$+++ u8458 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LIZZY +++$+++ What?
L614608 +++$+++ u8448 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ BROCK +++$+++ Lizzy... you gotta understand something. I've bet it all to find the Heart of the Ocean. I've got all my dough tied up in this thing. My wife even divorced me over this hunt. I need what's locked inside your grandma's memory.  You see this? Right here?
L614607 +++$+++ u8458 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LIZZY +++$+++ I'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and one year old grandmother. I came down here to tell you to back off.
L614606 +++$+++ u8448 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ BROCK +++$+++ Look, I'm running out of time. I need your help.
L614605 +++$+++ u8458 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LIZZY +++$+++ Don't you mean work me?
L614604 +++$+++ u8448 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ BROCK +++$+++ Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.
L614394 +++$+++ u8460 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Alright. You have my attention, Rose. Can you tell me who the woman in the picture is?
L614393 +++$+++ u8449 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ BUELL +++$+++ I told you you wanted to take this call.
L614391 +++$+++ u8460 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ ...Mrs. Calvert?
L614390 +++$+++ u8449 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ BUELL +++$+++ Rose Calvert.
L614389 +++$+++ u8460 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ This is Brock Lovett. What can I do for you, Mrs...?
L614388 +++$+++ u8449 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ BUELL +++$+++ No, trust me, you want to take this call.
L614387 +++$+++ u8460 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Bobby, we're launching. See these submersibles here, going in the water? Take a message.
L614386 +++$+++ u8449 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ BUELL +++$+++ There's a satellite call for you.
L614373 +++$+++ u8460 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ How it's going? It's going like a first date in prison, whattaya think?!
L614372 +++$+++ u8449 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ BUELL +++$+++ The partners want to know how it's going?
L615203 +++$+++ u8450 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ I put the diamond in my coat pocket. And I put my coat... on her.
L615202 +++$+++ u8459 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LOVEJOY +++$+++ What could possible be funny?
L615164 +++$+++ u8459 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LOVEJOY +++$+++ There are still some boats forward. Stay with this one... Murdoch. He seems to be quite... practical.
L615163 +++$+++ u8450 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ We're too late.
L615147 +++$+++ u8459 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LOVEJOY +++$+++ So do I.
L615146 +++$+++ u8450 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ I make my own luck.
L615131 +++$+++ u8450 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ Then that's our play. But we're still going to need some insurance.  Come on.
L615130 +++$+++ u8459 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LOVEJOY +++$+++ The one on the other side is letting men in.
L615129 +++$+++ u8450 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ We're running out of time. And this strutting martinet...  ...isn't letting any men in at all.
L615128 +++$+++ u8459 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LOVEJOY +++$+++ She's not on the starboard side either.
L614877 +++$+++ u8450 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ This is ridiculous, Lovejoy. Find her.
L614876 +++$+++ u8459 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LOVEJOY +++$+++ None of the stewards have seen her.
L615019 +++$+++ u8463 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ There's no need for language, Mr. Hockley.  Go back and turn the heater on in my room, so it won't be too cold when we get back.
L615018 +++$+++ u8450 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ It's just the God damned English doing everything by the book.
L614515 +++$+++ u8450 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ She knows.
L614514 +++$+++ u8463 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ You know I don't like that, Rose.
L614460 +++$+++ u8450 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ All part of my charm, Ruth. At any rate, it was my darling fiancee's beauty rituals which made us late.
L614459 +++$+++ u8463 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.
L614458 +++$+++ u8450 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath.
L614449 +++$+++ u8450 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ It is unsinkable. God himself couldn't sink this ship.
L614448 +++$+++ u8463 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ RUTH +++$+++ So this is the ship they say is unsinkable.
L614447 +++$+++ u8450 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ Your daughter is much too hard to impress, Ruth.  Mind your step.
L615303 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Jewels are precious. Goodbye, Mr. Hockley.
L615302 +++$+++ u8450 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ You're precious to me, Rose.
L615301 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Tell her that her daughter died with the Titanic.
L615300 +++$+++ u8450 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ What do I tell your mother?
L615299 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Is this in any way unclear?
L615297 +++$+++ u8450 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ Rose... your mother and I have been looking for you --
L615296 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yes, I lived. How awkward for you.
L615066 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I'd rather be his whore than your wife.
L615065 +++$+++ u8450 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ Where are you going? To him? Is that it? To be a whore to that gutter rat?
L615059 +++$+++ u8450 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ Not the better half.
L615058 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Oh, Mother shut up!  Don't you understand? The water is freezing and there aren't enough boats... not enough by half. Half the people on this ship are going to die.
L614979 +++$+++ u8450 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ Maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on.
L614978 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ But I was with him the whole time.
L614968 +++$+++ u8450 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ That's right. Two things dear to me have disappeared this evening. Now that one is back...  ...I have a pretty good idea where to find the other.  Search him.
L614967 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Something serious has happened.
L614794 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command! I am your fiancee --
L614793 +++$+++ u8450 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?
L614792 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.
L614791 +++$+++ u8450 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.
L614790 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I was tired.
L614789 +++$+++ u8450 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ I had hoped you would come to me last night.
L614586 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... it's overwhelming.
L614585 +++$+++ u8450 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer, the --
L614584 +++$+++ u8450 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ Diamond. Yes it is. 56 carats.
L614583 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ My God... Cal. Is it a --
L614574 +++$+++ u8450 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ Rose is displeased. Mmm... what to do?
L614573 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love?
L614565 +++$+++ u8450 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ You wanted to see the propellers?
L614564 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I was leaning way over, to see the... ah... propellers. And I slipped and I would have gone overboard... and Mr. Dawson here saved me and he almost went over himself.
L614563 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ It was... stupid really. I was leaning over and I slipped.
L614562 +++$+++ u8450 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ An accident?!
L614561 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Cal, stop! It was an accident.
L614560 +++$+++ u8450 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ What made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee?! Look at me, you filth! What did you think you were doing?!
L614496 +++$+++ u8450 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ He'll never amount to a thing, trust me. At least they were cheap.
L614495 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth without logic. What's his name again...?  Picasso.
L614494 +++$+++ u8450 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ Those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money.
L614463 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I felt like black.
L614462 +++$+++ u8450 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck.
L614461 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You told me to change.
L615196 +++$+++ u8450 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ I always win, Jack. One way or another.  Pity I didn't keep that drawing. It's going to be worth a lot more by morning.
L615195 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Almost as good as you.
L615194 +++$+++ u8450 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ You're a good liar.
L615192 +++$+++ u8450 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ Get in... hurry up, it's almost full.
L615191 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch.
L615190 +++$+++ u8450 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ There are boats on the other side that are allowing men in. Jack and I can get off safely. Both of us.
L614761 +++$+++ u8450 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ Probably best. It'll be all business and politics, that sort of thing. Wouldn't interest you. Good of you to come.
L614760 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No thanks. I'm heading back.
L614738 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No caviar for me, thanks.  Never did like it much.
L614737 +++$+++ u8450 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ Just a soupcon of lemon...  ...it improves the flavor with champagne.
L614579 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Can I bum a cigarette?
L614578 +++$+++ u8450 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ This should be amusing.
L614577 +++$+++ u8450 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ Good. Settled then.
L614576 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Sure. Count me in.
L614575 +++$+++ u8450 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ I know.  Perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow, to regale our group with your heroic tale?
L615137 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ We gotta get up there or we're gonna be gargling saltwater. Where's Tommy?
L615136 +++$+++ u8451 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ FABRIZIO +++$+++ The boats are all going.
L614771 +++$+++ u8451 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ FABRIZIO +++$+++ I don't know what she's say, she don't know what I say, so we get along fine.
L614770 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ How you two doin'?
L614491 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Of course not. That's not the point.  Goodbye! Goodbye!! I'll miss you!
L614490 +++$+++ u8451 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ FABRIZIO +++$+++ You know somebody?
L614479 +++$+++ u8451 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ FABRIZIO +++$+++ You see? Is my destinio!! Like I told you. I go to l'America!! To be a millionaire!!  Capito?? I go to America!!

L614473 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Sorry, you're not gonna see your mama again for a long time...
L614472 +++$+++ u8451 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ FABRIZIO +++$+++ What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo --
L614471 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Let's see... Fabrizio's got niente. Olaf, you've got squat. Sven, uh oh... two pair... mmm.  Sorry Fabrizio.
L614932 +++$+++ u8456 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!
L614931 +++$+++ u8452 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ FLEET +++$+++ Oy, mate... that was a close shave.
L614917 +++$+++ u8452 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ FLEET +++$+++ Well if that's what it takes for us two to get warm, I'd rather not, if it's all the same.
L614916 +++$+++ u8456 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ They're a bloody sight warmer than we are.
L614915 +++$+++ u8452 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ FLEET +++$+++ Cor... look at that, would ya.
L614909 +++$+++ u8452 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ FLEET +++$+++ Well I can.
L614908 +++$+++ u8456 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LEE +++$+++ Bollocks.
L614907 +++$+++ u8452 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ FLEET +++$+++ You can smell ice, you know, when it's near.
L615269 +++$+++ u8453 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ HITCHINS +++$+++ If you don't shut that hole in yer face, there'll be one less in this boat!
L615268 +++$+++ u8461 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ I don't understand a one of you. What's the matter with you? It's your men back there! We got plenty a' room for more.
L615267 +++$+++ u8461 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Aw knock it off, yer scarin' me. Come on girls, grab your oars. Let's go.  Well come on!
L615266 +++$+++ u8453 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ HITCHINS +++$+++ They'll pull us right down I tell ya!
L615155 +++$+++ u8453 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ HITCHINS +++$+++ No! It's our lives now, not theirs. And I'm in charge of this boat! Now row!!
L615154 +++$+++ u8461 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ We got room for lots more. I say we go back.
L615153 +++$+++ u8453 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ HITCHINS +++$+++ The suction will pull us right down if we don't keep going.
L615072 +++$+++ u8461 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Ain't you boys ever rowed before? Here, gimme those oars. I'll show ya how it's done.
L615071 +++$+++ u8453 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ HITCHINS +++$+++ Keep pulling... away from the ship. Pull.
L614955 +++$+++ u8464 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ SMITH +++$+++ Excuse me.
L614954 +++$+++ u8454 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ISMAY +++$+++ Well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged?
L614953 +++$+++ u8464 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ SMITH +++$+++ We've struck ice.
L614952 +++$+++ u8454 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ISMAY +++$+++ Why have we stopped?
L614679 +++$+++ u8454 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ISMAY +++$+++ Of course I leave it to your good offices to decide what's best, but what a glorious end to your last crossing if we get into New York Tuesday night and surprise them all.  Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?
L614678 +++$+++ u8464 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ SMITH +++$+++ I prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in.
L614677 +++$+++ u8454 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ISMAY +++$+++ Captain, the press knows the size of Titanic, let them marvel at her speed too. We must give them something new to print. And the maiden voyage of Titanic must make headlines!
L614676 +++$+++ u8464 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ SMITH +++$+++ No, but we're making excellent time.
L614675 +++$+++ u8454 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ISMAY +++$+++ So you've not lit the last four boilers then?
L615285 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I promise. I will never let go, Jack. I'll never let go.
L615284 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Never let go.
L615283 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I promise.
L615282 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You must do me this honor... promise me you will survive... that you will never give up... no matter what happens... no matter how hopeless... promise me now, and never let go of that promise.
L615280 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Rose, listen to me. Listen. Winning that ticket was the best thing that ever happened to me.
L615279 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I can't feel my body.
L615278 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me?
L615277 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I'm so cold.
L615276 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No... don't say your good-byes, Rose. Don't you give up. Don't do it.
L615273 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Just a few more minutes. It'll take them a while to get the boats organized...
L615272 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ It's getting quiet.
L615253 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I know. I know. Help me, here. Look around.
L615252 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ It's so cold.
L615251 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Look for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything.
L615200 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Right.
L615199 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You jump, I jump, right?
L615184 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Get in the boat, Rose.
L615183 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I'm not going without you.
L615109 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ We'll find out.
L615108 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Will this work?
L615099 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'll wait here.
L615098 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I'll be right back.
L615097 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You have to go for help.
L615094 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I didn't.  I just realized I already knew.
L615093 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ So... how did you find out I didn't do it?
L615092 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ See if you can find a key for these. Try those drawers. It's a little brass one.
L615091 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I know, I know.
L615090 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket.
L614976 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ He couldn't have.
L614975 +++$+++ u8455 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't!
