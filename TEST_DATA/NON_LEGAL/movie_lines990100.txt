L367820 +++$+++ u6456 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ D'ARTAGNAN +++$+++ There.
L367819 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Where is Michelle?
L367811 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ They have plotted against me!  Me! The embodiment of God's will!
L367810 +++$+++ u6456 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ D'ARTAGNAN +++$+++ Aramis, Porthos and Athos too.  I know what they have done was a threat against you -- and yet that threat has been removed, with no harm coming to your Majesty.  If their passions were in error, their spirits have ever been noble. Forgive them.
L367809 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Forgive?!
L367808 +++$+++ u6456 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ D'ARTAGNAN +++$+++ Not once have I ever asked anything for myself.  I ask now.  Forgive this man, this prisoner... your brother.
L367807 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Get out of my way.
L367806 +++$+++ u6456 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ D'ARTAGNAN +++$+++ Your Majesty... This man before you... He is royal blood, the same as you.  To spill it is the one thing even you cannot do.  It is against the laws of God, and of France.
L367799 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ My twin.  Which has kept him alive. Until now.
L367798 +++$+++ u6456 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ D'ARTAGNAN +++$+++ I -- I thought he was but... an impostor who resembled --
L367797 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ He is my brother.
L367796 +++$+++ u6456 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ D'ARTAGNAN +++$+++ ... You knew you had a double?
L367795 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I was told this impostor was dead!
L367794 +++$+++ u6456 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ D'ARTAGNAN +++$+++ Yes, your Majesty.
L367793 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain!
L367792 +++$+++ u6456 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ D'ARTAGNAN +++$+++ It shall be done, your Majesty.
L367791 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I want all these passages sealed! Another stupid idea of my father's! Seal them all, every one!
L367726 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ ... tired.  Must... lie down.
L367725 +++$+++ u6456 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ D'ARTAGNAN +++$+++ Your Majesty...?
L367681 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You will protect me as you always have, d'Artagnan.
L367680 +++$+++ u6456 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ D'ARTAGNAN +++$+++ Your Majesty.  This ball, with an open invitation to the nobility of Paris -- we have no way of checking --
L367523 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ It... was nothing.  A nightmare, nothing more.  Go away, I --
L367522 +++$+++ u6456 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ D'ARTAGNAN +++$+++ I just left the garden, it was empty.  What did you see?
L367297 +++$+++ u6456 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ D'ARTAGNAN +++$+++ Thank you, your Majesty.
L367296 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I will consider it.  Now leave me.
L367295 +++$+++ u6456 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ D'ARTAGNAN +++$+++ Order Fromberge to keep him in safety!  It is the least you can do, to protect your own honor!
L367294 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Silence!  I order you!
L367293 +++$+++ u6456 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ D'ARTAGNAN +++$+++ At least help Raoul.
L367292 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ That is enough!  You are a good servant, d'Artagnan, but you forget your place!
L367291 +++$+++ u6456 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ D'ARTAGNAN +++$+++ Not criticize -- plead.  Love.  Love your people, and you will not bear to see them hungry.  Love women, and they will love you.  Love yourself, and --
L367290 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You dare criticize my father?!  Or lecture me?!
L367289 +++$+++ u6456 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ D'ARTAGNAN +++$+++ There is more to love than he knew, or that you know.
L367288 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ What quaint notions, d'Artagnan! But they contradict my father, who picked his queen when he was old, and only then to bear me.
L367287 +++$+++ u6456 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ D'ARTAGNAN +++$+++ It is not Raoul's heart alone that concerns me.  It is yours.  I know you find women compliant -- especially the poorer ones like Michelle.  But do they love you?  Do you love them?  What about a queen to love?  A son of your own?
L367286 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ That is my desire, and my desire is what should concern you, not the sentiments of some commoner!
L367285 +++$+++ u6456 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ D'ARTAGNAN +++$+++ Your Majesty has had many women --
L367284 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Miss Beaufort has accepted our invitation.  By this we can only suppose that she wishes to come -- as we wish her to be here.
L367283 +++$+++ u6456 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ D'ARTAGNAN +++$+++ In his mind, anyway, and soon enough in hers.  She had written him many letters of love.
L367282 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Betrothed?  I think not.
L367281 +++$+++ u6456 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ D'ARTAGNAN +++$+++ Mademoiselle Michelle Beaufort.  She is betrothed to Raoul, the son of Athos the Musketeer, who has served France through many tribulations.
L367280 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ A personal nature?
L367279 +++$+++ u6456 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ D'ARTAGNAN +++$+++ Then there is one more thing, of an even more personal nature.
L367278 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I already know about the riots, d'Artagnan, I heard them out there whispering.  Some fool gave the order to distribute rotten food.  I will deal with it tomorrow.
L367277 +++$+++ u6456 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ D'ARTAGNAN +++$+++ It is for your security that I have come, your Majesty -- for the security of your honor.
L367276 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Aaa!  D'Artagnan!  These passages were constructed for the King's security, not so you could step from my father's portrait and startle me to death!
L367156 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Let us play a game, d'Artagnan, let us pretend I am King and you are Captain of my Musketeers.  Let us behave as if my wish is law.  And my wish is to enjoy this party!
L367155 +++$+++ u6456 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ D'ARTAGNAN +++$+++ But I deployed the Royal Guards according to your previous --
L367154 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I am King, d'Artagnan.  I will change my mind as I wish, and I will enjoy my banquet as I wish!
L367153 +++$+++ u6456 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ D'ARTAGNAN +++$+++ Then you must allow me to stay close to you so that --
L367152 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I decided it this morning.
L367151 +++$+++ u6456 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ D'ARTAGNAN +++$+++ The plans for use of the maze were not disclosed to me.
L367150 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ What is it, d'Artagnan?  Assassins falling from the sky now?
L367149 +++$+++ u6456 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ D'ARTAGNAN +++$+++ Your Majesty...
L367893 +++$+++ u6462 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ PHILLIPPE +++$+++ I am unhurt --
L367892 +++$+++ u6456 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ D'ARTAGNAN +++$+++ Phillippe!
L367881 +++$+++ u6456 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ D'ARTAGNAN +++$+++ No.  Even if I could give up my friends, I could never give up my son.
L367880 +++$+++ u6462 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ PHILLIPPE +++$+++ Wait.  Bargain me to Louis, for all your lives.  You have done your best.  Let me go, and let all of you find peace.
L367771 +++$+++ u6456 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ D'ARTAGNAN +++$+++ I must insist, Sire.
L367770 +++$+++ u6462 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ PHILLIPPE +++$+++ ... The ball... Continue.
L367769 +++$+++ u6456 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ D'ARTAGNAN +++$+++ Sire, we have an emergency -- of security.  I must ask you to accompany me.
L367768 +++$+++ u6462 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ PHILLIPPE +++$+++ Continue.
L367187 +++$+++ u6460 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ MAN IN THE IRON MASK +++$+++ What was the end page?
L367186 +++$+++ u6457 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ KEEPER +++$+++ You've... memorized...?
L367185 +++$+++ u6460 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ MAN IN THE IRON MASK +++$+++ Two-thirty-seven:  "... And the descendants of Japeth are these: Obediah, Zebulon, Hezekiah..."
L367184 +++$+++ u6457 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ KEEPER +++$+++ ... Two-thirty-seven.
L367183 +++$+++ u6460 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ MAN IN THE IRON MASK +++$+++ What number, on the first page?
L367182 +++$+++ u6457 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ KEEPER +++$+++ Eh?
L367181 +++$+++ u6460 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ MAN IN THE IRON MASK +++$+++ What number did you tear out?
L367177 +++$+++ u6460 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ MAN IN THE IRON MASK +++$+++ Thank you, Keeper.
L367176 +++$+++ u6457 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ KEEPER +++$+++ Food, moron.
L367085 +++$+++ u6460 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ MAN IN THE IRON MASK +++$+++ No, Keeper.
L367084 +++$+++ u6457 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ KEEPER +++$+++ You dead yet?
L367888 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Shoot them!  Shoot them!
L367887 +++$+++ u6458 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT +++$+++ Magnificent valor...
L367875 +++$+++ u6458 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT +++$+++ The corridor nullifies our number... And no one has stomach to fight the Captain.
L367874 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Cowards!  Twenty run from four?!
L367831 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ When he returns, watch him.  When he leaves again, you tell me.
L367830 +++$+++ u6458 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT +++$+++ Out directing the search for the traitors.
L367829 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Now.  Where is d'Artagnan?
L367373 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Not by you.  I will order d'Artagnan to do it.
L367372 +++$+++ u6458 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT +++$+++ Do you want Athos arrested, your Majesty?
L367371 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You may go, Lieutenant.
L367370 +++$+++ u6458 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT +++$+++ ... He did -- but Captain d'Artagnan blocked his way.
L367369 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Who was Athos seeking?  Tell me! Did he try to enter the palace?
L367368 +++$+++ u6458 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT +++$+++ No.  He cut an ear from one of the men, no one else was hurt.  Captain d'Artagnan allowed him to leave. Athos was upset about the death of his son, at the front.
L367367 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Did they kill him?
L367366 +++$+++ u6458 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT +++$+++ Athos, the former Musketeer, has just fought with several of your guard, at the Musketeers' Gate.
L367365 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Yes, yes, go on.
L367364 +++$+++ u6458 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LIEUTENANT +++$+++ I would not have disturbed you, Majesty, but you ordered me to keep you informed --
L367142 +++$+++ u6463 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ PIERRE +++$+++ What... an excellent idea, your Majesty!
L367141 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Exactly why it should be given away.
L367140 +++$+++ u6463 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ PIERRE +++$+++ That food has spoiled.  That is why it was not shipped to the army.
L367139 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Ah yes, the riots.  We have food stocks on the wharves right now, no?
L367130 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Aramis!  I have been expecting you!  We are satisfied, that will do.
L367129 +++$+++ u6463 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ PIERRE +++$+++ Majesty... We have more than enough food set aside for your birthday celebration next week.  If we distributed some of that, we would have time to gather more before --
L367128 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Sometimes the poor do grow hungry. But why would they riot about it?
L367127 +++$+++ u6463 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ PIERRE +++$+++ Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.
L367126 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Riots?  My people live in the world's most beautiful city, their king has the grandest palaces on earth.  Why should they feel anything but pride and contentment?
L367517 +++$+++ u6461 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ MICHELLE +++$+++ We'll burn in hell.  Both of us.
L367516 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Listen, my darling... Raoul was a... a good friend.  And now he is dead and that is very sad but --
L367515 +++$+++ u6461 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ MICHELLE +++$+++ Raoul... Oh, Raoul...
L367378 +++$+++ u6461 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ MICHELLE +++$+++ Oh Louis, Louis...
L367377 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I will order a Mass for his soul. It will guarantee his place in Heaven.
L367376 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I did not want to upset you.  It was tragic.  I did everything I could for him.  I ordered him positioned in a spot of complete safety, far from the fighting.  But he disregarded my wishes and charged into danger.
L367375 +++$+++ u6461 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ MICHELLE +++$+++ Did you know... about Raoul?
L367363 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ No, you may wait behind the screen.
L367362 +++$+++ u6461 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ MICHELLE +++$+++ Shall I leave?
L367328 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ If you don't want to be so appealing, why did you touch the rose to your skin?  Where was it? Here?
L367327 +++$+++ u6461 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ MICHELLE +++$+++ Sire, I --
L367326 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You are beautiful.  You know you are.
L367324 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ My dear, I've already done it.
L367323 +++$+++ u6461 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ MICHELLE +++$+++ You would do that, your Majesty?
L367322 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Wait, no!  Do not be ashamed.  The straits of your family need not be permanent.  It is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates, where they may have fine meals, and physicians to look after them.
L367321 +++$+++ u6461 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ MICHELLE +++$+++ I... we are humble people...
L367320 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ This is more than you are used to. Your mother is a seamstress, your father is dead.  You have three younger sisters, two of whom suffer from consumption.  Don't look so surprised, Kings know such things.
L367319 +++$+++ u6461 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ MICHELLE +++$+++ It's lovely.  It's just...
L367318 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ The food doesn't please you?
L367317 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Enough of this, our dinner waits.
L367316 +++$+++ u6461 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ MICHELLE +++$+++ Raoul... is in love...
L367315 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ From Raoul.  He urges you to guard your honor -- as if it could be in any danger... from your king.
L367314 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ A letter.  May I see?
L367313 +++$+++ u6461 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ MICHELLE +++$+++ ... Nothing.
L367312 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ How did I get in?  You're new here, and will soon learn many secrets. What is that?
L367311 +++$+++ u6461 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ MICHELLE +++$+++ Sire!  I -- How did you --
L367169 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You blush!  You do not wish to be beautiful to your King?
L367168 +++$+++ u6461 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ MICHELLE +++$+++ Sire, I --
L367167 +++$+++ u6459 +++$+++ m429 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I would have said it was impossible, but I believe the excitement of the chase has made you even more beautiful.
L368286 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Yeah, stick around, you might learn something.
L368285 +++$+++ u6466 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ You mind if I ride with you?
L368279 +++$+++ u6466 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Or worse, we'll have a hostage situation on our hands.
L368278 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Alright, we know who we're looking for.  Play it cool until the time is right to make a move.  Let's not pull any gangbusters shit or we'll lose him again.
L368266 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ If you guys want in, fine.  Just remember this is our jurisdiction.
L368265 +++$+++ u6466 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Every step of the way.
L368264 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Cooperate?
L368263 +++$+++ u6466 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ I'm sure if our departments cooperate we can find out the truth.
L368262 +++$+++ u6466 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ That's the point.  He slipped up, and he's desperate now.  And that means he's all the more dangerous.
L368261 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ If what you're saying is true, then why would he have killed two police officers? A man like that would want to lay low, if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission!
L368260 +++$+++ u6466 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Our agency monitors all threats very carefully, and there's good reason to believe Jim Trudell has the training, the connections, and the experience to present a clear threat to the public if he remains at large.
L368259 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Yeah?..well what are you getting at? You saying he has an agenda down here?
L368258 +++$+++ u6466 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ I don't think you understand. I don't mean shuffling papers in an office, I mean Jim Trudell worked classified assignments, special forces...sabotage...until last year. He was brought up on charges of espionage, but the charges were later dropped, and he sprang the service.
L368257 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ We ran the i.d.  I could have told you that.
L368256 +++$+++ u6466 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ We did a little digging on Jim Trudell at Sergeant Zydowski's request. He's 31, no priors, and he's been working for the military for ten years.
L368254 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Yeah - I heard - nothing came up.
L368253 +++$+++ u6466 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.
L368252 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ What can I do for you?
L368250 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Yeah?
L368249 +++$+++ u6466 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ Captain Doyle?
L368294 +++$+++ u6471 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ MARVOSA +++$+++ Alright, stay on the phone.
L368293 +++$+++ u6467 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ D.T. +++$+++ What do you think?
L368292 +++$+++ u6471 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ MARVOSA +++$+++ You set to go -
L368291 +++$+++ u6467 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ D.T. +++$+++ We're by Ozone...
L368290 +++$+++ u6471 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ MARVOSA +++$+++ Where are you?
L368289 +++$+++ u6467 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ D.T. +++$+++ Yeah?
L368138 +++$+++ u6471 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ MARVOSA +++$+++ No I mean ours, motherfucker! If I go down everyone's going with me - you and your crew especially! You won't get protection, you won't get the trucks - nothing!
L368137 +++$+++ u6467 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ D.T. +++$+++ You mean shut your ass down!
L368136 +++$+++ u6471 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ MARVOSA +++$+++ So what is they have enough to shut us down!
L368135 +++$+++ u6467 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ D.T. +++$+++ So what?
L368134 +++$+++ u6471 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ MARVOSA +++$+++ He walked in on Fleming and took him out.
L368133 +++$+++ u6471 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ MARVOSA +++$+++ The shit just hit the fan, brother. That bitch has a partner and he got away from me.
L368132 +++$+++ u6467 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ D.T. +++$+++ What do you need?
L368131 +++$+++ u6471 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ MARVOSA +++$+++ It's Marvosa -
L368439 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Well why don't you sit this one and get some rest...you look like shit. CUT TO INT TUBBS' APARTMENT - NIGHT
L368438 +++$+++ u6471 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ MARVOSA +++$+++ It's just...catching up with me, you know?
L368437 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Something wrong with you Marvosa?
L368434 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ That's got to our secret agent man! Do we have an address?
L368433 +++$+++ u6471 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ MARVOSA +++$+++ Outside hacker?  What the fuck are you talking about?
L368429 +++$+++ u6471 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ MARVOSA +++$+++ Hey what they did on their time was their business, you know?  I just want to catch this scumbag, wherever he is.
L368428 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Just wondering if maybe they had a thing going with this hooker, you know, some connection.
L368426 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Where do you come from, Marvosa?
L368425 +++$+++ u6471 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ MARVOSA +++$+++ Gotta come from somewhere...
L368424 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ It's kind of a funny coincidence, isn't it?
L368423 +++$+++ u6471 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ MARVOSA +++$+++ What?
L368422 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Well don't you think that's odd?
L368421 +++$+++ u6471 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ MARVOSA +++$+++ Yeah I saw 'em around.  They worked vice.
L368420 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ So you must have known Fleming... and Stanton -
L368419 +++$+++ u6471 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ MARVOSA +++$+++ Yeah...
L368418 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Did you start out area six?
L368417 +++$+++ u6471 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ MARVOSA +++$+++ Nineteen eighty four.  What fucking difference does it make?
L368416 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ When did you join the force?  You know, the police force, the place you work...
L368415 +++$+++ u6471 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ MARVOSA +++$+++ What?
L368403 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Our getaway car.  You said a cell phone?
L368402 +++$+++ u6471 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ MARVOSA +++$+++ What's this?
L368284 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Fine -
L368283 +++$+++ u6471 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ MARVOSA +++$+++ I'll take the south end -
L368282 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ I'm sure you can handle it.  Now I want to do an alley-to alley sweep beginning at the north and south ends from Marine to 30th.  Foot beat units continue on the boardwalk.
L368281 +++$+++ u6471 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ MARVOSA +++$+++ These crowds are going to make it a bitch!
L368280 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ If you can trail him to a remote area do it. We all want a piece of him but let's keep our heads and stay within the law - we got people everywhere out here.

L368241 +++$+++ u6471 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ MARVOSA +++$+++ I don't know, shit.  Maybe she was looking for love...
L368240 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ But what was a hair dresser from Malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?
L368239 +++$+++ u6471 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ MARVOSA +++$+++ So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play.
L368238 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.
L368237 +++$+++ u6471 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ MARVOSA +++$+++ What did the six-toes have to say?
L368202 +++$+++ u6468 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ I didn't hit shit!
L368201 +++$+++ u6471 +++$+++ m430 +++$+++ MARVOSA +++$+++ Did you hit him?
