L431285 +++$+++ u6964 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ NOLAN +++$+++ Yeah, considerin' they was usin' my head for a baseball!
L431284 +++$+++ u6954 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ FATHER BARRY +++$+++ You all right, Nolan?
L431274 +++$+++ u6964 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ NOLAN +++$+++ Deef 'n dumb. Somethin' c'n happen right in front of our noses and we don't see nothin'. You know what I mean. No matter how much we hate the torpedoes we don't rat.
L431273 +++$+++ u6954 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ FATHER BARRY +++$+++ D 'n D?
L431272 +++$+++ u6964 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ NOLAN +++$+++ Father, one thing you got to understand. On the dock we've always been D 'n D.
L431271 +++$+++ u6954 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ FATHER BARRY +++$+++ Now listen, if you know who the pistols are, if you see them on the dock every day, are you going to keep still until they cut you down one by one?  Are you? Are you? How about you, Nolan?
L431264 +++$+++ u6954 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ FATHER BARRY +++$+++ Have a seat. I'm trying to find out just what happened to Joey Doyle. Maybe you can help.
L431263 +++$+++ u6964 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ NOLAN +++$+++ Who asked him here?
L431683 +++$+++ u6955 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ GLOVER +++$+++ Sure... .
L431682 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Where you going? I'll walk along with you.
L431681 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Yeah, really!
L431680 +++$+++ u6955 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ GLOVER +++$+++ Really?
L431679 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Looping right! I never swung wild. I was strictly a short puncher— hooks— over 'n under—  — whop-whop!
L431678 +++$+++ u6955 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ GLOVER +++$+++ Well, I better get going. Hit those stairs again.  Was that a looping right or an uppercut the first time you caught him?
L431677 +++$+++ u6955 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ GLOVER +++$+++ Yeah?
L431676 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Yeah. My own blood— and they sell me out for a lousy bet— I had it in me to hit the top and—  Boy, if I wanted to, the things I could tell you about them guys— 
L431675 +++$+++ u6955 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ GLOVER +++$+++ I'll never forget it. I thought it was all over.
L431674 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Remember the first round how I had him against the ropes, and—
L431673 +++$+++ u6955 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ GLOVER +++$+++ I'm just resting my feet.
L431672 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Listen, this ain't for publication.
L431671 +++$+++ u6955 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ GLOVER +++$+++ Such as what?
L431670 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Yeah. Johnny Friendly and my brother had other ideas.
L431669 +++$+++ u6955 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ GLOVER +++$+++ You sure looked it. Something go wrong?
L431668 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ If I licked him I would have had the title shot instead of him— boy, I was ready that night.
L431667 +++$+++ u6955 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ GLOVER +++$+++ I think you could have.
L431666 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ You want to know something— I would have taken Wilson—
L431665 +++$+++ u6955 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ GLOVER +++$+++ I thought you were going to take him that night but...
L431664 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Wilson— yeah—  yeah— I fought Wilson.
L431663 +++$+++ u6955 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ GLOVER +++$+++ Didn't I see you fight in the Garden one night three or four years ago? With a fellow called Wilson?
L431662 +++$+++ u6955 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ GLOVER +++$+++ Well, it'll be worth it if we can tell the waterfront story the way the people have a right to hear it. Don't you think?
L431661 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ I guess it's pretty tough work at that.
L431660 +++$+++ u6955 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ GLOVER +++$+++ Not exactly. Just thought I'd sit down and rest my dogs a minute.  You know the next investigation we get into I hope it's got buildings with elevators in them. This one has been nothing but climbing stairs. And when we hit the top ßoor the folks are usually out.
L431659 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ You looking for me?
L431510 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ You know what you're askin'? You're askin'—
L431509 +++$+++ u6955 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ GLOVER +++$+++ You can bring a lawyer if you wish. And you're privileged under the Constitution to protect yourself against questions that might implicate you in any crimes.
L431508 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ I told you I don't know nothin' and I ain't saying nothin'.
L431507 +++$+++ u6955 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ GLOVER +++$+++ Be at the State House, Courtroom Nine, at ten o'clock tomorrow.
L431506 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ What?

L431161 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ I don't know nothing.
L431160 +++$+++ u6955 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ GLOVER +++$+++ We're getting ready to hold public hearings on waterfront crime and underworld infiltration of longshore unions.
L431159 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Waterfront— Crime— Commission— ?  What's that?

L431155 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ What about it?
L431154 +++$+++ u6955 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ GLOVER +++$+++ You're Terry Malloy, aren't you?
L431146 +++$+++ u6956 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ J.P. +++$+++ You'd be off the pier for good.
L431145 +++$+++ u6964 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ NOLAN +++$+++ ... .and you'll tell Johnny Friendly.
L431144 +++$+++ u6956 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ J.P. +++$+++ Raise a hand to me and... .

L431956 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ I'm glad what I done today, see? You give it to Joey, you give it to Nolan, you give it to Charley who was one of your own. You thought you was God Almighty instead of a cheap— conniving—good-for-nothing bum! So I'm glad what I done— you hear me? —glad what I done!
L431955 +++$+++ u6961 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Go on talkin'. You're talkin' yourself right into the river. Go on, go on... .

L431949 +++$+++ u6961 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ You want to know the trouble with you? You think it makes you a big man if you can give the answers.

L431540 +++$+++ u6961 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Guts! A crummy pigeon who's looking to get his neck wrung!  You should have  You should have known better than to trust this punched out brother of yours. He was all right hanging around for laughs. But this is business. I don't like goofoffs messing in our business.
L431537 +++$+++ u6961 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ I got it. Hot off the press.
L431536 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ How'd you get that.
L431535 +++$+++ u6961 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ He don't, huh?  Well, he knows thirty-nine pages worth of our operation.
L431534 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ You mean Kayo Nolan, the old timer? He doesn't know much.
L431533 +++$+++ u6961 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Oh, he did. Half an hour later a certain Timothy J. Nolan went into secret session with the Commission and he did all the talking.
L431532 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ It was a big nothing! The Father did all the talking.
L431531 +++$+++ u6961 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Nothing happened, he says. Some operator you got yourself there, Charley. One more like him and we'll all be wearing striped pajamas.
L431530 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Nothing happened, Johnny.
L431529 +++$+++ u6961 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ I thought you were gonna keep an eye on that church meeting.

L431094 +++$+++ u6961 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Takin' over this local, you know it took a little doin'. Some pretty tough fellas were in the way. They left me this—  —to remember them by.

L431087 +++$+++ u6961 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ OK— skip it, Einstein. How come you never got no education like the rest of us?
L431086 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Thirty-six— sev— aah I lost the count.
L431085 +++$+++ u6961 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ My favorite little cousin.

L431083 +++$+++ u6961 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Shut up. I like the kid.  Remember the night he took Farella at St. Nick's, Charley. We won a bundle. Real tough. A big try.
L431081 +++$+++ u6961 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ It's good for you. Develops your mind.
L431080 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Aw, you know I don't like to count, Johnny.

L431362 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ I can look at her, can't I? It's a free country.
L431361 +++$+++ u6962 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ MRS. COLLINS +++$+++ She's off limits for bums like you. Leave her alone.
L431360 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ I was only talkin' to her.
L431359 +++$+++ u6962 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ MRS. COLLINS +++$+++ You know what I mean. Leave her alone.
L431358 +++$+++ u6967 +++$+++ m465 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ What do you mean?
