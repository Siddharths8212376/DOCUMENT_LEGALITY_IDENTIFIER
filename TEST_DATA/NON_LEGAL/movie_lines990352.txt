L552490 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Speed?
L552489 +++$+++ u7923 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. QUIFFER +++$+++ Forty-five.  Still coming straight and fast. Twelve o' clock.
L552488 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ They must have been fired from Bromdingna - probably one of their new Vampire - 202's. They've got a range well over a hundred miles.
L552487 +++$+++ u7923 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. QUIFFER +++$+++ Just the missiles.
L552480 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Roger, keep calling them.  Knock off auto-pilot, Ace.
L552479 +++$+++ u7923 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. QUIFFER +++$+++ Missiles!  Sixty miles off, heading in fast.  Steady track, they look like beam riders.

L552164 +++$+++ u7923 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. QUIFFER +++$+++ I'm sorry, Major Kong.  I guess I was way out of line.
L552140 +++$+++ u7923 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. QUIFFER +++$+++ War?
L552139 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ War.
L552138 +++$+++ u7923 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. QUIFFER +++$+++ What?
L552137 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Then this is it.
L552873 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Skip it and jump, damn you!  This flak's so close, I can smell it.
L552872 +++$+++ u7924 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. TOEJAM +++$+++ Listen, King, old buddy.  On behalf---
L552867 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Forget it.
L552866 +++$+++ u7924 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. TOEJAM +++$+++ Gee, we hate to leave you like this, Major Kong.  But there isn't anything we can really accomplish by sticking around.
L552803 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Very interesting.
L552802 +++$+++ u7924 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. TOEJAM +++$+++ Yep, it's the CRM-114 code, all right.
L552793 +++$+++ u7924 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. TOEJAM +++$+++ Let's see...International Morse, I think ...K...E...O...P...E...R...E...C...A...L... L...M...I...S...T...A...K...E...O...P...E... Gee, I don't know, it seems to be some kind of code.
L552792 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ No kidding.
L552791 +++$+++ u7924 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. TOEJAM +++$+++ Some kind of signaling.
L552790 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ What does it look like?
L552763 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Damn you, Lieutenant Toejam!  Lothar!
L552762 +++$+++ u7924 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. TOEJAM +++$+++ Where'd they get you?
L552761 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Listen, I think I'm hit bad.
L552760 +++$+++ u7924 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. TOEJAM +++$+++ So am I.
L552706 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Lieutenant Toejam's going to help you in a minute.  Can you check your ECM?
L552705 +++$+++ u7924 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. TOEJAM +++$+++ I thought I should check out the damage first. My gear is busted up pretty bad.
L552444 +++$+++ u7924 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. TOEJAM +++$+++ Primary arming switch.
L552443 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Primary arming switch.
L552442 +++$+++ u7924 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. TOEJAM +++$+++ Ready, Major.
L552441 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Lieutenant Toejam, are you ready for Bim and Bam?
L552170 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Primary target the ICBM base at Laputa. One weapon fused for air burst at ten thou- sand.  Second weapon to be used if first malfunctions.  Otherwise the secondary gets it - the airfield outside of Karnak.  Fused air burst at ten thousand.
L552169 +++$+++ u7924 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. TOEJAM +++$+++ Roger, I'm setting up the CRM-114.
L552168 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Okay.  Check these points.  Complete radio silence.  To ensure that the enemy can't plant false transmissions and fake orders, the CRM-114 is to be switched into all receiver circuits.  The three code letters of the period are to be set on the alphabet dials of the CRM-114, which will in turn block any transmissions other than those preceded by the code letters. You got it?
L552150 +++$+++ u7924 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. TOEJAM +++$+++ Yeah, it sure looks like the real thing, all right.
L552149 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ No, this looks like the real thing.
L552132 +++$+++ u7924 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. TOEJAM +++$+++ That's what I'm doing, and it comes out the same.
L552131 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Check your code again.  No one at base would pull a stunt like that, Terry.
L552130 +++$+++ u7924 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. TOEJAM +++$+++ Wing attack, Plan-R.  That's exactly what it says.
L552128 +++$+++ u7924 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. TOEJAM +++$+++ I just got another blast on the CRM-114, and the damned thing decodes: Wing Attack, Plan-R.
L552127 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Yeah?
L552126 +++$+++ u7924 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. TOEJAM +++$+++ Hey, King.  Somebody at Burpelson has a very perverted sense of humor.
L552888 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Well, I just wanted you to know how I felt. Hell, I know Air Command wouldn't have taken you if you weren't okay.  And don't think I don't know some of our best ball-players and entertainers are of Negro descent.
L552887 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ Sure, King.
L552886 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ I just wanted you to know I didn't mean anything by it.
L552885 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ Forget it.
L552884 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Listen, Lothar.  You know that crack I made about your...butt?
L552883 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ Thanks, King.  I've always wanted to take one of these big babies in.
L552882 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ I'd be mighty proud if you did, Lothar.
L552881 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ King, would you mind if I keep me hands on the wheel when you take her in?
L552879 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ I thought maybe you'd like some company.
L552878 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Now what the hell did you want to go and do a thing like that for, Lothar?
L552877 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ I thought I'd go along for the ride.
L552876 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ What the hell are you doing here, Lothar?
L552875 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ We're on course, Major.  Just fixed our position on that river back there.
L552863 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Roger.
L552862 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ Well, it would probably help if you took it ...sort of...straight down.
L552861 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Would it matter if they hit at a flat angle? I mean, do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger?
L552860 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ I think it's okay, King.  They should go off on impact.
L552857 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ There's no other way, boys.  I'm going to have to take her in...the hard way.
L552856 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ Let me check.
L552855 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ There's no other way, Lothar.  Can you re-arm the bombs for impact?
L552854 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ But how are we going to drop the bombs if the doors won't ---  Hey, King....you're not thinking of --- You don't mean you'd --- ???
L552853 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ I asked you a question, Lothar!
L552852 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ But I TOLD YOU, I don't think we can get the bomb bay doors open.
L552851 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Lothar, can you arm the bombs for impact?
L552850 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ I tried everything.  Something must have gotten bent or twisted from the pounding we took.
L552849 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Have you tried the emergency system?
L552848 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ But I get a red light.
L552847 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Maybe the warning system's out.
L552846 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ Well, I can't get out and look, King.  But I don't get a green light.
L552845 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Are you sure?
L552844 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ Well, I hate to say this, but I think the bomb bay doors are stuck.
L552843 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ I'm okay.  What's up?
L552842 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ It's me - Lothar.  Are you okay?
L552841 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Who's that?
L552839 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Forget it.  Okay, team, let's break it up and get ready for the kick-off.
L552838 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ Sorry, King.
L552837 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ First lesson in War College:  Never under- estimate your enemy.
L552836 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ You're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball.
L552835 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ We crossed the coast over an hour ago. Okay?
L552834 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Okay, how do we know they didn't shoot down one of our planes and torture the crew?  How do we know that?
L552833 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ Come on, King.  That doesn't make sense.
L552832 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Nobody's loyalty is beyond question.  Besides, how do we know one of his staff didn't see it?
L552831 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ But the code is made up by General Ripper, and he's the only one left at the base who would know the code.
L552830 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ There are plenty of traitors and spies running around loose.
L552827 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Then get off my back!
L552826 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ Take it easy, Major Kong.
L552825 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Lieutentant Zogg, how would you like your black butt slung into a General Court Martial when we get back???
L552824 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ Look, King, maybe you've lost too much blood, or something.
L552823 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ I said that's the point!
L552822 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ I don't get you, King.
L552821 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ That's the point.
L552820 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ Right.  So how could we get any messages?
L552819 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ The CRM-114 is smashed, right?
L552818 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ Like hell it does.
L552817 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Then that settles it, doesn't it?
L552816 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ But the CRM-114 has been smashed for almost an hour.
L552815 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Our orders warn us to expect the enemy to use ingenuity in issuing contrary and confusing orders.  And therefore, to disregard anything that doesn't come on the CRM-114.
L552814 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ Look, this is different.
L552813 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Lieutenant Zogg, what do our orders say about the authentication of orders during an attack mission?
L552810 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ How the hell do I know?  Maybe the war's over.
L552809 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Why should they call us back?
L552808 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ They must have gotten it from the base. No one else would know it.
L552807 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ You tell me.
L552806 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ Wait a minute, Major.  "OPE," that's the recall code.  Where would they get that?
L552805 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Well, we sure as hell aren't going home just because the enemy tells us to.
L552804 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ What do you mean?
L552801 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L552800 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ I mean pulling a stunt like that.
L552799 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ What do you mean?
L552798 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ You sure have to hand it to those guys.
L552796 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ No, I think it means, "Recall period Mistake," and the OPE is probably the CRM-114 code. Terry?
L552795 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Recall what mistake?
L552794 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ No, look!  It's "OPE - Recall Mistake."
L552780 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Quentin, how's your gear?
L552779 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ I don't know what we got left besides Bim and Bam.
L552776 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Listen, give me a shot quick!
L552775 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ He's dead, all right.
L552774 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Hell, he looks dead.
L552773 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ How do you know he's dead?
L552772 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ In the back...feels like an arrowhead.
L552771 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ Where'd they get you?
L552770 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ Sure!  Sure, I'm on my way.
L552769 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ I bit his jugular vein.  Now will you shut up and get up here???
L552768 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ What happened?
L552767 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ He's dead.
L552766 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ Can't "Ace" help you?
L552765 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Lothar, get up here fast, and bring your First- Aid kit!  I'm hit kinda bad, I think.
L552764 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ Yes, Major.
L552698 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Binky?
L552697 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ Everything still checks out okay.
L552696 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Let's have a rundown on the damage, Lothar?
L552460 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ Master safety on.
L552459 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ All right, Lothat, that does it.  Master safety on now until bomb run.
L552458 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ Primary bomb is live.
L552457 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Master Kong.
L552456 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ Master safety.
L552454 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Check, ten thousand air burst.
L552453 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ Fusing for ten thousand air burst.
L552452 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Seond safety.
L552451 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ Second safety.
L552450 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ First safety.
L552449 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ Release first safety.
L552446 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Primary trigger switch.
L552445 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ Primary circuit is live.
L552298 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ As soon as I've checked over the route. About five minutes.  All right?
L552297 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ When do you want to arm the bomb for the primary, Major?
L552296 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Check, all bomb circuits green.  Okay, Lothar.
L552295 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ Bomb doors circuit is green, bomb release circuit is green, bomb fusing circuit is green.
L552294 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Check target approach.
L552182 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ Hellnno, Major.  I was just trying to think the thing through.
L552181 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Are you saying our order don't make sense?
L552180 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ Well, if they hit us first, they've probably fired off their missiles and got their planes off the ground already.  We'll just be hitting empty real estate.
L552179 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ What's your point, Lothar?
L552178 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ Well, if there's a war, they must have hit us first.
L552177 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ That's what I said.
L552176 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ Our targets are a missile complex and an airfield - not cities, right?
L552175 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ Shoot, Lothar.
L552174 +++$+++ u7925 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ LT. ZOGG +++$+++ I've got one.
L552173 +++$+++ u7926 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ MAJOR KONG +++$+++ In about twenty minutes we start losing height to keep under coastal radar.  Cross in over the coast low-level, continue low- level on zig-zag legs to primary, and climb for bomb run.  Any questions?
L552911 +++$+++ u7930 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ VON KLUTZ +++$+++ Certainly not, sir.  When they go down into the mine, everyone else will still be alive.  They will have no shocking memories, and the prevailing emotion should be one of a nostalgia for those
L552910 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ But, look here, Von Klutz.  Won't this nucleus of survivors be so shocked, grief-stricken, and anguished that they will envy the dead, and indeed, not wish to go on living?
L552909 +++$+++ u7930 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ VON KLUTZ +++$+++ When they emerge, a good deal of present real estate and machine tools will still be recoverable, if they are moth-balled in advance.  I would guess they could then work their way back to our present gross national product within twenty years.
L552907 +++$+++ u7930 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ VON KLUTZ +++$+++ A special committee would have to be appointed to study and recommend the criteria to be employed, but off-hand, I should say that in addition to the factors of youth, health, sexual fertility, intelligence, and a cross-section of necessary skills, it would be absolutely vital that our top government and military men be included, to impart the required principles of leadership and tradition.
L552906 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ But who would be chosen?
L552905 +++$+++ u7930 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ VON KLUTZ +++$+++ It would not be difficult.  Nuclear reactors could provide power almost indefinitely. Greenhouses could maintain plant life. Animals could be bred and slaughtered. A quick survey would have to be made of all the suitable minesites in the country, but I shouldn't be surprised if several hundred thousand of our people could be accomodatedd. Every nation would undoubtedly follow suit.
L552904 +++$+++ u7930 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ VON KLUTZ +++$+++ Mister President, man is an amazingly adaptable creature.  After all, the conditions would be far superior to those, say, of the Nazi concentration camps, where there is ample evidence most of the wretched creatures clung desperately to life.
L552903 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ But they couldn't come out for a hundred years!
L552902 +++$+++ u7930 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ VON KLUTZ +++$+++ In a matter of weeks, sufficient improvements for a dwelling space could be provided.
L552901 +++$+++ u7930 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ VON KLUTZ +++$+++ Yes.  The radioactivity could not penetrate a mine some thousands of feet deep.
L552900 +++$+++ u7928 +++$+++ m536 +++$+++ PRESIDENT MUFFLEY +++$+++ At the bottom of mines?
L553704 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ You know, like, like, I would always think, uh, you know, what if I make the wrong move? But maybe there isn't any right move. You know? I mean, look at us. You know, we all dress the same, we all talk the same, we all fuck the same, we all watch the same TV. Nobody's really different, even if they think they're different. "Oh, boy, look at my tattoo, you know?" And see, that's what makes me freak. Because I can do anything I want, as long as I don't care about the result.
L553703 +++$+++ u7931 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ BEE-BEE +++$+++ Mm-hm.
L553702 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ You know? And it used to scare me so much that I didn't know what was coming in my life.
L553701 +++$+++ u7931 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ BEE-BEE +++$+++ Yeah, I guess.
L553700 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Yeah, but, when I was walking, I realized that he's stuck in that limo all the time. He's stuck with his interviews, he's stuck with his autograph, he has to do whatever his manager tells him to do, you know? He's not free. He's just part of the machine, and if you think about it, freedom's all that there really is.
L553699 +++$+++ u7931 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ BEE-BEE +++$+++ Well, sure, he's rich and he's famous. He's got everything and you've got nothing.
L553698 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Well, what it was... I, I don't want to admit it, but, you know, I was jealous of Pony.
L553697 +++$+++ u7931 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ BEE-BEE +++$+++ Yeah.
L553696 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ We were all riding around and it suddenly hit me what we were doing. We were getting off on the fact that we're in a car teen feet longer than all the rest. And I got out and I just started walking.
L553692 +++$+++ u7931 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ BEE-BEE +++$+++ It was like hell with windows. You know, there's shit on the walls. Kids my age sucking their thumbs. I mean, every day I would, I'd wake up in my cell and I'd think, my parents put me here. Why? Why? Because I stayed out all night one time. Uh, because I broke the VCR when I was drunk. Because I was out of control. I thought my parents loved me.
L553691 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ It was pretty bad, huh?
L553690 +++$+++ u7931 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ BEE-BEE +++$+++ Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
L553689 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab.
L553688 +++$+++ u7931 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ BEE-BEE +++$+++ No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
L553687 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
L553686 +++$+++ u7931 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ BEE-BEE +++$+++ Uh, ninety days. And now I just have to go once a week. See, I'm rehabilitated.
L553685 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ How long were you in there?
L553684 +++$+++ u7931 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ BEE-BEE +++$+++ Intense.
