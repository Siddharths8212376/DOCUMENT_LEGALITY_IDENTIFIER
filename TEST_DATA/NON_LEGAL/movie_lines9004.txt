L103200 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Yeah.
L103199 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Is it back in?
L103190 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Hang on a second.
L103189 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ But he didn't say anything.
L103156 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ That's not bad.
L103155 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Eight dollars.
L103154 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Holy shit. What'd I tell you?
L103153 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Five, seven, eight dollars.
L103152 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Yeah, I heard that.
L103151 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ It had an alarm.
L103150 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ No, just do it real quick.  I'll meet you down there.
L103149 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ That sets it off.
L103148 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ I don't think so. Just reach on in.
L103147 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Dignan, it's got an alarm.
L103146 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ I'm lookout.
L103145 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Yeah, I saw it.
L103144 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Did you see that?
L103143 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ That's not what I meant, Dignan.
L103142 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying.
L103141 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ How was I ridiculing you?
L103140 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
L103139 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Where are you going?
L103137 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Then you shouldn't of gone in there, Dignan. Maybe we should of robbed your house. Did you ever think of that?
L103136 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it.
L103135 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
L103134 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Every valuable item in the house was on that list.
L103133 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ The list, Dignan. I know you remember the list because you signed it. "Things Dignan was not supposed to touch."
L103128 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ I know about money, Anthony. I know the value of money. Plus the earrings are worth three times that.
L103127 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
L103126 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Anthony, we'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone. That's less than what it's appraised at.
L103114 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ What do you think the cops have?
L103113 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ It's got a V-8, Dignan.
L103097 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ She's an attractive older woman.
L103096 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ She's really kind of hot.
L103092 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ See, your mind is very good with the more mechanical details. Whereas my strength would be --
L103091 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Now that window can never be locked. It's impossible.
L103090 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Who knows? That's why I filed it down.
L103089 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Would they do that?
L103088 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ That's true. But what if they change the locks?
L103087 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
L103086 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Did you see what I meant about the window?
L103085 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ No. This is he.
L103084 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ This is he?
L103083 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ He says. This is he.
L103082 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ What does Starsky say?
L103081 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.
L103080 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.
L103079 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ As part of his plan. I don't know why.
L103078 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Why?
L103077 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ No. It's a real episode. The killer is leading him across the city by calling different pay phones.
L103076 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
L103075 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.
L103074 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Plus where's Huggie Bear?
L103073 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Dignan, it's --
L103072 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ OK. That's wrong.
L103071 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Right. The blond guy.
L103070 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ Making Hutch David Soul?
L103069 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
L103068 +++$+++ u603 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ DIGNAN +++$+++ What color hair does he have?
L104045 +++$+++ u611 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ MR. HENRY +++$+++ Because I was like you once. And there was no one there to help me.
L104044 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Why'd you want to help us?
L104043 +++$+++ u611 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ MR. HENRY +++$+++ Absolutely.
L104042 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
L104041 +++$+++ u611 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ MR. HENRY +++$+++ We're renegades from despair.
L104040 +++$+++ u611 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ MR. HENRY +++$+++ It's an esoteric journey.
L104039 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Yeah.
L104038 +++$+++ u611 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ MR. HENRY +++$+++ But you're thieves. It's what you are.
L104036 +++$+++ u611 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ MR. HENRY +++$+++ I want to ask a favor, boys. One day, when I'm long gone and all but forgotten, make one last toast to Abe Henry. And remember me as a friend.
L104035 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ This is good.
L104011 +++$+++ u611 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ MR. HENRY +++$+++ Anthony, I'm petrified.
L104010 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?
L104009 +++$+++ u611 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ MR. HENRY +++$+++ Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome.  I love palindromes.
L104008 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ No. Bob did.
L104007 +++$+++ u611 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ MR. HENRY +++$+++ The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini?
L104006 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Death.
L104005 +++$+++ u611 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ MR. HENRY +++$+++ Exactly. Woah.
L104004 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
L104003 +++$+++ u611 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ MR. HENRY +++$+++ Are you afraid?
L104002 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ I don't want to die.
L104001 +++$+++ u611 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ MR. HENRY +++$+++ No, that door over there.
L104000 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Me?
L103999 +++$+++ u611 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ MR. HENRY +++$+++ I'll tell you, Anthony. Times like this I get philosophical. What does it mean? What's it all about? Are you afraid to die?
L103986 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ That sounds like Dignan.
L103985 +++$+++ u611 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ MR. HENRY +++$+++ Well, he agreed 100% that Bob should be dropped. And he also agreed you were a liability. But he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses.
L103984 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ How'd he do?
L103983 +++$+++ u611 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ MR. HENRY +++$+++ Yes, he did.
L103982 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Did Dignan take the test?
L103981 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ It feels good.
L103980 +++$+++ u611 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ MR. HENRY +++$+++ How does that feel?
L103979 +++$+++ u611 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ MR. HENRY +++$+++ Take a deep breath.
L103978 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ That was a test?
L103977 +++$+++ u611 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ MR. HENRY +++$+++ The Abe Henry double-cross test. You just made a perfect score.
L103976 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ What do you mean?
L103975 +++$+++ u611 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ MR. HENRY +++$+++ Congratulations. You passed the test.
L103973 +++$+++ u611 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ MR. HENRY +++$+++ Hold it.
L103972 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ And you're wrong if you think, I'd turn my back on a friend.
L103970 +++$+++ u611 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ MR. HENRY +++$+++ As far as I can tell he hasn't thought his life through. He'd be fine cutting my grass or parking my car. But business?  You I can work with. You I could groom. Dignan's not going to make it.
L103969 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But --
L103968 +++$+++ u611 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ MR. HENRY +++$+++ Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods  up here.
L103967 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person.
L103966 +++$+++ u611 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ MR. HENRY +++$+++ I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?
L103965 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --
L103964 +++$+++ u611 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ MR. HENRY +++$+++ Tell me something. What the hell kind of name is Dignan?
L103963 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ So do I.
L103962 +++$+++ u611 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ MR. HENRY +++$+++ Look at that woman. She's what? Fifty? Fifty-five? But she hasn't let herself go. I appreciate an older woman who has a commitment to her body.
L103863 +++$+++ u611 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ MR. HENRY +++$+++ Yeah. And I'll tell you who we're going to want: Kumar Banijamali.
L103862 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ You mean a safecracker?
L103857 +++$+++ u611 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ MR. HENRY +++$+++ Yeah. Convert it into lofts. OK. Pop quiz. What's the single most important aspect of your job?
L103856 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ I'd like to live in that place. Hinckley Cold Storage.
L103853 +++$+++ u611 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ MR. HENRY +++$+++ Technique. That's right. Seventy- five percent of your job is crowd control. Seventy-five percent. Do you believe that?
L103852 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ You mean like techniques?
L103849 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Grammar.
L103848 +++$+++ u611 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ MR. HENRY +++$+++ Every once in a while some cat comes to me. He wants to know how I made it. How did I become a success?  The first thing I tell them is: follow your instincts. Let your instincts guide you. The second thing I tell them is, for Christ's sake: you got to know your grammar.
L103842 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Thanks.
L103841 +++$+++ u611 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ MR. HENRY +++$+++ You know, your form is for shit, but you've got a hell of a talent.
L103840 +++$+++ u611 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ MR. HENRY +++$+++ It's called a racquet, Anthony, and you're holding it wrong. That's ghetto play. Hold it like this.
L103839 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ It's hard to get much spin with this kind of paddle.
L103838 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Thanks.
L103837 +++$+++ u611 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ MR. HENRY +++$+++ That's a sharp jacket.
L103836 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Nice to meet you.
L103835 +++$+++ u611 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ MR. HENRY +++$+++ This is my business manager, Rowboat.
L104225 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Temporarily.
L104224 +++$+++ u601 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ It's in the driveway.
L104215 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ His health isn't very good, you know. They take that into account.
L104214 +++$+++ u601 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ We think Mr. Henry maybe --
L104166 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Who's got the car keys?
L104165 +++$+++ u601 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Yeah.
L104134 +++$+++ u601 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ I didn't do anything.
L104133 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Jesus, Bob.
L104106 +++$+++ u601 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ No.
L104105 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Let me see it.  Did you drop it?
L104104 +++$+++ u601 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on.
L104103 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ What are you doing?
L104068 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Sure.
L104067 +++$+++ u601 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ No, I know. I'm just saying. I feel fine. You want a piece of cake?
L104065 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Nothing. I was just asking.
L104064 +++$+++ u601 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ No, I'm having a heart attack. Of course, I'm OK. What's that supposed to mean?
L104063 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ You OK, Bob?
L104025 +++$+++ u601 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Hopscotch. The code name is hopscotch.
L104024 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Give him a second.
L103885 +++$+++ u601 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Cause you would of let my brother rot in jail.
L103884 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Yeah. Let's keep it --
L103879 +++$+++ u601 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ It was stupid.
L103878 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Let's not even talk about it.
L103760 +++$+++ u601 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Jesus Christ! No.
L103759 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Was Future Man adopted?
L103758 +++$+++ u601 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ No. I wasn't adopted.
L103757 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Well, because you guys don't look alike.
L103756 +++$+++ u601 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Why do you say that?
L103755 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Were you adopted, Bob?
L103754 +++$+++ u601 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
L103753 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ I thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality.
L103748 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Prison tatoos. I got to be pretty good. It's not like drawing on paper.
L103747 +++$+++ u601 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
L103746 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Yeah. One minute you're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend.
L103745 +++$+++ u601 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Sixty days?
L103744 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. That's partly why I was in custody so long. Sixty days.
L103739 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ I don't like that word prank, Bob. I was trying to do something more than a prank.
L103738 +++$+++ u601 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ That's pretty complicated for a senior prank.
L103737 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ It took six months of research. I did all the wiring myself. Switched AC to DC. Doubled the voltage. Shorted out the generator. The whole school was shut down.
L103736 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Well, I didn't mean to electrocute him. But the whole operation was my idea.
L103735 +++$+++ u601 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.
L103734 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ No, I don't mind.
L103733 +++$+++ u601 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
L103732 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Yes. You just got to stick with it.
L103731 +++$+++ u601 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ You think I'm improving?
L103730 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ You've only been playing for two weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to learn this game.
L103729 +++$+++ u601 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Cause I'm not getting any better. It's a waste of time.
L103728 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Why not?
L103727 +++$+++ u601 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ I'm not playing any more golf.
L103726 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Bob, where you going?
L103591 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Is that OK?
L103590 +++$+++ u601 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ What?
L103585 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ And if Future Man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. All right?
L103584 +++$+++ u601 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Anthony, I --
L103581 +++$+++ u601 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ I don't know. I don't know anything. Except Phil says they got him. And he's in jail.
L103580 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ How long are they going to hold him?
L103468 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ He looked too shaken-up.
L103467 +++$+++ u601 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ You think he got my license plates?
L103429 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ OK, Dad.
L103428 +++$+++ u601 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Will you guys shut up? God. It's like having two little kids in the car.
L103409 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Nobody does.
L103408 +++$+++ u601 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
L103407 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Why don't you just tell them the truth. Those belong to my neighbor Phil.
L103394 +++$+++ u601 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Move.
L103393 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ Where you going?
L103387 +++$+++ u601 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Phil probably provoked him.  Where's he going?
L103386 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ I hope not.
L103385 +++$+++ u601 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
L103384 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ There's a million places to hide around here.
L103383 +++$+++ u601 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop? He loves them.
L103351 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ What was that?
L103350 +++$+++ u601 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ BOB +++$+++ You'll probably have them the rest of your life.
L103334 +++$+++ u599 +++$+++ m38 +++$+++ ANTHONY +++$+++ See you, Bob.
