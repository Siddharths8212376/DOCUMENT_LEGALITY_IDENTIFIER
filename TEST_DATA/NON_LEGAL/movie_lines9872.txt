L249953 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I don't know.
L249952 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Well, are you going out again?
L249951 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Fine.
L249950 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ How'd it go?
L249949 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Yeah, I went on a date last week.
L249948 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Yeah? You got a lady now?
L249947 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I know, but the joke's better if I tell it in the first person.
L249946 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ You've never been on a plane.
L249945 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You know, I was on this plane once. And I'm sittin' there and the captain comes on and is like "we'll be cruising at 35,000 feet," and does his thing, then he puts the mike down but forgets to turn it off. Then he says "man, all I want right now is a blow-job and a cup of coffee." So the stewardess goes runnin' up towards the cock-pit to tell him the mike's still on, and this guy in the back of the plane goes "don't forget the coffee!"
L249918 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ So if I asked you about art you could give me the skinny on every art book ever written...Michelangelo? You know a lot about him I bet. Life's work, criticisms, political aspirations. But you couldn't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. You've never stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling. And if I asked you about women I'm sure you could give me a syllabus of your personal favorites, and maybe you've been laid a few times too. But you couldn't tell me how it feels to wake up next to a woman and be truly happy. If I asked you about war you could refer me to a bevy of fictional and non-fictional material, but you've never been in one. You've never held your best friend's head in your lap and watched him draw his last breath, looking to you for help. And if I asked you about love I'd get a sonnet, but you've never looked at a woman and been truly vulnerable. Known that someone could kill you with a look. That someone could rescue you from grief. That God had put an angel on Earth just for you. And you wouldn't know how it felt to be her angel. To have the love be there for her forever. Through anything, through cancer. You wouldn't know about sleeping sitting up in a hospital room for two months holding her hand and not leaving because the doctors could see in your eyes that the term "visiting hours" didn't apply to you. And you wouldn't know about real loss, because that only occurs when you lose something you love more than yourself, and you've never dared to love anything that much. I look at you and I don't see an intelligent confident man, I don't see a peer, and I don't see my equal. I see a boy. Nobody could possibly understand you, right Will? Yet you presume to know so much about me because of a painting you saw. You must know everything about me. You're an orphan, right?
L249917 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ No.
L249916 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ You've never been out of Boston.
L249915 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Why thank you.
L249914 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ You're just a boy. You don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about.
L249913 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ No.
L249912 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ I was thinking about what you said to me the other day, about my painting. I stayed up half the night thinking about it and then something occured to me and I fell into a deep peaceful sleep and haven't thought about you since. You know what occurred to me?
L249911 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ So what's with this place? You have a swan fetish? Is this something you'd like to talk about?
L249877 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Time's up.
L249876 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ If you ever disrespect my wife again...I will end you.
L249875 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ That's it isn't it? You married the wrong woman. She leave you? Was she bangin' someone else?
L249874 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Watch your mouth.
L249873 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Maybe you married the wrong woman.
L249872 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Maybe you should be a patient and sit down.
L249871 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Maybe what mea--
L249870 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ --Well, maybe that means you.
L249869 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Sure, how 'bout "still waters run deep"--
L249868 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You ever heard the saying, "any port in a storm?"
L249867 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Oh, "Starry Night" time, huh?
L249866 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I think you're one step away from cutting your ear off.
L249865 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ What is?
L249864 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ The color here, see how dark it is? It's interesting.
L249863 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ What does?
L249862 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Poor color composition, lousy use of space. But that shit doesn't really concern me.
L249861 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Tell me what you really think.
L249860 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ This is a real piece of shit.
L249859 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Crayons?
L249858 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ No.
L249857 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Yeah. Do you paint?
L249856 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Oh.
L249855 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ 285.
L249854 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Free weights. WILL Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench?
L249853 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Nautilus?
L249852 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Yes, I do.
L249851 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You're right. It really gets in the way of my jazzercizing.
L249850 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Guy your age shouldn't smoke so much. Stunt your growth.
L249849 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Whatever blows your hair back.
L249848 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ You think so?
L249847 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You people baffle me. You spend all this money on beautiful, fancy books-- and they're the wrong fuckin' books.
L249846 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ How about Noam Chomsky's "Manufacturing Consent?"
L249845 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ "A History of the United States, Volume I." If you want to read a real history book, read Howard Zinn's "A People's History of the United States." That book will knock you on your ass.
L249844 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Yeah, it did take me a long time.
L249843 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ That must have taken you a long time.
L249842 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ I did.
L249841 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I'm not here for a fuckin' book report. They're your books, why don't you read 'em?
L249840 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ What did you think?
L249839 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Yeah, I read those.
L249838 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ How about the ones on that shelf?
L249837 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Probably not.
L249836 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Have you read all these books, Will?
L249835 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Did you buy all these books retail, or do you send away for like a "shrink kit" that comes with all these volumes included?
L250288 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Goodbye.
L250287 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Take care.
L250286 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ I love you, Will.  No take-backs.
L250285 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Yeah.
L250284 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ I never cared about that.
L250283 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I just wanted to call before you left.  I'm takin' all these job interviews. So I won't just be a construction worker.
L250270 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ You know what I want to hear? I want to hear that you don't love me. If you tell me that, then I'll leave you alone. I won't ask any questions and I won't be in your life.
L250269 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Don't bullshit me! Don't fuckin' bullshit me!
L250268 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ I don't want to "save" you. I just want to be with you. I love you. I love you!
L250267 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ What, you want to come in here and save me? Is that what you want to do? Do I have a sign that says "save me" on my back?
L250266 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Yes I do. Did you ever think that maybe I could help you? That maybe that's the point, that we're a team?
L250265 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You don't want to hear that I got cigarettes put out on me when I was a little kid. That this isn't surgery
L250264 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Yes, I do, Will.
L250263 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ No, you don't want to hear that.
L250262 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Yes, Will. I didn't even know that?
L250261 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Oh, is that what this is about? You want to hear that I don't really have any brothers? That I'm a fuckin' orphan? Is that what you want to hear?
L250260 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ What about your twelve brothers?
L250259 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I'm not honest?
L250258 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ You're afraid of me. You're afraid that I won't love you back. And guess what? I'm afraid too. But at least I have the balls to it give it a shot. At least I'm honest with you.
L250257 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ What the fuck am I afraid of?!
L250256 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Fuck you! You think I want this? That money's a burden to me. Every day I wake up and I wish I could give that back. I'd give everything I have back to spend one more day with my father. But that's life. And I deal with it. So don't put that shit on me. You're the one that's afraid.
L250255 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ At least you have a mother.
L250254 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ I inherited that money when I was thirteen, when my father died.
L250253 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ --some prick from Stanford that your parents will approve of. Then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too.
L250252 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Is that what you think--
L250251 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ --Don't tell me about my world. You're the one that's afraid. You just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town and marry--
L250250 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Well, what aren't you scared of? You live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you're scared shitless to do anything else--
L250249 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ What am I scared of?
L250248 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Why won't you come with me? What are you so scared of?
L250247 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ What do you mean "What am I afraid of?"
L250246 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Then what are you afraid of?
L250245 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I'm not sayin' I'm not in love with you.
L250244 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Look, Will if you're not in love with me, you can say that.
L250243 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ One, because I have a job here and two because I live here--
L250242 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Why not?
L250241 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I can't go out to California.
L250240 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ "Take-back?" What is that? I don't want a take-back. I want you to come to California with me.
L250239 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ 'Cause that's a serious thing you're sayin'. I mean, we might be in California next week and you could find out somethin' about me that you don't like. And you might feel like "hey this is a big mistake."  But you can't take it back, 'cause you know it's real serious and you can't take somethin' like that back. Now I'm in California, 'cause you asked me to come. But you don't really want me there. And I'm stuck in California with someone who really doesn't want me there and just wishes they had a take-back.
L250238 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Yeah, I'm sure.
L250237 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ And you're sure about that?
L250236 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ I don't know. I just feel it.
L250235 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Yeah, but how do you know?
L250234 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ I know. I just do.
L250233 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ How do you know that?
L250232 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ I want you to come with me.
L250231 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ What?
L250230 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Come with me to California.
L250229 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ No.
L250228 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Will? Are you awake?
L250180 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ --When it came to stuff like that I could always just play.
L250179 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ --But you can do my O-chem lab in under an hour, you can--
L250178 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Not a lick. I look at a piano and I see black and white keys, three pedals and a box of wood. Beethoven, Mozart, they looked at it and it just made sense to them. They saw a piano and they could play. I couldn't paint you a picture, I probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway Park and I can't play the piano--
L250177 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ So, do you play the piano?
L250176 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Well all right, Beethoven. He looked at a piano and saw music. The fuckin' guy was deaf when he composed the Ode to Joy. They had to turn him around to take a bow because he couldn't hear the crowd going crazy behind him. Stone deaf. He saw all of that music in his head.
L250175 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.
L250174 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I'm trying to explain it to you. So you play the piano. When you look at the keys, you see music, you see Mozart.
L250173 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Come one Will. I just want to know.
L250172 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Do you play the piano?
L250171 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Yeah. Someone like you who divides his time, fairly evenly, between the batting cages and bars.
L250170 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Like me?
L250169 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Nobody does organic chemistry for "fun." It's unnecessary. Especially for someone like you.
L250168 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I guess so.
L250167 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Just for fun?
L250166 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Some, a little.
L250165 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Have you ever studied Organic Chemistry?
L250164 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I guess. I don't know. How do you remember your phone number?
L250163 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ All right, Mr. Nosey Parker. Let me ask you a question? Do you have a photographic memory?
L250162 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Instead you're going to bust your ass for five years so you can be broke? SKYLAR No, so I can be a doctor.
L250161 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Rich? I have an inheritance. It's two handred and fifty thousand dollars. That's exactly what it'll cost me, minus about five hundred bucks, to go all the way through med school. This is what I'm doing with that money. I could have done anything I wanted. I could have expanded my wardrobe, substantially.
L250160 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You're rich. What do you have to worry about?
L250159 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Clearly.
L250158 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Why is it important to you? If I inherited all that money, the only thing important to me would be workin' on my swing.
L250157 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ It's important that I learn this.
L250156 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ C'mon, give me a peek and we'll go to the battin' cages.
L250155 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ No.
L250154 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Want me to take a look?
L250153 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Fine.
L250152 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ How's it goin'?
L250070 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Not tonight.
L250069 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ I thought you said you'd show me your place.
L250040 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Then on behalf of my weiner, I'd like to ask for an advance.
L250039 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ You men are shameful. If you're not thinking of your weiner then you're acting on its behalf.
L250038 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I'd say...  It's only four in the mornin', they're prob'ly up.
L250037 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ What if I said I wouldn't sleep with you again until you let me meet your friends?
L250036 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Sometime. I don't know. Next week.
L250035 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ When?
L250034 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ All right, all right. We'll go.
L250033 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Is it me you're hiding from them or the other way around?
L250032 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Aah, it's kind of a hike.
L250031 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ I think I can make it to South Boston.
L250030 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ They don't come over here that much.
L250029 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ What about your friends? Or your brothers? When do I get to meet them?
L250028 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Exactly.
L250027 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ I've never seen your place.
L250026 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ 'Cause it's nicer than my place.
L250025 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ Why do we always stay here?
L249982 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Then let's go have some fun.
L249981 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ No.
L249980 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You're not going into surgery tomorrow are you?
L249979 +++$+++ u5616 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SKYLAR +++$+++ I'm supposed to understand this.
L249978 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Didn't your mother ever tell you not to look a gift horse n the mouth?
