L126017 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You telephoned me to meet you. I've been standing on the corner back there -- waiting for you.
L126016 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Hallo, Peter.
L125903 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Something modest but clean -- and near enough to UNESCO so you can take a cab when it rains -- okay?
L125902 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore.
L125901 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ We'll find you a hotel.
L125900 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I don't know where to go.
L125899 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Come on. You can't stay here.
L125898 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.
L125897 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Instant divorce you mean?
L125896 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I'm a simultaneous translator -- like Sylvie, only she's English to French -- I'm French to English. That's what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him.
L125895 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Doing what?
L125894 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose.
L125893 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Do you know what you're going to do?
L125892 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Charles sold it all -- at auction.
L125891 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Where did everything go?
L125889 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Yes it is -- I heard it this morning.
L125888 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I rang the bell but I don't think it's working.
L125887 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Thank you.
L125886 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ It's in all the afternoon papers. I'm very sorry.
L125885 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ How did you find out?
L125884 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.
L125883 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L125822 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Is there only one Charles Lampert?
L125821 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Charles is.
L125820 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Are you in the book?
L125819 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me?
L125818 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ It's terrible -- you just made it up.
L125817 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ How do you know?
L125816 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Shakespeare never said that.
L125815 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
L125814 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ No, I'm not -- I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today.
L125813 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Now you're angry.
L125812 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Mr. Joshua.  Well, I've enjoyed talking with you.
L125811 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me. First it was separate rooms -- now we're trying it with cities. What do people call you -- Pete?
L125810 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Is your husband with you?
L125809 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ That wasn't a proposal -- I was just curious.
L125808 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yes, but we're divorced.
L125807 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Is there a Mrs. Joshua?
L125806 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Oh. I guess.
L125805 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Well, you go in and you ask for some toothpaste -- the small size -- and the man brings you the large size. You tell him you wanted the small size but he says the large size is the small size. I always thought the large size was the largest size, but he says that the family size, the economy size and the giant size are all larger than the large size -- that the large size is the smallest size there is.
L125804 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I'm not sure I --
L125803 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Yes, I am -- I'm compulsive about it -- dishonesty infuriates me. Like when you go into a drugstore.
L125802 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Well, you're honest, anyway.
L125801 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ No, you see, I don't really love him.
L125800 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Please, not on my account.
L125799 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce.
L125798 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Good for you.
L125797 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Yes.
L125796 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Is there a Mr. Lampert?
L125795 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I'm Regina Lampert.
L125794 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Peter Joshua.
L125793 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ The one you're blocking. This is the last chance I have -- I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon. What's your name?
L125792 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Sorry. Which view would you like?
L125791 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
L125790 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Clever fellow -- almost missed me.
L125788 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ You give up awfully easy, don't you?
L125787 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ How's that?
L125786 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Quitter.
L125785 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yes, of course. But you will let me know if anyone goes on the critical list 
L125784 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
L125783 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I don't know -- how would I know?
L125782 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Why, do you think we're going to?
L125781 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ He was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild.  We don't know each other, do we?
L125780 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ It's hers. Where'd you find him, robbing a bank?
L125779 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Oh, forgive me.  Is this yours?
L126407 +++$+++ u4425 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ TEX +++$+++ Yes, ma'am. A little one -- 'bout seven or eight years old. Th' little tyke keeps callin' you his Aunt Reggie -- ain't that cute?
L126406 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Can you give me one good reason why I should?
L126074 +++$+++ u4425 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ TEX +++$+++ You think on it real careful-like, Miz Lampert -- y'hear?
L126073 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Please stop -- please!
L126072 +++$+++ u4425 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ TEX +++$+++ It belongs to me, Miz Lampert -- an' if you don't give it to me your life ain't gonna be worth the paper it's printed on. You savvy what I'm sayin', Miz Lampert?
L126070 +++$+++ u4425 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ TEX +++$+++ Don't make too much noise, Miz Lampert --
L126069 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Stop that!
L126066 +++$+++ u4425 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ TEX +++$+++ Come on now -- sure you do. An' you'd better give it to me, Miz Lampert -- cuz I ain't foolin'. No sireebob!
L126065 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ No -- no, I'm don't.
L126064 +++$+++ u4425 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ TEX +++$+++ You know what I want, Miz Lampert...
L126063 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Wha -- what do you want?
L126062 +++$+++ u4425 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ TEX +++$+++ Howdy, Miz Lampert.
L125921 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I don't understa--
L125920 +++$+++ u4425 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ TEX +++$+++ Charlie had no call to handling it this-a-way. He sure didn't. No siree.
L125919 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Yes?
L125918 +++$+++ u4425 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ TEX +++$+++ Miz Lampert, ma'am...
L126781 +++$+++ u4424 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ SYLVIE +++$+++ We will separate -- you look over there.
L126780 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I don't see him.
L126779 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ A fortune! Hurry -- we've got to find him!
L126778 +++$+++ u4424 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ SYLVIE +++$+++ What?
L126777 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Those stamps -- they're worth a fortune!
L126776 +++$+++ u4424 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ SYLVIE +++$+++ What's the matter, chérie?
L126775 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Good Lord! The stamps! Where is he? Sylvie -- we've got to find him!
L126774 +++$+++ u4424 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ SYLVIE +++$+++ The stamp market, of course -- it is here every Thursday afternoon. This is where Jean-Louis trades his --
L126773 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I'm glad. But what's all this?
L126772 +++$+++ u4424 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ SYLVIE +++$+++ He was so excited -- when he got the stamps you gave him this morning. He said he had never seen any like them.
L126771 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ What's he up to?
L126770 +++$+++ u4424 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ SYLVIE +++$+++ Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.
L126769 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Sylvie -- ? What are you doing here?
L126725 +++$+++ u4424 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ SYLVIE +++$+++ Oh la vache!
L126724 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Hold it -- Italy just finished. They're recognizing Great Britain.
L126723 +++$+++ u4424 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ SYLVIE +++$+++ Don't be silly -- he would not do anything. He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age.
L126722 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I hope Jean-Louis understands about last night -- it's just not safe for him to be around me right now.
L125927 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I don't know.  But if this is a sample of American diplomacy I'm buying a fallout shelter.
L125926 +++$+++ u4424 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ SYLVIE +++$+++ What is it about?
L125925 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ The American Embassy.
L125924 +++$+++ u4424 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ SYLVIE +++$+++ Who is it from?
L125915 +++$+++ u4424 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ SYLVIE +++$+++ He's allergic to him.
L125914 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ How can you tell?
L125913 +++$+++ u4424 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ SYLVIE +++$+++ He must have known Charles pretty well.
L125912 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I've never seen him before.
L125911 +++$+++ u4424 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ SYLVIE +++$+++ Do you know him?
L125910 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Until two days ago all I really knew about Charles was his name -- now it turns out I didn't even know that.
L125909 +++$+++ u4424 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ SYLVIE +++$+++ Have you no idea who could have done it?
L125908 +++$+++ u4424 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ SYLVIE +++$+++ At least he knows how to behave at funerals.
L125907 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Don't ask me -- I'm only the widow.  If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't even have him.
L125906 +++$+++ u4424 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ SYLVIE +++$+++ Didn't Charles have any friends?
L125905 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ It's not exactly what I'd call a large turn-out.
L125827 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Don't you want me to stay?
L125826 +++$+++ u4424 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ SYLVIE +++$+++ He knows everything.
L125777 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I admit I moved to Paris because I was tired of American Provincial,
L125776 +++$+++ u4424 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ SYLVIE +++$+++ With a rich husband and this year's clothes you will not find it difficult to make some new friends.
L125775 +++$+++ u4424 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ SYLVIE +++$+++ But that is no reason to get a divorce!
L125774 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Because I don't love him.
L125773 +++$+++ u4424 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ SYLVIE +++$+++ But why do you want a divorce?
L125771 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I don't know how to explain it. I'm just too miserable.
L125770 +++$+++ u4424 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ SYLVIE +++$+++ But what?
L125769 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ He's the only husband I've got. I tried to make it work, I really have -- but --
L125768 +++$+++ u4424 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ SYLVIE +++$+++ Ça alors! From Charles?
L125767 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Sylvie -- I'm getting a divorce.
L125765 +++$+++ u4424 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ SYLVIE +++$+++ Va jouer, mon ange.
L125764 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Isn't there something constructive he can do -- like start an avalanche?
L126432 +++$+++ u4423 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ SCOBIE +++$+++ We want that money -- now!
L126431 +++$+++ u4425 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ TEX +++$+++ This ain't no game, Miz Lampert.
L126425 +++$+++ u4423 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ SCOBIE +++$+++ Who invited you?
L126424 +++$+++ u4425 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ TEX +++$+++ Howdy, Miz Lampert.
L126146 +++$+++ u4423 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ SCOBIE +++$+++ Then he gets it out of your share, not mine! Not mine!
L126145 +++$+++ u4425 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ TEX +++$+++ Shoot no, not after all these years.
L126140 +++$+++ u4425 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ TEX +++$+++ He took care of Charlie for us.
L126139 +++$+++ u4423 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ SCOBIE +++$+++ Yeah? What's that?
L126138 +++$+++ u4425 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ TEX +++$+++ Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- don't forget he done us a little ol' favor.
L126137 +++$+++ u4423 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ SCOBIE +++$+++ We took all the chances. The money belongs to us, not him!
L127158 +++$+++ u4436 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ KILLER +++$+++ Can I come in? I'll need to use the phone.
L127157 +++$+++ u4426 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ ANNETTE +++$+++ You do?
L127156 +++$+++ u4436 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ KILLER +++$+++ I think I know how to restore your reputation.
L127155 +++$+++ u4426 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ ANNETTE +++$+++ He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.
L127154 +++$+++ u4436 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ KILLER +++$+++ He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.
L127153 +++$+++ u4426 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ ANNETTE +++$+++ Why?
L127152 +++$+++ u4436 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ KILLER +++$+++ I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's aunt. He asked me to come talk to you.
L127151 +++$+++ u4426 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ ANNETTE +++$+++ Yeah?
L127582 +++$+++ u4427 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Ok!
L127581 +++$+++ u4430 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ I get the imports.
L127580 +++$+++ u4427 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ One more time.
L127542 +++$+++ u4430 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Don't flatter yourself. You'll be lucky to last ten seconds with me Ben.
L127541 +++$+++ u4427 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ That's an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting?
L127540 +++$+++ u4430 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Ok not your imports. All your other CDS and your K2 snowboard.
L127539 +++$+++ u4427 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Not my imports.
L127538 +++$+++ u4430 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ I get all your CDs.
L127263 +++$+++ u4430 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ Your mind is just twisted enough. I believe you'd do all this just to get a dip or two.
L127262 +++$+++ u4427 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress?
L127261 +++$+++ u4430 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN?
L127260 +++$+++ u4427 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ You want me to die? I thought you and I were tight.
L127259 +++$+++ u4430 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ I'm not fucking you. Not for all your CDS.
L127120 +++$+++ u4427 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Me too. I'm going to start telling people that I saw her drop to her knees and latch on to his unit vector.
L127119 +++$+++ u4430 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ I think it's funny.
L127108 +++$+++ u4427 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ As fucking if.
L127107 +++$+++ u4430 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ If I'm so all-used-up Ben, why do you try to hook me up non-stop?
L127106 +++$+++ u4427 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Exactly. Then he must be a virgin.
L127105 +++$+++ u4430 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ I never fucked Rod.
L127104 +++$+++ u4427 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ What I don't understand is why they asked Marliston if Rod was a virgin. They could have asked you Cindy.
L127103 +++$+++ u4430 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ CINDY +++$+++ I wonder why it's so important to know if they fucked?
L127102 +++$+++ u4427 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Yeah. Chris BERRINGER WAS PARKED OUTSIDE THE WINDOW.
L127288 +++$+++ u4448 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Calm down Brent.
L127287 +++$+++ u4428 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ BRENT +++$+++ I swear to God. It's her. She told Jody she was Kenny's 'AUNT LISA'. I'm getting this sickly feeling...
L127286 +++$+++ u4448 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ That's impossible.
L127285 +++$+++ u4428 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ BRENT +++$+++ IT'S LISA SHERMAN. But she still looks like we're eighteen.
L127201 +++$+++ u4428 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ BRENT +++$+++ Better than a pile of dead teenagers.
L127200 +++$+++ u4448 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ You tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we're going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands.
L127199 +++$+++ u4428 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ BRENT +++$+++ I'm going to tell them everything I know. I'm calling a town meeting for eight p.m.
L127198 +++$+++ u4448 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Focus on the present. You always want to change the past. Let's figure out what you are going to tell the parents today, not what you should told them yesterday.
L127197 +++$+++ u4428 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ BRENT +++$+++ is there anything you do?
L127196 +++$+++ u4448 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Oh GOD Brent, is there anything you don't feel guilty about?
L127195 +++$+++ u4428 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ BRENT +++$+++ If I'd gone public with this yesterday Annette Michaels might be alive today.
L127076 +++$+++ u4448 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Why not? You worried you might find out how much she actually knows?
L127075 +++$+++ u4428 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ BRENT +++$+++ So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
L127074 +++$+++ u4448 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ So?
L127073 +++$+++ u4428 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ BRENT +++$+++ She's my daughter, Tom.
L127072 +++$+++ u4448 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ The kids adore him. They confide in him. His patchouli reeking rear might know if Stacy and Rod were really virgins. Why didn't you ask Jody that?
L127071 +++$+++ u4428 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ BRENT +++$+++ Why'd you send for Lenny Marliston?
L127061 +++$+++ u4428 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ BRENT +++$+++ I just wanted to check that you were okay?
L127060 +++$+++ u4448 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Hi Jody.
L127057 +++$+++ u4448 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Fine, just don't mention the carving This is going to be a tough enough day as it is.
L127056 +++$+++ u4428 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ BRENT +++$+++ But I am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends.
L127055 +++$+++ u4448 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Good.
L127054 +++$+++ u4428 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ BRENT +++$+++ No.
L127053 +++$+++ u4448 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ You aren't planning to tell these kids that 'virgin' was tattooed into both Stacy and Rod, are you?
L127615 +++$+++ u4428 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ BRENT +++$+++ Run!
L127614 +++$+++ u4434 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ No!
L127294 +++$+++ u4428 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ BRENT +++$+++ Ok. Goodbye. Now get back to school.
L127293 +++$+++ u4434 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. You didn't say goodbye.
L127292 +++$+++ u4428 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ BRENT +++$+++ What did you hear?
L127291 +++$+++ u4434 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ No I wasn't.
L127290 +++$+++ u4428 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ BRENT +++$+++ You were eavesdropping.
L127284 +++$+++ u4428 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ BRENT +++$+++ Never mind darling. You go back to school. I don't want you missing anymore classes today.
L127283 +++$+++ u4434 +++$+++ m294 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Who is she Daddy?
