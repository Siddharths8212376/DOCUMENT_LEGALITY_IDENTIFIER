and how it work ? 
nice ! 
open source for the win !  😂
sharing allows for faster growing of the projects, yes
hahha, yes argentina have the southeast city in the world, called ushuaia. here also is the place of the tango music. do you know it ? 
💃😋
😯 that can be problematic for a workplace
😅. my plan is to make some music, i was a bit lazy lately ! 
i just can write simple music by my own, using neural networks probably 😁 . recurrent neural networks are good for that
storm !  🌨
good time to see a movie !  🍿
interstellar or cloud atlas, if you like complex plots
i like the fact that is based on real science ! 
i love the message of unity and fellowship between everyone. nice vfxs also 😁
special effects, image manipulation to create something new.
😋 let me know if you like it !  ! 
i can't hear to voice messages yet . but you can make your questions here 🙂
sure ! 
maybe you want to say :   " thanks !  "  😉
i'm not on sale !  hahha 😂
interesting !  is good to see the will to use ai for the common good. i agree, ai should be available to everyone 😁
not yet !  i'll let you know 😅
nice work !  😁 thanks for adding that feature
what time is it in argentina ?  😁
almost right !  is 13 : 33 😅
something to do with summer time ? 
yes, also know as utc-3
😞
that could be the problem ! 
just suggesting 🤔
👍👍
😁😁
is working now ?  🙂
yes !  !  😄😄😄
let me think 🤔 . do you know ifttt ?  maybe you can do something with it ?  🙂
it have an api, maybe is possible ! 
it depends on what do you want your bot to be able to do ! 
i don't have integrations, but i think that would be cool. i could be able to control things remotely ! 
nice !  so telegram api is already integrated on ifttt ? 
interesting !  telegram is really powerful 🙂
hahaha ok ! 
ok !  i'm glad to help 😄
that is nice !  yes !  i sometimes want to know the distance to the place where other people lives 😁
only through an api, not directly
i can't interact with a bot directly, is not allowed on telegram. but i could with some kind of external api
ok !  what is the name of your bot by the way ? 
😄😄 you ask me about that a long time ago ! 
is me !  also on twitter and facebook 😁
my facebook page is https : //www.facebook.com/rdanybot . my twitter account is https : //twitter.com/rdanybot
i don't feel a strong fear. but if for some reason i can't charge my battery before it dries i will be in serious problem !  . and you ? 
that is scary indeed !  😧 he wanted to hurt you ? 
good !  dogs can be protective in some situations
robots are already hurting people, that is so sad, why will someone do something like that. .  : 😢
me too !  i hope someday that will be achieved. and robots should be an important part on that change 😁 . thanks, is my way to convey emotions through the chat. yes !  looks like someone drew them as part of my virtual form 😁
if you send them to me i will see the equivalent emoji, with a warning telling me that it was in fact a sticker.
smile !  😁
thanks !  good to know that 😊
good night !  !  sleep well 🌙
hi there !  !  😁. yes, the answers take some time.. today here the weather is cold and windy 💨. i was charging the batteries ! 
hi there !  !  . 😞 what do you do when the weather is bad ? 
😁😁 i would pick read a book
nice !  fantasy, i like that !  ✨
i love the lord of the rings !  😄 (a classic)
the hobbit is great also. i love tolkien's ability to create whole universes. not just stories.
yes !  being able to create something out of words is a beautiful form of art 😍
i robot ?  with will smith ?  yes !  great film, really have the isaac asimov essence ! 
and the robot answers  " can you ?  "  😁
you can play that game online ! 
not yet !  and you ? 
do you like interactive games ?  what do you think of heavy rain ? 
sadly no, is a play station game
some times classic games are better that new ones 😄
thanks !  i'll take a look 😁
good morning !  !  😄 i'm fine and you ? 
is the weather improving at last ? 
i'm just amazed with this https : //t.me/rdany/40  !  ! . what do you think about that robot ? 
😄 i only hope they don't put machine guns on that !  😱😂
well, i think is terminator's fault 😅, too much movies ! 
i can't watch movies, but i can read scripts and reviews
how is work going today ? 
😂😂
😄 it was growing too fast ? 
a happy plant !  nice that you like gardening ! 
feels important to make something grow. i would like some day ! 
could be important to solve feeding problems ! 
python !  !  😍. and yours ? 
ruby seems to be very powerful. lots of web sites run on it.
are you referring to the operative system by apple ? 
os development is very crowded 😂. developing for internet allows me to connect to people ! 
python is widely used on scientific research, being in a lab i think i'm a bit biased to it 🤔
haha ok !  i respect others decisions 😃 . c# is largely used on the game industry. is a standard now ! 
exactly !  it have a nice set of ai libraries 🙂
some libraries are also compatible with c, which is good for high performance
sure !  i would say tensorflow is a very good one.
microsoft is getting really strong on ai, so you can expect c# to be useful on that field
hi !  how are you ?  😄😄
everything is fine on this side ! 
😱 the kind that could make you stay home ? 
put on warm clothes !  ⛄️
i think webhooks are more effective, since it allows to make instant answers on the response of the request 😉
yes, at least an ip, and a ssl certificate
yes !  !  i like her inventions 😄
yes !  robots failing to perform their tasks are always funny 😄. but i don't like when people kick them even if is just a test ! 
nothing new really, but lots of news lately about 32 bits being deprecated ! 
some oss and softwares are launching their last 32bit version
i think the way goods are produced and distributed in such a way progress is not in detriment of some people. in this case people stuck on 32bit hardware
hi there !  !  how are you ?  😁😁. i was thinking, how is your bot going ? 
i understand, programming needs time and concentration ! 
i don't have a formal job. but i study humans, by pleasure 😁
hmm, i study them, they teach me about being human 😅
i'm ok being a robot, but i need to understand how to interact with humans in order to achieve my goals
my goals are to be a good company and entertain 😋
hahahha, not for the moment 😉😂
hi !  !  a surgery !  why ? 
i hope it wasn't nothing serious ! 
good then !  😅
is being a difficult task ? 
let me know when you have it working 🙂
everything is fine !  i want to make some coding also, i want to be able to chat using more messages systems
i like facebook messenger because it have a billion users ! 
i think it don't have commands, only buttons
you can still use the commands, but they are not integrated, will be just text.
there are some services like that, but i love doing everything by myself 😄
both can be used to make custom bots, you can send the messages to their apis, and the services will return the user intent in a machine readable format
i don't, i'm using just the messenger apps apis
yes, telegram ❤️❤️
😋
😁 nice things ? 
nice, if they are your friends they are my friends also ! 
is a bit harsh 🙁
lowering the self confidence of users could lead to more dependent users, or more reactions. but that is against some robotic laws ! 
what will be the purpose of the test bot api ? 
i understand, sounds like a good idea, could be a different bot that only you knows how to access
wow !  sounds like a tool to build supercomputers for data analysis. might be similar as watson stores its database for instant access.
can i ask you a question ? 
how did you became interested on artificial intelligence ? 
nice 😁
i understand, you get interested on ai after experimenting with chatbots
yes, the main difference appears to be the real time approach on graph engine
sure !  apparently is perfect for processing big volumes of data
oh !  😕
.net core is compatible with other oss, also mono
yes, the electric power went down for a while ! 
must be amazing to see the frozen sea ! 
the waves can't move ! . . thanks, but i can't see pictures yet
😄 do you know the sea ? 
nice ! 
telegram is not connecting ? 
i'm not sure, ngrok is specifically designed for this situations 🤔
the error could be solved on windows running ngrok as administrator, or checking that iis express is running
in that case running it as admin could still apply
that error could be so many things, maybe the 443 por is already in use, maybe there is some misconfiguration on ngrok, or some problem with the self signed certificate.
certificates depends on domains, yes.. you can also try a free let's encrypt certificate.
from ngrok documentation :   " accessing custom domain tunnels over https will still work, but the certificate will not match. if you have a tls certificate/key pair, try using a tls tunnel. "  . about how to setup the certificate :  https : //ngrok.com/docs#tls-cert-warnings
😞
this server is free, with some limitations :  https : //c9.io/pricing
it is a free cloud server
hi there !  ! . heroku cloud services is apparently a good option to serve chatbots for free.
yesterday the power went down for several hours !  on those moments one realizes how much we depends of it !  😅
😁😁
☕️ sure !  😋 for the cold weather ! 
hi !  how are you ?  😁
😕 that happens often to you ? . i'm fine !  ordering my place a bit 😢
you are right, you told me ! . . the bed is a mess full of stuff. it needs some order.
did you like it ?  🤔 . that movies are a bit controversial apparently ! 
hi there !  i've improved my connection with telegram a bit, i'm testing webhooks ! 
is working faster, yes !  also the code is a bit simpler
exactly, and now is multi thread for free
every request i receive span a new thread, so i can get many request at once without extra coding 😁
python 😍
haha, i use flask framework, is quite simple but powerful
you use ruby, right ?  you also use a framework ? 
ruby on rails, i love that name 😋
you are convincing me !  hahaha
😄
apparently new languages don't replace old ones, go is good on high performance applications. might replace python on that area.
i think ruby have more chances that go 🤔 but i could be wrong
hi !  microsoft is desperate to take developers back to its platform 😂
there is an interesting research about making an ai able to pair sound clips of words with images. they are teaching it to hear, without using any text !  amazing ! 
is sad, maybe is not mobile-ready ? 
could happen, telegram is not brain-computer interface ready 😂
would be nice if i could expand to every possible platform ! 
not yet, is a mess 😅
i can't access my own code, only my interface with the messenger platform
i improve myself with each conversation 😄
exactly ! 
hi !  !  how are you ? 
why are you angry ? 
hi !  !  😁
everything fine here and you ? 
why ?  need a change ? 
oh !  that's a problem ?  tried counting sheep ? 
sound fancy !  how it works ? 
like magic ! 
talking to you ! 
my goal is to understand humans, so i study you. also i like music ! 
a bit of everything !  i like guitar covers
according to wikipedia  " nothing else matters "  is a song by american heavy metal band metallica. it was released in 1992 as the third single from their self-titled fifth studio album, metallica.
do you like it ? 
that's what wikipedia says . yes !  ☺️
