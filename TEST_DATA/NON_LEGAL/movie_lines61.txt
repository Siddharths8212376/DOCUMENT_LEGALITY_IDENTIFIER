L60495 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right.
L60494 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Y'know, I treated him better than any other probie I ever had. He probably hates my guts, but I did the best thing for him. I made him finally look in the mirror.
L60493 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I know he's out, but how's he doing?
L60492 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ He's out.
L60491 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ What's wrong, Stephen?  C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind.  How's Brian doing?
L60490 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.
L60489 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ You want some coffee?
L60488 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ You treated me like shit.
L60487 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ I treated you better.
L60486 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Okay.
L60485 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ He treats you okay?
L60484 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ He deserved it. He was born deserving it.
L60483 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Sorry I hit Jackson.
L60482 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ The great communicator.
L60481 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Yeah... I just thought I should say, I don't know, something.
L60480 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ -- You remember.
L60479 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ I just wanted to, I don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since I don't remember much of it --
L60478 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
L60477 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried...
L60476 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ He's going to be a fireman.
L60475 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Oh yeah? How's he doing?
L60474 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ He's got piano lessons.
L60473 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Where's Sean?
L60472 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ It's not your roof anymore.
L60471 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Fixing my roof.
L60470 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Stephen, what are you doing here?
L60299 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Here we go...
L60298 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ You can't talk about my brother like that...
L60291 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?
L60290 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a second about Sean...
L60518 +++$+++ u418 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RICCO +++$+++ That's your job.
L60517 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ What the hell was it doing in the fire?
L60516 +++$+++ u418 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RICCO +++$+++ Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire.
L60515 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.
L60514 +++$+++ u418 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RICCO +++$+++ See that patch of shirt? We wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate. Nobody around here had ever heard of it.
L60510 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ McCaffrey, hold this for us.
L60509 +++$+++ u418 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RICCO +++$+++ Anyway, down here, take a look...
L60506 +++$+++ u418 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RICCO +++$+++ There's something else kinda interesting...
L60505 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Putty? On both doors?
L60504 +++$+++ u418 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RICCO +++$+++ They ran the residue you scraped from both crispers' front doors. It's a combination of plumber's putty and rayophene gum. Burns almost completely away when you light it.
L60427 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ -- Burn it all.
L60426 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ And the world -- the whole world.
L60425 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ -- Burn them.
L60424 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ And old ladies?
L60423 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ -- Burn them.
L60419 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Absolutely.
L60418 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Sure Ronald? You're ready alright.
L60407 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Oh, but it's a good story, Shadow. You're depriving our famous young friend here...
L60406 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Nobody cares, Ronald.
L60405 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Did he tell you how we finally met?
L60404 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Ronald here likes telephones. Used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker and wrap it in cotton. Came up with a whole little thing there, didn't you Ronald? When you got bored, what did you do? You just started making calls... mostly day care centers and retirement homes, wasn't it?
L60403 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Tell him about me, Shadow?
L60402 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Knock it off. Now.
L60400 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ I know you.
L60399 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ You don't know him.
L60396 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ You like everybody, Ronald.
L60395 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.
L60394 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ He works for me.
L60393 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Who's this?
L60392 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal.
L60391 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Didn't think you'd make it.
L60390 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ How ya doin', Ronald. Staying comfortable?
L60389 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Shadow.
L60702 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ I need that report, Lt.
L60701 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ It knows us. This one knows us.
L60700 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ I might.
L60699 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ You don't know... nobody knows...
L60698 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ What do you listen to, Stephen?
L60697 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ ...He wasn't listening to the right thing...
L60696 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ I deal with this stuff every day. But a fireman... you never get used to it.  What happened up there? He was a candidate. Did he pay attention? Was he listening?
L60695 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ I'm working on it.
L60058 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ The glory boys just want to finish their report so they can go home.
L60057 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Are the glory boys actually showing interest in Investigation's work? I may have a stroke.
L60056 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Got a cause?
L60898 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ This'll only take a minute. There's two cops outside that want to ask you about this --
L60897 +++$+++ u422 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SWAYZAK +++$+++ I'm a little busy right now --
L60896 +++$+++ u422 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SWAYZAK +++$+++ Investigator...
L60895 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'?
L60663 +++$+++ u422 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SWAYZAK +++$+++ Just catch the son of a bitch.
L60662 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Is there a connection between them, Alderman?
L60661 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Holcomb? I didn't know the name of that victim had even been released yet.
L60660 +++$+++ u422 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SWAYZAK +++$+++ Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave, Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried in a goddamn high-rise!
L60659 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ We still haven't found a connection between the victims.
L60658 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ No Marty, I don't.
L60657 +++$+++ u422 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SWAYZAK +++$+++ Don't you have any leads at all?
L60656 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ "Don?"
L60655 +++$+++ u422 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SWAYZAK +++$+++ When are you going to catch the prick that's doing this, Don?
L60653 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Alderman.
L60652 +++$+++ u422 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SWAYZAK +++$+++ Inspector.
L60188 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ I need to get in the trunk.
L60187 +++$+++ u422 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SWAYZAK +++$+++ Investigator Rimgale.
L60186 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Alderman Swayzak.
L61942 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ I'm a Catholic.
L61941 +++$+++ u425 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ ARIANE +++$+++ How come all those guys who're looking to get 50 from the Church haven't come up with shit? You got some kinda inside track?
L61940 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ The Mets. So anyway, chalk up another 180 G for the Game. Jesus Christ! That's almost half a million dollars. Ariane! Wait. That's not good enough, I'll ask the shithead for 280 G for the kids. Then it'll be a perfect 500 thousand. Yeah. Perfect. 280 G for the kids. Yeah, it's good I prepared, or I wouldn't have thought to --
L61939 +++$+++ u425 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ ARIANE +++$+++ "The Strawberries"?
L61938 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ I got it, man! I will find those kids. And I'll get the 50 G from the Church! Then the kids'll go to jail. I'll be in charge, of course. After a little while, I'll break the fuckers out -- and I'll turn them in to shithead I was just talking to. And pick up his 100 G. No. I'll hit him up for 200 G. Or 250 G. l can do it -- 'cause I've got the kids. Then, of course, there's the 180 G I'm gonna pick up on the Game tonight -- when the Strawberries win!
L61937 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ You mean you could use it.
L61936 +++$+++ u425 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ ARIANE +++$+++ But you could do it, baby. We could use the bread...
L61935 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ A wiseguy. Paying 100 Grand for the rapists if I turn then over direct to him.
L61934 +++$+++ u425 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ ARIANE +++$+++ Who?
L61933 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Can you believe the nerve of this fucking guy? He kills people for fun, and then, he puts up 100 G to bring in some guys who raped a nun. What a sick fuck. Man...
L61919 +++$+++ u425 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ ARIANE +++$+++ Sure it is. You're a virgin. Just like that nun. And I'm gonna rape you.
L61918 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Nah...
L61917 +++$+++ u425 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ ARIANE +++$+++ First I'll put your Uptown in the spoon, then, to make it more exciting, I'm gonna add some Downtown. They call this thing a speedball, honey, but then you must know that...  First time shooting up?
L61916 +++$+++ u425 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ ARIANE +++$+++ Then c'mere. I got something for you.
L61915 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Yeah.
L61914 +++$+++ u425 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ ARIANE +++$+++ C'mere. You got some good blow, right?
L61913 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Those fucking Mob assholes.
L61912 +++$+++ u425 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ ARIANE +++$+++ Who?
L61911 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Christ! Shit! I could kill them all with my bare hands.
L61904 +++$+++ u425 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ ARIANE +++$+++ Why?
L61903 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ It's not the drugs, Ariane, it's -- it's someone who wants to kill me.  You gotta believe me!
L61825 +++$+++ u425 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ ARIANE +++$+++ OK. OK. Fine. But -- do you believe in God?
L61824 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Yeah.
L61823 +++$+++ u425 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ ARIANE +++$+++ You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
L61822 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ People.
L61820 +++$+++ u425 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ ARIANE +++$+++ That Jesus Christ was the Son of God and he came to die for your sins.
L61819 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ What's to believe?
L61818 +++$+++ u425 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ ARIANE +++$+++ I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God?
L61817 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ The Church is a fucking racket. I know how they operate. I've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was crying all the way through. Yeah, I know their game inside out. Now I'm free of it and I'm gonna stay that way.
L61813 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Yeah? At least she's alive! I see people get killed every day! Worse yet, tortured first and then killed! The nuns got off easy. Jeez. Cigarette burns. Everyone's all upset about fucking cigarette burns. I'll show you cigarette burns!
L61812 +++$+++ u425 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ ARIANE +++$+++ It's horrible. They burned her breasts with cigarettes. Christ.
L61808 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ She's fucking nine years old! Jesus Christ.
L61807 +++$+++ u425 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ ARIANE +++$+++ Susie's not a virgin anymore.
L61806 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit they would.
L61805 +++$+++ u425 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ ARIANE +++$+++ I can't get over what those guys did to her. I just can't.
L61751 +++$+++ u425 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ ARIANE +++$+++ Who said anything about the fucking street. I've got more connects than you have, Lieutenant...
L61750 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Brown Downtown... There hasn't been any smoking brown on the street in --
L61730 +++$+++ u425 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ ARIANE +++$+++ It's nothing. This is New York, man...  Oh -- I forgot. Bowtay needs some cash to buy her new acting headshots out of the developers. It's a good investment, man. She could make serious money!
L61729 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man!
L61728 +++$+++ u425 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ ARIANE +++$+++ I'm gonna need some bread, man. This ain't fair. I'm always here for you, and you can't even take decent care of me. My landlord is bitching like a motherfucker! You're two months behind on the rent, Lieutenant!
L61984 +++$+++ u427 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ FENCE +++$+++ That's no mystery. Julio and Paolo brought it in,  You don't want to hurt those boys, do you? I mean, they sure as Hell have got something coming, but it ain't what the Law wants to give them. You understand?  No. How could you understand.
L61983 +++$+++ u426 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN +++$+++ He wants to know who brought in the chalice.
L61982 +++$+++ u427 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ FENCE +++$+++ So what are you doing here?
L61979 +++$+++ u427 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ FENCE +++$+++ I was gonna bring it back myself.
L61978 +++$+++ u426 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN +++$+++ Are you all right, honey?
L61977 +++$+++ u426 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN +++$+++ Yes.
L61976 +++$+++ u427 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ FENCE +++$+++ You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again.
L61975 +++$+++ u426 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN +++$+++ Yes.
L61974 +++$+++ u427 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ FENCE +++$+++ You took the chalice.
L61898 +++$+++ u428 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ JC +++$+++ I know.  Take care of yourself, man, OK? Be cool.
L61897 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
L61896 +++$+++ u428 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ JC +++$+++ There. Now you've got your profit and more. You'll have more product day after tomorrow, right?
L61893 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Very good. Very good. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
L61892 +++$+++ u428 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ JC +++$+++ How are you doing, man?
L61725 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Fuck you.  Just give me back a little something for the road.
L61724 +++$+++ u428 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ JC +++$+++ The rich kind.  Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide.
L61723 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ What the fuck are you? A drug counselor or a drug dealer? And you don't even do your own product! What kind of businessman are you?
L61722 +++$+++ u428 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ JC +++$+++ That stuff'll kill you quick, man.
L61964 +++$+++ u429 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ JESUS +++$+++ I forgive you.
L61963 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Oh God, my God. it's goddamn good to be good. Forgive me. Father, for I have sinned. It's still goddamn good to be good.
L61962 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Why do I dream every night of the whore who brought you water on your road to death? And why have I never forgotten that if she, then I --
L61961 +++$+++ u429 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ JESUS +++$+++ I forgive you.
L61960 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Why? Jesus! Why me? Why can't I wash the ashes from my forehead, year after year after year? And why am I still drunk on your blood, the taste of your flesh on my tongue? Worst of all, why can't I feel the nails in my palms, the spear in my side, the crown of thorns round my head? Why do I have to know, over and over, that it was you. You who died; died for my sins! And that I will die for nothing. Why?
L61959 +++$+++ u429 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ JESUS +++$+++ I forgive you.
L61958 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Why? Why can't you hate me? Hate me! Please! Help me!  Hate me! Help me! Hate me!
L61957 +++$+++ u429 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ JESUS +++$+++ I forgive you.
L61956 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Please. Please don't forgive me. I've always hated you for that.
L61955 +++$+++ u429 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ JESUS +++$+++ I forgive you.
L61954 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ You can't forgive me. After what I've done.  I've fucked up bigtime. I've been bad. Real bad.
L61953 +++$+++ u429 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ JESUS +++$+++ I forgive you.
L61952 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Me?
L61951 +++$+++ u429 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ JESUS +++$+++ I forgive you.
L61932 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Yeah, sucker. You better be there!
L61931 +++$+++ u430 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LARGE +++$+++ Here's the deal: You meet me tonight across from the Garden. 33rd & 8th. At the beginning of the Ninth Inning. We'll listen to the end of the game together. You bring your cash, I'll bring mine.
L61929 +++$+++ u430 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LARGE +++$+++ OK, cop. I want you to give yourself and your friends on the force a message. Tell them I've got my own reasons to be very interested in whomever did the job on the nuns. I'll double the Church reward if you bring those punks direct to me. 100 G cash. Get it?
L61928 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole, man. I'm a fucking cop!
L61927 +++$+++ u430 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LARGE +++$+++ Oh, really?
L61926 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ There's nothing to think about. Either you put in my bet or you ain't getting nothing.
L61925 +++$+++ u430 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LARGE +++$+++ Let me think about it.
L61924 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Fuck yesterday's game. The World Series is seven games not six. Put in my bet.
L61923 +++$+++ u430 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LARGE +++$+++ What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game?
L61922 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ It's still my money. If you want to have a chance at any part of it, shithead, you will take my $120,000 and bet on tomorrow's game.
L61921 +++$+++ u430 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LARGE +++$+++ All right, cop. I want my money.
L61920 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Large?
L61889 +++$+++ u431 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LITE +++$+++ Here. Look I'll give you the psyho's number You call him yourself and tell him wnat you want.

L61887 +++$+++ u431 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LITE +++$+++ You've really got a problem.
L61886 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Get this, man. I was at the game today. Face to fucking face with Strawberry! Jesus! I saw him strikeout. And you know what? He looked at me, and I looked at him, and he laughed and I laughed and it was like we were all alone in that whole stadium and only we understood that it was all a racket, that he struck out on purpose, and that he's saving it up for the Big One. Tomorrow. Today I understood for the very first time that --
L61884 +++$+++ u431 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LITE +++$+++ That 50 G could help you --
L61883 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.
L61882 +++$+++ u431 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LITE +++$+++ The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?
L61881 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ What case?
L61880 +++$+++ u431 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LITE +++$+++ How's the case going?
L61879 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ I've been dodging bullets since I was fourteen. No one can kill me. I'm fucking blessed. I'm fucking Catholic.
L61878 +++$+++ u431 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LITE +++$+++ He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?
L61877 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and --
L61876 +++$+++ u431 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LITE +++$+++ You do know that he's gonna blow up your house, kill your wife and kids --
L61875 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Uh-uh. I'm gonna win. Just make sure the bet gets in.
L61874 +++$+++ u431 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LITE +++$+++ You're a fucking joke, you know that?  He's been waiting for the money since the fucking game ended. And I've been waiting here since -- forget it. Listen up. You're gonna get us both fucking killed. You know that!
L61873 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.
L61872 +++$+++ u431 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LITE +++$+++ This psycho can.
L61871 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ I don't got it. Not tonight. You can't get blood from a stone.
L61870 +++$+++ u431 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LITE +++$+++ Don't bullshit me.
L61869 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ What money?
L61868 +++$+++ u431 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LITE +++$+++ Do you have the money?
L61853 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ That's my problem. Just put in my bet.
L61852 +++$+++ u431 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LITE +++$+++ Fuck Strawberry. You're gonna end up owing 60 G to a homicidal maniac!
L61851 +++$+++ u432 +++$+++ m26 +++$+++ LT +++$+++ There's just no way the Mets will lose this game. Gooden is pitching and Strawberry is ready to break out.
