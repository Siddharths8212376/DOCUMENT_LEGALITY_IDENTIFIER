L194667 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Look at you, cutey! What are we doing?
L194663 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?
L194662 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now.
L194661 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally.
L194660 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
L194659 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.
L194635 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Gross! You must remember to tell me this in the morning. I'm, like, so freaked out now.
L194634 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased!
L194633 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Really? Is he cute?
L194632 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him.
L194631 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ What?
L194630 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ There's this guy!
L194629 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ -- another rainy day. Whatever shall we do?
L194628 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --
L194627 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ You remember what happened next?
L194626 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I loved you so much this day. On my bed in your panties. I remember I thought, how impossibly lucky am I to have you on my bed in your panties.
L194625 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ You know, we're okay. They're not finding us. You'll remember me in the morning. And you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over.
L194593 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading. The memory. I think we're hidden.
L194592 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose...
L194591 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ I'm right here.
L194590 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I want my mommy.  I don't want to lose you, Clem.
L194586 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Well... if they're looking for me in memories I'm in, what if you take me to a memory I'm not in?  And we can hide there till morning.
L194585 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ What do you mean?
L194584 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ What if you hide me?
L194580 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I don't know.
L194579 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?
L194578 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore.
L194577 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Oh?
L194576 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
L194575 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Such a beautiful view.
L194539 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ It's my favorite book. Since I was a kid. It's about these toys. There's this part where the skin Horse tells the rabbit what it means to be real.  I can't believe I'm crying already. He says, "It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand."
L194538 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ No.
L194537 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
L194536 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Yeah, Tangerine?
L194535 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Joely...
L194525 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ No. Thanks.
L194524 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ More?
L194520 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Joel, you're a liar.
L194519 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
L194518 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ I want to know you.
L194517 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ No, it isn't that.
L194516 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ You don't tell me things, Joel. I'm an open book. I tell you everything. Every damn embarrassing thing. You don't trust me.
L194483 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so --
L194482 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ You're drunk.
L194477 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Would you get me another, Joely?
L194476 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ So, um --
L194472 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ It's you! It's you who can't commit to anything! You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you! I don't even know why I am! I should just end it right here, Joel. Leave you in the zoo. Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with!
L194471 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Oh, thank God. It's going.
L194470 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ I'd make a fucking good mother! I love children! I'm creative and smart and I'd make a fucking good mother!
L194469 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --
L194468 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!
L194467 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Joel, We're fucking gonna talk about it!
L194466 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I don't want to talk about this here.
L194465 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ What?!
L194464 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Clementine, do you really think you could take care of a kid?
L194463 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ You're not ready.
L194462 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I don't think we're ready.
L194461 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.
L194460 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Let's talk about it later.
L194459 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ I want to have a baby.
L194458 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Oh shit. I remember this.  Want to go?
L194457 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ I'm fucking crawling out of my skin.
L194456 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Where are you going?
L194455 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ How can you watch this crap?
L194438 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Look at it out here. It's falling apart. I'm erasing you. And I'm happy.
L194437 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
L194436 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Let me drive you home.
L194434 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight. Isn't that how you get people to like you?
L194433 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ A wino? Jesus, Are you from the fifties? A wino!  Face it, Joel. You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?
L194430 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Oh Christ I didn't kill anybody. It's just a fucking dent. You're like some old lady or something.
L194429 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I don't know, maybe you did kill somebody.
L194428 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Well it is pathetic. And fucking irresponsible. You could've killed somebody.
L194427 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ ...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
L194426 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I can't believe you wrecked my car. You're driving drunk. It's pathetic.
L194423 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ It's three.
L194422 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Yo ho ho!
L194331 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ You didn't say anything about my hair.
L194330 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone?
L194299 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Okay.
L194298 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
L194297 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Tomorrow?
L194296 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ When?
L194295 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Yeah.
L194294 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ You'll call me, right?
L194293 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ So, I enjoyed meeting you.
L194291 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Yes.
L194290 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.
L194289 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Okay.
L194288 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...
L194287 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ You should stay.
L194286 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Sounds good. But right now I should go.
L194285 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and --
L194284 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Yeah? Oh, great!
L194283 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Okay.
L194282 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.
L194281 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I think so.
L194280 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?
L194279 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ That's scary sounding.
L194278 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
L194277 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Oh, yeah.
L194276 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph.
L194275 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ I don't either. I used to. But I'm through with that. Y'know, if I don't love my body, then I'm just lost. You know? With all the wrinkles and scars and the general falling apart that's coming 'round the bend.  So, I've been seeing this guy...
L194274 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ No, not at all.
L194273 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?
L194272 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ No.
L194271 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?
L194270 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Yeah.
L194269 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?
L194268 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --
L194267 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ What's the goal, Joel?  My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?
L194266 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Yeah.
L194265 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?
L194264 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Thanks.
L194263 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.
L194262 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I do have a tendency to use that word too much.
L194261 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it. God, I'm an idiot.
L194260 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I think about that.
L194259 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
L194258 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.
L194257 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?
L194256 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ But I think I am. I like to think I am.
L194255 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Yeah, I guess.
L194254 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?
L194253 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to know.
L194252 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?
L194251 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I don't know.
L194250 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?
L194249 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Yeah?
L194248 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.
L194246 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Drink up, young man. It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.
L194245 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Thanks.
L194243 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ I know a man who needs a refill.
L194242 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ No. I --
L194241 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
L194240 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Well, I should probably get going.
L194237 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ I don't know! I can't see them from here, Joel! Just pick something good.
L194236 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ You just say. I'm not really --
L194235 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ You pick it.
L194234 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ What do you want to hear?
L194232 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ No, I'm okay for now.
L194231 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Ready for another?
L194230 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Yeah? Well, have a seat, anyway.
L194229 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I'm fine.
L194228 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ God, that feels so fucking good. Take yours off.
L194227 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Cheers.
L194226 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!
L194225 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ It's pretty.
L194224 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?
L194223 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Frost?
L194222 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Me neither. Oh, there's an inscription on the back.  The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued.
L194221 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I don't know.
L194220 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
L194219 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Thanks. That was good, that crow sound.
L194218 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ This... someone gave that to me, just like, recently. I like it, too. I like crows. I think I used to be a crow.
L194217 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Very much.
L194216 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ You like that?
L194213 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Never mind. Sorry, that was stupid. I'm embarrassed. Good night, Joel.
L194212 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Um --
L194211 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
L194210 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Take care.
L194209 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Oh, geez, I'm full of shit. I already told you that.  Anyway. See Ya.
L194208 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Well, I wouldn't want to be --
L194207 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.
L194206 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ I'm just a bit of a wreck. "I sleep in your hat" makes me cry.  Me.
L194205 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ What?
L194204 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..."  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.
L194203 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Sort of, um...
L194202 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen." Remember?
L194201 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
L194200 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
L194199 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I like to read.
L194198 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ So you like bookstores, huh?
L194197 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ It's okay. I didn't think you were.
L194196 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of nutso. I'm not really.
L194195 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Wilmont. Near the high school.
L194194 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Yeah.
L194193 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ You know Wilmont?
L194192 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ I'm not a stalker.
L194191 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that.
L194190 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.
L194189 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ You're not a stalker or anything, right?
L194188 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Where do you live?
L194187 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Yeah?
L194186 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ It's okay.
L194185 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ I don't want to take you out of your way.
L194184 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ You're sure? It's cold.
L194183 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
L194182 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Hi. I could give you a ride if you need.
L194181 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Unless I get that hair-color-naming job.
L194180 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Probably see you at the book store.
L194179 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then.
L194178 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --
L194177 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice. Right now, anyway. I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. But right now I'm glad you said, "that's okay" to me. That was nice of you.
L194176 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ That's okay.
L194175 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today.
L194174 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Yes?
L194173 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Joel? It's Joel, right?
L194170 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ Shit. Shit. I know it's here. Hold on.
L194169 +++$+++ u861 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ JOEL +++$+++ Okay.
L194168 +++$+++ u859 +++$+++ m55 +++$+++ CLEMENTINE +++$+++ I don't need nice. I don't need myself to be it and I don't need anyone else to be it at me.
