L533413 +++$+++ u2881 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ BAGRADIAN +++$+++ Take some matches, see?  And a cigarette, see?  Tuck the cigarette in like this, see?  Now the cigarette keeps burning like a fuse, see?
L533412 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ What's the match gag?
L533411 +++$+++ u2881 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ BAGRADIAN +++$+++ Just pulled the old match gag, see!
L533410 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Throws what? How could he have a time bomb?
L533409 +++$+++ u2881 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ BAGRADIAN +++$+++ There was that ammunition train in the depot at Frankfurt, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room and fixes a time bomb, see? Then he waits until the train starts moving out, see? And one of the cars got the door open with some straw on the floor, see? So he throws it, see, and three minutes later -- voom! See?
L533408 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Do Cagney. Like you did yesterday.
L533394 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ He's still in the Kommandant's office. That's all I know.
L533393 +++$+++ u2881 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ BAGRADIAN +++$+++ Any news on Dunbar?
L533392 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ We made a deal with Barrack One.
L533282 +++$+++ u2881 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ BAGRADIAN +++$+++ I don't have to think. We didn't tell anything to anybody. Not a word. Not until we hit this barrack.
L533281 +++$+++ u2892 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Maybe just a hint or so. Think hard.
L533555 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Get going on the trap door.
L533554 +++$+++ u2882 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ BLONDIE +++$+++ Coming up.
L533553 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Three's a crowd, especially if you've got to cut your way through barbed wire.  Here's the wire cutters.  Are the civilian clothes ready?
L533500 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Okay. Move on.
L533499 +++$+++ u2882 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ BLONDIE +++$+++ Roger.
L533498 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Ready?
L532942 +++$+++ u2882 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ BLONDIE +++$+++ Static!
L532941 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Come on!
L532714 +++$+++ u2882 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ BLONDIE +++$+++ Looks good outside.
L532713 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ They ought to be under the barbed wire soon.
L533615 +++$+++ u2883 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ COOKIE +++$+++ So long, Sefton.
L533614 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ So long, Cookie. The department store is all yours. What's left of it.
L533470 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Yeah. Security.
L533469 +++$+++ u2883 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ COOKIE +++$+++ If you don't want to tell me, why don't you tell Hoffy? Or Security?
L533468 +++$+++ u2883 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ COOKIE +++$+++ Who is it?
L533467 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ That's not the point, Cookie. The point is what do you do with him? You tip your mitt and the Jerries pull him out of here and plant him someplace else, like Stalag Sixteen or Fifteen. Or you kill him off and the Krauts turn around and kill off the whole barracks. Every one of us. So what do you do?
L533466 +++$+++ u2883 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ COOKIE +++$+++ Who is it?
L533465 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Why not? Just one of the boys. Sharing our bunks. Eating our chow. Right in amongst the ones that beat me up. Except that he beat hardest.
L533464 +++$+++ u2883 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ COOKIE +++$+++ In this barracks?
L533463 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ I understand how you feel, Cookie. It's sort of rough -- one American squealing on other Americans. Then again, Cookie -- maybe that stoolie's not an American at all. Maybe he's a German the Krauts planted in this barracks. They do this type of thing. Just put an agent in with us -- a trained specialist. Lots of loose information floating around a prison camp. Not just whether somebody wants to escape, but what outfits we were with and where we were stationed, and how our radar operates. Could be, couldn't it?
L533462 +++$+++ u2883 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ COOKIE +++$+++ I don't know anymore.
L533461 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ What's the matter? You on their team now? You think I'm the guy?
L533143 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ We'll get some more.
L533142 +++$+++ u2883 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ COOKIE +++$+++ There's only one pair left.
L532735 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ That'll do.
L532734 +++$+++ u2883 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ COOKIE +++$+++ W-w-will that do or do you want some m-m-m --?
L533603 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Forget it.
L533602 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Brother, were we all wet about you!
L533568 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ We're looking at it.
L533567 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Here's the knife to do it with. Only make sure you got the right throat.
L533507 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ No? Aren't you a little afraid to turn the stoolie loose on that compound? For a tip-off like this, you know what the Krauts would pay?
L533506 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ You ain't going to squeal this one, brother.
L533505 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ I wouldn't worry about Schulz. I'd worry about Sefton. Remember me? I'm the stoolie.
L533422 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Thanks.
L533421 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Have a cigar.
L533400 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Why not?
L533399 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Next we're going to auction off your department store -- and your stable.
L533398 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Take it.
L533397 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ What are you looking at him for?  Any objections, Sefton?
L533255 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ You're all wire happy, boys. You've been in this camp too long. You put two and two together and it comes out four. Only it ain't four.
L533254 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ You make my mouth water.
L533253 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Let's get on with what? What is this anyway? A Kangaroo Court? Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
L533252 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Yeah, what about it?  Cut the horsing around. We know he's the stoolie and we know what the pay- off is. Let's get on with it.
L533039 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ A little something what?
L533038 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ And maybe a little something else?
L533037 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ I grease the Kraut guards. With ten percent of the take.
L533034 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Ask Security.  You tell him, Price. You've got me shadowed every minute of the day. Or haven't you found out yet?
L533033 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
L533032 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ That's right.
L533031 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ I suppose they also know about your distillery and the horseraces?
L532944 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Maybe it's going to be a longer war than you figured -- eh, Duke?
L532943 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Static is right! The radio's static, Patton's static, we're static!
L532901 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ You stink, Sefton!
L532900 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ You would, would you? Listen, Stupe -- the first week I was in this joint somebody stole my Red Cross package, my blanket and my left shoe. Well, I wised up since. This ain't no Salvation Army -- this is everybody for himself. Dog eat dog.
L532899 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ A lot sharper, Sefton! I'd like to have some of that loot you got in those footlockers!
L532898 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ What's your beef, boys? So I'm trading. Everybody here is trading. Only maybe I trade a little sharper. So that makes me a collaborator.
L532895 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Look, this may be my last hot breakfast on account of they're going to take away that stove. So will you let me eat it in peace?
L532894 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Nice guy! The Krauts shoot Manfredi and Johnson last night and today he's out trading with them.
L532891 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Forty-five cigarettes. The price has gone up.
L532890 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Come on, Trader Horn! Let's hear it: what'd you give the Krauts for that egg?
L532823 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ How come the Krauts knew about that stove, Security? And the tunnel? How come you can't lay down a belch around here without them knowing it?
L532822 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Private property, bub.
L532748 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Anybody here wanna double their bet?
L532747 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Hold it, Sefton. So we heard some shots -- so who says they didn't get away?
L532721 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ No crack. Two packs of cigarettes say they don't get out of the forest.
L532720 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Now what kind of a crack is that?
L533537 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Everybody but Joey, and you know who.
L533536 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Then we're all in on it?
L533491 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Only he ain't quite finished yet. Blondie -- get that smudge pot. Tie it to Steve's leg.
L533490 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ The S.S. Men are here to pick up Dunbar. They're taking him to Berlin. Looks like he's finished.
L533229 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Easy! Walked right through the gate, past the guard. Like he was some Kraut Field Marshal.
L533228 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ How did he get over there?
L533043 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ There'll be no vigilante stuff. Not while I'm Barrack Chief.
L533042 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ How much more do we have to take from him?
L533041 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Break it off!
L532831 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ You betcha. I said one of us is a stoolie. A dirty, stinkin' stoolie!
L532830 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Come again?
L532741 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Okay, Security -- what happened?
L532740 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Don't ask me. Price was elected Security.
L532730 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ I'll call the whole pot.
L532729 +++$+++ u2889 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HOFFY +++$+++ Put me down for ten, you louse.
L532970 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ You are talking crazy!
L532969 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ That's the general idea.  Only it's not so general as far as I'm concerned.
L532966 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Which one of you is what?
L532965 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Come on, Schulz! Spill it! How did you get the information? About Manfredi and Johnson? About the stove and the tunnel? Who's giving it to you? Which one of us is it?
L532962 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Tipping me off? I do not understand.
L532961 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Cut out the guff, Schulz. We're on to you. You know everything that's happening in this barrack. Who's tipping you off?
L532759 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ Don't wear it out!
L532758 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
L532757 +++$+++ u2884 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUKE +++$+++ You killed them, huh? Both of them?
L533646 +++$+++ u2885 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Let's!
L533645 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Let's blow, Chauncey.
L533635 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ We'll know in forty seconds.  Only in a democracy can a poor guy get his keister shot off with a rich guy.
L533634 +++$+++ u2885 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ What are the chances busting out of here?
L533633 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ You won't get off that cheap.
L533632 +++$+++ u2885 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ It's on me.
L533631 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Who doesn't! Suppose we wait until we hit the Waldorf Astoria.
L533630 +++$+++ u2885 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Yeah.
L533629 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ What some brandy?
L533628 +++$+++ u2885 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Not you.
L533627 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ What did you expect, a St. Bernard dog?
L533626 +++$+++ u2885 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Sefton!
L533625 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ You'd better get that blue blood circulating, because we're busting out of this stink-hole in exactly --  -- one minute and twenty seconds.
L533624 +++$+++ u2885 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ My legs are frozen.
L533623 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Shut off the moaning, or we'll have the dogs on us. Shut it off, Lieutenant. This is orders!
L533150 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Look, Lieutenant. All your dough won't help you here. Because here you're on your own. And no mother to throw you a lifebelt. Now let's see how good you can swim.
L533149 +++$+++ u2885 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Just a minute. You made a couple of cracks before and I let them slide. But I don't intend to take any more. If you resent my having money, start a revolution, but get off my back.
L533148 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ What did you expect, glamor boy? The Officers' Club with a steam room and a massage maybe?
L533116 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ They've got a summer house in Nantucket, with an upstairs polo field.  You better put a canopy over his bunk.
L533115 +++$+++ u2885 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Twenty-five.
L533114 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Maybe he would. We applied for Officers' Training together, remember? They turned me down, but I'm glad to see you made it. Of course, it couldn't be that all that dough behind you had something to do with it!  His mother's got twenty million dollars.
L533112 +++$+++ u2885 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Yes, it would. Do we know each other?
L533111 +++$+++ u2894 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SEFTON +++$+++ Lieutenant Dunbar? It wouldn't be James Schuyler Dunbar? From Boston?
L533373 +++$+++ u2885 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ How could I have had a time bomb? They searched me when they took me prisoner.
L533372 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ Oh, come now! You threw a time bomb.
L533371 +++$+++ u2885 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ I didn't do it. I was in the Frankfurt station and the train was three miles away when it blew up.
L533361 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ You will remember the name? Von Scherbach? VON SCHER-BACH!
L533360 +++$+++ u2885 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ I want to sleep... I haven't slept for three days.
L533359 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ There will be two S.S. men here tomorrow to take you to Berlin. You will be interrogated by the General Staff. When you come to the part about your arrest, I'm sure you won't forget to give me the proper credit.
L533355 +++$+++ u2885 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ I didn't do it. I didn't do it.
L533354 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ Nine-thirty. General von Pfeffinger should be at his desk by now. Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news?
L533353 +++$+++ u2885 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ I want to sleep. Give me five minutes on that couch.
L533352 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ You are being rude again.
L533351 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ Of course you did! Twenty-six carloads of munitions gone off like a trick cigar! The S.S. is running around in circles. The Gestapo is arresting the wrong people. And von Scherbach has caught the fish. Most amusing, isn't it?
L533350 +++$+++ u2885 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ I didn't do it -- I didn't do it.
L533349 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ You have no idea how boring my life here is. If it weren't for an occasional air raid or some foolish prisoners trying to escape, I wouldn't know what to do. I want to thank you for keeping me company. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't read. I hate music. That only leaves good conversation. It will be a shame to lose you.
L533275 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ Abfuehren!
L533274 +++$+++ u2885 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ Ever try forty sleeping pills?
L533273 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ No bother. I'm very grateful for a little company. You see, I suffer from insomnia.
L533272 +++$+++ u2885 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ I'm okay here. Why bother?
L533271 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ Of course you don't. Now, Lieutenant, how would you like to join me in my quarters? I have a nice fire going.
L533270 +++$+++ u2885 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about, Colonel.
L533269 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ Quite a transportation jam we are having outside of Frankfurt! They are very angry in Berlin. They will be even angrier on the East Front, waiting for that ammunition train. Don't you think so, Lieutenant?
L533268 +++$+++ u2885 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ I'll live.
L533267 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ That is correct.  Lieutenant Dunbar, I came to apologize for the accommodations. Ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men.
L533266 +++$+++ u2885 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ 105-353.
L533265 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ What is your number?
L533264 +++$+++ u2885 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ DUNBAR +++$+++ I am Lieutenant Dunbar.
L533331 +++$+++ u2886 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ GENEVA MAN +++$+++ How long is temporarily? I trust not until July.
L533330 +++$+++ u2887 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ GERMAN LIEUTENANT +++$+++ The men here used it for a trap door, so we had to remove it temporarily.
L533329 +++$+++ u2886 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ GENEVA MAN +++$+++ What do you do for heat in this barrack? No stove?
L533328 +++$+++ u2886 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ GENEVA MAN +++$+++ They also smell of moth balls.  When were they issued? This morning?
L533327 +++$+++ u2887 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ GERMAN LIEUTENANT +++$+++ As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
L533326 +++$+++ u2886 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ GENEVA MAN +++$+++ Naturally. It would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk.
L533325 +++$+++ u2887 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ GERMAN LIEUTENANT +++$+++ Here we have a typical barrack. It houses seventy-five men. Every one of them has his own bunk, naturally.
L533383 +++$+++ u2886 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ GENEVA MAN +++$+++ Perfectly all right. I do not like boots.
L533382 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ Very well. If you insist on details. I have ways of finding out about that blasted time bomb. Good day, sir.  You will forgive me for receiving you like this?
L533381 +++$+++ u2886 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ GENEVA MAN +++$+++ Isn't it?
L533380 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ Interesting.
L533379 +++$+++ u2886 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ GENEVA MAN +++$+++ Simply this. After the hostilities are ended, there will be such a thing as a War Crimes Commission. If this man should be convicted without proper proof, you will be held responsible, Colonel von Scherbach.
L533378 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ You were saying --?
L533376 +++$+++ u2886 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ GENEVA MAN +++$+++ I am not. According to the Geneva Convention --
L533375 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
L533374 +++$+++ u2886 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ GENEVA MAN +++$+++ And the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely.
L533370 +++$+++ u2886 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ GENEVA MAN +++$+++ He is a prisoner of war until you can prove sabotage.
L533369 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ Whatever it is, it's out of your jurisdiction. This man is not a prisoner of war. Not any more. He is a saboteur.
L533368 +++$+++ u2886 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ GENEVA MAN +++$+++ What exactly is he charged with?
L533367 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ It is.
L533366 +++$+++ u2886 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ GENEVA MAN +++$+++ I want to talk about Lieutenant Dunbar. Is this Lieutenant Dunbar?
L533365 +++$+++ u2896 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ VON SCHERBACH +++$+++ Well, Herr Inspector! How did you find the camp? Crowded but gemuetlich, shall we say?
L533190 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ And this?
L533189 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ It's a mouse trap.
L533188 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ What is this? This is water?
L532974 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Raus! Raus! All of you!
L532973 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Why don't we accept, Animal? The worst that can happen is we wind up a couple of lamp shades.
L532957 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Droppen Sie dead!  Raus mit dem Ofen. Los! Los!
L532956 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Hey, Schulz! I got a deal for you. Suppose you help us escape. We'll go home and have everything ready for you in Madison Square Garden. For the world championship! Schulz, the Beast of Bavaria versus Halitosis Jones!
L532950 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You should live so long.
L532949 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ You always think I am a square. I have been to America.  I wrestled in Milwaukee and St. Louis and Cincinnati. And I will go back! The way the war is going I will be there before you!
L532948 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Wisecrackers? Where did he pick up his English? In a pretzel factory?
L532790 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Some are not bad at all.
L532789 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Jawohl!
L532771 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Ja -- ja! Droppen Sie dead! Always mit the jokes! Droppen Sie dead!
L532770 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Then droppen Sie dead!
L532769 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Jawohl.
L532768 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Sprechen Sie deutsch?
L532767 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Jawohl?
L532766 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Say, Schulz --
L532765 +++$+++ u2893 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ SCHULTZ +++$+++ Aufstehen, gentlemen! Please! You do not want to stay in bed on such a beautiful morning we are having today!
L533541 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ No. I want to draw.
L533540 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ You want to go?
L533539 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Let me do it, Hoffy.
L533488 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ This is me, Animal! It's Harry Shapiro!
L533487 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ Betty! Betty!
L533486 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Animal! Animal! Wake up!
L533485 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ I've been crazy about you for years. I've seen every picture you've ever made six times. I'd just sit there and never even open that popcorn bag.
L533484 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Hey, Animal! Animal!
L533483 +++$+++ u2895 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ STOSH +++$+++ But it's not just those legs. It's that nose of yours I'm crazy about. That cute little button of a nose!
L533478 +++$+++ u2888 +++$+++ m190 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Why, sure!
