L356521 +++$+++ u6381 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Oh no...
L356520 +++$+++ u6382 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Sorry if I have the worst B.O., I've been sweating in this little room with T.V. lights for hours...
L356519 +++$+++ u6381 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Uh..thanks.
L356516 +++$+++ u6382 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ No!  Hi! So great to meet you!
L356515 +++$+++ u6381 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Have you met Charlotte? My wife.
L356514 +++$+++ u6382 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ It's amazing  there!
L356513 +++$+++ u6381 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ We're here for the week. I'm shooting in Osaka for a few days.
L356512 +++$+++ u6382 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ ...doing like twenty million interviews a day... It's soo good to see you. How long are you here for?
L356511 +++$+++ u6382 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Promoting that action movie I did...
L356510 +++$+++ u6381 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?
L356509 +++$+++ u6382 +++$+++ m425 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ John! What are you doing here?
L359126 +++$+++ u6387 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ We're still going to be together.
L359125 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You really had me going, Claire.  I was finally ready to propose to you.
L359124 +++$+++ u6387 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Listen to me, I love you, Peter, I'm trying to protect you!
L359123 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ So you're going to kill her?  Put the gun down Claire.
L359122 +++$+++ u6387 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ She's been stalking you, Peter.
L359121 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I found the pentacle.
L359120 +++$+++ u6387 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Honey, you're exhausted.  Do you want to lie down for a little while?
L359118 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I thought the spare set was in the kitchen drawer.
L359117 +++$+++ u6387 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Must be a spare set.
L359116 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I found them in your file box.
L359115 +++$+++ u6387 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I don't know.  What are they?
L359114 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What're these?
L359112 +++$+++ u6387 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ This is the person...you were talking about?
L359111 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Claire...
L359110 +++$+++ u6387 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ There you are!  My God, darling, I've been so worried.  Are you alright?
L358981 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I believe in you.
L358980 +++$+++ u6387 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ You need to believe in something besides yourself.
L358979 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I'm just temporarily off my game.
L358978 +++$+++ u6387 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Well, it shattered your faith in everything.
L358977 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ It's with me all the time, Claire, I just don't like to talk about it.
L358976 +++$+++ u6387 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Like you need to admit that losing your parents when you were twelve was traumatic.
L358975 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yeah, like...
L358974 +++$+++ u6387 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out...
L358973 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You're glad somebody tried to kill me?
L358972 +++$+++ u6387 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I don't know.  In a way, I'm glad it all happened.
L358971 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I'm gonna have to get a restraining order.  What a nightmare.
L358900 +++$+++ u6387 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Thank God he did.
L358899 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I can't believe Will killed him.
L358898 +++$+++ u6387 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I'm still shaking.
L358895 +++$+++ u6387 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ When did they find her?
L358894 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yeah, I appreciate it.  Thanks, Josef.
L358892 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What happened?
L358891 +++$+++ u6387 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What?  That's horrible!
L358819 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Well, it's a nice surprise.  Should I hit the "stop" button?
L358818 +++$+++ u6387 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I spaced out.
L358817 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Forgot my car keys.  What are you doing on the fourth floor?
L358816 +++$+++ u6387 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Hey, what are you doing here in the middle of the day?
L358796 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ No.  Of course not.  Mmmm.  Anago.  My favorite.
L358795 +++$+++ u6387 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Oh, Peter, you're going to pursue this.
L358794 +++$+++ u6387 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Now that you're on TV, you're a magnet for all the wackos out there.
L358793 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Says she can get me in to see this killer.
L358792 +++$+++ u6387 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
L358791 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Sorry.  It's just...a strange woman waltzes into my office today.  Tells me she murdered her parents and can prove Satan exists.
L358790 +++$+++ u6387 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Peter, where are you?
L358789 +++$+++ u6387 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ You know, there was a guy on the radio today trying to explain why we're losing daylight.  Quarks and dark matter, things like that.  Even how daylight savings has caught up with us over the last hundred years and our universal watch is just fast, you know?
L358788 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Hmmm.
L358787 +++$+++ u6387 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I can't believe it's already starting to get dark so early.
L358786 +++$+++ u6387 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Sushi.
L358785 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Uh...sure...I...what?
L358784 +++$+++ u6387 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I must really be slacking off.  Hungry?
L358783 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Weird.  The book again.  Sex spelled backwards...
L358782 +++$+++ u6387 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Bad?
L358781 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Shi... Sorry, honey.  I was having the weirdest dream.
L358668 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ It's probably trivial.
L358667 +++$+++ u6387 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ You never said anything to me...
L358635 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ It's Susan's cooking, Claire.  That's why Uncle James lets them stay.
L358634 +++$+++ u6387 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ It's great of you to let William and Susan stay at the house until he gets on his feet.
L358623 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ She's a talk show host.  They can't be charmed.  By definition.
L358622 +++$+++ u6387 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ How'd your interview go?  I'm sure you charmed the hell out of Sally.
L358621 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Do you think they have a room here?
L358620 +++$+++ u6387 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I missed you.
L358659 +++$+++ u6387 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Eight.  That okay?
L358658 +++$+++ u6391 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ FATHER JAMES +++$+++ What time did you make it for?
L358657 +++$+++ u6387 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ You know, I made a reservation at Marco's for Peter's birthday dinner, but maybe you should cater it.
L358640 +++$+++ u6391 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ FATHER JAMES +++$+++ Yes.  It's exactly...
L358639 +++$+++ u6387 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ ...you wearing a watch, Father?
L358638 +++$+++ u6391 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ FATHER JAMES +++$+++ Well, if Peter here would hop off his laurels long enough to marry you...
L358637 +++$+++ u6387 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Frustrating.  Form over content. Everything's so retro.
L358636 +++$+++ u6391 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ FATHER JAMES +++$+++ Nonsense, it's all of our home.  So how's work treating you?
L358632 +++$+++ u6387 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Peter, are you okay?
L358631 +++$+++ u6391 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ FATHER JAMES +++$+++ What a...jerk!
L358579 +++$+++ u6396 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MR. SILBERMAN +++$+++ Just me.
L358578 +++$+++ u6388 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ DEFENSE ATTORNEY +++$+++ Tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and Mr. Viznick.
L358577 +++$+++ u6396 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MR. SILBERMAN +++$+++ He asked to go home early.  He said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do.
L358576 +++$+++ u6388 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ DEFENSE ATTORNEY +++$+++ On the day of the murders  what did the defendant request?
L358575 +++$+++ u6396 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MR. SILBERMAN +++$+++ Seemed...on edge.
L358574 +++$+++ u6388 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ DEFENSE ATTORNEY +++$+++ And on the day of the murders, his state of mind?
L358573 +++$+++ u6396 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MR. SILBERMAN +++$+++ Quiet.  Real quiet...
L358572 +++$+++ u6388 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ DEFENSE ATTORNEY +++$+++ And how would you describe him?
L358571 +++$+++ u6396 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MR. SILBERMAN +++$+++ Yes.
L358803 +++$+++ u6388 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ DEFENSE ATTORNEY +++$+++ I'm gonna go make a stink.  Sit tight. I'll make sure you get a change of clothes.
L358802 +++$+++ u6403 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ VIZNICK +++$+++ I can take care of myself.
L358801 +++$+++ u6388 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ DEFENSE ATTORNEY +++$+++ You have to tell me who did it.
L358800 +++$+++ u6403 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ VIZNICK +++$+++ Not the guards.  Some of the prisoners are easily disturbed.
L358799 +++$+++ u6388 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ DEFENSE ATTORNEY +++$+++ Sure it is.  If the guards did this, we can file charges.
L358798 +++$+++ u6403 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ VIZNICK +++$+++ It's nothing.
L358797 +++$+++ u6388 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ DEFENSE ATTORNEY +++$+++ George, come in.  What the hell happened to you?
L358841 +++$+++ u6389 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ DR. ALLEN +++$+++ Of course not.  They put him through severe mental stress.  Causing this aneurysm.
L358840 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ So you don't believe his condition is the result of anything supernatural?
L358839 +++$+++ u6389 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ DR. ALLEN +++$+++ You should know I never felt Mr. Birdson needed anything but professional psychiatric care.  And then, minutes after they left, he suffered a stroke. He's comatose.  No brain wave activity at all.
L358838 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ No, I wasn't, actually.
L358837 +++$+++ u6389 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ DR. ALLEN +++$+++ You're aware that this woman was party to the so-called exorcism.
L358836 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ My secretary?
L358835 +++$+++ u6389 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ DR. ALLEN +++$+++ When your secretary called, she made no mention of her coming, too.
L358834 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Quite a compliment coming from you, doctor.
L358833 +++$+++ u6389 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ DR. ALLEN +++$+++ Mr. Kelson, what a pleasure to meet you. I have to say your instincts about the criminally insane are impeccable.  I am a fan.
L358553 +++$+++ u6389 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ DR. ALLEN +++$+++ I think I should join you.
L358552 +++$+++ u6392 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ LAREAUX +++$+++ Father Jeremy and Deacon John Townsend of St. Ursula's, and our associate, Maya Larkin.  Secular assistants are permitted if regarded as qualified.  Maya is eminently qualified.
L358551 +++$+++ u6389 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ DR. ALLEN +++$+++ I'm aware of that, but I don't think he's in any condition to make requests. I'm trying to appeal to your more...logical self, Father.  I'm concerned about harm to my patient.
L358550 +++$+++ u6392 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ LAREAUX +++$+++ It's the patient's request, doctor.
L358549 +++$+++ u6389 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ DR. ALLEN +++$+++ This patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures.
L358548 +++$+++ u6392 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ LAREAUX +++$+++ But your patient is legally entitled to it.
L358547 +++$+++ u6389 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ DR. ALLEN +++$+++ You know I'm not comfortable with this.
L358546 +++$+++ u6392 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ LAREAUX +++$+++ Your court order, Dr. Allen.
L358848 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ You heard voices, you know you did.
L358847 +++$+++ u6389 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ DR. ALLEN +++$+++ There is a medical explanation for everything that happened.
L358846 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ And was he in distress when you opened the door?  Or was he sitting here, relaxed, at this table?
L358845 +++$+++ u6389 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ DR. ALLEN +++$+++ The patient was in great distress. Naturally he was...yelling.
L358844 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ What did you hear?
L358843 +++$+++ u6389 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ DR. ALLEN +++$+++ I certainly hope you're not lending any credence to this.
L358842 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Dr. Allen, could you please tell Mr. Kelson what you heard as you tried to enter Mr. Birdson's room?
L359155 +++$+++ u6390 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ FATHER FRANK +++$+++ I don't have the experience.  Father Thomas should officiate.
L359154 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ You'll do it?
L358970 +++$+++ u6390 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ FATHER FRANK +++$+++ You have a sister in New Orleans.
L358969 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Father, I have nowhere else to stay.
L358968 +++$+++ u6390 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ FATHER FRANK +++$+++ I've had it.  Townsend's dead.  The police are calling and now I see you having a scene in front of the children. I'm sorry, Maya, you've been with us for many years, but effective immediately, I'm rescinding your right to live at the church.
L358709 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ I hope so.
L358708 +++$+++ u6390 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ FATHER FRANK +++$+++ Is he going to be okay?
L358699 +++$+++ u6390 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ FATHER FRANK +++$+++ But bad judgement.  And now you see how dangerous the consequences can be.
L358698 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ He will.  He has great faith.
L358697 +++$+++ u6390 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ FATHER FRANK +++$+++ The doctor's concerned he may never come out of this dementia.
L358687 +++$+++ u6390 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ FATHER FRANK +++$+++ Maya, for the last time, I will not tolerate these obsessions.
L358686 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ If you really believe in God, why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real?
L358685 +++$+++ u6390 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ FATHER FRANK +++$+++ Please, Maya.  I'm trying to get us into the next century and you insist on this medieval nonsense.
L358684 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ You weren't there.  Give me time to get some proof.
L358683 +++$+++ u6390 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ FATHER FRANK +++$+++ I don't mean to belittle you, but we've been through this before.  Satan is not what you think he is.  Satan is not some creature.
L359215 +++$+++ u6391 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ FATHER JAMES +++$+++ I had to.  There was no other way. Their deaths were part of the greatest legacy I could have given you.
L359214 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You killed my parents.
L359213 +++$+++ u6391 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ FATHER JAMES +++$+++ You are my son.  Don't you see the opportunity that lies before you?
L359212 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You raised me, like a son.
L359211 +++$+++ u6391 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ FATHER JAMES +++$+++ Everything I did, I did for you.  I love you, Peter.  Think of it.  I'm giving you a gift, absolute power and knowledge.
L359210 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You lied to me my whole life. Everything you said, everything you did.
L359209 +++$+++ u6391 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ FATHER JAMES +++$+++ It was perfect.  The harder I pushed, the more you pulled away.
L359208 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ So all that bullshit about God and faith.
L359207 +++$+++ u6391 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ FATHER JAMES +++$+++ Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.
L359206 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You fucking bastard.
L358912 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You know, I respect that you have such faith, James.  I don't understand it, but I want you to know that despite our differences, I admire you and I always will.
L358911 +++$+++ u6391 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ FATHER JAMES +++$+++ Peter.  Your life must matter to you because it matters to all of us who love you.
L358910 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ But it's true.  I have no faith.  It's strange.  When that gun was pointed at my face tonight, I was surprised, but never frightened.  It was as if I knew nothing could possibly happen to me and...in that one moment I didn't care about anything.  Not eve my own life.
L358909 +++$+++ u6391 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ FATHER JAMES +++$+++ No matter, my son, he believes in you.
L358908 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You're right, but it's funny.  All my life I thought I was simply a man who didn't believe in any of it.
L358907 +++$+++ u6391 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ FATHER JAMES +++$+++ Listen to me, Peter.  You can't let the ravings of a madman disturb you, okay?
L358906 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yeah.  It didn't make any sense.
L358905 +++$+++ u6391 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ FATHER JAMES +++$+++ He spoke to you?
L358904 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Something he said, just before...
L358903 +++$+++ u6391 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ FATHER JAMES +++$+++ What is it?
L358630 +++$+++ u6391 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ FATHER JAMES +++$+++ Given all that's happened, I understand. The world is random, but then there's faith.  Where are you in death without it?
L358629 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You know how I feel.  The world is random.  The only certainty I believe in is death.
L358628 +++$+++ u6391 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ FATHER JAMES +++$+++ Between your book sales and this TV thing, there's going to be no living with you.  And let me guess, you boiled God down to a conceit.
L358625 +++$+++ u6398 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You ready?
L358624 +++$+++ u6391 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ FATHER JAMES +++$+++ How're you doing?  Looking lovely as always.
L359181 +++$+++ u6392 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ LAREAUX +++$+++ ...art sank, sun set, ark sank again...
L359180 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Father, please don't die.
L359145 +++$+++ u6392 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ LAREAUX +++$+++ Miette, come here and relax.
L359144 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ So I guess Satan lost.  Satan is the weak one.
L359143 +++$+++ u6392 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ LAREAUX +++$+++ Would you like to rest, Miette?  You must be exhausted.
L359142 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father?  That Satan...
L359141 +++$+++ u6392 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ LAREAUX +++$+++ Um hm.  That's right, Maya.
L359140 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ We won because Christ...triumphed over Satan?
L359139 +++$+++ u6392 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ LAREAUX +++$+++ Yes.  We won, that's right.
L359138 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ So...we won?
L359135 +++$+++ u6392 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ LAREAUX +++$+++ Well, in my prayers, I realized we've been fooling ourselves and probably... blown this all out of proportion.  God would never allow anything like that to happen.
L359134 +++$+++ u6393 +++$+++ m426 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ What do you mean "don't worry?"
