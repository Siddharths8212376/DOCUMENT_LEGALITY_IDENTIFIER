L357692 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Besides, I - I don't feel like making that trip alone, Bob.
L357691 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Oh, George . . .
L357690 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Look here, Bob, Ever since I can remember, you've looked after me. Now I think you're the one that needs looking after. I'm your brother, Bob. If there's something wrong with you, let me help you.
L357689 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Enough! Never mind the girl!  Well, why don't you go?
L357688 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned—
L357687 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ I'm tired of owing you things. You're free to go. Go ahead.
L357686 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You've got to talk about it. What about me? You said they stole that plane to bring you here. I didn't want to come. You owe me some responsibility.
L357685 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Please, George. I don't want to talk about it anymore.
L357684 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ It's no place for you, Bob. Think of what's waiting for you. Do you want to stay here until you're half dead? Until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them?
L357683 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Then you'd better go, George. This is no place for you.
L357682 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk.
L357681 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Is that all my story meant to you?
L357680 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I knew there was a reason I hated this place. I'd give half my life to fly over it with a load of bombs just for what they've done to you. How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof? All this talk about the Lamas being hundreds of years old. How do you know? Did you see their birth certificates?  I can't believe it, Bob. A bunch of decrepit old men sit around and dream about reforming the world. And you, Bob Conway - two-feet-on- the-ground Conway - want to join them. It's horrible.
L357679 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ I don't need any proof.
L357678 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I think you've been hypnotized by a lot of loose-brained fanatics. Why, I wouldn't believe it if I heard it in an English monastery. Why should I swallow it here in Tibet?  How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof?
L357677 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ So you think it's all nonsense, huh?
L357676 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What else can I think after a tale like that?  Good heavens, Bob, things like that don't happen today. We're living in the twentieth century.
L357675 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ So you think I'm mad?
L357674 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Well, I - I really don't know what to say. Except that you must be completely mad.
L357672 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ I will, George. I want to tell you. I'll burst with it if I don't. It's weird and fantastical and sometimes unbelievable, but so beautiful!  Well, as you know, we were kidnapped and brought here . . .
L357671 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about. You're carrying around a secret that seems to be eating you up. If you'll only tell me about it.
L357670 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Something grand and beautiful, George. Something I've been searching for all my life. The answer to the confusion and bewilderment of a lifetime. I've found it, George, and I can't leave it. You mustn't either.
L357669 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Stay here?!  What's the matter with you, Bob? You've been acting strangely ever since we came here.  I've never seen you like this. Why can't we leave? What's stopping us?
L357668 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ You mustn't. You've got to stay here now.
L357667 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Why not? What's going to stop me?
L357666 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ You can't leave, George.
L357665 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I said we're getting out of here. Back to civilization. I made a deal with the porters. They brought in a load of books or something, and they're leaving tomorrow at dawn. They're waiting for us five miles outside the valley. Come on, get your things together. Where's your top coat?
L357594 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I don't see that there's anything to say.
L357593 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ George - you're behaving like a child. You haven't opened your mouth in two weeks.
L357445 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ George. George - do you mind? I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it tonight.
L357444 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ For heaven's sake, Bob, what's the matter with you? You went out there for the purpose of—
L357442 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Why - I'm sorry - but I—
L357441 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Didn't you find out anything about the porters?
L357440 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Porters?
L357439 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What about the porters?
L357392 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ All right. Sorry, George.
L357391 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Let me up! Let me up!
L357387 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Chang! Chang! Chang!
L357386 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ George, come back!
L357385 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Let me go, Bob!
L357384 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ George, what do you think you're doing?
L357349 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Shhh!
L357348 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'm afraid the porters are just a myth.  I guess we never will know why we're here, or how long we're going to be held prisoners.
L357347 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we?
L357346 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
L357345 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Porters?
L357344 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Nothing about the porters yet?
L357343 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Well - I heard that if you want a man's wife, she's yours, if he's got any manners.
L357264 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ That's what's on the other side of the hill.
L357263 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ There must be some connection between the plane and this place. They must have deliberately brought us here. Why, Bob? What reason could they have for doing a thing like that?
L357262 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L357261 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Chang's first question was about the pilot.
L357260 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ George, I've been putting things together. Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot? And why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane? Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point. What brought them there? Unless it was to meet us?
L357259 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What's on your mind, Bob? You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here.
L357258 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Well - I mean—
L357257 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ That's what you said.
L357256 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Did I say "if"?
L357255 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What do you mean if we should get out?
L357254 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Of course you would. If ever we get out of this place, the thing for you to do is to take that job with Helen's father.
L357253 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What could there be except just another hill? In any event, I'm not curious. At the moment, it seems to me we should be concerned about getting home. I'd give anything to be in London right now.
L357252 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Don't you ever want to see what's on the other side of the hill?
L357251 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You're a strange bird. No wonder Gainsford calls you the man who always wanted to see what was on the other side of the hill.
L357250 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ I don't know.
L357249 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L357248 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Something happened to me, when we arrived here, George, that - well - did you ever go to a totally strange place, and feel certain that you've been there before?
L357247 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You talk as though you intend on staying.
L357246 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Oh, I'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything.  I think I'm going to like it here.
L357245 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ It's far from over, from what I can see. This place gives me the creeps, hidden away like this - no contact with civilization. Bob, you don't seem concerned at all.
L357244 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ We've had plenty of it the last few days.
L357243 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Thanks.  I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
L357242 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Hello, George.  Cigarette?
L357108 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ It means we're in unexplored country - country nobody ever reached.
L357107 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What's it mean?
L357106 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ That's where we were this morning. He had it marked. Right on the border of Tibet. Here's where civilization ends. We must be a thousand miles beyond it - just a blank on the map.
L357105 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yes.
L357104 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ See that spot?
L357103 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What is it?
L357101 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Dead?
L357100 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ He's dead.
L357098 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ It looks like it.  Smell those fumes?
L357097 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What is it? Has he fainted?
L357084 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ It's not knowing that's so awful, Bob. Not knowing where you're going, or why, or what's waiting when you get there.
L357083 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Oh George, come on.
L357064 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ I don't know. I can't get the dialect.
L357063 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ What are these people?
L357048 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ I'm going to drag him out and force him to tell us what his game is.
L357047 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ George, what are you going to do?
L357034 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ The bloke up there looks a Chinese, or a Mongolian, or something.
L357033 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Oh, stop it!
L356995 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Huh? Oh, sure, Freshie. Good thing, sleep.
L356994 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Do try to sleep, Bob.
L356993 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Don't worry, George. Nothing's going to happen. I'll fall right into line. I'll be the good little boy that everybody wants me to be. I'll be the best little Foreign Secretary we ever had, just because I haven't the nerve to be anything else.
L356991 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Just you wait until I'm Foreign Secretary. Can't you just see me, Freshie, with all those other shrewd, little Foreign Secretaries?  You see, the trick is to see who can out-talk the other. Everybody wants something for nothing, and if you can't get it with smooth talk, you send an army in. I'm going to fool them, Freshie. I'm not going to have an army. I'm going to disband mine. I'm going to sink my battleships - I'm going to destroy every piece of warcraft. Then when the enemy approaches we'll say, "Come in, gentlemen - what can we do for you?"  So then the poor enemy soldiers will stop and think. And what will they think, Freshie? They'll think to themselves - "Something's wrong here. We've been duped. This is not according to form. These people seem to be quite friendly, and why should we shoot them?" Then they'll lay down their arms. You see how simple the whole thing is? Centuries of tradition kicked right in the pants—  —and I'll be slapped straight into the nearest insane asylum.
L356990 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You'd better try to get some sleep, Bob.
L356989 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Hurray for us. Did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated? No, you wouldn't say that. They don't count.
L356988 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yes.
L356987 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Did you say we saved ninety white people?
L356986 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yes, Bob.
L356985 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Hello, Freshie. Did you make that report out yet?
L356982 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Don't talk nonsense. Give me the bottle.
L356981 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ How I'm going to bask in reflected glory!  People are going to point to me and say, "There goes George Conway - brother of the Foreign Secretary."
L356980 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Hurray!
L356979 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Just this once, Bob. I feel like celebrating. Just think of it, Bob - a cruiser sent to Shanghai just to take you back to England. You know what it means.  Here you are. Don't bother about those cables now. I want you to drink with me.  Gentlemen, I give you Robert Conway - England's new Foreign Secretary.
L356978 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ You?
L356977 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Just what I needed too.
L356943 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Aha - very good, Freshie.[3] Very good. You'd better put his name on the list and make out a report later.
L356942 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ The next time you're in wild country like this, keep in touch with the British Consul.
L356926 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Come on! Quick! This way.
L356925 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Bob, these are all that are left.
L356921 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Right, Bob.
L356920 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ All right, go ahead!  We go on to the next plane. Bring out any people that are left.
L356919 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Come on! We'll burn the hangar. That will make light for them!
L356918 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ The power house - they've blown it up! The planes can't land without lights.
L356904 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Hello? Colonel?
L356903 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yes.
L356902 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ And be sure that none of the natives get in.
L356901 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Yes.
L356900 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Colonel, wait a minute, they may be here now!  Say George, get down on that field and guide those planes in when they get here.
L356899 +++$+++ u1894 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Bob! I think I hear motors!
L357152 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ We'd be eternally grateful if you—
L357151 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ At the mercy of a mad pilot.
L357080 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Well, Mr. Conway, for a man who is supposed to be a leader, your do- nothing attitude is very disappointing.
L357079 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Huh? I give it up. But this not knowing where you're going is exciting anyway.
L357067 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Where are we going? Huh?
L357066 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Imagine having all that fuel there, waiting for us!  George, something tells me our journey is just beginning.
L357060 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ It might afford you a great deal of relief.  Now gentlemen, I'm going back to sleep. Oh, and I was having such a peaceful dream.  As soon as he lands, let me know.
L357059 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Why, you - you— Look here - he may dash us to pieces!
L357058 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ What do you suggest?
L357057 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?
L357056 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ I don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from Fenner.  When he lands, we'll find out.
L357055 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ In for what?
L357054 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ I guess we're in for it.
L357052 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Brilliant!  Can anyone here fly a plane?
L357051 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do.
L357050 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ What if he refuses?
L357049 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Good.
L357046 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ What's he doing? Where's he taking us? He may be a maniac for all we know.
L357045 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ That fellow got on at Baskul.
L357044 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Of course. We never left the air. I know - I didn't sleep the whole night long.
L357043 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ No. That's not possible! If we had landed, we all would have been awakened.
L356941 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ I know - and a war broke out right over your head.
L356940 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Hiding? Oh, no. Hunting - I was in the interior - hunting fossils. This morning I looked up suddenly—
L356939 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Where were you hiding?
L356936 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Why aren't you registered through our office?
L356935 +++$+++ u1898 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ I'm Alexander P. Lovett, sir.
L356934 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Where did you come from?
L357564 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Forgiven.  You know, when we were on that plane, I was fascinated by the way its shadow followed it. That silly shadow racing along over mountains and valleys, covering ten times the distance of the plane. It was always there to greet us with outstretched arms when we landed. And I've been thinking that somehow you're that plane, and I'm that silly shadow. That all my life I've been rushing up and down hills, leaping rivers, crashing over obstacles, never dreaming that one day that beautiful thing in flight would land on this earth and into my arms.
L357563 +++$+++ u1900 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ SONDRA +++$+++ I've thought about it for years.  I knew you'd come. And I knew if you did - you'd never leave.  Am I forgiven for sending for you?
L357561 +++$+++ u1900 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ SONDRA +++$+++ Why?
L357560 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ I'd love it!
L357559 +++$+++ u1900 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ SONDRA +++$+++ Would you like to wring my little neck?
L357558 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Because mother read it in a book somewhere, and if mother's little darling doesn't take her fingers out of the salad bowl this instant, mother's going to wring her little neck.
L357557 +++$+++ u1900 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ SONDRA +++$+++ Why, mother?
L357556 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ It's the most annoying word in the English language. Did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it?  Mother's little darling musn't stick her fingers in the salad bowl. Why? Because it isn't lady- like to do that. Why? Because that's what forks are made for, darling.
L357555 +++$+++ u1900 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ SONDRA +++$+++ I was just going to.
L357554 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ You know, if you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere. And don't ask me why.
L357553 +++$+++ u1900 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ SONDRA +++$+++ Why?
L357552 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Well, everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself, accumulate a nest egg, and so on.
L357551 +++$+++ u1900 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ SONDRA +++$+++ Struggling, why?
L357550 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Oh, the usual reasons. A world full of people struggling for existence.
L357549 +++$+++ u1900 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ SONDRA +++$+++ Why?
L357548 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ It's not so bad, really. Some phases are a little sordid, of course. That's only to be expected.
L357547 +++$+++ u1900 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ SONDRA +++$+++ Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.
L357546 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ You know, sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there?
L357545 +++$+++ u1900 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ SONDRA +++$+++ You see, it's not a dream.
L357544 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Ouch!
L357543 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ When the plane lands at Shangri-La and wakes us all up.
L357542 +++$+++ u1900 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ SONDRA +++$+++ Bump?
L357541 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Beautiful! I'm waiting for the bump.
L357497 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Then it wouldn't be a garden spot for long.
L357496 +++$+++ u1900 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ SONDRA +++$+++ I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart. I have never seen the outside world. But I understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security, where there's beauty and comfort, where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish the whole world might come to this valley.
L357495 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ I wonder.
L357494 +++$+++ u1900 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ SONDRA +++$+++ Perhaps because you've always been a part of Shangri-La without knowing it.
L357493 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ I can't quite explain it, but everything is somehow familiar. The very air that I breathe. The Lamasery, with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley, while its head explores the eternal. All the beautiful things I see, these cherry blossoms, you - all somehow familiar.  I've been kidnapped and brought here against my will. A crime, a great crime, yet I accept it amiably, with the same warm amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend. Why? Can you tell me why?
L357492 +++$+++ u1900 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ SONDRA +++$+++ I'm so glad.
L357491 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ On the contrary, you're not strange. And that in itself is confusing. I have the same idea about Shangri- La. The sense that I've been here before, that I belong here.
L357490 +++$+++ u1900 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ SONDRA +++$+++ I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?
L357489 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ All of it. Father Perrault and his magnificent history. This place, hidden away from the rest of the world, with its glorious concepts, and now you come along and confuse me entirely.
L357488 +++$+++ u1900 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ SONDRA +++$+++ What is?
L357485 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Oh, you're going to make life very simple.
L357484 +++$+++ u1900 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ SONDRA +++$+++ I'm thirty.
L357483 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Father Perrault. Of course I can't quite get used to this age thing.
L357482 +++$+++ u1900 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ SONDRA +++$+++ Yes, I know.
L357481 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked to him last night.
L357480 +++$+++ u1900 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ SONDRA +++$+++ Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.
L357479 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Thank you.
L357478 +++$+++ u1900 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ SONDRA +++$+++ I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here.
L357477 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ There are so many questions I'd like to ask you, I hardly know where to begin.
L357476 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Don't worry about the pigeons. From now on, you can put flutes on my tail and bells on my feet!
L357475 +++$+++ u1900 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ SONDRA +++$+++ I really only brought you here to show you my pigeons!
L357474 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ You're absolutely right. And I had to come all the way to a pigeon house in Shangri-La to find the only other person in the world who knew it. May I congratulate you?
L357473 +++$+++ u1900 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ SONDRA +++$+++ Yes.
L357472 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ A little boy whistling in the dark!? Do you realize that there is a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai, smoke pouring out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings, waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London? Do you know that at this minute there are headlines shrieking all over the world the news that Conway is missing? Does that look like a man whose life is empty?
L357471 +++$+++ u1900 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ SONDRA +++$+++ As a matter of fact, all I saw was a little boy whistling in the dark.
L357470 +++$+++ u1900 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ SONDRA +++$+++ Oh, I know. It was full of this and full of that. But you were accomplishing nothing. You were going nowhere, and you knew it.
L357469 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ A man whose life was empty!
L357468 +++$+++ u1900 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ SONDRA +++$+++ I saw a man whose life was empty.
L357467 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ Oh, you've read my books. You do more things! What have my books got to do with it?
L357466 +++$+++ u1900 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ SONDRA +++$+++ That was easy. I read your books.
L357465 +++$+++ u1893 +++$+++ m124 +++$+++ CONWAY +++$+++ You suggested my being brought here, didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd fit in?
