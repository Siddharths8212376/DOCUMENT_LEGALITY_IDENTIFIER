L191897 +++$+++ u5103 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ THREEPIO +++$+++ It can wait.
L191896 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Sit down, and shut up!
L191895 +++$+++ u5103 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ THREEPIO +++$+++ Sir, I was wondering ...
L191857 +++$+++ u5103 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ THREEPIO +++$+++ The energy shield is down.  We'll be stuck here forever.
L191856 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Transport XJ. get out of here. Go!
L191686 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ The kid ran into something mean, and it wasn't the cold.
L191685 +++$+++ u5103 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ THREEPIO +++$+++ I do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning.  I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit ...
L191684 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ He doesn't make sense to me either, Chewie.
L191644 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Go tell your precious Princess ... Luke is dead unless he shows up soon.
L191643 +++$+++ u5103 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ THREEPIO +++$+++ I don't know, Artoo.  Sir, might I inquire what's going on?
L191636 +++$+++ u5103 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ THREEPIO +++$+++ She is looking for Master Luke, and assumed he would be here with you.  No one seems to know ...
L191635 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ I shut it off.  What's her royal holiness want?
L191634 +++$+++ u5103 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ THREEPIO +++$+++ Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator, but either you have it turned off, or it is malfunctioning ... if it's damaged, Artoo, could fix it, if you like.
L191633 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ What is it?
L191632 +++$+++ u5103 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ THREEPIO +++$+++ Captain Solo, sir. Might I have a word with you?
L192417 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ ... just remember that, Ôcause I'll be back ...
L192416 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ ... I love you.  I couldn't tell you before, but it's true.
L192379 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Me either.  They had me howling on the scan grid, but they never asked me any questions.
L192378 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to.
L192377 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ I was worried about you.
L192308 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Look, sweetheart, I'm not going to have you accusing my friend of ...
L192307 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ No thanks.
L192304 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Chewie, do you think you can repair him?
L192303 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Well, I do trust him.  Lando's an old friend.  Must have been an accident.
L192302 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.
L192301 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ He found him in a junk pile ...
L192298 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Luke!  I'm sure he's fine.  Probably sitting around wondering what we're doing right now.
L192297 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right.
L192296 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Huh?  Oh.  Your droid's been gone too long just to be lost.  He may have gotten into some trouble. Chewie went to look for him.  Come over here.  I want to check this out.
L192295 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Has Threepio turned up yet?
L192294 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ You look great.
L192293 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ You look silly.
L192292 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Who's staring?
L192291 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ What are you staring at?
L192250 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ It'll be all right.  Trust me.  And keep your eyes open.  You wait here.
L192249 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ I don't like this.
L192228 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Let Ôer go, Chewie.
L192227 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ You do have your moments ... Not many, but you do have them.
L192225 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ No.  But he has no love for the Empire, that much I know ...
L192224 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Can you trust him?
L192223 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. Lando and I go way back.
L192222 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ A mining colony.
L192221 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Lando's not a system, he's a man. A gambler, con-artist ... all- around scoundrel ...  ... your kind of guy.  The system is called Bespin.  It's a ways from here, but reachable.
L192220 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Never heard of that system.
L192219 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I knew it!  Lando Calrissian.
L192218 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ You keep logs?  My, how organized.
L192217 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Funny, I have the feeling I've been in this area before.  Let me check my logs.
L192216 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Here ... near the Anoat system.
L192215 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ That depends.  Where are we?
L192214 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Then we have to find a safe port around here.  Got any ideas?
L192213 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Not bad, hot shot, not bad.  Then what?
L192212 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ The fleet is finally breaking up. I'm hoping they'll follow standard Imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed.
L192211 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ What'd you have in mind for your next move?
L192210 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Chewie, check the manual release on the landing claws.
L192209 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.
L192208 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Oh, so sorry!  Didn't mean to offend your droid.  You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?
L192207 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ You could have warned him before you shut him off.
L192166 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ You're going to attack them?!!!
L192165 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Sharp bank, Chewie.  Let's turn this bucket around.  You heard me, turn around!  Full power on the front shield.
L192162 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ It's not my fault.  I can't under- stand it!
L192161 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ No lightspeed?
L192160 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Couldn't be, I checked the transfer circuits, just like you said!  I tell you this time it's not my fault.  I'm sure I checked it.
L192124 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ The entrance is collapsing!
L192123 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ I see it Chewie, hang on.
L192122 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ But the tremors have stopped.
L192121 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off!
L192120 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Those Star Destroyers will spot us long before you can get into light speed.  You can't make the jump in this asteroid field.
L192112 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ There will be more of them.  They always travel in groups.  And there's nothing they like better than to attach themselves to ships. Just what we need right now.
L192111 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Looks like some kind of Mynock.
L192108 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Look, we just got this bucket going again.  I'm not about to let some varmint tear it apart ...
L192107 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Are you crazy!
L192104 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Outside, in the cave.
L192103 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Where?
L192102 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ There's something out there!
L192057 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Try and control this ...
L192056 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ I do not!
L192055 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ You mean a man you can control.
L192054 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ There's nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be civilized.
L192053 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Sure, they're safer.  You always know what they're going to do. Trouble is, it gets a little dull.
L192052 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Don't count on it.  I happen to like nice men.
L192049 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Afraid of?  Certainly not you Captain Solo ... or any other man in this galaxy.
L192048 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ What are you afraid of?
L192046 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Why?
L192045 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Stop that.
L192044 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ That's quite a compliment.
L192043 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Sometimes, maybe ... occasionally, when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
L192042 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ You could be a touch warmer, though.  Admit it, against your better judgment you think I'm all right.
L192041 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Yes, you do.
L192040 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Sure.  I guess I make it difficult sometimes.
L192039 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Would you please stop calling me that?
L192038 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Easy, your worship.  Only trying to help.
L192035 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Where have I heard that before?
L192034 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe.
L192033 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ They're moving away.
L192031 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Felt like a hydro concussion ... an Imperial Cruiser.
L192030 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ That was no earthquake.
L191984 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll have to let go.
L191983 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.
L191982 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Well, I hope you don't expect more.
L191981 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Sorry, Captain, being held by you isn't enough to get me excited.
L191979 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Beautiful.
L191978 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ How do I look?
L191977 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ You don't look angry.
L191976 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Very funny.  You can let go now .... I'm getting angry.
L191975 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Why, Princess, this is so sudden.
L191947 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ That should do nicely.
L191946 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ What is it?
L191945 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ There, there.  Chewie get a reading on that.  Looks pretty good.
L191941 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Right.  I'm going to get in closer to one of these big ones ...
L191940 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Now you're making sense.
L191939 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ We've got to get out of this shower.
L191938 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ I'm against that.
L191937 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ But we're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.
L191936 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Good.
L191935 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ That Star Destroyer is slowing down.
L191934 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ I take it back.
L191933 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Well, you said you wanted to be there when I was wrong.
L191924 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Aren't I?  Hang on, sweetheart. We're gonna do some flyin'.
L191923 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
L191922 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.
L191921 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Probably an asteroid field ....
L191920 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Asteroids!  Chewie, bank left, let's find out where they're coming from ...
L191919 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Or you ran into something ....
L191918 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ That was no laser blast .... some- thing hit us ....
L191894 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ I'm glad you said there was going to be no problem, or I'd be worried.
L191893 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.
L191892 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ I know, I know, I see them ... LEIA See what?
L191874 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ I'll be surprised if we ever start moving.
L191873 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ This baby's got a few surprises left in her.
L191872 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.
L191869 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Don't worry, your holiness, I'll get her started.
L191868 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Would it help if I got out and pushed?
L191851 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Wait, don't open it ... that's one of the traps for the ice creatures.
L191850 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Hey!  Someone's still in here.
L191771 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Who's scruffy-looking?  I tell ya' sweetheart, I must've hit pretty close to the mark to get you hoppin' like this.  Doesn't it look that way to you, Luke?
L191770 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Why you low-down, stuck-up, half- witted, scruffy-looking nerf-herder.
L191769 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Come on, your highness, are you telling me you haven't been thinking about that kiss?
L191768 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ You must have gone completely out of your feeble mind.
L191765 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Ooops!  I guess you haven't told Luke about that yet.
L191764 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ I don't know what he's talking about.
L191759 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ I had nothing to do with it.  General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we know where that probe came from.
L191758 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Well, your worship, it looks like you arranged to keep me close by for a while longer.
L191716 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Now don't panic.  We don't know that.
L191715 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ An Imperial probe droid.
L191714 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit it that hard.  It must have had a self-destruct ....
L191713 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ What was it?
L191712 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ .... I'm afraid there's not much left.
L191691 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ No kidding.  If this snowball's got nasty natives, they could be anywhere.
L191690 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Now all we've got to worry about is what attacked him.
L191688 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Forget it.
L191687 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Those creatures he keeps talking about ... we'd better double the security ... Han, I don't know how ...
L191627 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Sure ... If I were interested. But I don't think it'd be much fun.
L191626 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ And you think you're the one to apply some heat?
L191625 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Spare me please!  Don't tell me about the Rebellion again.  I've had it with your noble mission. All you let yourself think about is the Rebellion.  The result is you're as cold as this planet.
L191624 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ We are fighting for a cause much ...
L191623 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ There's no accounting for taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss.  You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one.  I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute.  But it's too late now, sweetheart.  Your big opportunity is flying out of here.
L191622 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ I'd just as soon kiss a wookiee.
L191621 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Am I?  I say you came running after me because you were afraid I was leaving you without even a kiss.
L191619 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ I respect you.  You're a bold fighter, maybe not the brightest, but ... HAN No, your worship.. That's not what I'm talking about.
L191618 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
L191617 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ And what are they, pray tell?
L191616 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ You probably don't.  How could you?  You're so terrified of your own emotions ...
L191615 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Me?  I don't know what you mean.
L191614 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Not you?
L191613 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Yes.
L191612 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ We?
L191611 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Han, we need you here.
L191610 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ He'll know when he gets back ... Don't give me that look.  Every day more bounty hunters are searching for me.  If I don't pay off Jabba soon, there'll be too many to stop ... Remotes, Gank killers, and who knows what else.  I've got to get that price off my head while I still have a head.
L191609 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ Does Luke know?
L191608 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
L191607 +++$+++ u5099 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LEIA +++$+++ You said you were going to stay. What happened?
L191606 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Yes, Your Highness?
L191798 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Don't worry.  You haven't seen the last of us.
L191797 +++$+++ u5100 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I hope you make your peace with Jabba.
L191767 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Now don't get the wrong idea, pal. She was just trying to express her true feelings for me.
L191766 +++$+++ u5100 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ About what?
L191761 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ That makes a good story.  But I think you just can't bear to let me out of your sight.
L191760 +++$+++ u5100 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Probe?  What probe?
L191757 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ That's two you owe me, junior.
L191756 +++$+++ u5100 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Thanks to you.
L191755 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Hi kid, you look strong enough to wrestle a Gundark.
L191588 +++$+++ u5100 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I'll see you shortly. A meteorite just hit the ground near here and I want to check it out .. Won't be long.
L191587 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
L191586 +++$+++ u5100 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings.
L191585 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Loud and clear, kid.  What's up?
L192396 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Yeah, you're a real hero.
L192395 +++$+++ u5098 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ Don't shoot!  I've done what I can for you.  I'm sorry it's not better, but I've got my own problems.  I've already stuck my neck out further than I should ...
L192392 +++$+++ u5098 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ Don't ask me, but he's on his way.
L192391 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ All this just to get the kid? What's so important about him?
L192388 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Luke?  I don't get it.
L192387 +++$+++ u5098 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ He doesn't want you at all.  He's after someone named Skywalker.
L192386 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ You don't know much about much if you think Vader won't want us dead before this is over.
L192383 +++$+++ u5098 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ Vader agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.  They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.
L192382 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ This ought to be good.
L192381 +++$+++ u5098 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.
L192380 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Get out of here, Lando!
L192327 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ I'm sorry too.
L192326 +++$+++ u5098 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ Sorry friend, I had no choice. They arrived right before you did.
L192272 +++$+++ u5097 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ HAN +++$+++ Nothing.  I never would have guessed that underneath that wild schemer I knew was a respon- sible leader and businessman ... But you wear it well.
L192271 +++$+++ u5098 +++$+++ m337 +++$+++ LANDO +++$+++ Not as well as I'd like.  We're a small outpost and not very self- sufficient.  I've had supply problems of every kind and ...  What's so funny?
