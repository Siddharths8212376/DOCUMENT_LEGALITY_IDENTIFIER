L219320 +++$+++ u5341 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Nineteen.
L219319 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Creasy, how old are you?
L219318 +++$+++ u5341 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ I ought to get some sleep.
L219317 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ I think that's highly unlikely, Creasy.
L219316 +++$+++ u5341 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam. Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he's outta junk. Then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk. So where does it come from? Through the sand?
L219315 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ I wasn't asking.
L219314 +++$+++ u5341 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ I have no idea.
L219313 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Wonder who his supplier is.
L219312 +++$+++ u5341 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Sonofabitch.
L219311 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.
L219310 +++$+++ u5341 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ He doesn't know? How come he doesn't know?
L219309 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ That's what he said.
L219308 +++$+++ u5341 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ CREASY +++$+++ Whaddyamean 'maybe'?
L219307 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Maybe tonight?
L220192 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Go ahead. Make my evening.
L220191 +++$+++ u5342 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ CUMMINGS +++$+++ This one's going to be even more fun.
L220177 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Thank God, the police.
L220176 +++$+++ u5342 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ CUMMINGS +++$+++ Greetings, everyone.
L219772 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Not at all, Chief. But next time... no tongue, okay?
L219771 +++$+++ u5342 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ CUMMINGS +++$+++ Thanks for coming down to see us.
L219770 +++$+++ u5342 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ CUMMINGS +++$+++ That a boy.
L219769 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Not a prayer.
L219768 +++$+++ u5342 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ CUMMINGS +++$+++ Speaking of which, you're not going to print anything before my investigation is through, are you?
L219767 +++$+++ u5342 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ CUMMINGS +++$+++ Its been very nice meeting you. I enjoy your column.
L219766 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ I hate the beach. Wouldn't go there if you paid me. Besides, I'm way overdue on my story about off-track betting in the Himalayas. You don't think it's the mafia, do you?
L219765 +++$+++ u5342 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ CUMMINGS +++$+++ What'll it be Fletch?
L219764 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Can I call my Mom? I'd like to tell here how much I've always loved her.
L219763 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Can I ask anybody now?
L219762 +++$+++ u5342 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ CUMMINGS +++$+++ Ask anybody.
L219761 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ My God, you're serious.
L219760 +++$+++ u5342 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ CUMMINGS +++$+++ After I shoot you, I stick the knife in my arm, then place it in your dead hand. Self-defense. We don't do this very much anymore... but we have. Got rid of a lot of minorities that way.
L219759 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ I'm no lawyer, but I do believe that's a violation of my rights.
L219758 +++$+++ u5342 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ CUMMINGS +++$+++ Maybe I'm not going to keep you here.  Maybe I'm gonna blow your brains out.
L219757 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ You can't keep me here.
L219755 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Hey, you and Tommy Lasorda. That's great.
L219754 +++$+++ u5342 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ CUMMINGS +++$+++ You go back to that goddamn beach, I swear to God I'll make you regret it.
L219752 +++$+++ u5342 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ CUMMINGS +++$+++ You idiot. Off the record, deep background: I've got that beach crawling with undercover cops.
L219751 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ 'Your men' might just be involved in all this.
L219750 +++$+++ u5342 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ CUMMINGS +++$+++ I'm about to break that beach wide open, and I don't need some pennyante Woodward and Bernstein getting in the way of my men.
L219749 +++$+++ u5342 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ CUMMINGS +++$+++ Your editor called me yesterday to respond to allegations you're about to print about police involvement in narcotics dealing. Fletch starts to get up, but Cummings plants his foot on Fletch's chest, forces him back down.
L219748 +++$+++ u5342 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ CUMMINGS +++$+++ We're looking at five years, maybe ten. Is that what you want... Jane Doe?
L219747 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ It was planted on me, sir.
L219746 +++$+++ u5342 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ CUMMINGS +++$+++ For a gentleman who was just found holding a bag full of heroin...
L219745 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probably explains the curious feeling of love I have for you.
L219744 +++$+++ u5342 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ CUMMINGS +++$+++ Why are you doing this Mr. Fletch?
L219743 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ I'm President of the International Fletch Corporation.
L219742 +++$+++ u5342 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ CUMMINGS +++$+++ I see. And what do you do for a living, Mr. Fletch?
L219741 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Fletch F. Fletch
L219740 +++$+++ u5342 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ CUMMINGS +++$+++ Full name.
L219739 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Fletch.
L219738 +++$+++ u5342 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ CUMMINGS +++$+++ You should have seen what she wanted to do with the place. Mauve.  So what's your name?
L219737 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ You decorate this yourself or did Mrs. Chief of Police help you?
L220189 +++$+++ u5342 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ CUMMINGS +++$+++ Your 'foolproof' way is going to land my ass on the front page while you're basking in Rio.
L220188 +++$+++ u5353 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MR. STANWYK +++$+++ Jerry, you're simply going to have to trust me. I've got a foolproof way to get rid of this guy and now you're jeopardizing everything.
L220186 +++$+++ u5342 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ CUMMINGS +++$+++ What, 'long distance?' I couldn't help but hear you say something about Rio, Alan. You're not leaving with the eight hundred thousand dollars I staked you for the next load, are you?
L220185 +++$+++ u5353 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MR. STANWYK +++$+++ I said I'll take care of it. Now, a man of your position shouldn't be a part of what's about to go down. So go home and I'll call you tomorrow.
L220184 +++$+++ u5342 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ CUMMINGS +++$+++ Fat Sam left the beach today. So did Gummy. It began to occur to me that some things are beginning to happen that maybe I should be aware of.
L220183 +++$+++ u5342 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ CUMMINGS +++$+++ Under control? You idiot. You didn't know who he was?
L220182 +++$+++ u5353 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MR. STANWYK +++$+++ I've got it all under control, Jerry. You can go now.
L220179 +++$+++ u5342 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ CUMMINGS +++$+++ Put the gun down, Alan. I'll take care of them.
L220178 +++$+++ u5353 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MR. STANWYK +++$+++ What the hell are you doing here?
L219514 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Thanks, Doc. Maybe I'll come back with a date. Or an elephant.
L219513 +++$+++ u5343 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ DR. DOLEN +++$+++ Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.
L219512 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove?
L219511 +++$+++ u5343 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ DR. DOLEN +++$+++ Yeah, we check you into Mt. Hebron for a few days, run lots of tests, charge a bundle. You can pull your pants up now.
L219510 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ I'm sure it's not for a lack of looking. Maybe I should get a real complete physical. You give Alan an annual, don't you?
L219509 +++$+++ u5343 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ DR. DOLEN +++$+++ I can't discuss another patient. You know that.  Well, I can't find anything wrong with you.
L219508 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right?
L219507 +++$+++ u5343 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ DR. DOLEN +++$+++ Just relax.
L219506 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?
L219505 +++$+++ u5343 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ DR. DOLEN +++$+++ There is?
L219504 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Anyway, I'm surprised Alan got the policy so easily. I know there's a history of cancer in the family.
L219503 +++$+++ u5343 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ DR. DOLEN +++$+++ Breathe easy...
L219502 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Did I say 'kidneys'? I meant my ear. Maybe I should see an ear dahhh --  Ever serve time?
L219501 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Honest, I feel fine. You better be married.
L219500 +++$+++ u5343 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ DR. DOLEN +++$+++ Just relax....
L219499 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
L219498 +++$+++ u5343 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ DR. DOLEN +++$+++ Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar.
L219497 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden.  You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy.
L219496 +++$+++ u5343 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ DR. DOLEN +++$+++ He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
L219495 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Sure, but the end was so sudden.
L219494 +++$+++ u5343 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ DR. DOLEN +++$+++ Oh, he was dying for years.
L219493 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.
L219492 +++$+++ u5343 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ DR. DOLEN +++$+++ I'll bet. Shame about Ed.
L219491 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Is she ever. I've got some stories....
L219490 +++$+++ u5343 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ DR. DOLEN +++$+++ Funny old bird.
L219489 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Margaret.
L219488 +++$+++ u5343 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ DR. DOLEN +++$+++ Well, which one?
L219487 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Right.
L219486 +++$+++ u5343 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ DR. DOLEN +++$+++ Joan or Margaret Smith.
L219485 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Mrs. Smith.
L219484 +++$+++ u5343 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ DR. DOLEN +++$+++ Your aunt?
L219483 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Oh, I don't belong formally. I've gone with my aunt.
L219482 +++$+++ u5343 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ DR. DOLEN +++$+++ Still, it'd an odd name. I don't remember seeing it on the club registry.
L219481 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.
L219480 +++$+++ u5343 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ DR. DOLEN +++$+++ No children?
L219479 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ I don't know. I don't have any.
L219478 +++$+++ u5343 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ DR. DOLEN +++$+++ Arnold Babar. Isn't there a children's book about an elephant named Babar?
L219477 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ But not right next to each other. I thought that's what you meant.
L219476 +++$+++ u5343 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ DR. DOLEN +++$+++ That's two.
L219475 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ One. B-a-b-a-r.
L219474 +++$+++ u5343 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ DR. DOLEN +++$+++ Two bs?
L219473 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ That's Babar.
L219472 +++$+++ u5343 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ DR. DOLEN +++$+++ Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?
L219471 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
L219470 +++$+++ u5343 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ DR. DOLEN +++$+++ That's my club too. I haven't seen you there.
L219469 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Yes.
L219468 +++$+++ u5343 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ DR. DOLEN +++$+++ Really. The California Racquet Club?
L219467 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ We play tennis at the club.
L219466 +++$+++ u5343 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ DR. DOLEN +++$+++ So where do you know Alan from?
L220118 +++$+++ u5344 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FAT SAM +++$+++ Rio. Know how he gets it in the country? Some big shot airline executive flies it in on company jets. Very impressive operation, Fletch. Very impressive.
L220117 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Gum thought Brazil.
L220116 +++$+++ u5344 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FAT SAM +++$+++ You find the source?
L220115 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ What?
L220114 +++$+++ u5344 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FAT SAM +++$+++ Gonna need it. That boy is dangerous. Fletch?
L220113 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Wait five minutes, and go to my office. You'll get federal protection after that.
L220112 +++$+++ u5344 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FAT SAM +++$+++ Noooo. Free snort. That's it.
L220111 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ You don't have a piece of the action?
L220110 +++$+++ u5344 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FAT SAM +++$+++ Oh, I'll help, Fletch. I'm a slave to that sonofabitch. He busted me, third offense, gave me a choice: Work for him or do fifteen long. All I get out of this is free snort.
L220109 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or --
L220108 +++$+++ u5344 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FAT SAM +++$+++ You gonna nail the chief?
L220107 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ For me. I'm a reporter, Sam. I'm breaking the drug story and I got the chief red-handed. Gummy gave me a deposition.
L220106 +++$+++ u5344 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FAT SAM +++$+++ Thought so. What for?
L220105 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Affirmative.
L220104 +++$+++ u5344 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FAT SAM +++$+++ The two surfer boys?
L220103 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Affirmative.
L220102 +++$+++ u5344 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FAT SAM +++$+++ What, the heat here?
L220101 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ I'm serious, Sam.
L220100 +++$+++ u5344 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FAT SAM +++$+++ My pleasure.
L220099 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ You don't know me.
L220098 +++$+++ u5344 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FAT SAM +++$+++ Jesus.
L219298 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Sorry. I find a little humor really brightens things up around here, don’t you?
L219297 +++$+++ u5344 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FAT SAM +++$+++ Fletch...
L219296 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ I think I’d rather have drugs.
L219295 +++$+++ u5344 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FAT SAM +++$+++ No, not for sure. When it comes, it comes. You gonna want some shit?
L219294 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ For sure?
L219293 +++$+++ u5344 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FAT SAM +++$+++ Like tonight.
L219292 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Like when?
L219291 +++$+++ u5344 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FAT SAM +++$+++ Okay. Some idea.
L219290 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ No idea at all?
L219289 +++$+++ u5344 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FAT SAM +++$+++ No idea.
L219288 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ So what do you figure?
L219550 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ He'll be so relieved.
L219549 +++$+++ u5356 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ RECORDS NURSE +++$+++ I guess not.
L219548 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ This was last month. So Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.
L219547 +++$+++ u5356 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ RECORDS NURSE +++$+++ That's it.
L219546 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ That's it?
L219545 +++$+++ u5356 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ RECORDS NURSE +++$+++ Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here.  Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign.
L219544 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ My associates did a biopsy on this man recently.  He's supposed to have a melanoma, or a carcinoma, some kind of noma. Hmmm. I can't seem to find any record of it.
L219543 +++$+++ u5356 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ RECORDS NURSE +++$+++ Is there anything particular you're looking for?
L219542 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Thank you.
L219541 +++$+++ u5356 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ RECORDS NURSE +++$+++ Here you are, Doctor.
L219540 +++$+++ u5356 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ RECORDS NURSE +++$+++ Yes, right away.
L219539 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Oh, God, I think I'm about to hyperventilate. Have you got a paper bag, or something.
L219538 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ It's all right. It wasn't him but that spleen was a splitting image.
L219537 +++$+++ u5356 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ RECORDS NURSE +++$+++ Oh my God!
L219536 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Well, I didn't want to say anything, but I thought the dead man was my brother.
L219535 +++$+++ u5356 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ RECORDS NURSE +++$+++ Doctor Holmes went to get you some smelling salts. He was quite surprised that you fainted.
L219534 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Have you got a make-shift plywood pillory? Heh Heh, just kidding.
L219533 +++$+++ u5356 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ RECORDS NURSE +++$+++ Can I get you something?
L219532 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ I'm fine.
L219531 +++$+++ u5356 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ RECORDS NURSE +++$+++ You're in the Records Room.
L219530 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Where am I?
L219529 +++$+++ u5356 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ RECORDS NURSE +++$+++ Are you all right, Doctor?
L219519 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Right. Fine.
L219518 +++$+++ u5356 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ RECORDS NURSE +++$+++ Nothing. They're still there.
L219517 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ It's me doctor Rosenpenis. I just have to take another peek at Alan Stanwyk's file. What have they done with this place?
L219579 +++$+++ u5347 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ GILLETT +++$+++ Till then.
L219578 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Found it in a cab. That's a grand. Apply the difference to next month.
L219577 +++$+++ u5347 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ GILLETT +++$+++ Cash. I'm impressed.
L219576 +++$+++ u5347 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ GILLETT +++$+++ This is no joke. If some kind of payment isn't made, we're going to have to contact the paper and garnish your wages.
L219575 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Damn... lost again. Sorry.
L219573 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Wait a minute! Our problems might be solved.
L219572 +++$+++ u5347 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ GILLETT +++$+++ That's history, Fletch. You owe us nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
L219571 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Are you serious?
L219570 +++$+++ u5347 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ GILLETT +++$+++ You may be right.
L219569 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ I think he was sleeping with Wendy, too.
L219568 +++$+++ u5347 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ GILLETT +++$+++ I agree.
L219567 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ My lawyer was a bum.
L219566 +++$+++ u5347 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ GILLETT +++$+++ You should have proved that in a court of law.
L219565 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ She was sleeping with everybody. The cable TV guy. You can't get lower than that...
L219564 +++$+++ u5347 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ GILLETT +++$+++ I empathize with your plight, Fletch. However, you threw her out.
L219563 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this.
L219562 +++$+++ u5347 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ GILLETT +++$+++ Until she remarries, Fletch.
L219561 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ It stinks. I thought woman were independent now.
L219560 +++$+++ u5347 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ GILLETT +++$+++ I don't know what you're referring to. Wendy maintains her own residence.
L219559 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ She doesn't need the money, for crissakes. She's living with Monty. I know it.
L219558 +++$+++ u5347 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ GILLETT +++$+++ You owe Wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
L219555 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ I hate to conduct business on the lanai. Why don't we step inside.
L219554 +++$+++ u5347 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ GILLETT +++$+++ I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband.
L219553 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that?
L219552 +++$+++ u5347 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ GILLETT +++$+++ Refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch.
L220172 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Whoops.
L220171 +++$+++ u5353 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MR. STANWYK +++$+++ I was already prepared to commit one murder. What makes you think I won't commit two?
L220166 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ How similar in build you and I are. Then I figured it. You bump me off, throw me in the car, and burn me up.
L220165 +++$+++ u5353 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MR. STANWYK +++$+++ And what was that?
L220164 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ The thing that really tipped it off for me was something your wife said to me while we were in bed together.
L220163 +++$+++ u5353 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MR. STANWYK +++$+++ Bravo, Mr. Fletcher.
L220161 +++$+++ u5345 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ FLETCH +++$+++ Ahem.  'Sally Ann can confirm all this when the police pick her up at the Airport Marriott.'
L220160 +++$+++ u5353 +++$+++ m355 +++$+++ MR. STANWYK +++$+++ I'd have been long gone.
