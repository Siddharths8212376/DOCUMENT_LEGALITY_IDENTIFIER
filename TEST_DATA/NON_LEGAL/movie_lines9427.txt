L562654 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Not the way I can.
L562653 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ And nobody else can do that?
L562652 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ I found a peephole into Deviant World. I'm gonna reach in and yank some of those creeps out.
L562651 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ You need time to think. About the case, about you and me.
L562650 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ What's that?
L562649 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ Then there's the other issue.
L562648 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ That's true.
L562647 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ There's the Agency issue. I think Koessler may suspect something already. We're not on the best footing with him as it is.
L562646 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Oh.
L562645 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me.
L562644 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ I can't. They trust me, they accept me. I've got their confidence.
L562643 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ Maybe we should back off a bit.
L562642 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ You did.
L562641 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.
L562640 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ No, Jaime, I apologize. I didn't... I had no right to speak to you like that.
L562639 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ Mack, I'm sorry. I apologize. I should have called. I had no right to sneak in on you like that.
L562620 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Murman and Imelda had been slipping into a private chat room. Low had poor old Testa drooling on the keyboard. Abduction fantasies, voyeurism, mutilation, teasing him with fetish elements. He is very good. I think it's safe to say Richard Low is Murman.
L562619 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ You should have seen the store manager at Parade of Shoes. She was inconsolable.
L562615 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ Not yet. This time they're waiting for you.
L562614 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Did they disconnect Testa's computer?
L562613 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ You found the body. She was one of Harold Speck's victims. In El Paso.  They're not just talking to each other, Mack, they're trading souvenirs.
L562612 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ You mean --
L562611 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ Sue Ann Hanson.
L562610 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ The tattoo?
L562609 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ We're trying to match them with dump site bodies.  This we know is Carol Delview from Tampa, found her last Spring. This one --
L562608 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Jesus.
L562607 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ We did find these, however.
L562606 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ We got an UNSUB walking around with four feet?
L562605 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ No. Cut off while he was still alive, look at his wrists, damn near ripped his hands off trying to get free. Must have been screaming real loud when the killer chain-sawed his throat. Unfortunately, he'd soundproofed his van.
L562604 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Find the feet?
L562528 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ Not yet. Not about this, either.
L562527 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Not about coming to see Daitz?
L562526 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ Just routine stuff.
L562525 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ What did you tell him?
L562524 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ He's called a couple times.
L562523 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Does Koessler ask about me?
L562522 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ I've been thinking about this.
L562521 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ I know.
L562520 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ It's a no-no.
L562519 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ "Intra-Agency fraternizing."
L562518 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ There are Agency regulations about this.
L562517 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Oh yeah, I forgot.
L562516 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ Because you asked him to, stupid.
L562515 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Why did Koessler assign you as my liaison?
L562514 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ No, Mack, I do not think you're a square and definitely not a nerd.
L562513 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ You must really think I'm a square, a computer nerd.
L562512 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ Of course he did. He came on to every attractive student. Which bothers you most: that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me?
L562511 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ When you were his student? Did he come on to you?
L562510 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ Huh?
L562509 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ I saw him on a talk show once, talking about these killers like they were his friends. Not the victims, not the families of the victims, he doesn't talk about them. Blood money, that's what it is.  Did he hit on you?
L562508 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ Don't be too harsh.
L562507 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ I ever get like that, just take me out in back and shoot me.
L562473 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ He's a consultant to a network TV program on Profilers. He gets a check every episode.
L562472 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?
L562471 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
L562470 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.
L562469 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ Me too.  Make any headway with "Zorro"?
L562468 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Every cop has a story and every story has a girl. The girl in my story was fifteen years-old. She wore a pink angora sweater -- I can still see it -- one day, she disappeared. I told the police she wouldn't run away, I told them who to look for, but I was just a kid. I sat in the police station crying and crying. My parents took me home. The girl was my cousin and the man who abducted her was a teacher I'd had. He kept her alive a week before he killed her. The police could have saved her. Every time I see a photo of a victim I see her. That's what I want to do. I want to save her.
L562465 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ My guess: he's wondering whether to get more fries or go straight to the chocolate sundae.
L562464 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Take it to the next level. What are his fantasies, what turns him on, what kind of pornography does he like? If he could act out his fantasies, what would he do? Imagine yourself one of his victims, realizing your life is in his hands. What is he thinking?
L562463 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ What's this country coming to?
L562462 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ He thinks he looks young.
L562461 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ Grown man dressed like a clown. Does he really think he looks good?
L562460 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Look at this fellow... or this one.
L562458 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ Sex.
L562457 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ What's that?
L562456 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ And one other thing.
L562455 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ I was interested in two things: computers and crime. They sort of came together.
L562454 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ I was going to be a physician, I am a physician, but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me.
L562453 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us.
L562452 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ You got a point there.
L562451 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Taking a Stryker saw, cutting off the top of someone's cranium, pulling the brain out -- what's that, a day in Spring?
L562450 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ This is some serious shit.
L562449 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims: "I went live last month."
L562448 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ "Gone live?"
L562447 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ No, no, no, most of them -- I used to think all of them -- are just fantasists, guys who get off telling degrading stories. When I came across this fugitive chat room, listened in, I started to think some might actually be real, that they'd gone live. The challenge was to figure out which was which. Then I had my disagreement with Koessler.
L562446 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ They're all criminals?
L562445 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Working the net isn't that different from ordinary undercover work. You go into the community, walk their walk, talk their talk, gain their confidence.
L562444 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ You want to have dinner?
L562443 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ The other reason?
L562442 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ That's part of the reason I dropped by. I need to learn this stuff.
L562441 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ That's the beauty of the system. This is a fugitive chat room. It moves from place to place, chat rooms that are normally empty at certain hours: a gardening website, Chaucer buffs, a dating service. A pre- arranged code shows up in one of fifty porn rooms -- that's where I stumbled across it -- notifying "friends" to meet at a certain time, usually midnight to three Eastern Standard, at a certain website -- a deserted chat room, say, "How to Plant Perennials." Come Tuesday, twelve a.m., bingo, these like-minded deviates log on and start yakking it up: explicit sex crime gossip, who did what to whom, who wants to do what, when, why and how.
L562440 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ What about the chat rooms themselves?
L562439 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Setting up. Technically, anyone in a chat room can be traced back to a screen address. But, by using punters, a correspondent literally punts his address around the world, through computers in countries that have no communication treaties. The correspondent becomes "ghosted," invisible.
L562438 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ Don't even go there. What's up?
L562437 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ The man knew how to dress.
L562436 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ Relax.  J. Edgar's greatest fear: a female with a badge.
L562418 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ It explains a lot.
L562417 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Yes I do.
L562408 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Where's my watch? It's gone.
L562407 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ Some kids found you in a garbage dump.
L562336 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ A very sexy case.
L562335 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ That information's being withheld from the media.
L562334 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ And who kills in the manner of his victim.
L562333 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have?  We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the FBI to know he exists.
L562332 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ Doesn't fit.
L562331 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Yeah, you know the vic's car, he was killed this side of the state line, the car then pushed across the border. This by an Unknown Subject, presumably the killer, who left no fucking evidence except the snapshot, which may or may not have been accidental.
L562330 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ This is a sexy case.
L562329 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ Beats me. He just asked me to come along, double-check the forensics.  What did you do to piss him off?
L562328 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Why did he come out here? What's going on?
L562327 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ Not especially.
L562326 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ You work with Koessler?
L562325 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ Five months. I love it.
L562324 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ How long have you been downtown?
L562323 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ I read your white paper. It's sort of like the Bible for what they're trying to do in Computer Crime.
L562322 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ The Academy, then CIIAC.
L562321 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?
L562320 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Maybe I shouldn't put it that way. I'm on my best behavior. I've got to watch what I say.
L562319 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ None taken.
L562318 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense.
L562317 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ Thanks for the ride.
L562986 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ I'll be back.
L562985 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ Bitch! Cunt! Please, please, please don't do this, Agent Kulok. You need me.
L562983 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ Turn around. Stretch your arms over the seat.
L562982 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ No weapon.
L562981 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ Okay, I'll unhook you. No weapon.
L562963 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ I want to protect the boy. I also want to protect Suspect Zero -- from you.
L562962 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ Uncuff me. What's wrong with you? Don't you want to save the boy?
L562961 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ Of course he does. Now get the key, get these things off me.  Unhook me.
L562960 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ Mack must think Zero has a police band.
L562955 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ Sit back.
L562954 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ Unlock these cuffs.
L562931 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ Agent Kulok, could you wipe my face?
L562930 +++$+++ u3073 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ KULOK +++$+++ Kulok.
L562929 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ Agent...
L562994 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Yeah.
L562993 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ Was it Zero?
L562992 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ The boy's okay. I saw him...
L562991 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Yeah.
L562990 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ Is he dead?
L562799 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ Yeah, problem was, I had the only copy. See ya.
L562798 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ You? You went by the book?
L562797 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ This guy, Zero, he drifts around, that's how they all start, drifting around, their minds filling up with fantasies. He thinks he's real smart, laughs at us, laughs at his victims. But he has left a trail, and the trail is somewhere in those names. You know how to reach me.  Take my advice, when dealing with these FBI tight-asses, go by the book. That's what I did.
L562796 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Maybe you should back off.
L562795 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ We're alike. We are hunters. We have the gift. It's ancient times all over again. We stand between order and chaos. I need help. I can't carry on alone.
L562794 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Those were just fantasies.
L562793 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ I know you, Lionheart. I watched your mind work, heard your dirty thoughts --
L562792 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ It was the mall.
L562791 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ You did. You were with her when she disappeared, right? She took you to the mall or the movies, you turn around and she's gone.
L562790 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Who told you about her?
L562789 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ If you won't do it for me, do it for your cousin, Nadine, right? The girl in the pink sweater.
L562788 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ I already have an employer.
L562787 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ There's someone out there, Mack, I know, some man killing for the fun of it, sniffing human glue, without regard to age or sex, without predicable M.O. Someone who has a way to dispose of the bodies. You have access, you can call up local authorities, check morgues, conduct interviews. Be my man.
L562786 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ Please. You can't hide from me, sonny. I invented the questionnaire. I can tell those who talk from those who do it in the time it takes you to fart.
L562785 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ You knew it was me all along?
L562784 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ And who else did I find? Agent Thomas Mackelway, crackerjack FBI techie. I was greatly disappointed when you were re-assigned.
L562783 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ How do you know who's real and who's not?
L562782 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ After my hiatus, after I got my priorities readjusted, I drifted online, started tracking porn chat rooms, looking for Zero. Got accepted, came across these boys swapping stories, pictures, downloads. Never found Zero, but I did come across some Class A scumbags.
L562781 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Daitz hinted it existed. It was a matter of forming the request in the proper terms.
L562780 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ Of course not. They're possibles. I've checked them against Bureau records, check them against your file. How did you get it?
L562779 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Zero killed them all?
L562778 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ It's my master list of missing persons: men, boys, girls, children over the last ten years. Two hundred and eighty-five names. A pool of possible victims.
L562776 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ The file, however, was kept open after your death. NPE disappearances, No Plausible Explanation, were sometimes filed there, deleted if the bodies were found.
L562775 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ Hum a tune and I'll sing to it.
L562774 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ "Agent Low's theory of Suspect Zero, the undetected serial killer, is delusional, the product of good intentions, paranoia and obsession..."
L562773 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
L562772 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ I don't carry it with me.
L562771 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ Was I afraid of Dave Koessler? Not likely. I told you, I'd gotten a bit obsessive. It was an opportunity to back off, think things through.  Where's the file?
L562770 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ So you went underground?
L562769 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition.
L562768 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Suspect Zero?
L562767 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ I'm not sure, exactly. I had monsters on the brain. I wanted to get these guys, every one of them. I got obsessive.
L562766 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ What was your weakness, sir?
L562765 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ He always had a weakness in that area. I saw it the first time I met him. We all had our weaknesses, I guess. Daitz wanted the money. With Dave it was the glory. Koessler saw the Behavioral Sciences Unit as a stepping stone to bigger and better bureaucratic things. He had his eye on the Director's job, even then. Catching killers was a means to an end for them.
L562764 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ He's moved on to TV.
L562763 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ He couldn't break an egg with a hammer. He still writing those crime porn books?
L562762 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ I've been reading, hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor Daitz.
L562761 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ How's the arm?
L562760 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.
L562759 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ Dave Koessler must have you jumping through hoops.
L562752 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ When you exit, head east on 10th.
L562751 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L562750 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ This is Richard Low. Stay on the phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching you. I will instruct you where to drive.
L562749 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Yes.
L562748 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ Agent Mackelway?
L562398 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ I'll give you a little hint. You're a smart guy, figure it out.
L562397 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Who are you?
L562396 +++$+++ u3074 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ LOW +++$+++ The little piggie speaks.
L562395 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ How did you know Speck was a killer?
L562734 +++$+++ u3076 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MURMAN +++$+++ [I don't think so. We want the same thing. See ya.]
L562733 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Leave this room, I'll go back with you, blow your cover.
L562732 +++$+++ u3076 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MURMAN +++$+++ [And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]
L562731 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ I want to go live with you.
L562730 +++$+++ u3076 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MURMAN +++$+++ [What does the file say?]
L562729 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ George Sheldon? The second serial killer killed in the manner of his killings. The crime scene profile was never entered into VICAP. At whose request? David Koessler.
L562728 +++$+++ u3076 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MURMAN +++$+++ [You tell me.]
L562727 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Not everything is imputed to memory. The most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy. Why would the Zero file be kept secret?
L562726 +++$+++ u3076 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MURMAN +++$+++ [Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.]
L562725 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ I've located the Suspect Zero file. Did you know there was one? Koessler ordered it as part of your evaluation.
L562724 +++$+++ u3076 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MURMAN +++$+++ [Not the heart, the watch.]
L562723 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ I want to help you.
L562722 +++$+++ u3076 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MURMAN +++$+++ [Hello, Agent Mackelway. How's the watch? Maybe you can do one of those TV commercials, I found my watch under a serial killer's heart and it was still ticking.]
L562721 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Let's talk about Zero.
L562717 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Let's go someplace private, Murman, I have something for you.
L562716 +++$+++ u3076 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MURMAN +++$+++ [If you wanted a good steak, you should have gone to Omaha.]
L562674 +++$+++ u3076 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MURMAN +++$+++ [Ask for Leslie. Eight days from tonight, exactly one a.m. Be there if you dare. You cannot fool the Murman.]
L562673 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ Haven't had any, but I'm willing to try.
L562672 +++$+++ u3076 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MURMAN +++$+++ [The address is 147 South Rane. It's a lively address. You got a problem with dark meat?]
L562671 +++$+++ u3075 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MACKELWAY +++$+++ If I owe, I will go.
L562670 +++$+++ u3076 +++$+++ m201 +++$+++ MURMAN +++$+++ [Not this way. Call it a little favor, call it a little thing I'm going to do for you. I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you. You'll owe me one.]
