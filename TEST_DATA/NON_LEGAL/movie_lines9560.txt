L51571 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ No... no thank you notes.
L51570 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ What you did changed my life.
L51569 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Hey, what I did for you is working out?
L51568 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Okay.
L51567 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore.
L51566 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ So. Anything else?
L51561 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I want your life for a minute where my big problem is someone offers me a free convertible so I can get out of this city.
L51560 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore.
L51559 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Getting loud, getting loud.
L51543 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ A thank-you note for what you did for me.
L51542 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ What's this?
L51500 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Yes.
L51499 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ So you'll be at work?
L51498 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Just how grateful I am.
L51497 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
L51496 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I'm not kidding.
L51494 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I'm not going to sleep with you. I will never, ever sleep with you. Never. Not ever.
L51493 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ What needs clearing up?
L51492 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I don't think I can wait until tomorrow. This needs clearing up.
L51491 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ You waiting for me to say something?  What sort of thing do you want? Look, I'll be at the restaurant tomorrow.
L51490 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ But you do have some idea how strange that sounds??? I'm worried that you did this because...
L51489 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ To get you back at work so you can wait on me.
L51488 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Why did yo do this for me?
L51487 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Note. Put it in the note.
L51486 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ That's not why I'm here...  ...  though you have no idea what it's like to have a real conversation with a doctor about Spencer...
L51485 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I was working...  can't you just drop me a thank-you note?
L51484 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ The doctors had your billing address. I'm sorry about the hour.
L51483 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Yes.
L51482 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Carol the waitress?
L51481 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Uh, Udall?
L51368 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ No!!! Stay away from me!
L51367 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Yeah, yeah...  any chance you'll get back to work today?
L51354 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ How ya doing?
L51353 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Sorry, honey...  I'll be right there.
L51352 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I hear you talk when I'm waiting!!!
L51351 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ How do you know about my mother?
L51350 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ What about your mother?
L51349 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ My son is sick, okay?
L51348 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it I have not gotten personal and you have. Why aren't you at work? You're not sick -- you don't look sick... just very tired and bitter.
L51347 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
L51346 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I am trying to keep emotions out of this. Even though this is an important issue to me and I have strong feelings about the subject.
L51345 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Are you totally gone? This is my private home...
L51344 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ This is not a sexist thing. If you were a waiter I would still be here saying...
L51343 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L51342 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I'm hungry.  You've upset my whole day. I haven't eaten.
L51294 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ You all set here?
L51293 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Last week I was playing the piano for him and he likes it, and so I decide I'm going to make a little joke...
L51290 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ What's with the dark?
L51289 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Okay, pal...  I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.
L51288 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Otherwise, you're not ugly.
L51287 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ And if I had to guess by your eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, so much for eyes. But as long as you bring up age...  how old are you?
L51286 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ If I had to guess by your eyes, I'd say you were fifty.
L51285 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Oh, please...
L51284 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ How old are you?
L51283 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ You know he's a little dog. Next time, if Bryan's not here, you can bring him in.
L51282 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ It's okay -- I'll sit here.
L51281 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Sorry.
L51280 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake.
L51279 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ You're not worried that someone might take him?
L51278 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
L51277 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ So what are you doing with a dog?
L51226 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Spence.
L51225 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Okay.
L51224 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Spencer.
L51223 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ His name?
L51222 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ An ear infection can send us to the emergency room -- maybe five, six times a month where I get whatever nine-year-old they just made a doctor. Nice chatting with you.
L51221 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ No.
L51220 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ He's gotta fight to breathe. His asthma can just shoot off the charts -- he's allergic to dust and this is New York and his immune system bails on him when there's trouble so an ear infection...  Is this bothering you?
L51219 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ What do you care?
L51218 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ What's wrong with your son, anyway?
L51217 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Just give yourself a little pep talk. "Must try other people's clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out."
L51216 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I see the help -- judgement call.
L51215 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours...  afraid it isn't clean?
L51214 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Okay.
L51213 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Clippity clop -- clippity clop -- she has to pretend she doesn't hear me. Listening to the story from the upset friend...  now she drops off the cappuccino and smiles at the putzette who doesn't even say, "Thank you." No, the putzette wanted the whipped cream so back she goes and now she has to pass him again and it's getting tougher to make believe.
L51168 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ We're all gonna die soon. I will. You will. It sure sounds like your son will.
L51167 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
L51166 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ The table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it. Two sausages, six bacon strips, fries, three eggs over easy and coffee.
L51159 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ It's not your table. It's the place's table. Behave. This once, you can sit at someone else's station.
L51158 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I've got Jews at my table.
L51157 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I know. He's just the best.
L51153 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Will you please take it?
L51152 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I'm starving.
L51815 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Don't want to. I love you.
L51814 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ I love you...  Let him take you home.
L51796 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ You think you're kidding.
L51795 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ One night with me!
L51792 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ I'll take care of myself --
L51791 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ But what about...
L51785 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ I just love her.  How're you doing?
L51784 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ We held each other. It was better than sex. What I need he gave me great.
L51777 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ All right, cut me a break.
L51776 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ That long neck -- the line of you... you're porcelain... your back goes on forever. You're classic... you're why cavemen chiseled on walls...
L51775 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...
L51774 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ But you're beautiful... your skin glows.
L51773 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Stop staring. Do a vase.
L51772 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ I haven't even been thinking about sketching for weeks.
L51771 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ No... Absolutely not. I'm shyer than you think. I give the wrong impression sometimes and...
L51770 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ I've got to sketch you.
L51768 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Good night.
L51767 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Good night.
L51766 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Can you believe in our little mix you're the good roommate.
L51765 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ How to die, mostly.
L51764 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Why? What have you been thinking about?
L51763 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Well, considering everything's horrible and tomorrow I have to face my parents... Don't ask me ... I'm sick of my own complaints ... got to get me a new set of thoughts.
L51762 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I'm sorry... are you okay?
L51761 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Uh-huh...
L51760 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal.
L51759 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ No!!!
L51758 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I don't think so. You need help with the pants?
L51757 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Can you not be violent?
L51756 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Our room. I don't want to see him and he's not going to come knocking on your door.
L51755 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Was this supposed to be your room?
L51680 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ What a nice compliment.
L51679 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along.
L51678 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I don't blame you... This is a monumental first day out... You sad or anything?
L51649 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ No, let me pull over so I can pay full attention.
L51648 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Well...
L51647 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Yes. I really would.
L51646 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Do you want to know what happened with my parents?
L51641 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ I'm sorry... I can't hear you. I can't turn my head all the way yet... tell her we can't hear her.
L51640 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I don't know the last time I've been out of the city... Hey, my arms are tanning. I used to tan great. We gotta stop soon so'se I can check on Spencer.
L51335 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Hey, elephant girl, call her or something...  just let her do my one meal here. I'll pay whatever. I'll wait.  Do it!!!
L51334 +++$+++ u3778 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CHERYL +++$+++ What the heck do you mean?
L51333 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ What are you trying to do to me?
L51332 +++$+++ u3778 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CHERYL +++$+++ I'm filling in. We don't know if she's coming back. She might have to get a job closer to home.
L51331 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ No. No. Get Carol.
L51330 +++$+++ u3778 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CHERYL +++$+++ What the heck are those for?
L51328 +++$+++ u3779 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Yes.  No.
L51327 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Shhhhhhh. I don't have this mountain of available time...  I got to get to my restaurant on time. Do you know how hard it is for me to be here?
L51326 +++$+++ u3779 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ I also regrew my beard...  but you're not interested in changes in me... so it's like I always told you...  when it comes to people you...
L51325 +++$+++ u3779 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Two years ago...
L51324 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ You changed the room around...
L51323 +++$+++ u3779 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ I can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app --
L51322 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ You said you could help me -- what was that -- a tease?
L51321 +++$+++ u3779 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ There's not going to be a debate. You must leave.
L51320 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Explain to me how you can diagnose someone as "obsessive compulsive disorder" and then act like I have any choice in barging in.
L51319 +++$+++ u3779 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ If you want to see me you will not do this. You will make an appointment...
L51318 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Help!
L51621 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ So am I, Frank.
L51620 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I'm sorry that I'm not taking you.
L51274 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Yes. Your dog is fine, Simon.
L51273 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ You are very certain my dog is okay...  because you have no idea...
L51272 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ No, I promise...  not a chance. I own this guy. There was no one else. I'm on the move too much. Trust me.
L51271 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ How could you do that? He'll hurt him.
L51270 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.
L51269 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ So, what's new anyway? How's Verdell?
L51266 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Jackie, will you hand me the mirror?
L51265 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Hey, hey...  Haaa...  bad but temporary. The nurses say it's much better than you looked three weeks ago...  the hand will come back...  they're sure...
L51135 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Won't worry about it. You go ahead.
L51134 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he?
L51565 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Last word freak.
L51564 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.
L51563 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow. Let's not drag this out. We don't enjoy another that much.
L51558 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Like the wind but I'm not doing it.
L51557 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Take my car -- a convertible. Do you drive?
L51556 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Think white and get serious.
L51555 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high maintenance selling painter coming through... So I'm out. Can you take him?
L51554 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Yeah. If his parents are alive they've got to help -- those are the rules. Good.
L51553 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It's not only financial assistance. What he's got to do is go to Baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money. It's not going to happen on the phone.
L51552 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Concerned. I'm just the hall monitor here.
L51551 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Yeah, but it's all about Simon now... you helped with the dog... And now there are other things. I'm just as concerned as you are about Simon.
L51550 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ About a dog.
L51549 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Hey -- you called me... I...
L51548 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ "What?" Look at you... You sense a mark.
L51547 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What?
L51546 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It looks like it really went over. You're sure making the rounds. Simon says you brought him soup last night. I hope he doesn't write you a note.
L51545 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Really nice. Shouldn't that be a good thing... telling someone, 'no thanks required.'
L51544 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ She's nice.
L51540 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Do it.
L51539 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days.
L51538 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Sure -- take him to the vet.
L51537 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ It's not my dog and this Simon seems to have enough on his mind -- but he did throw up twice and his spark is off.
L51307 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Okay by me.
L51306 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow.
L51305 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ It's been five weeks...  another few won't kill me.
L51304 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Simon's home. I was sort of hoping you could keep the dog until he's had a chance to think and adjust...
L51303 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ He's a pain in the ass.
L51302 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ How's Verdell doing?
L51255 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You don't want to mess with me today. I'll figure something else out tomorrow.
L51254 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Hey, where are you going? You can't do this.  I can't take a dog.  Nobody's ever been in here before.
L51253 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Thanks for looking after him.
L51252 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I'm not saying nothing to you.
L51251 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You're taking him...  yes...  you're taking him -- this will clear the books. One night. You want to say "no" to me? Try...  because I've never felt as nuts as I do right this second. I almost want you to try saying "no."
L51140 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Shhhh now. I like Simon. I like him enough to batter you unrecognizable if you verbally abuse him or so much as touch his dog again. Meanwhile, I'll try and think how you can make this up to him.  I hate doing this. I'm an art dealer.  Have a nice day. Party!
L51139 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Police! Police! Fucking crooked police...  doughnut-munching morons help me!  Assault and battery and you're black.
L51138 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me.
L51137 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ No touch. No touch. No touch.
L51104 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Hope you find him. I love that dog.
L51103 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Definitely a package you don't want to open or touch.
L51101 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ What I know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me, I don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show. Are we being neighbors for now?
L51100 +++$+++ u3781 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Simon, you've got to get dressed.
L51709 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ No, it's all right. I'll just watch.
L51708 +++$+++ u3782 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ HEAD WAITER +++$+++ Shall I get her for you?
L51696 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Wait here.
L51695 +++$+++ u3782 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ HEAD WAITER +++$+++ Actually, I don't think so.
L51692 +++$+++ u3782 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ HEAD WAITER +++$+++ They require a tie and jacket but we have some available.
L51691 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ What?
L51690 +++$+++ u3782 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ HEAD WAITER +++$+++ Yes, we do... And I can give you a tie and jacket.
L51687 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Hi. You have hard shells, right?
