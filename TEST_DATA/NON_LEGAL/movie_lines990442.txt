L615974 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Not because of Ned.
L615971 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ Don't kid yourself--you know how I stand back there.
L615970 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ --you'd go with him!
L615969 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ A tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and--
L615968 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ You leave the kid alone.
L615967 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ Thanks to me.
L615966 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ He's all right.
L615965 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ That's more like the old Sally--a little bit of fire.  How about Ned?
L615964 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ You get wise to <U>yourself</U>! If you know what's good for you, you'll leave me alone. Everybody's entitled to one mistake--Well--you're mine. When the going got too rough, I pulled up stakes and quit. We stay quit!--Get that!--And what're you going to do about it?
L615963 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ Get wise to yourself, Sally--you're no sob story.
L615962 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I wish I could.
L615961 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ Because I want you--will always want you--no other woman'll ever take your place.  I want you more now than I did that first night--  You've forgotten all that, I suppose?
L615960 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Why don't you leave me alone?
L615959 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ It wasn't smart. Even if you'd gotten away without me --I'd have found you--no matter where you were.
L615958 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I didn't want to see you again--that's my privilege.
L615957 +++$+++ u8470 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ LOTHER +++$+++ You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.
L615956 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ All right--but what is there to face? It's finished.
L616478 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ This is interesting--  Why didn't you tell me you gave this kid your gun last night?
L616477 +++$+++ u8473 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ NED +++$+++ I tried to borrow a gun from Chad, but--
L616474 +++$+++ u8473 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ NED +++$+++ Because I was yellow, I guess--
L616473 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Why?
L616472 +++$+++ u8473 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ NED +++$+++ I wouldn't say that--  I'm glad he's dead--yes--I'd thought of killing him-- but I didn't--
L616471 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ S'pose you've never thought of killing him--
L616470 +++$+++ u8473 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ NED +++$+++ No!
L616469 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ You didn't have a gun in your hand last night?
L616468 +++$+++ u8473 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ NED +++$+++ Yes, Yes!
L616529 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ He's a swell person. He told me he'd rather turn one guy straight than jug a million.
L616528 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Next time I get a vacation I'll spend it at headquarters. Good-night.
L616519 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ I hope so. Well, I guess you two can do without me. I'll be seeing you.
L616518 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I've got a hunch you're going to win that bet, Inspector.
L616517 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Soon as I get that bracelet back I'm going to relax. Wish the guy that borrowed it would help me out--I got to win that fifty bucks.
L616462 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ For a very excellent reason from your own admission--  --I'm not saying you <U>did</U>--but I think you know more than you're telling. Years of experience have taught me to mistrust circumstantial evidence. Nevertheless, in your case there's plenty of it.
L616461 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Why should <U>I</U> kill him?
L616460 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ I sincerely hope so--
L616459 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ That's the truth--every single word!
L616361 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Maybe you will after you've thought it over.
L616360 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at.
L616359 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ And if you liked the person, you'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight, wouldn't you?
L616358 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Well, of course, I wouldn't take it.
L616357 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ I mean if you knew it were stolen.
L616356 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Say, "Thanks very much!"
L616355 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ He'll be back.  What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?
L616354 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?
L616353 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Congratulations.
L616233 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Good night!
L616232 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ It's getting kind of chilly on deck. If you'll excuse me, I think I'll go to bed. Good night, Mr. McKinney!
L616258 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Nothin--  --I just remembered the name of a guy that owes me fifty bucks.
L616257 +++$+++ u8474 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ PURSER +++$+++ What's the matter?
L616256 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Well, I'll be a son of a sea cook!
L616255 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ It all depends on what you're used to.
L616254 +++$+++ u8474 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ PURSER +++$+++ I mean--a lot of gentlemen would be offended if you searched them like that.
L616253 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ "Smooth's" the word.
L616252 +++$+++ u8474 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ PURSER +++$+++ He's certainly good-natured.
L615864 +++$+++ u8474 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ PURSER +++$+++ Thirty one's and two ten's?
L615863 +++$+++ u8472 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ MCKINNEY +++$+++ Thank you.
L615862 +++$+++ u8474 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ PURSER +++$+++ There you are, sir.
L616140 +++$+++ u8473 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ NED +++$+++ If he comes near you again, I'll break his neck--

L616138 +++$+++ u8473 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ NED +++$+++ What!--are you crazy?
L616137 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I was in his cabin--
L616136 +++$+++ u8473 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ NED +++$+++ You saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you?
L616135 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I'm all right.
L615941 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Aren't the roses beautiful?
L615940 +++$+++ u8473 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ NED +++$+++ Sure, Sis.
L615939 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Isn't it great to be away from it all? Aren't you happy? It seems too good to be true.
L615397 +++$+++ u8475 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Do you think Lother could have seen it?
L615396 +++$+++ u8473 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ NED +++$+++ I thought I had our sailing covered up--  --and here it is.
L616330 +++$+++ u8476 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ SHORTIE +++$+++ Because you ran after me.
L616329 +++$+++ u8477 +++$+++ m575 +++$+++ STEWARD +++$+++ Then why did you run away?
