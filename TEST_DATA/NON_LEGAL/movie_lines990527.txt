L663536 +++$+++ u8982 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ We should get back to the lab.  You okay, Jon?
L663535 +++$+++ u8983 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JON +++$+++ Nothing.  What were you going to say?
L663534 +++$+++ u8982 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ We should get back --  What?
L663533 +++$+++ u8983 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JON +++$+++ Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --
L663532 +++$+++ u8982 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
L663531 +++$+++ u8983 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JON +++$+++ Nothing wrong with ketchup.
L663530 +++$+++ u8982 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JANEY +++$+++ With lots of ketchup?
L663529 +++$+++ u8983 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JON +++$+++ I'll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I'm gonna head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.
L663787 +++$+++ u8984 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JUSTINE +++$+++ Isn't it true that you --
L663786 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ I did not.  Now get out of my way!
L663785 +++$+++ u8984 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JUSTINE +++$+++ Did you know he was back on the streets?
L663784 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ No comment.
L663682 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ No.  We laid out very careful ground rules --
L663681 +++$+++ u8984 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JUSTINE +++$+++ Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.
L663680 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ No.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the Watchmen.
L663679 +++$+++ u8984 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ JUSTINE +++$+++ Thanks, no.  But it's a wonderful product.  Now Adrian -- your old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --
L663678 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Sphinx brand.  When I got out of weapons design, I wanted to move into a more . . . humanitarian area.  I was thinking: what would do some good in the world?  And I thought: why not a genetically-altered tobacco, that no only doesn't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs as you smoke it?  In fact I think I'll have one now.  Care to join me?
L663599 +++$+++ u8989 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ SCHMIDT +++$+++ That's right.  Your meal ticket's flown the coop.  That blue bastard has apparently left the planet.
L663598 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Jon??  You mean he's --
L663597 +++$+++ u8989 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ SCHMIDT +++$+++ Oh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan border this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out.
L663596 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --
L663595 +++$+++ u8989 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ SCHMIDT +++$+++ You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.
L663594 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Am I free to go?
L663593 +++$+++ u8989 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ SCHMIDT +++$+++ All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.
L663468 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible joke to make me --
L663467 +++$+++ u8989 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ SCHMIDT +++$+++ Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
L663466 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ What does this mean?  What does it --
L663465 +++$+++ u8989 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ SCHMIDT +++$+++ I'm terribly sorry.
L663464 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?
L663463 +++$+++ u8989 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ SCHMIDT +++$+++ Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else in common as well.  They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.
L663462 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Then why don't you ask him?!?
L663461 +++$+++ u8989 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ SCHMIDT +++$+++ You're not "protecting" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on the answers you give.  These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --
L663460 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I don't know their real names!
L663459 +++$+++ u8989 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ SCHMIDT +++$+++ You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
L663458 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I don't know their real names.
L663457 +++$+++ u8989 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ SCHMIDT +++$+++ Their real names, please.
L663379 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ I'm sorry about Blake.
L663378 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Maybe I'll do that.
L663377 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Nasty cough.  -- Try one of mine.  Darling, you need to get out of the house.  Why don't you give Daniel a call?  I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you.
L663376 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.  I'll ring for the guards.
L663375 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ What about you?
L663374 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --
L663373 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed the world.
L663372 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human.  He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams.
L663371 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ He's a little farther gone every time.
L663370 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Please.
L663369 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
L663368 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --
L663350 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ He's in by the superaccelerator.  -- Let me take your coat.
L663349 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
L663348 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Don't rub it in.  I live here.
L663347 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Laurie!  Good to see you.
L663346 +++$+++ u8985 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Adrian.
L663671 +++$+++ u8986 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ MOLOCH +++$+++ No, no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case, Rorschach, I got something for you.
L663670 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Two things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational drugs.
L663629 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Don't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.
L663628 +++$+++ u8986 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ MOLOCH +++$+++ CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --
L663627 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
L663626 +++$+++ u8986 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ MOLOCH +++$+++ Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with --
L663622 +++$+++ u8986 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ MOLOCH +++$+++ ALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How'd you find me?
L663621 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Terrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon.
L663620 +++$+++ u8986 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ MOLOCH +++$+++ You're making a big --
L663619 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Edgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch.
L663618 +++$+++ u8986 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ MOLOCH +++$+++ I don't know who you are buddy, but I swear to God, you got the wrong guy.
L664123 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking at.
L664122 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.
L664119 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ No.  I just hastened the inevitable.  He's been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a little push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer.
L664118 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Veidt.  You're the one who started World War III.
L664113 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save the world.
L664112 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .
L663691 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Fate of the world at stake, Adrian.  Can't get too worked up over bad press.
L663690 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Yeah, I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a roomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now.  And whatever you're doing, knock it off.  You're making us all look bad.
L663689 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Bigger than I thought.  CTU involved . . .
L663688 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ What is that ungodly smell?
L663687 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked up.
L663686 +++$+++ u8990 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ VEIDT +++$+++ Ever see one of these before?
L663685 +++$+++ u8988 +++$+++ m612 +++$+++ RORSCHACH +++$+++ New information.
L665331 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You're a jerk-off, you know that?
L665330 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing.
L665329 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ No needles, huh? What about the acid bath?
L665328 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ On come on, X. Did you really think we were that barbaric?
L665327 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles?
L665326 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ You know what they say, the only way to change the system is from the inside.
L665325 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Who says you're the good guys?
L665324 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there. You're a hero. Don't be afraid to join the good guys.
L665323 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ But I hate cops, remember? Except for her.
L665322 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ You've kept up your end of the bargain, I'll do the same. But you really should consider staying on, you make a decent agent.
L665321 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
L665320 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Thought you bought the farm down there, X. Glad as hell to see you.
L665247 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ We don't have that kinda time, boss, I don't think Prague's gonna be around much longer. I've gotta go now. I've got a lot of bad guys to kill.
L665246 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Somebody else makes those decisions, not guys like you and me. You've done your job, X, head back to Prague. I'll be landing in 90 minutes. This is my operation now.
L665245 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Kinda funny, though, isn't it? We're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway. Guess we shoulda played by the rules.
L665244 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Yeah, that's right. So now that you know, you understand why it's important that we get it back.
L665243 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is something we came up with?
L665242 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Silent Night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent. The glass canister is shot into the air and detonated. The black and white chemicals mix, forming a toxic cloud. When it settles down to Earth, it'll kill everything in the vicinity.
L665241 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Come on, Gibbons, you can do better then that.
L665240 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Yes it does.
L665239 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ They retrofitted Ahab with some kind of rocket launcher. They were loading canisters of liquid into it, light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate. Something tells me this it that "classified" stuff you didn't want me to know about. Does the song "Silent Night" mean anything to you?
L665238 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ I'm on the way with a team to relieve you. What's the latest?
L665237 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Snow covered fortress. Army of bad guys. The usual.
L665162 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You ain't seen nothing yet.
L665161 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work.
L665160 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Thanks.
L665159 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ I'm gonna be en route with a team shortly to relieve you. Just keep the pressure on until the cavalry arrives. And X? You done yourself proud helping those people today.
L665158 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Hey, one miracle at a time. They're on to me now, remember?
L665157 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ This is good work, X, damn fine work. You need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this "Ahab".
L665156 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Yeah, I sent you pictures. Here's what I'm thinking. If they take out the cameras and sensors, they could probably put a bomb in this thing. You drop it in the water in the Red Sea and three weeks later it's swimming up the Potomac.
L665155 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ You did say "Ahab"? You're sure about that?
L664955 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I know, poison needles in my shins. You've got 36 hours. Peace, out.
L664954 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ My friend, if you're planning on crossing me...
L664953 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Call me crazy, but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side. What else? You gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too?
L664952 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ That information is classified. You're there to gather information on their operations, period.
L664951 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick.
L664950 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ We're not after car thieves here.
L664949 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I'm already on a first name basis with these dudes, I got a deal set up, you want me to hammer it or not?
L664948 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ One point two million dollars? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars!
L664947 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money.
L664946 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment, X.
L664945 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I guess you got my E-mail. I set up a purchase. Ten cars.
L664869 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Just remember, I'll be watching.
L664868 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Is that all?
L664867 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Crude and defiant as always, Triple X. It fits so well because you're obscene.
L664866 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Up yours.
L664863 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5.
L664862 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ I expect you to call in regularly with progress reports.
L664859 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Yeah, I spy or I die.
L664858 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Wherever you go on the planet, I'll find you. There's no quitting. If you try to take it off, a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground. Is all that clear?
L664857 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ How about a pedicure as long as you're down there. What's this? Lo-Jack?
L664849 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ What's with that "X" on the back of your head? Does that mean you're "extreme"? I've got some news for you, Mr. X, you're a three time loser. So maybe you should tattoo another couple of X's on your head.
L664848 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Not bad for a gimp.
L664847 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You're one sick bastard. A sadist with a badge looking to rope me in to a suicide mission. I think no matter which way I go I'm likely to wind up face down on a sheet of plastic. So here's my answer: kiss my ass, Hop-along.
L664846 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ If you find out what I want to know, and if I'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath.
L664845 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ What do I get out of it?
L664844 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.
L664843 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Now I'm the one who's nauseous. So what's the deal? What do you need me for?
L664839 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ That's too bad. I thought a guy like you would appreciate the challenge.
L664838 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I plan on getting a lot older. And playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead.
L664837 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ You're an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary. You risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you're not getting any younger.
L664836 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ I'm not interested. I've already got a job.
L664835 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ You're perceptive too. I forgot to add that to the list of surprises. I'm with the National Security Agency. And unlikely as it may sound, I need your help.
L664834 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You want the cheap backstory? The runaway mom, the suicide dad and the foster homes? Gimme a break. You're not interested in my past, you're interested in my future as some kind of spy.
L664833 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ You've really got me confused, Cage. On the one hand you showed leadership, courage under fire, a willingness to protect men you hardly knew... and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic. Help me out here. I'm not following your evolution.
L664832 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Good thing you were there to save the day. Come walk with me.
L664831 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
L664830 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class.
L664772 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ You know what I hate? It's always the assholes that pass the tests.
L664771 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ You know what I hate? Any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they're God.
L664770 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage. It's nausea.
L664769 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Is that a fact?
L664768 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ You've got this wrong. You're not under arrest, you've been abducted. And until I say different, you belong to me.
L664767 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me, I'm walking.
L664766 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
L664765 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
L664764 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Why is that?
L664763 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ ..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy.
L664762 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. "Many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?
L664761 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.
L664760 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ It's your lucky day. You just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy.
L664759 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit.
L664758 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character.
L664757 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ That shows me already that you don't have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?
L664756 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place. I expected you to do the same.
L664753 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Diner, huh? Let me tell you what the problem is. I wake up drugged to find what? You've got a "salesman" over here reading a three week old newspaper. He's pulling a 211 with a "trucker", who happens to be packing a cop issue H&K 9mm. I get tipped that something is going down when she passes me a note. How's that for twisted logic? How did she know there was trouble unless they pulled the guns before I "walked" in? And if that's true, why'd they stop and wait until I woke up to gaffle the money? Then I notice how beefy they both are. Hell, even the waitress is cut. All three of them look like they went through the same training program. Ergo they ain't strangers and this isn't what it seems. That's how I knew yo-yo wouldn't get a round off even if I gave him all day. Why?
L664752 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Looks like a diner.
L664751 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ What is this place?
L664750 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ The name's Gibbons. You were saying?
L664749 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Who the hell are you?
L664964 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ So the odds are up to fifty-fifty? I can deal with that.
L664963 +++$+++ u8995 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SAM TANNICK +++$+++ Alright, do what you want. But keep the screws on him. He's a wild card. That could be either good or bad.
L664962 +++$+++ u8995 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SAM TANNICK +++$+++ Why not? You were going to throw him in a tub full of acid, weren't you?
L664961 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ He's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined. He got us an account number to boot. Now even if he's just dumb and lucky, I say we back his play.  I put him out there, Sam. If he doesn't come up with the money, they'll kill him. I can't let that happen.
L664960 +++$+++ u8995 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SAM TANNICK +++$+++ You're talking about a very expensive risk here.
L664959 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely.
L664958 +++$+++ u8995 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SAM TANNICK +++$+++ You what? A wire transfer of this size?
L664957 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ I think we should send him whatever he wants.
L664956 +++$+++ u8995 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SAM TANNICK +++$+++ Ridiculous. Cut him off. I'm sorry Gibbons, you pulled up a shark this time.
L664695 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ That's exactly why we need them.
L664694 +++$+++ u8995 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SAM TANNICK +++$+++ They're degenerates. There's not a man in there that would give a damn if the Chinese took over.
L664693 +++$+++ u8995 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SAM TANNICK +++$+++ I've seen enough. Turn it off.
L664692 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ But programmable. And expendable.
L664691 +++$+++ u8995 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SAM TANNICK +++$+++ The scum of the Earth.
L664690 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ The usual prospects. Convicts, contract killers, murde...
L664689 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ You wanna find out about rats, ask a rat. I've had my people put together a talent pool. I downloaded it to your desktop.
L664688 +++$+++ u8995 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SAM TANNICK +++$+++ So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven.
L664687 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ I'll go in with a team. But first I'm going to need some intel. I'll have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming. One of their own.
L664686 +++$+++ u8995 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SAM TANNICK +++$+++ How will you fix it?
L664685 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it.
L664684 +++$+++ u8995 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SAM TANNICK +++$+++ Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
L664683 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ They're ruthless and they have a lot of firepower. It's only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy Silent Night. Then we're gonna have a catastrophe on our hands.
L664682 +++$+++ u8995 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SAM TANNICK +++$+++ He was the best there was. That makes three agents lost.
L664681 +++$+++ u8991 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ GIBBONS +++$+++ Not a whole helluva lot. His final transmission was mangled. About something or someone called "Ahab". Whatever it is, it cost him his life.
L664680 +++$+++ u8995 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ SAM TANNICK +++$+++ What do you have?
L664809 +++$+++ u8992 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ JEFE +++$+++ Now you're gonna make me enjoy this, funny guy. Now I'm gonna take the whole foot off. Whatchu think of that?
L664808 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Alright. You wanna eat through a tube, be my guest.
L664807 +++$+++ u8992 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ JEFE +++$+++ You saving me? You talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling.
L664806 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ We're on to the game, ese. You got the fake blood splattered all over the walls, you got your torture tools... It's all very cute. But come on, let's quit while you're ahead. I'm only trying to save you a beatin'.
L664800 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ We're anti-social. We don't have any friends.
L664799 +++$+++ u8992 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ JEFE +++$+++ We seen this kind of parachutes before, you know. U.S. Army. You got some friends here, jump out with you guys?
L664798 +++$+++ u8992 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ JEFE +++$+++ That's some accident, hombre. You accidentally fall out of a plane in the middle of the night and land up in my back yard.
L664797 +++$+++ u9000 +++$+++ m613 +++$+++ XANDER +++$+++ Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.
