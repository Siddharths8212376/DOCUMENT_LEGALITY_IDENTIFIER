L350140 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino.
L350139 +++$+++ u1840 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
L350138 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ I'm sorry. After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline.
L350596 +++$+++ u1842 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JIMMY THE DEMON +++$+++ He's got 'til midnight tonight, Nicky.  You get your ass back up there. You save your father!
L350595 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
L350594 +++$+++ u1842 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JIMMY THE DEMON +++$+++ Check one-two. Check one-two.
L350591 +++$+++ u1842 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JIMMY THE DEMON +++$+++ Now he's got no ears! You happy, Nicky? Your father's got no ears!
L350590 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ I got no ears! I can't hear!
L350099 +++$+++ u1842 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JIMMY THE DEMON +++$+++ Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a pineapple up Hitler's ass at four o'clock.
L350098 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ No, no, that's not what I said. He can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go.
L350097 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Yes, Jimmy.
L350096 +++$+++ u1842 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JIMMY THE DEMON +++$+++ Knock, knock.
L350859 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I will, Dad. But in the words of Motley Crue, this will always be my... home sweet home...
L350858 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Listen, I got down low. Your mom's got up high. You take care of the middle.
L350854 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Nicky, I let my butterflies die once upon a time and it's never stopped hurting.  That's right, you heard me, Holly. I'm still in love with you.
L350853 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
L350852 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
L350851 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad.
L350850 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ You came through, Nicky.
L350593 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ I can't hear you, Nicky. I can't hear anything!
L350592 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Uh, I'll do my best, Dad. Do you have any advice at all for me?
L350589 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ What are you gonna do? Look at me, Nicky! I got no legs, I got no hips, I got one ear...
L350588 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Dad, Adrian's got the whole city after me. He's always a step ahead. What am I gonna do?
L350186 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Please, Nicky, get back up there.  Try to hurry.
L350185 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.
L350184 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ That's a train, son. Don't stand in front of them.
L350180 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Son, just do your best.
L350179 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ No. This can't be happening.
L350175 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Are you telling me I have to go to Earth and kill my brothers?
L350174 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Nicky, the worst thing that could happen on Earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here.
L350168 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ I'm too weak. The process has already begun.
L350167 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ So go get 'em, Dad!
L350166 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ To do that Cassius and Adrian have to come back through the other way.
L350155 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ I'm gonna die, Nicky. If the gates are broken, no new souls can get in, which means I'll start to deteriorate into nothing.
L350154 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ How bad?
L350153 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ This is bad, Nicky.
L350146 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ And I also happen to be a Jets fan.
L350145 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You're a good devil, Dad.
L350137 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ I was just playing with you.
L350136 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Metallica, Dad. Come on.
L350135 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
L350134 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester.
L350133 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?
L350132 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Definitely.
L350131 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Now that was an experience. "You are only coming through in waves." That line blows my mind every time.
L350106 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ The important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil. And I don't think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet. You need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time.
L350105 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I mean... tough break.
L350102 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Such a sweet boy. But after much thought and careful consideration, I've decided that the ruler for the next ten thousand years is going to have to be... me.
L350101 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
L350100 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ This was a very difficult decision, because I have three wonderful sons. I mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless. And Cassius, so strong, so tough. And Nicky, so... so...
L350093 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Okay, kid, we'll listen to it later.
L350092 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape. I really think it's a masterpiece.
L350091 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Now everybody sit down.
L350088 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?
L350087 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Nothing, Dad. Just re-arranging the furniture.
L350260 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Beast.
L350259 +++$+++ u1841 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ GATEKEEPER +++$+++ Bus?
L350215 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You got it.
L350214 +++$+++ u1841 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ GATEKEEPER +++$+++ You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
L350213 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
L350212 +++$+++ u1841 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ GATEKEEPER +++$+++ Thanks.
L350211 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ That's a pretty brassiere.
L350210 +++$+++ u1841 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ GATEKEEPER +++$+++ Hey.
L350152 +++$+++ u1841 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ GATEKEEPER +++$+++ That's what I'm thinkin'...
L350151 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Coulda been much worse.
L350150 +++$+++ u1841 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ GATEKEEPER +++$+++ I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right?
L350355 +++$+++ u1845 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ LUCIFER +++$+++ I can't enjoy anything. I go fishing. I catch nothing. I go to orgies, I catch everything...
L350354 +++$+++ u1841 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ GATEKEEPER +++$+++ That's nice, Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
L350353 +++$+++ u1845 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ LUCIFER +++$+++ Boogerland!
L350352 +++$+++ u1841 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ GATEKEEPER +++$+++ What was it called, sir.
L350351 +++$+++ u1845 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ LUCIFER +++$+++ Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
L350350 +++$+++ u1841 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ GATEKEEPER +++$+++ It's Stanley, sir.
L350349 +++$+++ u1845 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ LUCIFER +++$+++ You know what was in Hell when I came down here, Cassius?
L350347 +++$+++ u1845 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ LUCIFER +++$+++ I started slow, though. For years, I was just giving people hot foots. Actually, you can give all the credit for Hell to my first wife; she was the inspiration. She was an ugly one, too. One day, she asked me if I wanted super sex. I said I'll take the soup.
L350346 +++$+++ u1841 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ GATEKEEPER +++$+++ I know, your wickedness.
L350345 +++$+++ u1845 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ LUCIFER +++$+++ You know, I was the one who created Hell.
L350183 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal.
L350182 +++$+++ u1842 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JIMMY THE DEMON +++$+++ You were gone ten seconds. What happened?
L350173 +++$+++ u1842 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JIMMY THE DEMON +++$+++ You're the spawn of Satan. You got it in you.
L350172 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I've never been to Earth. I've never even slept over at some other dude's house!
L350171 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You're not saying it's up to me?
L350170 +++$+++ u1842 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JIMMY THE DEMON +++$+++ I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
L350169 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ So go get 'em, Jimmy!
L350165 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas?
L350164 +++$+++ u1842 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JIMMY THE DEMON +++$+++ Nothing's getting through that. The fire is solid as a rock.
L350065 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Okay, but Jimmy, when the house is rockin', don't forget the knockin'!
L350064 +++$+++ u1842 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JIMMY THE DEMON +++$+++ Your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.
L350063 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Hey...
L350795 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Of course you do, Tommy Tune.
L350794 +++$+++ u1851 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ His name is Andrew. I know that guy.
L350484 +++$+++ u1851 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Oh, would you grow up.
L350483 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Easy, Liberace.
L350478 +++$+++ u1851 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ No.
L350477 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ By she, do you mean he?
L350476 +++$+++ u1851 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ I was in love one time but she said I wasn't financially reliable enough. And she needed that.
L350464 +++$+++ u1851 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.
L350463 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ No wonder your uncle's so weird...
L350757 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get us out of this?
L350756 +++$+++ u1847 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ This don't look good.
L350631 +++$+++ u1847 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Peppermint... alright.
L350630 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Schnapps...
L350600 +++$+++ u1847 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ We know where to find Nicky.
L350599 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Looking for the chief.
L350598 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Little nervous. Wanna puke.
L350597 +++$+++ u1847 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You sure you're down with this?
L350490 +++$+++ u1847 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ We're going to see Ozzy play at the Meadowlands, right now. Wanna come, Nicky?
L350489 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ That's a big pass, Elton John.
L350428 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Six, six, six, pick up sticks.
L350427 +++$+++ u1847 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Look who's back from the dead.
L350281 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ The Dark Prince is here.
L350280 +++$+++ u1847 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Did you check out the dragon mouth?
L350274 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Yeah. You do it.
L350273 +++$+++ u1847 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Should we wake him up?
L350272 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Yo, man, I think that devil guy just got ripped off.
L350271 +++$+++ u1847 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Gotta be one of his disciples or something.
L350270 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What's with that guy?
L350269 +++$+++ u1847 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Mr. Sleepyhead must have some major ties to the dark side.
L350268 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ There's our man.
L350267 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ 'Bout time...
L350266 +++$+++ u1847 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Sounds like our devil dance actually worked this time.
L350493 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ See ya, fellas.
L350492 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. Later on.
L350491 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ No thanks. I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.
L350468 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Not again, fellas. It kind of hurts.
L350467 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Come on. One more time.
L350461 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Absolutely nothing. The Blizzard always came straight with his messages. But wrap your minds around this one.
L350460 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What's Ozzy trying to say there?
L350278 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ That way.
L350277 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Which way did he go?
L350397 +++$+++ u1848 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ REGIS +++$+++ I was DeNiro!
L350396 +++$+++ u1844 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ KATHY LEE +++$+++ Yes, great movie...
L350395 +++$+++ u1848 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ REGIS +++$+++ Recently, yes! So I run up behind this guy, and start bashing his brains in with this bat, and it made me feel happy! Did you ever see THE UNTOUCHABLES?
L350394 +++$+++ u1844 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ KATHY LEE +++$+++ You keep a bat under your seat?
L350393 +++$+++ u1848 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ REGIS +++$+++ I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat.
L350392 +++$+++ u1844 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ KATHY LEE +++$+++ You followed him?
L350391 +++$+++ u1848 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ REGIS +++$+++ So I followed him...
L350390 +++$+++ u1844 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ KATHY LEE +++$+++ Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
L350389 +++$+++ u1848 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ REGIS +++$+++ So I was driving to work today, and some bozo in a Cadillac cut me off...
L350842 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I'll just go to Heaven.
L350841 +++$+++ u1847 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You gotta kill yourself.
L350580 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yes. I'll meet you at Grand Central at noon. Okay. Do me. I command you.
L350579 +++$+++ u1847 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Dude. Seriously?
L350578 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Good idea... kill me.
L350570 +++$+++ u1847 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Dude, it's us. Let us in.
L350569 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I'm not Nicky. I'm not home! I don't live here!
L350470 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ All right...
L350469 +++$+++ u1847 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Please. You got to.
L350524 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Oh. Sorry, Andrew. Valerie?
L350523 +++$+++ u1850 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ STUDENT +++$+++ You got the wrong window again, man.
L350506 +++$+++ u1850 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ STUDENT +++$+++ Andrew.
L350505 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Adrian?
L350504 +++$+++ u1850 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ STUDENT +++$+++ I don't need luck. I'm good.
L350503 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
L350502 +++$+++ u1850 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ STUDENT +++$+++ Valerie Doran? Two floors up, one window over.
L350501 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.
L350500 +++$+++ u1850 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ STUDENT +++$+++ It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific." Makes me feel like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I'm going for. Wanna come in?
L350499 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You smell like coconuts.
L350498 +++$+++ u1850 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ STUDENT +++$+++ Hello.
L350848 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I love you.
L350847 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ I love you.
L350846 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Do me.
L350831 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ From my dad's side of the family.
L350830 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that?
L350828 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ That was Cassius!
L350827 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ Nicky!
L350659 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I have to, Valerie.
L350658 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ Don't do it.
L350548 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ "Mister Crowley, what's inside of your head..."
L350547 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live until he was dead.  Please tell me you like metal.
L350546 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ East Rutherford.
L350545 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ We're going to Jersey?
L350544 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Next time. Tonight, I want to share the most beautiful thing I could possibly imagine.
L350543 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ Can we go fly over Central Park?
L350537 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ Okay, I do. Get back up here.
L350536 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You gotta believe me. You gotta believe in the butterflies.
L350533 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ ...to decompose. And I love my Dad very much. So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and... well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you.
L350532 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ ..."The Devil?"...
L350531 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Well, that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. Which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my dad...
L350530 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ Yes...
L350529 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell?
L350528 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ What do you mean, "possessed?"
L350527 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ That wasn't me. I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian. He's the one who call you a gross pig.
L350526 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ Look, just because you're floating doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you giving me the finger.
L350521 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now? Because I am.
L350520 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
L350519 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ Why would you be floating?
L350518 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I think I'm floating.

L350514 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Valerie?
L350511 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I'm not sure, but it didn't involve getting blinded with poison.
L350510 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ What were you thinking coming here?
L350508 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ Nicky? Oh my God. Stay right there.

L350368 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Your juicy, heart-shaped ass.
L350367 +++$+++ u1852 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ VALERIE +++$+++ What?
