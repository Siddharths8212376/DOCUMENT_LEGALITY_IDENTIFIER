L143403 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ In other words.
L143402 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ In other words, God works in mysterious ways...
L143401 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ Maybe what you experienced can't be reduced to images on a videotape. Maybe they still plan to grant your request, only in their own way, in their own time... Or maybe it's just like you said:  ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
L143400 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ ... but it is a good question, and I suppose I'll always wonder about the answer:  Why would they send me back without proof?
L143362 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ Ellie... if you go out there like this -- if you admit to even the possibility that what you experienced didn't actually happen -- I'm afraid they really will crucify you.  Please.  For your own sake, for the sake of the world... tell them what you know to be the truth.  Tell them it really happened.
L143361 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I want to, Palmer -- more than anything.  But it has to be real. It has to be true.
L143360 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ Have you seen what's happening out there?  The terror, the despair? The world is on fire, Ellie.  People need something they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them!
L143359 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ But --
L143358 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ Ellie, the only one holding you to that standard is you!  The people want to hear your story, they need to hear it!
L143357 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ It's not enough, don't you understand?  I know it happened -- but by every standard of science, by every standard I've lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point.  It may be true but it doesn't matter because I can't prove it's real.
L143356 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ Ellie, you're the proof.  You tell them your story.  Ultimately they'll have no choice but to believe you.
L143355 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I don't have any proof, Palmer.
L143354 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ It also makes God enormous.  I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away.  As it will everyone else's.
L143353 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ You're sure you want to?  In the universe I saw we're not exactly the stars of the show.  What happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small.
L143352 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ I do.
L143351 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ They don't believe me.
L143350 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ I'm not sure it's come to that.
L143349 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ So.  I'm assuming they sent you here to administer last rites?
L143348 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Pretty ironic, huh?  I had to go all the way to the center of the galaxy... Just to find you.
L143347 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ It was quite a page turner.
L143346 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I'm assuming you read my deposition.
L143345 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ Hi.
L143344 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Hi.
L143196 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ And yet that's always how I seem to end up, isn't it?  If you really do love me, Palmer, you'll leave.  Now.  Please.
L143195 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.
L143194 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I can't hear this now --
L143193 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ Do you really think your life is meaningless, Eleanor?  Is that why you're so quick to risk it -- because if your life means nothing then you have nothing to lose?
L143192 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ -- I don't know --
L143191 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ And then what?  Then you'll be safe?
L143190 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Don't you understand?  I just have to hold it together -- just until tomorrow --
L143189 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ I'm in love with you, Ellie.
L143188 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Please --
L143187 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ What are my other options?  In fifty years?  Never?
L143186 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now --
L143185 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ What are you so afraid of?
L143184 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I can't do this --
L143183 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ What?
L143182 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I'm sorry -- I can't --
L143181 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ Ellie, what is it?
L143180 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ What is it?
L143179 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L143178 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ What...?
L143177 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ Maybe that's okay.
L143176 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I do seem to be... Maybe because I'm just a little bit terrified about tomorrow.
L143175 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ You're trembling.
L143174 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Thank you.
L143173 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ During the crusades -- pilgrims who made the journey to the holy land brought back a palm frond to show they'd actually been there.  I thought it sort of made sense that Earth is now your holy land, so...
L143172 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ Oh.  I brought you something.
L143171 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ The final countdown.
L143170 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ So.  The final countdown.
L143169 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I remember.  You were indelicate, indiscreet and entirely less than tactful... Sound like anyone you know?
L143168 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ Ellie... the last time we spoke... I said some things...
L143103 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ What if their answer is, 'Oh, that's easy.  A thousand years ago our world was in terrible shape, our population out of control, violent crime, no food... so we called a general council and decided to eliminate the anit-social.  The weak.  The sick.  The unwanted.  And ever since we've been doing great.'
L143102 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ How do you mean?
L143101 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ An excellent question, Doctor.  But what if we don't like the answer?
L143100 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ ... Another question I would ask would be a very simple one.  How did you do it?  How did you evolve as far as you have and not destroy yourselves?
L143098 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ It's late.  We should go back.
L143097 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ Ellie --
L143095 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ What are you so afraid of, Ellie?
L143094 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ It's getting late...
L143093 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ And yet you're willing to die for this cause, the one thing that's given your life a sense of purpose. Don't you see the contradiction here -- ?
L143092 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I don't know.  But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility.
L143091 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ Do you really believe your life is meaningless?
L143090 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Maybe the reason people are having trouble finding meaning isn't because science has obscured it... maybe it's just revealed it isn't there.
L143089 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ I don't follow.
L143088 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Did you ever stop to think that maybe that isn't science's fault, but meaning's?
L143087 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ I don't consider you the enemy, Ellie.  I'm not 'out to get' technology.  I only ask the question:  Does it have to have all the answers?  I look out there and I see so much emptiness... People are so starved for meaning, and it's something they just don't seem to be getting from science.
L143086 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I thought it was well-written. Heart-felt.  And a little bit naive... But that's just the enemy's perspective.
L143085 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ I won't deny I was ambitious.  When I had my... experience... I wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible.  I'm the first to admit that process included making some compromises.  You didn't answer my question.
L143084 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I'm more interested in the story behind the story... How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the President.
L143083 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ What'd you think?
L143082 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Losing Faith:  The Search For Meaning In the Age of Reason. Catchy.
L143081 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ Really.
L143080 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I read your book.
L143079 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ It's what my whole life's been... aimed at; the only thing that's given it a sense of purpose.
L143078 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ You're willing to die for this.
L143077 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ If you came back.  If you survived at all.  Which it's pretty certain you wouldn't.
L143076 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ And everybody you care about would be dead and buried.
L143075 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Something like that.
L143074 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ If you came back... you'd only be four years older -- but over 50 years would have passed on Earth.
L143073 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ If you came back.
L143072 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ Relativity.  Explain this to me one more time... even if you traveled near the speed of light, when you came back --
L143071 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ In other words.
L143070 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ In other words, God is one hell of an engineer.
L143069 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ It's too... elegant.  The degree of economy is extraordinary; it's really the next logical step... Even on Earth technology has always aspired to a condition of nature. D.N.A. outclasses any computer we can come up with; the human body is the most exquisitely designed machine imaginable.
L143068 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ Why?
L143067 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I don't think so.
L143066 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ Maybe you're creating a monster.
L143065 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Not exactly.  It has organic qualities, but we don't really understand how they're integrated with the mechanical systems.
L143064 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ Some of my best friends are scientists.  They're saying the machine is alive.
L143063 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors.
L143062 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ Some of my best friends are scientists.
L143061 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ So.  Is this kosher fraternizing with the enemy like this?
L142968 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ Prove it.
L142967 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Yes.  Very much.
L142966 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ Did you love him?
L142965 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I never knew my mother.  My father died when I was nine.
L142964 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ Do you love your parents?
L142963 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ You may not believe this... but there's a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your God.  To believe that we're all here for a purpose, that all this... means something.  But it's because that part of me wants it so badly that I'm so stubborn about making sure it isn't just self-delusion. Of course I want to know God if there is one... but it has to be real.  Unless I have proof how can I be sure?
L142962 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ Look, I'm a reasonable person, and reasonably intelligent.  But this experience went beyond both.  For the first time I had to consider the possibility that intellect, as wonderful as it is, is not the only way of comprehending the universe. That it was too small and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with.
L142961 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ And there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it?
L142960 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ I had... an experience.  Of belonging.  Of unconditional love. And for the first time in my life I wasn't terrified, and I wasn't alone.
L142959 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Can you try?
L142958 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ ... It's an old story.  I grew up in South Boston, more or less on the streets.  By the time I was thirteen I'd tried my first hit of heroin, by fifteen I'd stopped using but I was dealing full-time.  By the time I was nineteen I decided I didn't want to live any more, at least not in a world like that.  One day I got on a bus; I got as far as Ohio before my money ran out, and after that I just kept walking.  Didn't eat, didn't sleep... just walked.  I ended up collapsing in a wheat field.  There was a storm... I woke up...  And that's about as far as words'll go.
L142957 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ Now you know.
L142956 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ That's not doubt.  That's four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct.  I always wondered what you religious types did with your free time.
L142955 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ Only a tiny bit.  Even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt.
L142954 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I flinched.
L142951 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ So if I let the pendulum go, when it swings back you wouldn't flinch.
L142950 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ And mind, yes.  What are you --
L142949 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ And you believe this law with all your heart and soul.
L142948 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ That's not faith, it's physics.  The second law of thermodynamics.
L142947 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ Your 'faith' tells you that the distance a pendulum swings from the vertical can never get bigger, only smaller.
L142943 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Very smooth.  It's Palmer, right? Where I came from a palmer was a person who cheated at cards.  Really though... the Bible describes a God who watches over one tiny world a few thousand years old.  I look out there and see a universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars... I mean burn me for a heretic, but your God seems awfully small.
L142942 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ 'My father's house has many mansions.'
L142941 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Well it's been a while, but I don't recall the Bible saying too much about alien civilizations.
L142940 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ How do you mean?
L142939 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ What about you?  Doesn't all of this shake your faith at all?
L142938 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ Spoken like a true believer.
L142937 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
L142936 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
L142935 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I'd say logic more than faith.  The odds were on my side.
L142934 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ ... What I'm curious about are the wilderness years.  You're out there all alone, no money, mocked by the skeptics.  It must have taken tremendous faith.
L142931 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ Make that two.
L142930 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Champagne please.
L142912 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ I'd have to say I don't know enough to have one yet.  For the moment I don't believe the two approaches have to be mutually exclusive.
L142911 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ And where exactly does that put your position...?
L142910 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ I agree with Mr. Rank that there are unavoidable religious implications here -- but I don't think it justifies taking an alarmist position.  Dr. Arroway is right -- their chosen means of communication was a scientific one, and a scientific approach is probably appropriate, at least until the theological dimensions of the problem become more apparent.
L143109 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ For managing the truth.  But the truth won't be managed, sir.  It stops being the truth the moment you try.
L143108 +++$+++ u4611 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PROJECT OFFICIAL +++$+++ Nobody is proposing we censor the truth here, Doctor.  We're simply talking about putting a mechanism in place --
L143107 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I guess I'd say I trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of, thanks for the advice, but no thanks.  But to dilute or censor the truth, for whatever reason --
L143106 +++$+++ u4611 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PROJECT OFFICIAL +++$+++ How would you propose we handle it, Doctor?
L143105 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ You kill me, you really do.  The first truly global, a-political event in history and you can't wait to spin it.
L143050 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Y'know what?  Fine.  I guess if we want them to know the truth about who we are there's no quicker way to show them.
L143049 +++$+++ u4611 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PROJECT OFFICIAL +++$+++ Dr. Arroway, you are entitled to your opinion.  But we feel quite strongly that it would by both irresponsible and naive to send a human being into a completely unknown, completely uncontrollable situation absolutely defenseless.
L143048 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Call it xenophobic paranoia.  Don't you see the absolute absurdity of this?  This isn't about them, it's about us -- our violence, our fear and mistrust --
L143047 +++$+++ u4611 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PROJECT OFFICIAL +++$+++ It's designed purely as a defensive device.  Call it a reasonable precaution.
L143046 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile.
L143045 +++$+++ u4611 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PROJECT OFFICIAL +++$+++ You have a question, Dr. Arroway?
L143342 +++$+++ u4610 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PRESIDENT LASKER +++$+++ Have your department make a full report.
L143341 +++$+++ u4607 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ KITZ +++$+++ I don't know.  Maybe we built the damn thing wrong.  Maybe it was all a hoax...  The safest thing would probably be to do a Chernobyl; encase it in concrete.
L143340 +++$+++ u4610 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PRESIDENT LASKER +++$+++ Recommendations?
L143339 +++$+++ u4607 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ KITZ +++$+++ ... as have all attempts at internal analysis.  We've tried sonargrams, magnetic resonance, gamma rays; it's completely impenetrable.
L142836 +++$+++ u4610 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PRESIDENT LASKER +++$+++ That's it, Mike.  Last time I checked, I was still running the country.  Although it seems that for the moment, Dr. Arroway is running the planet.
L142835 +++$+++ u4607 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ KITZ +++$+++ But --
L142834 +++$+++ u4610 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PRESIDENT LASKER +++$+++ Well.  That would seem to decide it. Like it or not, for the moment, anyway, it looks like we're all in this together.
L142816 +++$+++ u4607 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ KITZ +++$+++ What is it?
L142815 +++$+++ u4610 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PRESIDENT LASKER +++$+++ Oh my God...
L143543 +++$+++ u4617 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ BOSS PAUL +++$+++ Cut that backsass!
L143542 +++$+++ u4614 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ ALIBI +++$+++ But I made this arrangement --
L143541 +++$+++ u4617 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ BOSS PAUL +++$+++ Git movin', I said.
L143540 +++$+++ u4614 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ ALIBI +++$+++ I don't think you understand. We made a deal ---
L143539 +++$+++ u4617 +++$+++ m305 +++$+++ BOSS PAUL +++$+++ Git your shovel and git to work.
