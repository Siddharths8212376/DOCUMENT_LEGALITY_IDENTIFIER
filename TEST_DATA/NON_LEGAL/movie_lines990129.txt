L388049 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ There's nearly 2 million in London.
L388048 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Five, six-hundred thousand.
L388047 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ What's the population of Seville any idea?
L387988 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ That's because I'm on my back.
L387987 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Damn, you're beautiful.
L387986 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Ask a question, you get an answer!..
L387985 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Of what?
L387984 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Spoken like a spook..you ever afraid?
L387983 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ So do I.  Sort of.
L387982 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Well, then, what I am I doing here?  I assume I'm meant to be some sort of thief-to catch-a-thief..
L387981 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I don't know that they 'pinched' it. Don't even know that they're blokes.
L387980 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..
L387979 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ So where did I got right?
L387978 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ That they're lying.
L387977 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Which is?
L387976 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ That's not the point.  In the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you don't.
L387975 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Not revealing information doesn't necessarily make someone a liar.
L387974 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth.  He'd lie about his favorite color.  But then I reckon it's an occupational hazard.  All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.
L387973 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ They've got a book for everything.
L387972 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ They've got a book for this?
L387971 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Oh.  Well..this isn't exactly by the book.
L387970 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ When they've got your recruiting technique?  Not a thing.
L387968 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Who wants to be decent?..
L387967 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Care to wait a decent interval?
L387966 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Awfully short notice..
L387964 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Well, Ethan Hunt, what is it you want to talk to me about?
L387963 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Ethan Hunt.
L387962 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ What's you name?
L387955 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Oh bloody hell.  You're a spy.
L387954 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority.  I can make them go away.
L387953 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Your help?  What are you talking about?
L387952 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I need your help and I thin you can use mine.
L387951 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Listen to what?
L387950 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Pull over and listen to me, will you? Just listen..
L387948 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Where did you get this number?  I don't even have it!
L387947 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Hi.  Would you mind slowing down?
L387946 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Hola..
L387943 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Not really.  I triggered the alarm..
L387942 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ You're apologizing for me?  Quite the gentleman..
L387941 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ You didn't do that badly.
L387940 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Sounds smashing.  I'm in.  Muchacho, mi carro, por favor!  Now be serious.  You couldn't possibly want me off tonight's performance..
L387939 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Working under adverse conditions.  Highly adverse conditions.
L387938 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ May I say something, no offence?  You look like a gigolo, you sound like a thief, you act like a cop - what the bloody hell do you have in mind?
L387937 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Wanted to see how good you were. I'm hoping we might work together.
L387936 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it?
L387935 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ At least you walked.
L387934 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ I'm missing something here, aside from a 500,000 pound necklace.  Even after I botched the job, I could've walked out of there with the bloody thing.
L387931 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Well, Senor de l'Arena, there's no reason to disrupt your party any longer.  we have some further concerns about the disposition of your security guards, which you'll receive in our written report by fax in the morning, hard copy to follow.  Shall we?
L387930 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Indeed.
L387929 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Under the circumstances I think we would recommend re-setting the senors to respond to a lighter load.  How do you feel about forty kilos, Miss Hall?
L387922 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Do what?
L387921 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I wouldn't do that.
L387920 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ - right..
L387919 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Hey, you put me here.  I just do what I'm told.
L387918 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ - this is very disconerting..
L387917 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ - torque wrench.
L387916 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Where's the bloody -
L387915 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Far right.
L387914 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ - right..where is it?
L387910 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Oh, either way works for me.
L387909 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Would you mind if I'm on top?
L387907 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ I see.  You're not just another pretty face..
L387906 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?
L387905 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L387901 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Uh-huh?
L387900 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L387899 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ What if I pay the rent?
L387898 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Look, it's either you or the rent and I don't mind telling you it's not an easy choice.
L387897 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ There's not enough time in the world for any of it to be bad.
L387896 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ Not tonight.  Bad timing.  Sorry -
L387895 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.
L387894 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ No.  Just as if I'd like to.
L387893 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ No.  You just looked as if you did.
L387892 +++$+++ u6626 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NYAH +++$+++ No.  Should I?
L387891 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Do you know me?
L388579 +++$+++ u6628 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ SWANBECK +++$+++ Oh, you don't have to do that. Wouldn't be a vacation if you did.
L388578 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Not sure.  Some sort of vacation.  I'll let you know where I'm going.
L388577 +++$+++ u6628 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ SWANBECK +++$+++ Well, Hunt, what are your plans?
L388576 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I don't.  No exactly.
L388575 +++$+++ u6628 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ SWANBECK +++$+++ Where is she now, by the way?  Do you know?
L388574 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I do.
L388573 +++$+++ u6628 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ SWANBECK +++$+++ In this case, it wasn't a bad idea.  In face, it was a pretty damn good idea. Just don't make a habit of it.  And, as for Ms. Hall, in light of her efforts, her criminal records will certainly be expunged.  I'm assuming you approve.
L388572 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ No, I don't.  But in this case -
L388570 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ By fire.  That's the best way, really.
L388569 +++$+++ u6628 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ SWANBECK +++$+++ But you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the Chimera virus.  I'd be very interested to know how, after you'd managed its recovery intact, it subsequently got destroyed.
L388568 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Well, Bellerophon, it turns out, was only really effective against Chimera.
L388567 +++$+++ u6628 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ SWANBECK +++$+++ And that appears to have been destroyed. It also contained the anti-virus, Bellerophon.
L388566 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Yes.
L388565 +++$+++ u6628 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ SWANBECK +++$+++ And the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from Ambrose.
L388564 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Yes, I gathered as much.
L388563 +++$+++ u6628 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ SWANBECK +++$+++ Of course it was.  Anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do, is bound to get a little flak here and there.  You try flogging the stories on CNN I've had to come up with about what's been going on around here the last few days.  At any rate, it's been most instructive -- what they'll swallow, or what they'll broadcast with a straight face.  Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus.  Not even antibodies.
L388562 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was a compliment.
L388561 +++$+++ u6628 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ SWANBECK +++$+++ Why not?  You've done just about everything else on this operation.
L388560 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.
L388559 +++$+++ u6628 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ SWANBECK +++$+++ Sorry, Ethan.  I don't quite know where to begin.  Any suggestions?
L388462 +++$+++ u6628 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ SWANBECK +++$+++ No.  I can't afford to be curious.  And neither can you, Hunt..
L388461 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Aren't you even curious?  About why she did it?
L388460 +++$+++ u6628 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ SWANBECK +++$+++ Something else?
L388459 +++$+++ u6628 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ SWANBECK +++$+++ Brave girl.  If you can get hold of Bellerophon with the time limit, you may spare her the ultimate sacrifice.  But in either case you've got less than nine hours to kill her or cure her.  After that it's out of our hands and a matter of worldwide material law.  And Hunt.  However you obtain it, we want you to preserve a sample of Chimera.  Bring it back alive.
L388458 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ She sacrificed herself..
L388457 +++$+++ u6628 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ SWANBECK +++$+++ - good.  Then if you manage to get hold of Ambrose, and obtain what he's got, you've got -  - 8 hours 57 minutes and twenty-three seconds to destroy the largest remaining source of Chimera on earth.
L388455 +++$+++ u6628 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ SWANBECK +++$+++ Yes, I believe that's right.  Now my understanding is that 20 hours after exposure, the victim becomes infectious. Highly infectious.
L388454 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ You mean that leaves Miss Hall.
L388453 +++$+++ u6628 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ SWANBECK +++$+++ But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.
L388452 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Yes, I believe that's right.
L388451 +++$+++ u6628 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ SWANBECK +++$+++ Do you?  Even assuming you're able to prevent Ambrose selling Chimera, you've now got an additional problem.  You destroyed all of Chimera at Biocyte.  If Ambrose is going to sell Chimera now, he'll have to do it by taking a pint or so of Miss Hall's blood to market.
L388450 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ We think we've got our finger on the buyer.
L388449 +++$+++ u6628 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ SWANBECK +++$+++ We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable.  No deposits, no withdrawals.  Therefore no suspects.
L388448 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Not yet.  We did manage to pull any sensitive equipment and material out of our safehouse wreckage.
L388044 +++$+++ u6628 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ SWANBECK +++$+++ Well it's not mission <i>difficult,</i> Hunt. It's mission <i>impossible.</i>  Difficult should be a walk in the park for you.  If you can think of a quicker way to get to Ambrose, you're welcome to try.  Oh, by the way, you might want to take a look at these..if you have any further qualms about getting her to do the job.
L388043 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Very.
L388042 +++$+++ u6628 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ SWANBECK +++$+++ You mean it'll be difficult.
L388041 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I don't think I can get her to do it.
L388040 +++$+++ u6628 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ SWANBECK +++$+++ Go to bed with a man and lie to him? She's a woman.  She's got all the training she needs.
L388039 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ She's got no training for this kind of thing.
L388038 +++$+++ u6628 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ SWANBECK +++$+++ Well, then I mislead you.  Or you made the wrong assumption.  Either way we're asking her to resume a prior relationship, not do anything she hasn't already done.
L388037 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ You made it sound as if I was recruiting her for her skills as a thief.
L388036 +++$+++ u6628 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ SWANBECK +++$+++ Then makes sure she continues to see him. Gets him confide in her and report to you.
L388035 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ And then what?
L388034 +++$+++ u6628 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ SWANBECK +++$+++ Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously.  She walked away and he's wanting her back ever since.  We believe she's our surest and quickest way of location him.
L388033 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Excuse me?
L388032 +++$+++ u6628 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ SWANBECK +++$+++ - is where Miss Hall comes in.
L388031 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ If that's what you're thinking Ambrose would have set up a bidding situation with any number of buyers before he got on the plane.  Locating him in time to stop something like that -
L388030 +++$+++ u6628 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ SWANBECK +++$+++ Well you know Nekhorvich's history. You're the one who got him out of the Soviet Union was it still in bio- weapon business.
L388029 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ 'Terrorists?'
L388028 +++$+++ u6628 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ SWANBECK +++$+++ - right.  In fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts.
L388027 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ In order to do that, I've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it.
L388026 +++$+++ u6628 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ SWANBECK +++$+++ In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.
L388025 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Right now only Ambrose knows that.
L388024 +++$+++ u6628 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ SWANBECK +++$+++ The question is why?  What was this Chimera Nekhorvich was carrying?
L388023 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Sean feels he hasn't done the job unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground.
L388022 +++$+++ u6628 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ SWANBECK +++$+++ Enough to kill Nekhorvich and two hundred innocent passengers?
L388021 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Whatever Nekhorvich was carrying Sean wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact that he took it.
L388020 +++$+++ u6628 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ SWANBECK +++$+++ Then you do think it was Ambrose.
L388019 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ So there's one thing we know Ambrose doesn't.
L388017 +++$+++ u6628 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ SWANBECK +++$+++ Not necessarily.
L388016 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ You know we had reservations about each other.  Isn't it a little late in the day to be asking me that?
L388015 +++$+++ u6628 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ SWANBECK +++$+++ What did you think of him?
L388014 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Twice.
L388013 +++$+++ u6628 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ SWANBECK +++$+++ When I couldn't find you, I had to replace you.  Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice. He double you, what?  Two, three times?
L388012 +++$+++ u6628 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ SWANBECK +++$+++ You were there.
L388011 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ If he didn't want to go anywhere without me, how did you get him on the flight?
L388010 +++$+++ u6628 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ SWANBECK +++$+++ Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.  So is his colleague, Gradski, but that happened earlier.  We had Nekhorvich on a flight from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies..
L388009 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry.  And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier.  So let's get on with it.  He's still in Sydney?
L388008 +++$+++ u6628 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ SWANBECK +++$+++ Like?
L388007 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ An idea, yeah.
L388000 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ You gotta be kidding.
L387999 +++$+++ u6628 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ SWANBECK +++$+++ 'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'
L387998 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Like what?
L387997 +++$+++ u6628 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ SWANBECK +++$+++ Why did you phrase it like that?
L387996 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.
L387995 +++$+++ u6628 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ SWANBECK +++$+++ Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
L387994 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Sorry I didn't let you know where I was.
L388003 +++$+++ u6625 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NEKHORVICH +++$+++ I'm fine..
L388002 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ ..I'm fine..and you?
L387875 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ You keep calling me Dmitri.  You really shouldn't.
L387874 +++$+++ u6625 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NEKHORVICH +++$+++ ..it seems we have a problem, Dmitri.
L387868 +++$+++ u6625 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NEKHORVICH +++$+++ No.  After you've lived with <i>Chimera</i> for twenty hours, nothing can save you.  Not even...<i>Bellerophon.</i>
L387867 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ ..not in time to save him.
L387866 +++$+++ u6625 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NEKHORVICH +++$+++ Yes, he knew.  Just..
L387865 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ He was quite a man.  Did he know before the end you two had succeeded?
L387864 +++$+++ u6625 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NEKHORVICH +++$+++ Yes, I'm sorry too.. 'You're sorry and I'm sorry..'  - you do know Gradski thought the world of you.
L387863 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Sorry it couldn't be under happier circumstances.
L387862 +++$+++ u6625 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NEKHORVICH +++$+++ I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.
L387861 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ They're ready and waiting.  You'll soon be with old friends.
L387860 +++$+++ u6625 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ NEKHORVICH +++$+++ Well, yes.  I suppose I am a bit anxious.
L387859 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ You keep staring at that watch as if your life depended on it, Doctor..
L388582 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Good job.  And thanks.
L388581 +++$+++ u6623 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ So what did he say?
L388544 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Copy.  She's only got twenty-eight minutes left.  Track ahead and pick her up.
L388543 +++$+++ u6623 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ She's on the North Head Bluff - approaching the cliffs.  One klick away.
L388542 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Luther, say again.
L388472 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Ninety-seven minutes, twenty-seven seconds.
L388471 +++$+++ u6623 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ Ethan, I keep telling you there's not a chance of locating Nyah til I access the satellite and there's not a chance of doing that til I get this thing booted up and running!  How much time does she have left?
L388366 +++$+++ u6623 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ Oh. Uh. Commencing diversion.  Alarm in cosmetics.
L388365 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Luther, I'm looking at security.
L388357 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I'm not waiting 48 hours.  When we're done at Biocyte, if she's not out of Ambrose's, I'm going in and getting her out.
L388356 +++$+++ u6623 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ Thirty-second opening in the roof and a 250-foot drop.
L388349 +++$+++ u6623 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ No garage entrance.  Lobby's protected by five guards on rotating patrol.
L388348 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Now how to get in there.
L388345 +++$+++ u6623 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ All storage and production of Chimera is done here, in this lab on the forty-second floor, the heart of the building.
L388344 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Let's start from the inside out.
L388341 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Nyah still on the property?
L388340 +++$+++ u6623 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ Sorry, that it a Biocyte facility, their storage structure..
L388332 +++$+++ u6623 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ You've got the voice print, I'll get us in..
L388331 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I kill Chimera at Biocyte and he's sitting on a cure without a disease.
L388330 +++$+++ u6623 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ Yeah.  Why else would he come back to Australia?  If he had them both, he could sell them anywhere.
L388329 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Ambrose got Bellerophon from Nekhorvich on the plane, but he didn't get the Chimera virus.
L388291 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I told her to get outta there.
L388290 +++$+++ u6623 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ She must still be on the property.
L388289 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I don't know, but Nekhorvich was not a manic.  Get me a twenty on Nyah.
L388213 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Nyah, Ambrose is heading back.  There's an enveloped inside --
L388212 +++$+++ u6623 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ Left jacket pocket confirmed.
L388211 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Confirm.  Left jacket pocket.
L388210 +++$+++ u6623 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ Roger that.
L388209 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Left jacket pocket?
L388208 +++$+++ u6623 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ Ambrose just pulled the memory card out of the digital camera and put it into an envelope, put it in his inner left jacket pocket...
L388203 +++$+++ u6622 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Yep.
L388202 +++$+++ u6623 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ Nekhorvich's boss?
L388160 +++$+++ u6623 +++$+++ m442 +++$+++ LUTHER +++$+++ Right.  I guess there aren't many flu epidemics in the middle of summer.
