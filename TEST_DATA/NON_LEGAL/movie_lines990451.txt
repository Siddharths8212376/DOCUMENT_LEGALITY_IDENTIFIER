L621953 +++$+++ u8545 +++$+++ m579 +++$+++ WOODY +++$+++ Slink!  Hang on!
L621952 +++$+++ u8544 +++$+++ m579 +++$+++ SLINKY +++$+++ I can't hold on much longer!
L621949 +++$+++ u8545 +++$+++ m579 +++$+++ WOODY +++$+++ Speed up!
L621948 +++$+++ u8544 +++$+++ m579 +++$+++ SLINKY +++$+++ Woody!  Speed up!
L621775 +++$+++ u8544 +++$+++ m579 +++$+++ SLINKY +++$+++ See?  It is Buzz.  Now give back the lights, Potato Head.
L621774 +++$+++ u8545 +++$+++ m579 +++$+++ WOODY +++$+++ Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too.
L621750 +++$+++ u8544 +++$+++ m579 +++$+++ SLINKY +++$+++ I knew you'd come back, Woody!
L621749 +++$+++ u8545 +++$+++ m579 +++$+++ WOODY +++$+++ Boy, am I glad to see you guys!
L621746 +++$+++ u8545 +++$+++ m579 +++$+++ WOODY +++$+++ We're gonna get outta here, Buzz -- Buzz?
L621745 +++$+++ u8544 +++$+++ m579 +++$+++ SLINKY +++$+++ Woody?!
L621349 +++$+++ u8545 +++$+++ m579 +++$+++ WOODY +++$+++ Oh, shut up!  In a couple of days, everything will be just the way it was.  They'll see... they'll see. I'm still Andy's favorite toy.
L621348 +++$+++ u8544 +++$+++ m579 +++$+++ SLINKY +++$+++ Heh, heh, heh!  Golly bob howdy --
L621277 +++$+++ u8545 +++$+++ m579 +++$+++ WOODY +++$+++ Uh-h-h-h...nothing!  Uh, nothing. I'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all.  Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose.  It's just a mistake.
L621276 +++$+++ u8544 +++$+++ m579 +++$+++ SLINKY +++$+++ Woody, what are you doing under the bed?
L621159 +++$+++ u8544 +++$+++ m579 +++$+++ SLINKY +++$+++ Got it.
L621158 +++$+++ u8545 +++$+++ m579 +++$+++ WOODY +++$+++ Just gather everyone up for a staff meeting and be happy!!
L621157 +++$+++ u8545 +++$+++ m579 +++$+++ WOODY +++$+++ Sh-h-h-h-h!!
L621156 +++$+++ u8544 +++$+++ m579 +++$+++ SLINKY +++$+++ Bad news?!
L621155 +++$+++ u8545 +++$+++ m579 +++$+++ WOODY +++$+++ Not now, Slink.  I've got some bad news.
L621154 +++$+++ u8544 +++$+++ m579 +++$+++ SLINKY +++$+++ Oh...well alright, you can be red if you want.
L621153 +++$+++ u8545 +++$+++ m579 +++$+++ WOODY +++$+++ No, Slink --
L621152 +++$+++ u8544 +++$+++ m579 +++$+++ SLINKY +++$+++ I'm red this time.
L621151 +++$+++ u8544 +++$+++ m579 +++$+++ SLINKY +++$+++ Right here, Woody!
L621150 +++$+++ u8545 +++$+++ m579 +++$+++ WOODY +++$+++ Hey, Slinky?
L622271 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Nothing is left but us.
L622270 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Everything is gone, now.
L622269 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ So had I.
L622268 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ But then I had a brother and a sister left.
L622267 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ So did I.
L622266 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ I already lost everything once.
L622254 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ All the time.
L622253 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ How long has -
L622252 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ What difference does <i>that</i> make?
L622251 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Surely she is older?
L622250 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Did you now.
L622249 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ I thought she was fondest of you, because you were the youngest.
L622246 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Do you think we should take her up to bed?
L622245 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ It was only a mouthful!
L622244 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.
L622243 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ H'm?
L622242 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Somebody couldn't wait until dark.
L622234 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ I know for a fact he didn't take Jonathon. Jonathon went off by himself.
L622233 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Reprieve.
L622228 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ In my pocket.
L622227 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Finn ...
L622226 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ I've got a present for you...
L622225 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Stop it!
L622224 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Almighty Jove in the shape of a swan.
L622223 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ The swan was so ridiculous. All the same, it did scare me.
L622222 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Can you move over a wee bit?
L622221 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.
L622220 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ He'll be looking for another apprentice.
L622219 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ He'll murder you when he finds out.
L622217 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ You did what?
L622216 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ I finished it off.
L622215 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ You <i>are</i> cold. Where have you been?
L622214 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ I'm cold.
L622213 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Finn -
L622212 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Would you mind holding me in your arms for a little while?
L622211 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Ah, come on now!
L622210 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Well ... yes. All right. But -
L622209 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Can I come into bed with you for a little while, I feel terrible.
L622207 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Let me in.
L622206 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Who's there?
L622191 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Living with him put years on me.
L622190 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ You're not so old yourself!
L622189 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ You're only a young thing.
L622188 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Do what?  Oh, I see.
L622187 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ I won't do it because he wants me to do it, even if I want to do it.
L622186 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ What did I do wrong?
L622185 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Go away.
L622184 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Finn, there's a splinter in your left foot.  If you don't let me take the splinter out, it will fester.
L622178 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Ah, you should see the swan! His masterpiece. Now, walk along the beach and stoop to pick up the shell.
L622177 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Is that all?
L622176 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ That's your beach. This is the story. Leda walks by the shore, gathering shells.  Night comes on. She hears the beating of great wings and sees the approach of the swan. She runs away but it bears down and casts her to the ground. Curtain.
L622133 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Get away from me...
L622132 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ What was <i>that</i> in aid of?
L622111 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ What about school?
L622110 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ She'll have to learn.
L622109 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ She's not accustomed to being ignored.
L622098 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ I can't go home because there's no home left.
L622097 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Home is where the heart is.
L622096 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ I want to go home.
L622095 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ I didn't know about the puppets. It's a lot to take in, all at once.
L622094 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Don't fret. It's only his dream. Dreams aren't catching, not like measles.
L622086 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Didn't you know he made things?
L622085 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside.
L622084 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ He made that. In his off hours.
L622083 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ She got away.
L622082 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Mummy was scared of him, I think. He went to her wedding but he was <i>furious</i>, you can see it in the photograph.
L622081 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ He can take out his smile and keep it on a shelf, but, his bite is worse than his bark, isn't that so, old fellow?
L622080 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ I saw his teeth in the bathroom.
L622077 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Speak when you're spoken to. He likes his women quiet.
L622076 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Is there anything else I should know about him?
L622075 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Slip up and change into a skirt, else he'll create something terrible. Don't you want to make a good impression on your first day?
L622074 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ A sin against <i>what?</i>
L622073 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ He can't abide a woman in trousers. He says a woman in trousers is a sin against nature.
L622071 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ I carried you up to your bed.
L622070 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ I did like the music.
L622069 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Curled up on the landing like love locked out!
L622064 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ You're spoiling your pretty looks. Come here.
L622063 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ I like plaits.
L622062 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Do you know you've lovely hair, even if you torment it in those braids.
L622061 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ He's a pyjama case, really.
L622060 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ Excuse me.
L622059 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ I can manage.
L622057 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ There's not.
L622056 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ There's no mirror.
L622055 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ You'll put your clothes here.
L622042 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ There's no law, as I know of, to prevent it.
L622041 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ But you're Irish!
L622040 +++$+++ u8546 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ FINN +++$+++ You'll need to know who we are, we're the brothers of his wife, which makes us in an unsanctified kind of way, your uncles. Me name is Finn, me brother is called Francie -
L622023 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ In the play. She was married, by my age. And Mummy. Mummy wasn't much older than me when she got married. Well, not <i>that</i> much older.
L622022 +++$+++ u8547 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ JONATHON +++$+++ Juliet who?
L622021 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ I'm not too young. Juliet was my age.
L622020 +++$+++ u8547 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ JONATHON +++$+++ We're too young.
L622019 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ They're going to fly everywhere. Mean things. They should have taken us.
L622015 +++$+++ u8547 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ JONATHON +++$+++ Storms?
L622014 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ 'Have ploughed the stormy seas - '
L622169 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ It's all right, Finn.
L622168 +++$+++ u8549 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ PHILIP +++$+++ Oh no you can't. Get on with the painting.
L622163 +++$+++ u8549 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ PHILIP +++$+++ I wanted my Leda to be a little girl. Leda and the swan. See?
L622162 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Sixteen. Well, nearly sixteen.
L622161 +++$+++ u8549 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ PHILIP +++$+++ You're well built; how old are you?
L622125 +++$+++ u8549 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ PHILIP +++$+++ What? Did you let that child play with one of my toys? I don't like children playing with my toys.  Have to fix you up with another hammer, won't we. Give her a saucepan to play with, that'll do.
L622124 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ Victoria -
L622123 +++$+++ u8549 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ PHILIP +++$+++ Did you do this?
L622102 +++$+++ u8549 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ PHILIP +++$+++ You're late for breakfast.
L622101 +++$+++ u8548 +++$+++ m580 +++$+++ MELANIE +++$+++ I'm Melanie.
L622732 +++$+++ u8550 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ A.D.A. KELLY +++$+++ Well, I hope it stays that way.
L622731 +++$+++ u8570 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ No, of course not.  She's one of the top students at her school.
L622730 +++$+++ u8550 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ A.D.A. KELLY +++$+++ Is she in any kind of therapy... professional help?
L622729 +++$+++ u8570 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ I... I don't really know.
L622728 +++$+++ u8550 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ A.D.A. KELLY +++$+++ I mean, did you ask her?  What kind of drugs has she tried?
L622727 +++$+++ u8570 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ I don't know what you mean.
L622726 +++$+++ u8550 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ A.D.A. KELLY +++$+++ One thing bothers me...  That kid they dropped off had coke and heroin in him.  Serious amounts.  He's lucky he lived.  So I gotta ask: what's your daughter on?
L622725 +++$+++ u8550 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ A.D.A. KELLY +++$+++ Like I said, open container, P.I., Misdemeanor possession.  Easy to make it disappear.  For you, poof, it's gone.
L622724 +++$+++ u8570 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Still, this was a sensitive issue for me and I wanted to thank you personally.
L622723 +++$+++ u8550 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ A.D.A. KELLY +++$+++ Judge Wakefield, it's an honor to handle it for you.  Consider it gone away.  She's a minor; it probably would've expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.
L622722 +++$+++ u8570 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ I appreciate you coming in so early.
L623198 +++$+++ u8564 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ JAVIER +++$+++ You will believe me, because it's true.
L623197 +++$+++ u8551 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I want to believe you.  I really do.
L623196 +++$+++ u8564 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ JAVIER +++$+++ If Manolo hadn't gone and told them what he did then Salazar and Madrigal would never have been brought to justice.  He did a great thing for Tijuana.  He did a great thing for Mexico.
L623011 +++$+++ u8551 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Well, you know, he's going to say about Madrigal... and Salazar.
L623010 +++$+++ u8564 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ JAVIER +++$+++ What is he planning on telling them?
L623009 +++$+++ u8551 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Nine thousand dollars.
L623008 +++$+++ u8564 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ JAVIER +++$+++ How much?
L623007 +++$+++ u8551 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ He has debts.  He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.
L623006 +++$+++ u8564 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ JAVIER +++$+++ Why does he need money?
L623003 +++$+++ u8551 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ It's very hard for me to come and tell you this.
L623002 +++$+++ u8564 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ JAVIER +++$+++ What?  What is it?
L622807 +++$+++ u8564 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ JAVIER +++$+++ No.
L622806 +++$+++ u8551 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ He never came home last night.  Was he with you?
L622805 +++$+++ u8564 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ JAVIER +++$+++ He's not here.
L622804 +++$+++ u8551 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I can't find Manolo.
L622803 +++$+++ u8564 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ JAVIER +++$+++ Anna.  What's wrong?  What do you want?
L622438 +++$+++ u8551 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ He's right.  They'll do it when you're walking somewhere, make it look like street crime.
L622437 +++$+++ u8564 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ JAVIER +++$+++ Even if that were true, they're not going to come to your house where you're waiting for them.
L623151 +++$+++ u8552 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ARNIE +++$+++ It's the same.  What happened to what they gave you?
L623150 +++$+++ u8563 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ It's the same stuff?  From the rainy day stash?
L623148 +++$+++ u8552 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ARNIE +++$+++ What are you thinking, calling me at home with a message like that?  You've compromised me and our relationship --
L623147 +++$+++ u8563 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ Did you get it?
L623087 +++$+++ u8552 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ARNIE +++$+++ I can't do that.
L623086 +++$+++ u8563 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers.
L623085 +++$+++ u8552 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ARNIE +++$+++ Helena --
L623084 +++$+++ u8563 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ I know I made things worse.  I know that and I'm sorry, but Arnie I need something from you.  Something only you can help me with.
L623083 +++$+++ u8552 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ARNIE +++$+++ Helena, please.  This is out of your hands.
L623082 +++$+++ u8563 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ That is going to be rather difficult when all the evidence is against us.
L623081 +++$+++ u8552 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ARNIE +++$+++ Have you gone crazy?  You are not Carl.  You aren't as good as Carl.  They are moving the trial to a high security location.  The press has gone berserk.  The jury will be influenced.  Stay out of things. Let us try to win the case.
L623080 +++$+++ u8563 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ I tried, Arnie.  And, I will continue to try.
L623079 +++$+++ u8552 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ARNIE +++$+++ That was a stupid thing you did. Incredibly stupid.
L622875 +++$+++ u8563 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ I'm glad you think so, but I'm picturing a debt-ridden, thirty-two year-old mother whose ex-husband is being compared to Pablo Escobar.  And I'm wondering who would want to be with someone like that?
L622874 +++$+++ u8552 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ARNIE +++$+++ I remember when I first met you: little Helen Watts from the wrong side of somewhere.  I had a feeling even then that your survival instincts were pretty well honed.
L622873 +++$+++ u8563 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ Sometimes I wonder what I'll do if Carl doesn't get out.  I'm not very adept at being on my own.  I've always had a man in my life.  Always.
L622872 +++$+++ u8563 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ Don't you have some good news?  Isn't there something positive you could say.
L622871 +++$+++ u8552 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ARNIE +++$+++ Laundromats for the washing of money. Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business.
L622870 +++$+++ u8563 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ What about legitimate businesses? We own a construction concern, real estate --
L622869 +++$+++ u8552 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ARNIE +++$+++ Even if I knew I wouldn't tell you. You do not want to come into contact with these people.  Only Carl knows who they are.  That's his real asset. Ruiz doesn't know them.  They don't know Ruiz.  Church and State.
L622868 +++$+++ u8563 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ Please.  Tell me who Carl sells to.
L622867 +++$+++ u8552 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ARNIE +++$+++ Yes, I told you before, there are people who owe you money but they're not paying.  There's too much heat on Carl.
L622866 +++$+++ u8563 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ Arnie, help me.  Doesn't anyone owe us money?
L622865 +++$+++ u8552 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ARNIE +++$+++ Helena, if I had it I would give it to you, but I don't have that kind of money.
L622864 +++$+++ u8563 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ Arnie, I need money.  Somebody threatened my children.  They want a first payment of three million dollars.
L622863 +++$+++ u8552 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ARNIE +++$+++ This place is swept twice a day.  I learned that in Miami in '85.  Then the U.S. shut down the whole Caribbean, but it's a big game of wack-a-mole.  Knock it down in Miami, it pops up here.  And San Diego is so much more relaxing.
L622678 +++$+++ u8552 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ARNIE +++$+++ I suspect he'll accept his payment in publicity.
L622677 +++$+++ u8563 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ How much do I pay him?
L622676 +++$+++ u8552 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ARNIE +++$+++ You're gonna get through it, but the first thing we do is get Michael Adler to represent Carl.  We get Adler and we beat this thing.
L622675 +++$+++ u8563 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ If all our assets are frozen and our "sales force" has scattered...  How am I supposed to survive?  I'm giving birth in three months.  How do I get through this?
L622664 +++$+++ u8552 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ARNIE +++$+++ Of course he is.  I've known him for twenty years and he doesn't jaywalk...
L622663 +++$+++ u8563 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ I am on the board of my son's school. I had a fundraiser for A.L.V. in my front yard.  I have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman.
L622598 +++$+++ u8552 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ARNIE +++$+++ That's a very apt analogy, Helena. Now, go home and be with your children.
L622597 +++$+++ u8563 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.
L622596 +++$+++ u8552 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ARNIE +++$+++ I don't know, but under no circumstances would I talk about it here.  I want you to go home and relax the best you can.  Continue your life as if nothing has happened. That is very important.
L622595 +++$+++ u8563 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ What is he being charged with?
L622594 +++$+++ u8552 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ARNIE +++$+++ Got it?  Good.  Do not discuss anything over the telephone.  Do not talk to the neighbors.  Stay out of your yard.
L622593 +++$+++ u8563 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ HELENA +++$+++ Arnie, this is crazy.
L622592 +++$+++ u8552 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ARNIE +++$+++ Good.  From now on I want you to expect that every word you utter will be tape-recorded, that the movement of your lips is being read. Got it?
L622591 +++$+++ u8552 +++$+++ m581 +++$+++ ARNIE +++$+++ Listen to me carefully.  First of all, Carl isn't here.  DEA's got him and they'll hang on to him until arraignment, which will probably be tomorrow.  So here you're wasting your time.  Are you with me?
