L499962 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ A comedy! What will my hero be but the saddest wretch in the kingdom, sick with love?

L499960 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ If my hurt is to be that you will write no more, then I shall be the sorrier.
L499959 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.
L499958 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ It was we ourselves did that. And for my life to come I would not have it otherwise.
L499957 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I am done with theatre. The playhouse is for dreamers. Look where the dream has brought us.

L499785 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ "Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."

L499767 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You cannot marry Wessex!
L499766 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ You were not dead before. When I thought you dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that I would never see your face. I saw our end, and it will come.
L499765 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Oh, my love  You ran from me before.
L499764 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ I love you, Will, beyond poetry.
L499761 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I was the more deceived.
L499760 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ Calf love. I loved the writer, and gave up the prize for a sonnet.
L499759 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed.
L499758 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ You lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed.
L499757 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ You lie.
L499756 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.
L499755 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ You never spoke so well of him.
L499754 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Marlowe's touch was in my Titus Andronicus and my Henry VI was a house built on his foundations.
L499698 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ A literary feud. Quite normal.
L499697 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ Will! What--?
L499623 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ Stage fighting!  Oh, Will! As Thomas Kent my heart belongs to you but as Viola the river divides us, and I will marry Wessex a week from Saturday.
L499622 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I know how to fight!
L499621 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ You cannot, Wessex will kill you
L499620 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Then I will go with you.
L499619 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ You follow your desire freely enough in the night. So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.
L499618 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ To be the wife of a poor player?--can I wish that for Lady Viola, except in my dreams? And yet I would, if I were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day.
L499617 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ What will you have me do? Marry you instead?
L499616 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You cannot! Not for the Queen herself!
L499609 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ Yes, this is not life, Will. This is a stolen season.
L499608 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy I am writing now. A broad river divides my lovers--family, duty, fate--as unchangeable as nature.
L499607 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ Oh, but it will end well for love?
L499606 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I found something in my sleep. The Friar who married them will take up their destinies.
L499570 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Oh, but it is mine too!
L499569 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ That's my line!
L499568 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ "Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast. O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
L499554 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Yes, some of it is speakable.
L499553 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ Oh, Will!
L499548 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I must. I must
L499547 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ Oh, do not go
L499516 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ It was the owl. Believe me, love, it was the owl.
L499515 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ It is broad day!  The rooster tells us so!
L499514 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ There is time. It is still dark.
L499513 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ Oh--no, no!
L499512 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Let him be damned for his pages!
L499511 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ Mr. Henslowe?
L499510 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Oh, let Henslowe wait.
L499509 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ It was the owl--come to bed
L499508 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ No, the morning rooster woke me.
L499507 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ Moonlight!
L499506 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I must. Look-- how pale the window.
L499505 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ You would not leave me?
L499503 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Well perhaps better than my first. 
L499502 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ And that was only my first try.
L499501 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Oh
L499500 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ Even your play.
L499499 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ There is.
L499498 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ I would not have thought it. There is something better than a play.
L499496 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ It is strange to me, too.
L499495 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ I do not know how to undress a man.
L499494 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ Then kiss me again for I am not mistook.
L499493 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I am.
L499492 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?
L499491 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Wait! You are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as I was mistook in Thomas Kent.
L499490 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ Can you love a player?
L499489 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Can you love a fool?
L499342 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ Oh, not for the world!
L499341 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You can bring them with a word.
L499340 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ If they find you here they will kill you.
L499339 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Oh my lady, my love!
L499336 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Oh--I am him too!
L499335 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ Alas indeed, for I thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart.
L499334 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ A lowly player.
L499333 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ Oh but why "alas?"
L499332 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ The same, alas.
L499331 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ Anon, good nurse. Anon.  Master Shakespeare?!
L499330 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Will Shakespeare!
L499329 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ Who is there?
L499328 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ My lady!
L499747 +++$+++ u7572 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WESSEX +++$+++ Killed last night, in a tavern! Come, then, we'll say a prayer for his soul
L499746 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ He is dead?
L499745 +++$+++ u7572 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WESSEX +++$+++ Oh!--dear God, I did not think it would be me to tell you. A great loss to playwriting, and to dancing.
L499744 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?
L499743 +++$+++ u7572 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WESSEX +++$+++ And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house.
L499742 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ It is to be expected on a Sunday.
L499741 +++$+++ u7572 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WESSEX +++$+++ I understand of course. It is to be expected.
L499740 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ I am going to church.
L499739 +++$+++ u7572 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WESSEX +++$+++ Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
L499738 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ It is not my riding day, my lord.
L499737 +++$+++ u7572 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WESSEX +++$+++ You look sad, my lady! Let me take you riding.
L499659 +++$+++ u7572 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WESSEX +++$+++ Lady Viola is…young in the world. Your Majesty is wise in it. Nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.
L499658 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ I mean…Your Majesty, they do not, they have not, but I believe there is one who can
L499627 +++$+++ u7572 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WESSEX +++$+++ Ah! My lady! The tide waits for no man, but I swear it would wait for you!
L499626 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ Good morning, my lord!
L499444 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ I will do my duty, my lord.
L499443 +++$+++ u7572 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WESSEX +++$+++ She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief.
L499442 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ The Queen has consented?
L499441 +++$+++ u7572 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WESSEX +++$+++ Will you defy your father and your Queen?
L499440 +++$+++ u7572 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WESSEX +++$+++ It was your eyes. No, your lips.
L499439 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ But why me?
L499438 +++$+++ u7572 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WESSEX +++$+++ Why, yes! My fortune lies in my plantations. The tobacco weed. I need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work--I fancy tobacco has a future. We will not stay there long, three or four years . . .
L499437 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ Virginia?!
L499436 +++$+++ u7572 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WESSEX +++$+++ How your mind hops about! Your father was a shopkeeper, your children will bear arms, and I will recover my fortune. That is the only matter under discussion today. You will like Virginia.
L499435 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ I do not love you, my lord.
L499434 +++$+++ u7572 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WESSEX +++$+++ Your father should keep you better informed. He has bought me for you. He returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from Saturday.  You are allowed to show your pleasure.
L499433 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ Do you intend to marry, my lord?
L499432 +++$+++ u7572 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WESSEX +++$+++ No. I have spoken to the Queen.  Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.
L499431 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ You flatter, my lord.
L499430 +++$+++ u7572 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WESSEX +++$+++ I am aware of it, but it is beauty's privilege.
L499429 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ Lord Wessex. You have been waiting.
L499428 +++$+++ u7572 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WESSEX +++$+++ My lady VIOLA.
L499318 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ So my lord? I speak with him every day.
L499317 +++$+++ u7572 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WESSEX +++$+++ I have spoken with your father.
L499316 +++$+++ u7569 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA +++$+++ My lord.
L499315 +++$+++ u7572 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WESSEX +++$+++ My lady Viola.
L499714 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ It is, Thomas, but of good reputation. Come, there is no harm in a drink.
L499713 +++$+++ u7571 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA AS THOMAS +++$+++ Oh!--it's--it's--oh, it's a house of ill- repute!
L499482 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes!
L499481 +++$+++ u7571 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA AS THOMAS +++$+++ But what of Lord Wessex?
L499480 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of rank or riverbank! It will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king, and their love should be minded by each, for love denied blights the soul we owe to God! So tell my lady, William Shakespeare waits for her in the garden!
L499479 +++$+++ u7571 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA AS THOMAS +++$+++ I think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance. For what lady could live up to it close to, when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine? Besides, can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a Bankside poet and player?
L499478 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round and rare as golden apples!
L499477 +++$+++ u7571 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA AS THOMAS +++$+++ What of her bosom?
L499476 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Constantly. Without doubt. And plays the lute, she has a natural ear. And her bosom--did I mention her bosom?
L499475 +++$+++ u7571 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA AS THOMAS +++$+++ She sings too?
L499474 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Deeper. Softer. None of your twittering larks! I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song.
L499473 +++$+++ u7571 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA AS THOMAS +++$+++ And her voice? Like lark song?
L499472 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Oh, Thomas, her lips! The early morning rose would wither on the branch, if it could feel envy!
L499471 +++$+++ u7571 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA AS THOMAS +++$+++ And her lips?
L499470 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Oh, if I could write the beauty of her eyes! I was born to look in them and know myself.
L499469 +++$+++ u7571 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA AS THOMAS +++$+++ Yes, like rain and sun, like cold and heat.  Is your lady beautiful? Since I came to visit from the country, I have not seen her close. Tell me, is she beautiful?
L499468 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Like a sickness and its cure together.
L499467 +++$+++ u7571 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA AS THOMAS +++$+++ Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept a little. Tell me how you love her, Will.
L499466 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Your aunt?
L499465 +++$+++ u7571 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA AS THOMAS +++$+++ I … Her letter came to me by the nurse.
L499464 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ No. And yet she does where the ink has run with tears. Was she weeping when she gave you this?
L499463 +++$+++ u7571 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA AS THOMAS +++$+++ Does she say so?
L499462 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ She loves me, Thomas!
L499461 +++$+++ u7571 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA AS THOMAS +++$+++ It is only ours you can know.
L499460 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ And break her heart and mine?
L499459 +++$+++ u7571 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ VIOLA AS THOMAS +++$+++ If you love her, you must do what she asks.
L499458 +++$+++ u7573 +++$+++ m511 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ She tells me to keep away. She is to marry Lord Wessex. What should I do?
