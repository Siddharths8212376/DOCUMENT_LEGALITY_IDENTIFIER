L378612 +++$+++ u2054 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ BAFFERT +++$+++ Where did you find an old recording like that?
L378611 +++$+++ u2054 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ BAFFERT +++$+++ Yeah... Yeah... Now I can hear it.
L378610 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ Duke Ellington. "Things Ain't What They Used To Be", recorded July 30, 1945.
L378608 +++$+++ u2054 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ BAFFERT +++$+++ May I come in? I would just like to ask you a couple of questions.
L378607 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ What happened? Is there a problem?
L378606 +++$+++ u2054 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ BAFFERT +++$+++ It's Lieutenant Sam Baffert from the San Francisco Police Department.
L378605 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ Who is it?
L379024 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ Nobody knows who you are. Make it look like a robbery.
L379023 +++$+++ u2055 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ I won't get away with it.
L379022 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ Are you going to turn on me too? Who helped you when you were strung out? Who gave you money? Who bailed you out of jail?
L379021 +++$+++ u2055 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Don't make do it, Mike.
L379018 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ Fuck you! You know what he did to me?!...
L379017 +++$+++ u2055 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job.
L379016 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ You gotta do this for me. I'm in here because of you.
L378692 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ Leave town? They're going to know me in fucking Des Moines now!...  They got over ten million in jewels in that place. That's freedom, man. I could go anywhere I want.
L378691 +++$+++ u2055 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ I got a couple thousand bucks. You could leave town.
L378690 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ God damn it! I still needed to case that fucking store. It's too risky to show my face now.
L378688 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ You don't want to know.
L378687 +++$+++ u2055 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ What happened, Mike.
L378686 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ Not the fucking cop that showed up at my door!
L378685 +++$+++ u2055 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ I'm sorry, Mike. I never heard of LaMarra flipping on anyone before. He said he had the cops paid off. Antonucci never flipped on anyone before. He had the cops paid off.
L378684 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ You fucking idiot! Why do you think I use you?... To be a walking advertisement.
L378683 +++$+++ u2055 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ CLARENCE +++$+++ So that we could get the best price. He's got respect for you. He's gonna try to lowball me, Mike.
L378682 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ You told Antonucci that shit came from me.
L379095 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Is that where you're family lives?
L379094 +++$+++ u2056 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ I hate fucking Springfield.
L379093 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ I'll tell him. Where does he live. We'll get him on the phone right now.
L379092 +++$+++ u2056 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch.
L379091 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him?
L379090 +++$+++ u2056 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Tell my dad.
L379079 +++$+++ u2056 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Huh?
L379078 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ They have less power over you if you look into my eyes.
L379077 +++$+++ u2056 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ It's not just the particles man, it's the whole fucking machine, this is how they get assassins to operate. It's been this way since the cuban missile crisis.
L379076 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ How can I help you with the particles?
L379075 +++$+++ u2056 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me.
L379074 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Tell me what's wrong.
L379072 +++$+++ u2056 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ They want Walter dead!
L379071 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ This has nothing to do with Walter.
L379070 +++$+++ u2056 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Whoa!... The government. They control everybody's mind. You're too fucking stupid to know that?
L379069 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Who's controlling your mind?
L379066 +++$+++ u2056 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ You can't help me, man.
L379065 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ I... I'm Kevin. I 'm here to help you, D... Dave.
L378493 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You got it.
L378492 +++$+++ u2057 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Automatic.
L378491 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Manual or automatic?
L378489 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You want a convertible or hardtop?
L378488 +++$+++ u2057 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ What?!
L378481 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You're gettin' the car.
L378480 +++$+++ u2057 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Am I gettin' the car?
L378479 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ The Old Guy? What kind of show of faith is that? I want Debbie.
L378465 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Absolutely. Bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals.
L378464 +++$+++ u2057 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Really?
L378453 +++$+++ u2057 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Then where's my FUCKING car!
L378452 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ It's my job to see that no one gets killed, Earl... Including you.
L378444 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I need to get something straight first.
L378443 +++$+++ u2057 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ EARL +++$+++ Where's the car?
L379168 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ Wait a minute, lemme see that.
L379167 +++$+++ u2058 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ JAIL GUARD #2 +++$+++ Look, why don't you just come on back inside for a second.
L379166 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ I what?
L379165 +++$+++ u2058 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ JAIL GUARD #2 +++$+++ You signed out twice.
L379164 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ Is there a problem?
L379163 +++$+++ u2058 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ JAIL GUARD #2 +++$+++ Hold on a second here.
L379157 +++$+++ u2058 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ JAIL GUARD #2 +++$+++ Johnny who?
L379156 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ Johnny Hawkins. Bail Bonds. I gotta be over at county in fifteen minutes, alright?
L379155 +++$+++ u2058 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ JAIL GUARD #2 +++$+++ Who are you again?
L378703 +++$+++ u2059 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KIMURA +++$+++ Roper, we're into it...
L378702 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.
L378701 +++$+++ u2059 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KIMURA +++$+++ Roper...
L378700 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
L378699 +++$+++ u2059 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KIMURA +++$+++ Being faxed over now.
L378698 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
L378697 +++$+++ u2059 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KIMURA +++$+++ We ran a search on relatives. He has a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal. Smalltime thief. Last known address was on Pine Street. He moved out a month ago. We've got a couple leads on him to check out.
L378696 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ What do you got on Korda?
L378647 +++$+++ u2059 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KIMURA +++$+++ Solis said to keep you clear of this.
L378646 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Anything on Korda so far?
L378426 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I have to go face to face.
L378425 +++$+++ u2059 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KIMURA +++$+++ Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.
L378424 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ We got a guy who's probably on drugs. He's got a record of 459's and he was busted on possession. But he's never been busted on a major felony. What's his demeanor?
L378416 +++$+++ u2059 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KIMURA +++$+++ Earl.
L378415 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ What's the suspect's name?
L378414 +++$+++ u2059 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KIMURA +++$+++ That's right.
L378413 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ ...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
L378412 +++$+++ u2059 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KIMURA +++$+++ That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...
L378411 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ ...a car.
L378410 +++$+++ u2059 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KIMURA +++$+++ The suspect came in shortly after the bank opened. Botched robbery. A teller hit the silent alarm. He took seven hostages. Shot one -- the guard. He's still alive. So far he's asked for...
L378409 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?
L378408 +++$+++ u2059 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KIMURA +++$+++ Hi, Roper.
L379248 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I'll worry about that. Let's get on with it.
L379247 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ That's not going to look too good on your service record.
L379246 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Yeah.
L379245 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ I'm impressed. I didn't think you could do it. What did you have to do, steal them?
L379240 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ Spread it out.
L379239 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ It's all there.
L379238 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ Open the bag, dump everything on the table.
L379237 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Satisfied?
L379236 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ Shut the fuck up and do what I say!
L379235 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I'm not wearing a wire. This is just between you and me.
L379234 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ Open your shirt.
L378979 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ What if you and me got into a struggle... and my gun went off?
L378978 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ You can't kill me like this.
L378930 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ I'll give you something.
L378929 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Joe, I'm doing a lot for you. I think you could give me something to cement the deal... One hostage.
L378928 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ No. You just do shit for me right now.
L378927 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay.
L378926 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ For now that's all.
L378925 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Is that all?
L378924 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ I want a plane waiting at the airport. I'll tell them where I want to go when I get there.
L378923 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ I want a car. Like a four wheel drive. I want it in perfect condition. I want a uniformed cop to drive it up right here. I want him to leave the engine running and walk to the end of the street. Then we'll come out. I don't want any remote control devices in it. I know all the tricks. If it's not in perfect condition, and I mean if its even low on wiper fluid, I'm going to kill somebody and we're gonna start again.
L378922 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Yep.
L378921 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ Are you in charge, Roper?
L378918 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Good. I won't be armed. We gotta operate on trust here. We're going to wrap this up and have you guys out of here as soon as possible.
L378917 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ Alright, Roper. You want to come... come.
L378916 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Yes, I do. That way there's no misunderstandings. I need to make sure no one's hurt, then we can take care of business.
L378915 +++$+++ u2060 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ KORDA +++$+++ You don't have to come here.
L379284 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Stay put.
L379283 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building...
L379282 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ McCall, you all right?
L379215 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Good question.
L379214 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Mare Island is an abandoned shipyard, cranes, high buildings... he'll be in place where he can see everything.  How are we going to get me in there?
L379205 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Then we better get moving... But there's no way we can get the jewels out of evidence.
L379204 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ That's a chance I gotta take.
L379203 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ So what do you want to do?
L379202 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ He's gonna kill her no matter what. If I take him these jewels he's gonna kill me and her.
L379116 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You've got to decide that for yourself.
L379115 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ And what if you can't live with it?
L379114 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave.
L379113 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ And what about the ones you don't save?
L379112 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.
L379111 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ How many have you lost?
L379110 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ That it is.
L379109 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ I thought I could do it. I was so damn sure of myself. But I didn't know what to say. The words wouldn't come. My mouth turned to mush. You make it look so easy, Roper. But it is not. It's not easy.  It's a different job than looking through the rifle scope.
L379108 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
L379107 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
L379106 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ It might have happened no matter who was up there.
L378973 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Pull up alongside.
L378972 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ You're crazy.
L378971 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I don't know, but I've got to get on there.
L378970 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ What the fuck is going on.
L378962 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Damnit!
L378961 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ He's got the girl.
L378953 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ And doing a very good job of it.
L378952 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ He's cutting down the visibility.
L378951 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ There's your answer. He's smart.
L378904 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Police corruption. It's everywhere.
L378903 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ See this. Solis has me driving the shit-mobile, and he picked this up straight out of impound for fourteen grand. Probably worth thirty.
L378898 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Occasionally you lose.
L378897 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Is it always like this?
L378896 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ About six years. My partner took me.
L378895 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ How long you been coming here?
L378892 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ You want to bet on whether you won your bet? This is getting sick.
L378891 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ How much you wanna bet?
L378890 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ We won.
L378889 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ We lost.
L378888 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ We won!
L378887 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ COME ON, RUSSELL!
L378886 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ The jockey!
L378885 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ COME ON RUSSELL!...  Who the fuck's Russell?!
L378883 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Yeah, first and second.
L378882 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ They need to run first and second?
L378880 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ He'll be running at the quarter pole.
L378879 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ The 6 horse is still last.
L378877 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ To run late!
L378876 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ To run last?
L378875 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ That's okay. That's his style.
L378874 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ The 6 horse is last.
L378871 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ You're right. I'll never be as good a liar as you.
L378870 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Still needs work.
L378869 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ I'm just practicing my lying.
L378868 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ I don't know why she'd pick him over you.
L378867 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ So what do you want?... An autograph.
L378866 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
L378865 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ Ronnie... Yeah, so.
L378863 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ Fine.
L378862 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ We need the 4 and 6 to finish to first and second.
L378859 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ I do.
L378858 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I bought you a four-six exacta box. You owe me twenty bucks.
L378857 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ I have three words for you... Ex-ac- ta.
L378856 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ I have two words for you... Seek help.
L378855 +++$+++ u2065 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ ROPER +++$+++ See the favorite? Tail up. Washy. He doesn't want to run today. Cross him off... Now the Six looks good. On his toes. Coat shiny. This trainer/jockey combo does well. We can't leave him out.  What do you think?
L378852 +++$+++ u2061 +++$+++ m133 +++$+++ MCCALL +++$+++ You're a compulsive gambler?

We had a plan, but SWAT opened up too early. He got caught in the crossfire.  Let's move on... Notice this. Always use the eyes to keep the connection. It almost like hypnosis. That's the most important thing. Create a connection. You're always on their side...

A female hostage, red dress, on the floor in front of the cereal display. Male hostage, jeans and blue checked shirt, three feet to her right. Another male hostage, white pants, green shirt, Nikes, laying in front of the magazine rack. A female dirtbag with a gun under her shirt, sitting against the beer cooler, trying to pass herself off as a hostage, and there's a special on toilet-paper, four for a buck twenty-nine.
