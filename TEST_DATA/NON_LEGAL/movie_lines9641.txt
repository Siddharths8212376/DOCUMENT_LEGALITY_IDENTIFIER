L113508 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ I figured out exactly why it is I'm so hung up on getting a chance at weekend anchor...It's because if I do that well, they'll pay me more, treat me great and my life will be better.  That's why.
L113507 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Well, whatever you think.
L113466 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ You're welcome.  Sow how does it feel to...I know you gotta go -- Me too.  We're very busy here.
L113465 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- Nobody else will have him.
L113464 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Me again.  Hi.  Listen Gaddafi doesn't foam at the mouth or anything.  When you speak to him he's not at all nuts. He seems like a leader -- very impressive, self-control...that's what's so strange.
L113459 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Thanks.  The F-14 is one of the most difficult planes to master.  Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in the 70's the first crop had a number of crashes.
L113458 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ I think the pilot that shot down the Libyan in 1981 is stationed right here.  Maybe you could get him -- and maybe Tom should say that our F-14 is one of the hardest planes to fly. They're nicknamed 'Tomcats'.
L113412 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I'll come by your place, right after...drink, take pills... Love you.
L113411 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Watch? --
L113410 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I'll tell you later -- where you going to watch from?
L113409 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ What happened?
L113337 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Not because you have to.
L113336 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I write for you sometimes.
L113205 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Can you believe it?  I just risked my life for a network that tests my face with focus groups.
L113204 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ To the pan of the supplies boxes --
L113203 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ We can cut back at the end.
L113202 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Of course.
L113201 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Did you shoot their boots?
L113200 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Okay.  Great line at the end.
L113188 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ You spend too much time -- much too much worrying about that crap...  Oh good.
L113187 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Last time Paul was sick they gave Connie the weekend news instead of me.
L113186 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ If we don't get to their camp soon, we won't be able to tape the supplies coming in.
L113185 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ I didn't sleep.  They're giving me less and less air time.  They don't think I'm at all anchor material.
L113157 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Oh, God.  Back it, Bobbie -- Bobbie?
L113156 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Eleven and a half.
L113155 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Nine seconds.
L113106 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ You want to start going over who they could have gotten?  They can't take on people like this for network news.  For God's sake.  What's going on?
L113105 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ They didn't hire Peter Stiller from the <u>Times</u> and he had a great audition tape.
L113099 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Call if you get weird.
L113098 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive?  If needy were a turn-on?
L113097 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Good night.
L113096 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ I'd give anything if that were true.
L113095 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ This conversation is not worthy of you.
L113094 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Okay.  I feel like I'm slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think they're slipping because their standards are so high?
L113093 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Sure.
L113092 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Okay.  Let's do me.
L113091 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Because nobody invites a bad- looking idiot to their bedroom.
L113090 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Why do you say that?
L113089 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ He must have been great-looking, right?
L113019 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ No.  It makes me nervous to think about it.  Let's do this.
L113018 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Where's where I asked him about being scared?  You should work on your speech.
L112996 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Okay, I'll see you in the lobbies [<i>sic</i>].
L112995 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ A half hour in the lobby.
L112994 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Now listen, Arnold just said that he's been making three million a movie now.  But he's not ever gonna change.  He's still the same person when he was making two million dollars a movie.  He feels no different.  He also bought a brand- new condo with Maria, they gonna furnish tastefully.
L112993 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ At six o'clock on the wake-up news they used the wrong missile graphic.
L112992 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Hi.  Turn on your TV... <u>Good Morning America</u>, the <u>Morning News</u> and <u>Today</u> are all about to talk to Arnold Schwarzenegger and I think he's live on at least two of them.
L113007 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ In other times, with other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war.  Last week he was decorated by a president for heroism in a war.  But it was the civil war -- in Angola -- and he was in it for the money.
L113006 +++$+++ u4273 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ CAMERAMAN +++$+++ I'll put him in the low corner of the frame -- good.
L113005 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Oh, you mean use him...That's nice.  Okay.
L113003 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ In other times, for other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war.  He...
L113002 +++$+++ u4273 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ CAMERAMAN +++$+++ Okay.
L113001 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ No -- Don't worry about it.  Let's do this.
L113000 +++$+++ u4273 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ CAMERAMAN +++$+++ In front of a little -- it's a bit... You want a mirror?
L112999 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ It's an ethnic curl, I can't do anything about it.
L112998 +++$+++ u4273 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ CAMERAMAN +++$+++ Your hair's a little funny.
L112997 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Ready.
L113950 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ So I quit.
L113949 +++$+++ u4274 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ ERNIE +++$+++ The cost-efficient reporter.
L113948 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ They told me they'd keep me because they could plug me into any story and my salary was in line.
L113947 +++$+++ u4274 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ ERNIE +++$+++ It's what he did.  I'm proud of him.
L113675 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Thanks.
L113674 +++$+++ u4274 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ ERNIE +++$+++ I understand.  I'll go with you.
L113673 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Okay.  I think I'd better be alone for a while.
L113672 +++$+++ u4274 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ ERNIE +++$+++ It's been a while since you read the news -- I'll have somebody work with you.  Just on superficial performance things.
L113671 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Prepare what?  You have Saturday's news handy?
L113670 +++$+++ u4274 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ ERNIE +++$+++ Please prepare carefully.  This couldn't come at a better time.
L113669 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Do it then.
L113668 +++$+++ u4274 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ ERNIE +++$+++ I could do it this Saturday -- everyone wants off for the Correspondents' Dinner.
L113667 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Do one thing to me?  Get me one shot at anchoring the Weekend News -- they've never seen me do it.  I think it could turn them around.
L113666 +++$+++ u4274 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ ERNIE +++$+++ All I know is that they've got to fire a large number of people... and they're not going by seniority. There's a recklessness in the air. They...
L113665 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- My, God.  They want to fire me.
L113664 +++$+++ u4274 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ ERNIE +++$+++ I'm no suggesting the worst will happen...but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe, the next time that happens, down the road -- you should look into it.
L113663 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Wait.  Bullshit me a little...I'm beginning to appreciate it.
L113662 +++$+++ u4274 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ ERNIE +++$+++ Aaron, I've never seen them like this -- I think Paul's nervous about his own job and for some reason he thinks you only appeal to...
L113661 +++$+++ u4274 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ ERNIE +++$+++ Upper management thinks you're dull.
L113660 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Just blunt talk, okay?  I'd really appreciate bluntness.
L113659 +++$+++ u4274 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ ERNIE +++$+++ Anyway.  I want you to think of this as...
L113658 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Wipe me out?
L113657 +++$+++ u4274 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ ERNIE +++$+++ We know each other well enough for me to care how I put something to you which could wipe you out. So I will phrase things the way I think they should be phrased.  All right?
L113656 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Just tell me what's really going on.  I think we know each other well enough for me to expect that.
L113655 +++$+++ u4274 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ ERNIE +++$+++ I don't know if we have any younger man more respected in our operation than you.
L113654 +++$+++ u4274 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ ERNIE +++$+++ Yeah --
L113653 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Outside?
L113652 +++$+++ u4274 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ ERNIE +++$+++ Oh, I was just writing you a note. What do you say we take a walk?
L113398 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ I'll tell you what.  I'll stay if Tom knows how to spell Gaddafi.
L113397 +++$+++ u4274 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ ERNIE +++$+++ Stop it.
L113396 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ That's it.  I resign as of now.
L113382 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ You didn't say anything to her?
L113381 +++$+++ u4274 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ ERNIE +++$+++ I had the strangest thing happen yesterday.  Anne and I have been married what? -- Thirty-six years... Everything fine -- two days after the promotion came through, I was checking myself in the mirror and she was making a face at me behind my back. So yesterday I looked in the mirror and she was doing it again.
L113174 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ I'm gonna go look at it again.
L113173 +++$+++ u4274 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ ERNIE +++$+++ I saw the smile -- good piece.
L113021 +++$+++ u4277 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Uh-uh.  I'm a little freaked right now about seeing my father though.
L113020 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ All this business of war -- do you get scared?
L113016 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ It depends on how big a news day it is.
L113015 +++$+++ u4277 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuckes.  Snot... Fuckee.  You want to use that?
L113014 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ How long has it been since you've been home.
L113013 +++$+++ u4277 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Move away from me.
L113012 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ We came from Washington.
L113011 +++$+++ u4277 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ No.
L113010 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Just a few questions?
L113361 +++$+++ u4270 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BLAIR +++$+++ My gosh, and for a while there, I was attracted to you.
L113360 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ No.  I think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser.
L113359 +++$+++ u4270 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BLAIR +++$+++ You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser.
L113358 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Take care, Paul.  It takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the President of the News Division.
L113357 +++$+++ u4270 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BLAIR +++$+++ Goodbye, Paul.
L113167 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Oh, come on -- tell us another.
L113166 +++$+++ u4270 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BLAIR +++$+++ I was a little nervous there for a minute.
L113152 +++$+++ u4270 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BLAIR +++$+++ We have a minute and a half.  It's my responsibility to tell them we won't be ready.
L113151 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Norman Rockwell's enduring portrait of a <u>Homecoming</u>  The return of a fighting man has always been one of the more moving ceremonies of war... Tearful women, proud men, excited children.  But J.D. Singer was right -- his homecoming was no big deal.
L113146 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Oh, that's nice...  We'll need some new lines.
L113145 +++$+++ u4270 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BLAIR +++$+++ Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'
L113144 +++$+++ u4268 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ What is she shooting?
L113143 +++$+++ u4270 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BLAIR +++$+++ Okay.  I just wanted you to know.
L113916 +++$+++ u4280 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You can make it a little less brutal by knocking a million dollars or so off your salary.
L113915 +++$+++ u4269 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ This is a brutal layoff...And all because they couldn't program Wednesdays.
L113911 +++$+++ u4269 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ If we're not here for each other during the tough time, we're not a news organization.
L113910 +++$+++ u4280 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Bill...This is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. But I think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this.
L113909 +++$+++ u4269 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ I'd like to take everyone out after the show.
L113908 +++$+++ u4280 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Almost immediately.
L113907 +++$+++ u4269 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Just when do you start, telling people?
L113234 +++$+++ u4269 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ I'll speak to you soon
L113233 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ No, I don't.  He happens to deserve the credit.  He's right here.
L113232 +++$+++ u4269 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Well, you always want to give the credit away, do you?
L113231 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Aaron should be hearing this so I have an extra witness.
L113229 +++$+++ u4269 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Well, the visual with the boots at the end was just perfect.
L113228 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ But thanks.
L113227 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Thanks.  I just wish you'd kept the first twenty seconds.
L113226 +++$+++ u4269 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Well, darling, if it gets any better than that, I'm going to have to bring you up here to New York.
L113225 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Yes.
L113224 +++$+++ u4269 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BILL +++$+++ Jane?
L113932 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ It's started.
L113931 +++$+++ u4270 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BLAIR +++$+++ They canned me.  Well, my brother will feel great -- now he's not the only screw-up.
L113897 +++$+++ u4270 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BLAIR +++$+++ I spent a fortune on this.
L113896 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ What are you dressed up for?  Oh, that's right -- because the Evening News is here this week.
L113550 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ No, I'm not.  I'm the fourth. Joan Richmond.  Pauline Fredericks got that credit once on a U.N. special and there's Susan Zirinsky.
L113549 +++$+++ u4270 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BLAIR +++$+++ Do you know you're the second woman in network news history to produce?
L113457 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Yes?
L113456 +++$+++ u4270 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BLAIR +++$+++ It's Aaron.
L113419 +++$+++ u4270 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BLAIR +++$+++ Yes.
L113418 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Did you hear what I just said -- do you have that?  Take a breath.
L113417 +++$+++ u4270 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BLAIR +++$+++ And Bobbie says...
L113416 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Tell George and Jessica to try and cover everything without Tom having to ask additional questions.
L113344 +++$+++ u4270 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BLAIR +++$+++ I liked it.  He's not afraid to be human.
L113343 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Yeah, I know, I went back and forth on it.
L113240 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I'll never tell.
L113239 +++$+++ u4270 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BLAIR +++$+++ What did he say?
L113126 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Yes, there is.
L113125 +++$+++ u4270 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BLAIR +++$+++ I've got to tell Ernie...because there isn't enough time.
L113124 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ I'll be right down.  It's right tight.
L113123 +++$+++ u4270 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BLAIR +++$+++ You don't have time.  Not a chance.
L113303 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Bobbie, please.
L113302 +++$+++ u4271 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BOBBIE +++$+++ You know, I like Tom, because hi...
L113295 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Right there, Bobbie.
L113294 +++$+++ u4271 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BOBBIE +++$+++ Because...
L113293 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ No stop where he's all besieged.
L113292 +++$+++ u4271 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BOBBIE +++$+++ Do you want him all the way to the car?
L113149 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Just a two-second dissolve.
L113148 +++$+++ u4271 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BOBBIE +++$+++ Should I...
L113147 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Okay, Bobbie, just a two-second dissolve to the Rockwell.
L113118 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Let me hear it!
L113117 +++$+++ u4271 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BOBBIE +++$+++ He said something about...
L113116 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Play back the last line...
L113112 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Please, Bobbie, we're pushing.
L113111 +++$+++ u4271 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BOBBIE +++$+++ We could...
L113110 +++$+++ u4278 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Go back to 316, Bobbie.  The sound bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I don't know how I'll feel...'
L113439 +++$+++ u4272 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Well, who knows.  Just let m tell you what my favorite teacher ever, told me -- 'Don't be afraid to be wonderful.'
L113438 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I'll speak to you.
L113437 +++$+++ u4272 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ ...good-bye then.
L113436 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Hey, okay.  Look Buddy -- I've got to go to work.
L113435 +++$+++ u4272 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Good.  He's on the world's longest ego trip, let him take it alone.
L113434 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ No.  I'm doing fine...Look.
L113433 +++$+++ u4272 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Look, I can start up with him again if you really...
L113432 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Oh.
L113431 +++$+++ u4272 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ I broke up with my roommate -- He was really the magnet for everyone who knew anything.
L113430 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Yes, stop!  I wondered if you could find out anything about what's happening.  What's wrong?
L113429 +++$+++ u4272 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Anchor?
L113428 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Yes.  You didn't have to come here. It's just that I'm going to anchor this special report on this Libyan thing...
L113427 +++$+++ u4272 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Is everything all right?
L113326 +++$+++ u4272 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Okay.
L113325 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Hey, Buddy, don't do that anymore.
L113323 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ What do you mean?  You're one of the few people in this town I can talk to.
L113322 +++$+++ u4272 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Okay.  And look, in the future I can call you when I have news for you. Don't feel you have to spend time with me just to get the information.  Well, that wasn't as hard to say as you thought, was it, Buddy?
L113321 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ No.  Really...don't worry about it.
L113320 +++$+++ u4272 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ What if we just don't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story?
L113319 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ That's okay.
L113318 +++$+++ u4272 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ I wish it were you giving the story.
L113317 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Nobody else had it.
L113316 +++$+++ u4272 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Forgive me, but it really is intoxicating being a news source.
L113308 +++$+++ u4272 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ I see the change in you -- I see it.
L113307 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.
L113306 +++$+++ u4272 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Oh, please.  So they were really impressed with you at work.
L113305 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Thanks a lot, Buddy.
L113304 +++$+++ u4272 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ ...and the White House is hoping to keep a lid on it for a few days till they figure out what to do.
L113285 +++$+++ u4272 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ My roommate's very social -- somebody from Justice was over and...I always hear things before they happen.  Hey, and from now on, so do you.
L113284 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Yes.  How do you know?
L113283 +++$+++ u4272 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Yes, it's true.  They're going to make it public Wednesday but isn't it a big deal for you to have it a day and a half early?
L113282 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ What?
L113281 +++$+++ u4272 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ Okay.  At least let me show my appreciation.  The Secretary of Labor is going to be indicted on Wednesday. For the graft thing he supposedly did before he was appointed.
L113280 +++$+++ u4281 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I really have to go.
L113279 +++$+++ u4272 +++$+++ m285 +++$+++ BUDDY +++$+++ One's enough.
