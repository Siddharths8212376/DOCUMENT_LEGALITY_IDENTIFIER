L470223 +++$+++ u7283 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ROCKY +++$+++ I just dislocated my finger.
L470221 +++$+++ u7283 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ROCKY +++$+++ Absolutely.
L470220 +++$+++ u7264 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ But you never had a chance to prove yourself.
L470217 +++$+++ u7264 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ And you never got the chance?
L470216 +++$+++ u7283 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ROCKY +++$+++ Ain't skated since I was fifteen -- That's when I started fightin' -- gotta watch the ankles. Yeah, fightin' use to be tops with me, but no more. All I wanted to prove was I weren't no bum -- That I had the stuff to make a good pro.
L470215 +++$+++ u7264 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ ...Aren't you skating?
L470201 +++$+++ u7283 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ROCKY +++$+++ I think mebbe we're early or somethin' --
L470200 +++$+++ u7264 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ I think it's closed.

L470198 +++$+++ u7283 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ROCKY +++$+++ To you, to me it's Thursday.
L470197 +++$+++ u7264 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ It's Thanksgiving.

L469990 +++$+++ u7283 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ROCKY +++$+++ Hey, how's my buddy doin'?  -- Nice dog -- Well, I'll see ya later.
L469906 +++$+++ u7283 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ROCKY +++$+++ Shell-shocked!
L469905 +++$+++ u7264 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ ...I don't know.
L469904 +++$+++ u7283 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ROCKY +++$+++ I smack 'em hard on the shell an' they get... What?
L469901 +++$+++ u7283 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ROCKY +++$+++ Ain't your fault -- Here's the problem.
L469900 +++$+++ u7264 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ ...I'm sorry.
L469899 +++$+++ u7283 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ROCKY +++$+++ Me, I'm kinda aggravated.
L469898 +++$+++ u7264 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ ...Fine.
L469897 +++$+++ u7283 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ROCKY +++$+++ ...How's the turtle food this week?
L470597 +++$+++ u7280 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ PAULIE +++$+++ You a virgin? -- Ya let 'im in ya pants, didn't ya!  Ya pulled down ya pants an' let him have it, didn't ya!!
L470596 +++$+++ u7264 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ What?!
L470595 +++$+++ u7280 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ PAULIE +++$+++ You busted?!
L470594 +++$+++ u7264 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ Good? Good, Paulie?! I've been treatin' you like a baby. Since I can't remember it's so long -- I'm the only one who feeds you an' puts you in bed when ya can't stand up -- and it's you that made me feel like a loser -- That's what ya use to call me 'Loser' -- What kind of name is that? So can ya blame me for not remembering to talk about you when I'm with Rocky -- I don't owe you, Paulie, you owe me.
L470593 +++$+++ u7280 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ PAULIE +++$+++ You owe me an' are supposed to treat me good!
L470592 +++$+++ u7264 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ Owe you what?
L470591 +++$+++ u7280 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ PAULIE +++$+++ Get away from me -- I could never even get married 'cause you couldn't live by yaself -- ya'd die by yaself! So instead I put you two together -- Did ya think of puttin' in a good word for me? -- You owe me!
L470590 +++$+++ u7264 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ Don't do that again!
L470589 +++$+++ u7280 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ PAULIE +++$+++ I always seen ya had the best, but did ya ever think of puttin' in a good word for me with this scumbag!
L470588 +++$+++ u7264 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
L470587 +++$+++ u7280 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ PAULIE +++$+++ You forget what I went through to give ya the best.
L470586 +++$+++ u7264 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ Only a pig would say that!
L470585 +++$+++ u7280 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ PAULIE +++$+++ I want 'im outta here --  Don't think I'm good enough to work for Gazzo?  That's what I think of bums like you an' Gazzo!  You're goin' up an' don't care enough to throw Paulie some crumbs!  I give ya meat, an' I give ya my sister, too!
L470584 +++$+++ u7264 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ ...Paulie. Stop now!
L470579 +++$+++ u7280 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ PAULIE +++$+++ Get outta my life both of ya's.
L470578 +++$+++ u7264 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ Don't talk like that to him!
L470577 +++$+++ u7280 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ PAULIE +++$+++ You ain't no friend no more -- Go home! Outta my house I want ya!
L470576 +++$+++ u7264 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ It's not your house --
L470575 +++$+++ u7280 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ PAULIE +++$+++ Shutup! I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case! Get outta my house!
L470574 +++$+++ u7264 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ Paulie!
L470573 +++$+++ u7280 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ PAULIE +++$+++ Nothin'! I want nothin' from you!!!
L470380 +++$+++ u7264 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ Roosevelt finished last in his class -- Beethoven was deaf, an' Helen Keller was blind -- I think Rocky has a good chance.
L470379 +++$+++ u7280 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ PAULIE +++$+++ That so.
L470378 +++$+++ u7264 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ Einstein flunked out of school... twice.
L470362 +++$+++ u7264 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ You didn't!
L470361 +++$+++ u7280 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ PAULIE +++$+++ Christ.
L470360 +++$+++ u7264 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ Oh, Rocky!
L470349 +++$+++ u7264 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ Paul.
L470348 +++$+++ u7280 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ PAULIE +++$+++ Do me a favor -- His lungs, punch 'em out.
L470185 +++$+++ u7264 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ Paulie, it's Thanksgiving. I've gotta turkey in the oven.
L470184 +++$+++ u7280 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ PAULIE +++$+++ Why?
L470183 +++$+++ u7264 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ I can't go out.
L470182 +++$+++ u7280 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ PAULIE +++$+++ Don't get wise with me. I want ya to stop bein' a loser.
L470181 +++$+++ u7264 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ ...Like you?
L470180 +++$+++ u7280 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ PAULIE +++$+++ Hey, I want ya out instamaticly. -- I'm sicka lookin' at ya hangin' around like a friggin' spider -- Go out -- Live! Do, enjoy life.

L470175 +++$+++ u7264 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ ...Paulie, why didn't you tell me you were bringing him home?! Look at me, I'm not ready for this.
L470749 +++$+++ u7265 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ APOLLO +++$+++ ...Thanks.
L470748 +++$+++ u7284 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ TRAINER +++$+++ Cover the ribs -- Look here, elbow down, tight -- Tight -- stand straight -- you're the best, you're the best!
L470747 +++$+++ u7265 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ APOLLO +++$+++ ...Stop jivin'!
L470746 +++$+++ u7284 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ TRAINER +++$+++ Don't kill yourself, man -- Let the doctor stop the fight.
L470745 +++$+++ u7265 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ APOLLO +++$+++ One more round.
L470744 +++$+++ u7284 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ TRAINER +++$+++ Yo' bleedin' inside, man -- Get that doctor.
L470736 +++$+++ u7265 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ APOLLO +++$+++ No doctor!... I'm feelin' good, bro!
L470735 +++$+++ u7284 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ TRAINER +++$+++ You're hurtin', man!
L470734 +++$+++ u7265 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ APOLLO +++$+++ No doctor!
L470733 +++$+++ u7284 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ TRAINER +++$+++ Get that doctor.
L470732 +++$+++ u7265 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ APOLLO +++$+++ My side.
L470720 +++$+++ u7284 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ TRAINER +++$+++ Luck! You fightin' a crazy man -- but you got him hurt bad.  More ice, now!
L470719 +++$+++ u7265 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ APOLLO +++$+++ He got lucky.
L470718 +++$+++ u7284 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ TRAINER +++$+++ He's movin' to your left -- don't let him no more -- dance and stick, hear? Don't play -- I know what ya feelin', but don't play.
L470717 +++$+++ u7265 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ APOLLO +++$+++ ...That man's takin' his job too serious.
L470703 +++$+++ u7284 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ TRAINER +++$+++ People nothin', you in a fight, my man, -- ya best believe what you hear... Knock that boy out soon an' let's go home.
L470702 +++$+++ u7265 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ APOLLO +++$+++ Man, I rearranged his face with that right -- The people love what's happenin' tonight.
L470701 +++$+++ u7284 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ TRAINER +++$+++ Don't play with this man, he's fightin' hard -- Let 'em feel some real heat!
L470700 +++$+++ u7265 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ APOLLO +++$+++ I'll carry him 'till the third.
L470699 +++$+++ u7284 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ TRAINER +++$+++ Sure -- He can hit -- Don't play no more -- Stick an' move, hear?
L470698 +++$+++ u7265 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ APOLLO +++$+++ ...That boy damn near broke my arm.
L470156 +++$+++ u7265 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ APOLLO +++$+++ Southpaw, nuthin' -- I'll drop 'im in three -- 'Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion.' Shhiii -- Sounds like a damn monster movie!!
L470155 +++$+++ u7284 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ TRAINER +++$+++ I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong.
L470154 +++$+++ u7265 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ APOLLO +++$+++ Listen, I gonna carry this boy three rounds, then drop 'im like a bad habit.
L470153 +++$+++ u7284 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ TRAINER +++$+++ He won't last one round.
L470145 +++$+++ u7265 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ APOLLO +++$+++ ...I don't feel heat from the name.
L470144 +++$+++ u7284 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ TRAINER +++$+++ Too old, dull fighter.  Bobby Judge is a good boy.
L470116 +++$+++ u7265 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ APOLLO +++$+++ Give my main man a raise!!
L470115 +++$+++ u7284 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ TRAINER +++$+++ You's the novelty, Champ!
L470114 +++$+++ u7265 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ APOLLO +++$+++ I do -- Maybe what this fight needs is something new -- a novelty.
L470152 +++$+++ u7265 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ APOLLO +++$+++ Don't matter -- That name. 'The Italian Stallion,' it's right on.  Who discovered America? An Italian, right? So, man, what could be better than to get it on with one of his ancestors --
L470151 +++$+++ u7275 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ JERGENS +++$+++ Rocky Balboa -- His record's poor --
L470150 +++$+++ u7265 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ APOLLO +++$+++ 'The Italian Stallion' -- He's my man.
L470149 +++$+++ u7265 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ APOLLO +++$+++ ...This man.
L470148 +++$+++ u7275 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ JERGENS +++$+++ Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo?
L470147 +++$+++ u7265 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ APOLLO +++$+++ ...Still don't feel no heat.
L470146 +++$+++ u7275 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ JERGENS +++$+++ Joe Zack is a good prospect -- Exciting boy.
L470143 +++$+++ u7265 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ APOLLO +++$+++ How 'bout this Big Chuck Smith?
L470142 +++$+++ u7275 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ JERGENS +++$+++ Fouls.
L470141 +++$+++ u7265 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ APOLLO +++$+++ How 'bout this Billy Snow?
L470119 +++$+++ u7265 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ APOLLO +++$+++ No, man, it's very smart.
L470118 +++$+++ u7275 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ JERGENS +++$+++ ...It's very American.
L470117 +++$+++ u7265 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ APOLLO +++$+++ Now here's what's goin' down. Listen, 'cause I'm gonna say this but one time. On January first, the first day of the Bicentennial I'm gonna fight me a local poor underdog, dig? A snow-white underdog. An' I'm gonna put his face on this poster with me, hear? An' I'll tell you why, 'cause I'm sentimental -- An' all the people in the country all sentimental, man, an' they'd like nothin' better than me, Apollo Creed, to let some unknown get a shot at the greatest title in the world on this country's biggest birthday. Now that's the way I see it an' that's the way I want it!!
L470111 +++$+++ u7275 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ JERGENS +++$+++ Apollo, I'm sure there's a way to salvage this.
L470110 +++$+++ u7265 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ APOLLO +++$+++ Shape, nothin' -- They're afraid. They know everybody in the world's gonna see this fight an' none of them gotta prayer of beating me so they're makin' excuses so they don't have to be the chump that's gonna be whipped in front of the whole civilized world!!
L470105 +++$+++ u7275 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ JERGENS +++$+++ Shaw's fighting in South America -- Why not postpone the bout until July Fourth?
L470104 +++$+++ u7265 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ APOLLO +++$+++ Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.
L470103 +++$+++ u7275 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ JERGENS +++$+++ I contacted Ernie Roman's manager, he's fighting in France the same week.
L470102 +++$+++ u7265 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ APOLLO +++$+++ You best find me another ranked contender an' I mean in a flash, man!
L470095 +++$+++ u7275 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ JERGENS +++$+++ I suppose we could cancel the fight indefinitely if you are set on fighting Green.
L470094 +++$+++ u7265 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ APOLLO +++$+++ Damn.
L470031 +++$+++ u7265 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ APOLLO +++$+++ ...Stay in school an' use your brains, dig -- Be a lawyer, be a doctor, carry a leather briefcase an' forget about sports!! Sports can only make ya grunt an' smell -- Be a thinker not a stinker!!
L470030 +++$+++ u7269 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ COMMENTATOR +++$+++ Any quick advice for young boxing hopefuls?
L470029 +++$+++ u7265 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ APOLLO +++$+++ Me an' my wife are goin' home 'cause we miss our children an' can't go no more time without seein' them.
L470028 +++$+++ u7269 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ COMMENTATOR +++$+++ Where're you off to now?
L470027 +++$+++ u7265 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ APOLLO +++$+++ The Bicentennial Heavyweight Championship of the World is gonna be held in the only place it can be held -- Philadelphia! -- the nation's cradle -- January First -- the first major event of our two hundredth year.
L470026 +++$+++ u7269 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ COMMENTATOR +++$+++ Still to be held in Philadelphia?
L470025 +++$+++ u7265 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ APOLLO +++$+++ That's right -- It's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history -- A gala occurrence!
L470024 +++$+++ u7269 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ COMMENTATOR +++$+++ You're referring to the much publicized bicentennial fight?
L470023 +++$+++ u7265 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ APOLLO +++$+++ He was big, an' very nasty so I destroyed him in a hurry -- Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac Lee Green next month.
L470022 +++$+++ u7269 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ COMMENTATOR +++$+++ Apollo, how would you rate this last British challenger, Henry Wilcoxson?
L470021 +++$+++ u7265 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ APOLLO +++$+++ Very high an' very fast.
L470020 +++$+++ u7269 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ COMMENTATOR +++$+++ How was the flight, Champ?
L470136 +++$+++ u7283 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ROCKY +++$+++ Move your shoulders down.

L470129 +++$+++ u7266 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ BODYGUARD +++$+++ Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards like the zoo.
L470128 +++$+++ u7283 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ROCKY +++$+++ She ain't retarded, she's shy.
L470127 +++$+++ u7266 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ BODYGUARD +++$+++ Hear she's retarded.

L470047 +++$+++ u7283 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ROCKY +++$+++ No dollar.

L470045 +++$+++ u7283 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ROCKY +++$+++ Why?

L470240 +++$+++ u7283 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ROCKY +++$+++ I must be goin' deaf 'cause I thought ya said, 'ten cents.'
L470239 +++$+++ u7268 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ CLEANER +++$+++ That's ten bucks.
L470235 +++$+++ u7283 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ROCKY +++$+++ Yeah -- My ol' man who was never the sharpest told me -- I weren't born with much brain so I better use my body.
L470234 +++$+++ u7268 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ CLEANER +++$+++ Here -- Three minutes.
L470230 +++$+++ u7283 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ROCKY +++$+++ This guy is beautiful -- get the Cokes.
L470229 +++$+++ u7268 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ CLEANER +++$+++ Cost ya a buck.
L470228 +++$+++ u7283 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ROCKY +++$+++ How 'bout some Cokes?
L470227 +++$+++ u7268 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ CLEANER +++$+++ Six!
L470226 +++$+++ u7283 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ROCKY +++$+++ It ain't your fault -- I originally done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight.  That's me fightin' Big Baby Crenshaw -- Big Baby was the size of an airplane an' I broke my hands on his head -- I lost, but it's a nice picture, don't ya think?
L470225 +++$+++ u7268 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ CLEANER +++$+++ Seven minutes!
L470219 +++$+++ u7283 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ROCKY +++$+++ Hey, I ain't cryin'... I still fight. Kinda do it like a hobby. See I'm a natural southpaw an' most pugs won't fight a southpaw 'cause we mess up their timin' an' look awkward -- Southpaw means lefthanded... But I guess in the long run things probably worked out for the best, right?
L470218 +++$+++ u7268 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ CLEANER +++$+++ Nine minutes!
L470214 +++$+++ u7283 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ROCKY +++$+++ ...Yeah, give 'er the Blades.

L470211 +++$+++ u7268 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ CLEANER +++$+++ Few minutes?
L470210 +++$+++ u7283 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ROCKY +++$+++ Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --
L470209 +++$+++ u7268 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ CLEANER +++$+++ This a con?
L470208 +++$+++ u7283 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ROCKY +++$+++ Listen, I gotta problem. This girl ain't feelin' well, y'know -- The doctor says she should exercise, y'know once in awhile an' ice skatin' is the best thing --

L470205 +++$+++ u7283 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ROCKY +++$+++ Wait here, gotta smooth this guy out.
L470204 +++$+++ u7268 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ CLEANER +++$+++ Hey, the rink is empty 'cause we're closed -- ya ain't allowed in here so do me a favor an' not stay here.
L470203 +++$+++ u7283 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ ROCKY +++$+++ Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody.

L470731 +++$+++ u7271 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ COMMENTATOR #2 +++$+++ Not only has he refused to fall, but he has beaten the Champion's body without mercy and the bout has become a vicious slugfest.
L470730 +++$+++ u7270 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ COMMENTATOR #1 +++$+++ Without a doubt this is the most punishing brawl I have ever seen -- The ringside audience is spotted with blood. This fight should have been stopped rounds ago but Rocky Balboa refuses to fall --
L470713 +++$+++ u7270 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ COMMENTATOR #1 +++$+++ No way -- but the brilliant ability of the Champion to master situations like this is one of his most outstanding traits -- Creed tosses a perfect right hand that rocks Rocky. Creed on the offensive -- Balboa takes the punishment and counters with a left flush over the heart... that hurt.
L470712 +++$+++ u7271 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ COMMENTATOR #2 +++$+++ There's no way Apollo expected this kind of hitting power.
L470711 +++$+++ u7270 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ COMMENTATOR #1 +++$+++ Apollo almost sprints out of his corner -- feints and throws a pair of left-right combinations. Balboa drops beneath a left upper cut and lands a very solid shot on Creed's temple -- not much movement from Balboa, duck a left, a right, another left and explodes with a right hook to the temple -- I mean explodes. The Champ backs off.
L470710 +++$+++ u7270 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ COMMENTATOR #1 +++$+++ Round three ready to start and should be interesting to see if Creed can put the challenger away -- there goes the bell.
L470709 +++$+++ u7271 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ COMMENTATOR #2 +++$+++ If you had asked anyone who knows boxing, they never would've predicted a first round knockdown and the second round punishment to the body of the Champion... Most fighters will tell you, receiving a good body punch is the next worst thing to dying.
L470690 +++$+++ u7270 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ COMMENTATOR #1 +++$+++ Creed is down!!!
L470689 +++$+++ u7271 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ COMMENTATOR #2 +++$+++ The Champion is smiling and toying with the man -- trying to give the fans their money's worth and make a show of it with the badly out-classes challenger -- Another left to right combination. I feel sorry for --
L470688 +++$+++ u7270 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ COMMENTATOR #1 +++$+++ The Champ stings the slower challenger with jabs at will -- Balboa blocks eighty percent of the blows with his face -- Creed doesn't look the best he's ever been but is moving smoothly -- Creed snaps out a triple combination that backs Balboa into a corner -- oh, a solid hook by Creed, a master of fist-men.
L470666 +++$+++ u7270 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ COMMENTATOR #1 +++$+++ I agree.
L470665 +++$+++ u7271 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ COMMENTATOR #2 +++$+++ It's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of George Washington -- a great way to start 1976 off.
L470664 +++$+++ u7270 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ COMMENTATOR #1 +++$+++ Am I seeing right? Creed is approaching the ring in a boat. Is he supposed to be George Washington? Obviously so.
L470663 +++$+++ u7271 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ COMMENTATOR #2 +++$+++ You could go deaf with the noise -- it undoubtedly means Champion Apollo Creed is heading towards the ring --
L470662 +++$+++ u7270 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ COMMENTATOR #1 +++$+++ I only wonder if this man has the skill to go past three rounds -- Vegas odds say, 'no.'
L470661 +++$+++ u7271 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ COMMENTATOR #2 +++$+++ Thank you, Bob. The electricity is everywhere tonight. Rocky Balboa, a fifty-to-one underdog, is living a Cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine, 'The fighting style should be 'The Caveman Against the Cavalier.' From the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... His record is forty-four wins, twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts.
L470660 +++$+++ u7270 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ COMMENTATOR #1 +++$+++ We would like to welcome our viewing audience to the Grand World Championship Bicentennial Heavyweight Fight -- the first major event of the Bicentennial Year...

L470523 +++$+++ u7277 +++$+++ m491 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Why let Rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand? -- Take a shower, Dipper.
