L407805 +++$+++ u6811 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ It's like this, Wayne. Two people are standing in a dark room waiting for the other to attack. These two people can't see each other, yet they know they're there. Now, they can either stand in the dark room forever waiting until they die of boredom, or one of them can make the first move.
L407804 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ How can you say that you 'admire' them?
L407791 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Yes.
L407790 +++$+++ u6811 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Then you've seen the scene where Arnold Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou Ferigno.
L407789 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Yes.
L407829 +++$+++ u6816 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ They actually apologized.
L407828 +++$+++ u6811 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off.
L407827 +++$+++ u6816 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'
L407826 +++$+++ u6811 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Apparently, they've seen all our films.
L407825 +++$+++ u6816 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says, 'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'
L407824 +++$+++ u6811 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ And then Mallory stops Mickey and says, 'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'
L407823 +++$+++ u6816 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Just for fun, I guess.
L407822 +++$+++ u6811 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ They had us tied down during one of their house raids, you've seen the headlines, and they were taking a chainsaw to our legs before they were gonna kill us.
L407820 +++$+++ u6816 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Survival of the fittest.
L407819 +++$+++ u6811 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ They're shocking the world into remembering the primal law.
L407818 +++$+++ u6816 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ That's the way of the world.
L407817 +++$+++ u6811 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ That's the Mickey and Mallory way.
L407803 +++$+++ u6811 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Yes.
L407802 +++$+++ u6816 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Yes.
L407800 +++$+++ u6816 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Schwartzenegger was the king of the edge before they came along.
L407799 +++$+++ u6811 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ They've hypnotized the nation.
L407798 +++$+++ u6816 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Only on a much grander scale.
L407797 +++$+++ u6811 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Mickey and Mallory have that edge.
L407796 +++$+++ u6816 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ He had the edge. The mind's edge.
L407795 +++$+++ u6811 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.
L407794 +++$+++ u6816 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ ---and a snake-eye glare, Arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence Ferigno had.
L407793 +++$+++ u6811 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ And a snake-eye glare.
L407792 +++$+++ u6816 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Through the power of the simple word---
L407788 +++$+++ u6816 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Have you seen 'Pumping Iron?'
L407787 +++$+++ u6811 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Hypnotizing.
L407784 +++$+++ u6811 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I do, too.
L407783 +++$+++ u6816 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ I admire them.
L408269 +++$+++ u6818 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WURLITZER +++$+++ Jesus...
L408268 +++$+++ u6812 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ PITNEY +++$+++ That's my opinion.
L408267 +++$+++ u6818 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WURLITZER +++$+++ The entire wing?
L408266 +++$+++ u6812 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ PITNEY +++$+++ I'll say enough to destroy this wing.
L408265 +++$+++ u6818 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WURLITZER +++$+++ Take a wild stab!
L408264 +++$+++ u6812 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ PITNEY +++$+++ It's hard to say Capt'n.
L408263 +++$+++ u6818 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WURLITZER +++$+++ What do you think, Pitney? How much Explosives do you think that they really have in there?
L408249 +++$+++ u6812 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ PITNEY +++$+++ Here.
L408248 +++$+++ u6818 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WURLITZER +++$+++ Where do the air ducts lead?
L408247 +++$+++ u6812 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ PITNEY +++$+++ Here's the layout of the laundry room.
L408246 +++$+++ u6812 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ PITNEY +++$+++ Capt'n!
L408245 +++$+++ u6818 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WURLITZER +++$+++ I want two men stationed in that tier, and I want men with rifles all along the walkway.
L408128 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Scotty?
L408127 +++$+++ u6813 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ Rockin'!
L408126 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Roger?
L408119 +++$+++ u6813 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ Fine. Roger, what the hell are you doing? You're bothering the serial killer.
L408118 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Roger, enough with the fucking donuts! What did I tell you. Stop bothering Mickey, and get behind your nagra.
L408017 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Roger, I'm starting to get pissed. Just drop this fuckin' donut shit, and gather your gear.
L408016 +++$+++ u6813 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ Wayne---
L408015 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Okay, guys, we're here. L.A. County Jail. Julie, just park in the front.
L408014 +++$+++ u6813 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ So you're giving a man who butchers whole families, little babies included, my chocolate cream filled?
L408013 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? It's important we establish a rapport. Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year.
L408012 +++$+++ u6813 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ What's the big deal? Take out my chocolate cream filled, put one of these roasted coconut---
L408011 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Roger, no.
L408010 +++$+++ u6813 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ That dumbass probably put my chocolate cream filled in there by mistake.
L408009 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.
L408008 +++$+++ u6813 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ I'm as serious about that as I am about going back to the donut store, and dipping that stupid Mexican's head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled. Gimme that other box.
L408007 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ You can't be serious?
L407730 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ I hear ya. Play.
L407729 +++$+++ u6813 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ Now we got to film a new intro for the follow up episode. But we put the intro for the first episode at the beginning temporarily so you can see it with some scope.
L407712 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Next week's episode.
L407711 +++$+++ u6813 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ How immediate is immediately?
L407706 +++$+++ u6813 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ ROGER +++$+++ This is Raymond Burr witnessing the destruction of Tokyo by Godzilla.
L407705 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Drink up! This is a celebration. This is the day we received word we were gonna make television history. We're gonna have the first sit down, in depth interview with the most charismatic serial killer ever, one day before he's being shipped to a mental hospital for the rest of his life. This is one of those golden moments that happens maybe only four times in a lucky journalist's career. This is Wallace with Noriega, this is Elton John confessing his bi-sexuality to the Rolling Stone, this is the tearful reporting of the Hindenberg disaster, this is Truffaut setting the record straight on Hitchcock, this is a Robert Capa photo, this is Woodward and Bernstien meeting Deep Throat in an underground parking lot, this is John Reid reporting 'The Ten Days That Shook The World', this is the hippies' bloody palms at Kent State, the Maysles brothers at Altamont, this is the Nixon/Frost interviews...
L408207 +++$+++ u6818 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WURLITZER +++$+++ I'm taking one of these men. Yates, come with me.
L408206 +++$+++ u6814 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SCAGNETTI +++$+++ Yeah, sure.
L408205 +++$+++ u6818 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WURLITZER +++$+++ Jack, could you stay up here for a while?
L408197 +++$+++ u6818 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WURLITZER +++$+++ Me, neither. I don't eat meat.
L408196 +++$+++ u6814 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SCAGNETTI +++$+++ Nothing for me. I'm leavin'.
L408195 +++$+++ u6814 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SCAGNETTI +++$+++ Coolin' her jets in a holding cell.
L408194 +++$+++ u6818 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WURLITZER +++$+++ How 'bout Mallory?
L408193 +++$+++ u6814 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SCAGNETTI +++$+++ Waitin' in the lounge.
L408192 +++$+++ u6818 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WURLITZER +++$+++ They're real Goddamn good. They'll be there for when ya need 'em. Where are they?
L408191 +++$+++ u6814 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SCAGNETTI +++$+++ Yeah, we met. They're good men.
L408190 +++$+++ u6818 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WURLITZER +++$+++ I assigned you Bingham and Washington to go along.
L408189 +++$+++ u6814 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SCAGNETTI +++$+++ Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready to roll.
L408188 +++$+++ u6818 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WURLITZER +++$+++ Are you all set?
L408175 +++$+++ u6818 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WURLITZER +++$+++ Two-thirty. Shhh...
L408174 +++$+++ u6814 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SCAGNETTI +++$+++ You should see the other bitch. What time you got?
L408173 +++$+++ u6818 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WURLITZER +++$+++ What the hell happened to you?
L407665 +++$+++ u6814 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SCAGNETTI +++$+++ Wayne Gayle!
L407664 +++$+++ u6818 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WURLITZER +++$+++ Wayne Gayle.
L407663 +++$+++ u6814 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SCAGNETTI +++$+++ Who?
L407662 +++$+++ u6818 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WURLITZER +++$+++ We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest, darkest cell in the whole place. But it just so happens that right now he's got a special visitor.
L407661 +++$+++ u6814 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SCAGNETTI +++$+++ And where do you keep Mickey?
L407660 +++$+++ u6818 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WURLITZER +++$+++ Well, Mickey and Mallory can't be together. So, we'll put you on one of our prison busses and you'll take Mallory first, then you'll come back for Mickey.
L407659 +++$+++ u6814 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SCAGNETTI +++$+++ What's the travelling arrangements?
L407656 +++$+++ u6814 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SCAGNETTI +++$+++ Thanks.
L407655 +++$+++ u6818 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WURLITZER +++$+++ Pleased to meet ya, Jack. I read your book. I'm impressed. Good work on Curtis Fox.
L408181 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Super cool.  This is great stuff. How ya doin'?
L408180 +++$+++ u6815 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ It's gonna be beautiful.
L408151 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Fucking dammit! Mickey hold onto that thought. Reload, quick!
L408150 +++$+++ u6815 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Camera jam! I'm sorry Wayne. God.
L408130 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Slate it.
L408129 +++$+++ u6815 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Rollin'...and speed!
L408001 +++$+++ u6815 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Perfecto!
L408000 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ How's it working, Scotty?
L407992 +++$+++ u6815 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Okay.
L407991 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Good work, my brothers. Fan-fuckin'- tastic! I think that interview stuff's too long, we can lose some of that. Keep the girls, keep the long hairs, keep the Hun brothers, keep the black guy, keep the movie shit, and keep the cop at the donut shop. Lose the rest. And cut the interview with the prison board fellow before that. Cut it after I ask, 'I take it by your answer it was a whole new team.' Don't even let him answer. Fuck him. Then cut to me talking about the two chicken shit psychiatrists and straight in Dr. Reinghold laughing.
L407724 +++$+++ u6815 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Well, basically, what we did was put part of the old show on first...
L407723 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Okay, boys, let's have it.
L407721 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Tomorrow.
L407720 +++$+++ u6815 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ When do you want the assembly?
L407719 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ So Unruly Julie's comin' with me and planning the interview.  You two go down to the editing bay, take the old footage and the new footage, put it together, and see what we got. Get it into shape so when we finish the interview, we can just stick it in.
L407710 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Are you kidding? The last thing they expected was Mickey Knox to get up close and personal. They wanted a follow up episode and would've taken anything I had given them. I'm not gonna tell Mickey Knox that. I'm gonna make him think his grey matter depends on it. When I told Woody and the brass about this coup, they practically shit a brick. I'm talkin' an adobe brick. They want to expand the show to a hour, and they want it on immediately.
L407709 +++$+++ u6815 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Would the network really not run it without the interview?
L407708 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ We got tonight and tomorrow to get our shit together. The day after that they're shippin' Mallory. That's when we do the Mickey Knox interview, 'cause the next day he goes.
L407816 +++$+++ u6816 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Never is a very long time, Wayne. A word only the weak use. I'm not a sore loser. Even if I don't have a leg to stand on, I'm going to get up and fight this world until I'm on top again.
L407815 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ But you'll never be whole again.
L407814 +++$+++ u6816 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ By taking away our legs. Now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you'll find in this gym. Probably the whole city. They gave us the fighting spirit. Before this happened I was content. Now I'm pissed off. Now I'm half a man and I've got to work like the devil to get whole again.
L407813 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ How so?
L407812 +++$+++ u6816 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ They passed the 'edge' along to us.
L407811 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Why?
L407810 +++$+++ u6816 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ But you see, that's okay, Wayne.
L407786 +++$+++ u6816 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ They're mesmerising.
L407785 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ But how can you say that?
L408209 +++$+++ u6818 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WURLITZER +++$+++ Stay up here and finish your interview, I've got to see what the hell's going on down there before I can take responsibility for you to film there.
L408208 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Could we go with you and film it?
L408185 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Fine.  Julie, why don't you make a food run?  What's around here?
L408184 +++$+++ u6818 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WURLITZER +++$+++ I'm not running out and getting that piece of shit a Coke.
L408105 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ I didn't mean they were assholes. I mean if they're leaving, get 'em outta here.
L408104 +++$+++ u6818 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WURLITZER +++$+++ Don't call my men assholes.
L408103 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and you, I can live with that. We're about ready to go here, so let's get rid of these other assholes.
L408102 +++$+++ u6818 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WURLITZER +++$+++ Why don't I have Mickey thrown back into his cell and we can forget the whole thing?
L408101 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Why don't we make it three deputies and you?
L408100 +++$+++ u6818 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WURLITZER +++$+++ And me.
L408099 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ So we got a deal. Four deputies---
L408065 +++$+++ u6818 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WURLITZER +++$+++ I'll cut it in half. Four guys, but that's it.
L408064 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Three.
L408063 +++$+++ u6818 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WURLITZER +++$+++ I can't do that. Five guys.
L408062 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ No, no, no, no, no, no, I mean only two guys.
L408061 +++$+++ u6818 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WURLITZER +++$+++ Okay. I'll take two guys off.
L408060 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Two guys?
L408059 +++$+++ u6818 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WURLITZER +++$+++ What are we talking about?
L408058 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Phil, I'm just scared he's gonna clam up on me with all these sheriffs all over the place. They hate him. He hates them. What kinda intimacy am I gonna create with all this hate in the air. Even you and I feel it.
L408057 +++$+++ u6818 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WURLITZER +++$+++ Wayne, if it was anybody else---
L408056 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ We got one...two...three...four ...five...six...seven...eight. I mean Jesus Christ, Phil, that's too much. Let's lose some of these guys.
L408055 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ One...I can take care of myself. I grew up in a tough neighbourhood, and I've handled some pretty rough customers in my day. Mickey Knox doesn't scare me. Two...I'm a journalist, and I'm prepared to take that risk. Three...it ain't gonna happen. Believe me when I tell you, it is in Mickey Knox's own best interest to play this game according to Hoyle.  Wait a minute. We've gotten into a advisory relationship here, which is not what I want.  But seriously, Phil, look at this.
L408054 +++$+++ u6818 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WURLITZER +++$+++ Well, let me let you in on one more fact you obviously don't know. If I were to take my men away, Mickey Knox would snap your neck like a twig.
L408053 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Don't recite the fact to me. I'm sure I know 'em better than you do.
L408052 +++$+++ u6818 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WURLITZER +++$+++ Since he and his wife have been in custody, they've killed---
L408051 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very familiar with Mickey Knox's career.
L408050 +++$+++ u6818 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WURLITZER +++$+++ Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?
L408049 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Lose 'em.
L408048 +++$+++ u6818 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WURLITZER +++$+++ Well, just what the hell do you expect me to do?
L408046 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ They got a asshole over here.  A asshole sitting down reading a magazine over there.  A asshole perched up there.  Assholes everywhere. Hey, maybe if we were doin' that kiss, kiss, bang, bang stuff we'd need all those assholes, too. What we're about is intimacy. We're about two people having a conversation. Say I was interviewing you. All I want you to worry about is what I ask you. I want a trust to develop. If you're thinking about all this...  ...you're not going to relax, a trust won't develop, we'll be talking a each other instead of to each other, there will be no chance for intimacy.
L408045 +++$+++ u6818 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WURLITZER +++$+++ It sure is.
L408044 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ See what I mean? It's a funny business, isn't it?
L408043 +++$+++ u6818 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WURLITZER +++$+++ Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there was probably ninety-five people there, maybe more.
L408042 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Well...small world. Well, then, you know firsthand how Hollywood does things. Lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members---
L408041 +++$+++ u6818 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WURLITZER +++$+++ I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set about eight years ago.
L408040 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Really?
L408039 +++$+++ u6818 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WURLITZER +++$+++ Ya know, I was.
L408038 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever been on a set before---
L408037 +++$+++ u6818 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WURLITZER +++$+++ I see.
L408036 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Just a little nickname. Yep, they're my kids and they're all I need. After working together these past coupla years, we're like well-oiled machinery. No, more like a Formula race car. No, scratch that one, too. What we're really like is a Swiss watch. Small, intricate, compact...it shouldn't work as well as it does, but it does. Because of the craftsmanship, the expertise, and the artist's loving hand.
L408035 +++$+++ u6818 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WURLITZER +++$+++ Is that her real name?
L408034 +++$+++ u6817 +++$+++ m454 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Scott, genius cameraman, Roger, magician with sound. Unruly Julie, I could sooner do without my arm than Unruly Julie.
