L461136 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage -- with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open.
L461135 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I'm not ready for marriage.
L461134 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ That's abnormal.
L461133 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I don't want to.
L461132 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ That's normal.
L461131 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ She expects me to marry her.
L461130 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ You must be kidding. A beautiful young woman, and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood.
L461129 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Lisa Fremont.
L461128 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Gives your circulation something to fight.  What kind of trouble?
L461127 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Don't you ever heat that stuff up.
L461126 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ I knew it!
L461124 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Those sultry sun-worshipers you watch haven't raised your temperature one degree in four weeks.
L461123 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ How can you tell that from a thermometer!
L461122 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ You've got a hormone deficiency.
L461121 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Right now I'd even welcome trouble.
L461119 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ It crashed, didn't it?
L461118 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Stella -- in economics, a kidney ailment has no relationship to the stock market. Absolutely none.
L461116 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ How?
L461115 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ I predicted it.
L461111 +++$+++ u2578 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Well, I only quote from the best.
L461110 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Readers' Digest, April, 1939.
L461534 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Goodnight, Mrs Doyle.
L461533 +++$+++ u2576 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ MRS. DOYLE +++$+++ Goodnight, you idiot.
L461532 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ He knows.  Don't worry, Tess. It's a man.
L461531 +++$+++ u2576 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ MRS. DOYLE +++$+++ Who's Thorwald?
L461530 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Tell him not to waste time calling. To get over here soon as he can. I think Thorwald's pulling out tonight.
L461529 +++$+++ u2576 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ MRS. DOYLE +++$+++ I'll have him call the moment I hear from him.
L461528 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I'm afraid it is, Tess.
L461527 +++$+++ u2576 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ MRS. DOYLE +++$+++ It is something really important, Jeff?
L461526 +++$+++ u2576 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ MRS. DOYLE +++$+++ Not a word.
L461525 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ You haven't even heard from him?
L461524 +++$+++ u2576 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ MRS. DOYLE +++$+++ Not yet, Jeff.
L461523 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Jeff again.  Has Tom come in yet?
L461522 +++$+++ u2576 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ MRS. DOYLE +++$+++ Yes.
L461521 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Mrs. Doyle?
L461520 +++$+++ u2576 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ MRS. DOYLE +++$+++ Hello.
L461893 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Think you've got enough for a search warrant now?
L461892 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Shut up. I'm all right.
L461891 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Lisa -- I -- I -- can't tell you how scared I was that you -- you might --
L461890 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Get an ambulance.  Don't move. Try to lie still.
L461785 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Shall we vote him in, Stella?
L461784 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Chelsea 2-7099.  We scared him once. Maybe we can scare him again.  I'm using that word "we" a little too freely, I guess. I don't take any of the chances.
L461783 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ How?
L461782 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I'll try to give you at least fifteen minutes.
L461780 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Maybe I can get Thorwald out of the apartment.
L461779 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ What for?
L461776 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Now hold on. I'm not a bit squeamish about what might be under those flowers -- but I don't care to watch two women end up like that dog --
L461775 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Jeff, if you're squeamish, just don't look.
L461767 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ And the last thing she'd leave behind would be her wedding ring!  Do you ever leave yours at home?
L461766 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Suppose Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring was among the jewelry he has in the handbag.  During that phone conversation he held up three rings -- one with a diamond -- one with a big stone of some kind -- and one plain gold band.
L461759 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Too close.
L461758 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Wasn't that close?
L461732 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ It could be -- the knife, and the saw.
L461731 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Something's in there. Those flowers have been taken up, and put back again.
L461722 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I know. But there's one important change. The flowers in Thorwald's pet flower bed.
L461721 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.
L461720 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Well?
L461706 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ He's washing down the bathroom walls.
L461705 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Is he cleaning house?
L461704 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Do you think this was worth waiting all day to see?
L461702 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ In the whole courtyard, only one person didn't come to the window. 
L461701 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ But you're not?
L461700 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ For a minute, Doyle almost had me convinced I was wrong.
L461695 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Well, -- if there was one less thread this way --  -- and two less that way --  -- I might give up bachelorhood.
L461694 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Do you like it?
L461693 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Thank you.
L461692 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ I'll rephrase the question.
L461690 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ No, Lisa -- I don't think he did.
L461689 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case.
L461686 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I think I'll start reviving it tomorrow, with say -- Miss Torso for a start?
L461685 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Whatever happened to that old saying "Love Thy Neighbor."
L461683 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ You and me with long faces -- plunged into despair -- because we find out that a man didn't kill his wife. We're two of the most frightening ghouls I've ever known.
L461682 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Huh?
L461681 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Jeff -- if anybody walked in here, I don't think they'd believe what they see.
L461680 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Of course, they have the same chance. They can look at me like a bug under glass, if they want to.
L461679 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ I'm not much on rear window ethics.
L461678 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Do you suppose it's ethical to watch a man with binoculars, and a long- focus lens -- until you can see the freckles on the back of his neck, and almost read his mail -- do you suppose it's ethical even if you prove he didn't commit a crime?
L461669 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Who was the trunk addressed to?
L461668 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ I hate funny exit lines.
L461603 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Exactly what I had in mind -- along with some brandy.
L461602 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
L461601 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable?
L461600 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ But he never ends up marrying her. Strange.
L461599 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ The same.
L461598 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ The same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls, and over-passionate daughters of the rich.
L461597 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Surprise -- is the most important element of attack.  And beside, you're not up on your private eye literature. When they're in trouble, it's always their Girl Friday who gets them out of it.
L461596 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Staying the night here, uninvited.
L461595 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ I do?
L461594 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ You are. You have a talent for creating difficult situations.
L461593 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ It's utterly beautiful.  I wish I could be creative.
L461592 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ From his landlord -- once a month.
L461589 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I'd be no better than Thorwald, to refuse.
L461588 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ I'll trade you -- my feminine intuition for a bed for the night.
L461587 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ A Mark Cross overnight case, anyway. Compact, but ample enough.
L461586 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ That's a suitcase?
L461585 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ You said I'd have to live out of one suitcase  I'll bet yours isn't this small?
L461583 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Lisa, I won't be able to give you any --
L461582 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Say anything else, and I'll stay tomorrow night too.
L461581 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Well that's fine, but I only have one bed, and --
L461580 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ I have the whole weekend off.
L461579 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ You'll have to clear that through my landlord --
L461578 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Night. I'm going to stay with you.
L461577 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ We have all -- what?
L461576 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Don't rush me. We have all night.
L461575 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Don't be too hard on him. He's a steady worker. I wish he'd get there, though.
L461574 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ I'd like to see your friend's face when we tell him. He doesn't sound like much of a detective.
L461572 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ We'll agree they saw a woman -- but she wasn't Mrs. Thorwald. -- That is, yet.
L461571 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Still -- those witnesses.
L461570 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr. Doyle -- that couldn't be Mrs. Thorwald -- or I don't know women.
L461569 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ That's what the witnesses told him.
L461568 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ That Mrs. Thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband?
L461567 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.
L461566 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.
L461565 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Inside stuff?
L461564 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ They do not! And they don't leave it behind them. A woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup, perfume and jewelry.
L461563 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Do they hide it in their husband's clothes?
L461562 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ But only her husband would know that.  And the jewelry! Women don't keep all their jewelry in a purse, all tangled, getting scratched and twisted up.
L461561 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Because she didn't know she was going on a trip -- and where she was going she wouldn't need a handbag.
L461560 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ A woman has a favorite handbag -- it always hangs on her bedpost where she can get at it. Then she takes a trip and leaves it behind. Why?
L461559 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Lisa -- I can't guess what you're thinking.
L461558 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Women aren't that unpredictable.
L461557 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ What doesn't?
L461556 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ It doesn't make sense to me.
L461555 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Something on your mind, Lisa?
L461554 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Not a word. He was going to check on the railroad station, and the trunk. He must be still on it.
L461553 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ And you, and you friend Doyle --  Did you hear from him again -- since he left?
L461552 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Thinking about Thorwald?
L461551 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ All day long I've tried to keep my mind on work.
L461549 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Not yet!
L461548 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Well, I guess it's safe to put on some lights now.
L461547 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ He will. All his things are still piled on the bed.
L461546 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Suppose he doesn't come back again?
L461545 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I don't know.
L461544 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ I wonder where he's going now?
L461543 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I never saw him ask her for advise before.  But she volunteered plenty.
L461542 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Someone not his wife?
L461541 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone.
L461540 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ What about it?
L461539 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ That alligator bag his wife had on the bedpost --
L461538 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ He was just laying all his things out on one of the beds! Coats, suits, shirts, sox, even his wife's --
L461537 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ It doesn't seem to be in any hurry.
L461419 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ All right -- but what's he doing now?
L461418 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ To get on home.
L461417 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Okay, chief. What's my next assignment.
L461415 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ 125 West Ninth Street.
L461414 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ What's the apartment house number?
L461413 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ The name on the second floor rear mailbox reads Mr. And Mrs. Lars, that's L-A-R-S, Lars Thorwald.
L461410 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Okay, Lisa -- probably you're right. He's probably in the bedroom now, entertaining his wife with the indian rope trick. I'll admit to criminal insanity. Now when do I start the cure?
L461409 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Don't you see how silly you're being?
L461408 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ No comment.
L461406 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ And that's where you're not being clever. He wouldn't parade his crime in front of the open shades.
L461405 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ That's where he's being clever. Acting nonchalant.
L461404 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Jeff, do you think a murderer would let you see all that? That he shouldn't keep his shades down and hide behind them?
L461403 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Yeah.
L461402 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ You could see that he did because he had the shades in his apartment up, and walked along the corridor, and the streets and the backyard?
L461401 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ What are you getting at?
L461400 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ You could see all the things he did, couldn't you?
L461399 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ It's pretty hard to stay away from that word isn't is?
L461398 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't know, and I don't care. Lots of people have saws, knives and ropes around their houses. Lots of men don't speak to their wives all day. Lots of wives nag, and men hate them, and trouble starts -- but very, very, very few of them end up in murder -- if that's what you're thinking.
L461397 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ There is -- I've seen things through that window! Bickering, family fights, mysterious trips at night, knives, saws, rope -- and since last evening, not a sight or sound of his wife! Now you tell me where she is and what she's doing!
L461396 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ There's nothing to see.
L461395 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Lisa, please!
L461394 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ She could be under sedatives, sleeping.  He's in the room now.
L461393 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Where's the doctor -- the undertakers?
L461392 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Maybe she died.
L461391 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ A lot of things. She's an invalid who needs constant care -- and yet the husband nor anyone else has been in there all day.
L461390 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ What makes you think something's wrong with her?
L461389 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I want to find out what's wrong with the salesman's wife. Does that make me sound like a madman?
L461388 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ What is it you're looking for?
L461387 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ You'd better before you catch the disease!
L461386 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ I don't know what you consider it -- but if you don't stop it, I'm getting out of here.
L461385 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Do you think I consider this recreation?
L461384 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Sitting around, looking out a window to kill time, is one thing -- but doing it the way you are --  -- with, with binoculars, and with wild opinions about every little movement you see -- is, is diseased!
L461383 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Now, Lisa --
L461382 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Jeff -- if you could only see yourself.
L461375 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Something too frightful to utter.
L461374 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ What do you think?
L461372 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Lisa -- there's something terribly wrong.
L461371 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ I wouldn't dare answer that.
L461370 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?
L461369 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Nothing, thank heaven.
L461368 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ What's interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper?
L461367 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Homework. It's more interesting.
L461366 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today?
L461365 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
L461364 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Why would a man leave his apartment three times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? And come back three times?
L461363 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Tell me about it.
L461362 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ So do I.
L461361 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ I have one now.
L461360 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Don't you ever have any problems?
L461359 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Your mind is. And when I want a man, I want all of him.
L461358 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I'm not exactly on the other side of the room.
L461297 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Without any future?
L461296 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Can't we just sort of keep things status quo?
L461294 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ I mean what I said.
L461293 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ You mean "goodnight."

L461291 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ There's nothing wrong with you, Lisa. You have the town in the palm of your hand.
L461290 +++$+++ u2575 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ And it's deflating to find out that the only way I can be part of it -- is to take out a subscription to your magazine. I guess I'm not the girl I thought I was.
L461288 +++$+++ u2574 +++$+++ m167 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Right now, it doesn't seem so.
