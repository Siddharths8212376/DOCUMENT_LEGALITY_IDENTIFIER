L348207 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You all been here a long time. Doesn't anybody ever escape from this place?
L348206 +++$+++ u1832 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ WILLIE +++$+++ Goldmouth? They say he was born out back behind the shithouse. That's what they say.
L348188 +++$+++ u1832 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ WILLIE +++$+++ That's a long story...
L348187 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What are you in for, Willie?
L348186 +++$+++ u1832 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ WILLIE +++$+++ Me? Willie Long.
L348185 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What's your name?
L348015 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Maybe we will. Nice meeting you.
L348014 +++$+++ u1828 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ SLIM +++$+++ Green's the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling, girls. You oughta check it out.
L348013 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Blacks welcome there?
L348012 +++$+++ u1828 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ SLIM +++$+++ That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.
L348011 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Man, that music is hot. What goes on down there, Slim?
L348009 +++$+++ u1828 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ SLIM +++$+++ You found him.
L348008 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ How you doing? We're looking for Slim.
L347940 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I just want somebody who won't put a bullet in my back once the truck is full.
L347939 +++$+++ u1829 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ SPANKY +++$+++ If I was you, I'd want somebody who can handle himself in a tight spot.
L347938 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I'll take the little choirboy, if you don't mind.
L347937 +++$+++ u1829 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ SPANKY +++$+++ Alright, Ray, you've got a deal. Pick your man and get going.
L347936 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Understood.
L347935 +++$+++ u1829 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ SPANKY +++$+++ If you fuck me on this one, I'll spare no expense.
L347934 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ All I need is the front money and a truck. I could be back in two, three days tops if I had somebody to share the driving.
L347933 +++$+++ u1829 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ SPANKY +++$+++ I'm interested. Keep talking.
L347932 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Comes up the Mississippi. I can get more. A lot more. I was thinking about going into business for myself, but under the circumstances, I'd be willing to take on a partner.
L347931 +++$+++ u1829 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ SPANKY +++$+++ Where'd you get this?
L347930 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Puerto Rican rum. See for yourself.
L347929 +++$+++ u1829 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ SPANKY +++$+++ What's that, some of your bathtub brew?
L347927 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Come on, Spank, I'm just trying to get by here. You remember how it was when you were starting out.
L347926 +++$+++ u1829 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ SPANKY +++$+++ But you do. What does that say about you, Ray? What does that say about me? I've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. But he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so I guess I'm gonna have to school you myself.
L347925 +++$+++ u1827 +++$+++ m120 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You don't have to drown that fella, Spanky. You already scared him half to death. He didn't know who he was fucking with.
L350818 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ Absolutely not.
L350817 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Now will you get in the flask?
L350806 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ No. It's the inner light. And with it we can defeat anything you've got.
L350805 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ Is this a joke?
L350804 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask.
L350803 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ Little Nicky.
L350740 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Hey, that's Dad's throne! How did Adrian get that? Is Dad okay?
L350739 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ Welcome to the party. It's so nice to see all of you here.
L350657 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ I hear a train coming. Drink.
L350656 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Let her go.
L350655 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ Of course I can. Drink or she dies.  Unlike you, she won't come back from where she's going.
L350383 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ How about this? I stay here enjoying my Schnapps and you go back.
L350382 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
L350381 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright.
L350380 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yeah, he needs souls to live. When you guys left, you broke the gates. We gotta get the gates burning again before he dies.
L350379 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ He's sick?
L350378 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell. Dad's sick.
L350375 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Please, get out of my mind!
L350374 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ You shouldn't have come here.
L350373 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ ADRIAN!
L350864 +++$+++ u1837 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ CASSIUS +++$+++ Don't do it!
L350863 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ No!
L350825 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ I was going to let you out, eventually, Cassius. I swear.
L350824 +++$+++ u1837 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ CASSIUS +++$+++ Thank you, Nicky. Cause now I'm gonna bust Adrian's head wide open.
L350650 +++$+++ u1837 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ CASSIUS +++$+++ You mother...
L350649 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
L350648 +++$+++ u1837 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ CASSIUS +++$+++ All right. Let me out.
L350647 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ Hello, Cassius.
L350249 +++$+++ u1837 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ CASSIUS +++$+++ Why should it end? Who's gonna stop us?
L350248 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ Brilliant. This is so much fun. I never want it to end.
L350247 +++$+++ u1837 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ CASSIUS +++$+++ I lowered the drinking age to ten.
L350246 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ Well, we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our New Hell. How are things going down at City Hall?
L350245 +++$+++ u1837 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ CASSIUS +++$+++ "Let the sin begins" -- that was a good one.
L350127 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ It's our time, brother.
L350126 +++$+++ u1837 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ CASSIUS +++$+++ ...their damned souls will be ours.
L350125 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ Eventually, Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...
L350124 +++$+++ u1837 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ CASSIUS +++$+++ You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
L350123 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ We could create our own hell there.
L350122 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ What do you think about... Earth?
L350121 +++$+++ u1837 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ CASSIUS +++$+++ I am concentrating. Where can we rule?
L350120 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ Could you concentrate for five seconds?
L350119 +++$+++ u1837 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ CASSIUS +++$+++ That's what I thought!
L350116 +++$+++ u1837 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ CASSIUS +++$+++ Yeah, get out of here! Beat it!
L350115 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ Um, excuse me, we're having a private conversation here.
L350114 +++$+++ u1837 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ CASSIUS +++$+++ It's just such a slap in the face.
L350113 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ And he's dead serious.
L350112 +++$+++ u1837 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ CASSIUS +++$+++ You work your ass off for ten thousand years, hurting people, helping others hurt people, then you get a decision like that.
L350067 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ I've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years.
L350066 +++$+++ u1837 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ CASSIUS +++$+++ I knew it. He's finally retiring.
L350802 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You want a queen? Got one right here.
L350801 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ Keep it up and I just might make you my Queen for a night or two.
L350645 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ I'm calling you out, brother...
L350644 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Urr... uggg... errr...
L350643 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ Oh, Nicky, I've missed you. Come on out and say hello...
L350642 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Uh. No it won't?
L350641 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.
L350640 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ And give you a good buzz.
L350637 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Weed lowers the body temperature.  I read that... in, uh... er, science magazine.
L350636 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ It is awfully hot down here. How do you manage to stay so cool?
L350624 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ Sure, why not?
L350623 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ But what about the cash? Can we keep it or what?
L350619 +++$+++ u1843 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Noon...
L350618 +++$+++ u1834 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ADRIAN +++$+++ Ta-da. So what time is my brother expected back?
L350763 +++$+++ u1835 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ANGEL +++$+++ I would totally love to go there. But I hear it's really hard to get in.
L350762 +++$+++ u1838 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ CHRISTA +++$+++ She goes to Parson's, right?
L350737 +++$+++ u1838 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ CHRISTA +++$+++ Show him Central Park.
L350736 +++$+++ u1835 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ANGEL +++$+++ All these good people have totally been led astray.
L350731 +++$+++ u1838 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ CHRISTA +++$+++ You know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life.
L350730 +++$+++ u1835 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ANGEL +++$+++ I'll call her later.
L350723 +++$+++ u1835 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ANGEL +++$+++ Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him.
L350722 +++$+++ u1838 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ CHRISTA +++$+++ I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris.
L350665 +++$+++ u1838 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ CHRISTA +++$+++ So excited.
L350664 +++$+++ u1835 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ANGEL +++$+++ Oh. My. God. I can't believe you're here. Welcome. Can I just tell you, I am so excited right now.
L350785 +++$+++ u1835 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ANGEL +++$+++ You're already there...
L350784 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane.
L350783 +++$+++ u1835 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ANGEL +++$+++ It would be so okay.
L350782 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa.  Would it be okay if I called you Mommy?
L350776 +++$+++ u1835 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ANGEL +++$+++ I'm not a hundred percent on that. God said when the time comes, you'll know what to do.
L350775 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What is it?
L350773 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ A speech impediment?
L350772 +++$+++ u1835 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ANGEL +++$+++ Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
L350771 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
L350765 +++$+++ u1835 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ANGEL +++$+++ Yeah, you do...
L350764 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I gotta help her. I gotta help Dad. I gotta help everybody.
L350761 +++$+++ u1835 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ANGEL +++$+++ She's so nice.
L350760 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Valerie's crying!
L350735 +++$+++ u1835 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ANGEL +++$+++ We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look.
L350734 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ How did you see me?
L350729 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Well tell her I said "hi" back.
L350728 +++$+++ u1835 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ANGEL +++$+++ Hello... yes, he's here with me now... I don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you perv! I'll call you back...  Oh my God, I will call you back, goodbye.  That was my friend, Michelle, she says "hi."
L350721 +++$+++ u1835 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ANGEL +++$+++ It was a long time ago, at some Heaven and Hell mixer.
L350720 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Where did you meet my father?
L350685 +++$+++ u1835 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ANGEL +++$+++ Angels don't get any older, son.
L350684 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ How come you're not older?
L350680 +++$+++ u1835 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ANGEL +++$+++ Well, she was about six-three, only spoke Portuguese and had really long grey hair.
L350679 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Wow. What... what did she look like?
L350678 +++$+++ u1835 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ANGEL +++$+++ Unh-huh. Which would make you half angel.
L350677 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ An angel?
L350676 +++$+++ u1835 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ANGEL +++$+++ Try an angel.
L350675 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ My mom wasn't a goat?
L350674 +++$+++ u1835 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ANGEL +++$+++ A mountain goat? That's really sweet.
L350673 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis.
L350672 +++$+++ u1835 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ANGEL +++$+++ Okay, can I just ask you something? What do you know about your mom?
L350671 +++$+++ u1835 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ ANGEL +++$+++ Maybe try the opposite of that.
L350670 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ The home of eternal damnation, house of Hades, H.E. double toothpicks...
L350800 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ That turn you on there, RuPaul?
L350799 +++$+++ u1851 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Oh my God, he just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit.
L350759 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ I can't screw.  I can't screw.
L350758 +++$+++ u1851 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ They castrated him. He can't shoot arrows, he can't piss smoke.
L350612 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ He'll be here. Just keep your cool, kid.
L350611 +++$+++ u1851 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Where is he? He's late.
L350432 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ No.
L350431 +++$+++ u1851 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Did you just talk?
L350430 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth.
L350429 +++$+++ u1851 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ What's Nicky doing down there?
L350567 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ He superimposed your head onto "Scarface."
L350566 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ This is baloney!
L350562 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ I think you're looking at him.
L350561 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him.
L350560 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ Look. You were really high. Things happen.
L350559 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I didn't murder anybody
L350556 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ The shit has hit the fan, kid. Take a look.
L350555 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.
L350486 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ Maybe you love her. But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind.
L350485 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
L350407 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ I'm just saying, there's wickedness in you... I can tell from your snores.
L350406 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Release the evil?
L350405 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ You have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid -- engine oil, bat's blood, moose piss. You just have to release the evil within you.
L350404 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ "But those are my roommate's sodas..." Does that sound like a statement the son of the devil would make?
L350403 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ But those are my roommate's sodas...
L350402 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ Go get a soda out of the fridge.
L350401 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
L350400 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
L350399 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What can I do about it?
L350398 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.
L350264 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects. Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown.
L350263 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early.
L350254 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Well, let's rock and roll.
L350253 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
L350252 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Okay, just point me in the right direction next time.
L350251 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ Look, it's okay for me to shit the street. But you gotta use a toilet.
L350250 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ This is intense! And it happens every day? Sometimes twice? I gotta tip my hat to you people!
L350233 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Got ya.  Is it okay if I do the sleep thing?
L350232 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ You'll be alright. Go on. Big day tomorrow. Don't forget to do that sleep thing I told you about.
L350217 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ Great. Now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the Upper East Side. But I misplaced it.
L350216 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ From now on. I'm just going to avoid all moving metal objects.
L350209 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I got energy up the ying-ying. Let's get cracking!
L350208 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
L350207 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Hey... Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
L350204 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ Put it in your mouth.
L350203 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ So far, so good. Now what?
L350202 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ That pain is hunger.
L350201 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
L350200 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
L350199 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ It's freezing up here, Beefy.
L350198 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ Makin' friends already.
L350194 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Oh. Sorry.
L350193 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ It's not me, moron.
L350192 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Okay, "bro," this jig is up...  Just get in the bottle. Just slide right on in there.
L350191 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ It's not gonna be easy. Your brothers can possess people. So they probably won't look like themselves. You have to be suspicious of everyone.
L350190 +++$+++ u1846 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
L350189 +++$+++ u1836 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ BEEFY +++$+++ My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.
L350161 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Sure, pop. Whatever you want.
L350160 +++$+++ u1845 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ LUCIFER +++$+++ Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
L350159 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Please, pop, just go back to your room.
L350158 +++$+++ u1845 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ LUCIFER +++$+++ Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
L350157 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Everything's fine, pop.
L350156 +++$+++ u1845 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ LUCIFER +++$+++ What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?
L350144 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Now you're talking.
L350143 +++$+++ u1840 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAN +++$+++ This is bullshit, man.  I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you!
L350142 +++$+++ u1839 +++$+++ m121 +++$+++ DAD +++$+++ Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that.
