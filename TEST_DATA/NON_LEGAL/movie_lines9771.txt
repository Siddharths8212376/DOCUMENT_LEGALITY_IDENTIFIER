L179361 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Oh, come on.  You've had a hard year, you're cooped up with the kid all the time.  Let go; live a little.
L179360 +++$+++ u4986 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ SHERRY +++$+++ I can't afford this stuff right now.
L179354 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Okay.  Give me the drill.
L179353 +++$+++ u4986 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ SHERRY +++$+++ More this way.
L179352 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Here?
L179351 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Without Dave around. Sherry needed a lot of help around the house.
L179350 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Sure.
L179349 +++$+++ u4986 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ SHERRY +++$+++ Could you get this? I can't
L179190 +++$+++ u4986 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ SHERRY +++$+++ Your novel? Are you fucking kidding me?
L179189 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ After Dave got fired, Sherry kicked him out of the house and filed for divorce.
L179724 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Don't worry about Tracy.  She'll be fine.
L179723 +++$+++ u4985 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Just one more thing.  So, Mr. M., uh, do you think Tracy's going to be okay? I saw her face after the assembly, and I think she's taking it pretty hard.
L179722 +++$+++ u4985 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Oh, okay.  Yeah, sorry.
L179721 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Paul... Paul.... We'll have plenty of time to get into all this later.  A whole year, in fact. Right now I just need to finish my pie and get home.
L179720 +++$+++ u4985 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ And on Halloween we could have a haunted house.  But a really good haunted house, not like those cheesy bad ones.  You know, more like the radio station ones.  This one would be really scary.  And for Homecoming -- well, you know how last year's theme was -
L179715 +++$+++ u4985 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Why don't you guys go sit down, okay? I'll catch up in a minute? I want to talk to Mr. M. about some important stuff.
L179714 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Oh, no.  No.  I'm just finishing up here, and I've got to get home.
L179263 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Exactly.  So what do you say?  Maybe it's time to give a little something back.
L179262 +++$+++ u4985 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I also like bananas.
L179261 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Fine.  Let's say all you ever knew was apples.  Apples, apples and more apples. You might think apples were pretty good, even if you occasionally got a rotten one. Then one day there's an orange. And now you can make a decision. Do you want an apple, or do you want an orange? That's democracy.
L179260 +++$+++ u4985 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ No, wait -- apples.  Apples.
L179259 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Okay, let's say
L179258 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ takes a piece of chalk from the lip of the blackboard.
L179257 +++$+++ u4985 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Huh?  Oh.  Uh... pears
L179256 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Paul, what's your favorite fruit?
L179255 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Yeah.  But one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of a democracy, doesn't it? That's more like a... well, like a dictatorship, like we studied.
L179254 +++$+++ u4985 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ And she's super-nice
L179253 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Yeah, no, she's a go-getter, all right.
L179252 +++$+++ u4985 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Who, me?  Nooo.  I never... I don't know anything about that stuff, Mr. M. Besides, that's Tracy Flick's thing. She's always working so hard and --
L179250 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Let me give you a clue.  You're a born leader.  You're one of the most popular students at Millard.  You're honest and straightforward.  You don't choke under pressure, as we all saw in that amazing fourth quarter against Westside.  The other kids look up to you.  What does that spell?
L179249 +++$+++ u4985 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What do you mean?
L179248 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ But you've got a big choice right now. You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life. Or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity.  I personally think you have a big future ahead of you, and I don't mean the fleeting glory of sports.
L179247 +++$+++ u4985 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Yeah.
L179246 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I know.  I understand disappointment. I really do.
L179245 +++$+++ u4985 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it.  And maybe go on to...
L179244 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Paul, I know you've been pretty down since your accident.
L179742 +++$+++ u4989 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ WALT +++$+++ Larry, you just take it easy
L179741 +++$+++ u4981 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ You said I was a liar   You're the liar, you're the --
L179676 +++$+++ u4981 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ I'm telling you. Dr. Hendricks, every vote was accounted for.
L179675 +++$+++ u4989 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ WALT +++$+++ Whoa! Easy, Fouch. I don't like where you're going.
L179668 +++$+++ u4989 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ WALT +++$+++ If you say so.
L179667 +++$+++ u4981 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ And 290 "disregards," right?
L179666 +++$+++ u4989 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ WALT +++$+++ Sorry. My figures work out exactly the same as Jim's. 256 for Paul, 255 for Tracy.
L179665 +++$+++ u4981 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ No way I It doesn't make sense.
L179664 +++$+++ u4989 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ WALT +++$+++ 253... 254... 255. I get the same as you Jim. Looks like Paul's our president.
L179318 +++$+++ u4982 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Well, I do.
L179317 +++$+++ u4987 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TAMMY +++$+++ I don't care.
L179316 +++$+++ u4982 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ But other people can see them too.
L179315 +++$+++ u4987 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TAMMY +++$+++ I know.
L179314 +++$+++ u4982 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ These are private -- these are for us.
L179313 +++$+++ u4987 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TAMMY +++$+++ So?
L179312 +++$+++ u4982 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ People can see this.
L179311 +++$+++ u4987 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TAMMY +++$+++ What?
L179310 +++$+++ u4982 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Are you crazy?
L179301 +++$+++ u4982 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ I'm not a dyke, okay, and we're not in love. We were just... I was just experimenting.
L179300 +++$+++ u4987 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TAMMY +++$+++ What...?
L179299 +++$+++ u4982 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ I'm not like you.
L179298 +++$+++ u4987 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TAMMY +++$+++ Where 're you going?
L179284 +++$+++ u4982 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ I told you ... I can't. I just -- It doesn't feel right anymore, you know?
L179283 +++$+++ u4987 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TAMMY +++$+++ What?
L179481 +++$+++ u4985 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Oh, no, hey.  Like I said. Tammy wouldn't... she...
L179480 +++$+++ u4982 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ It was Tammy I  That's who it was.
L179479 +++$+++ u4985 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ We still have some extra ones, don't we?  Maybe we can just --
L179395 +++$+++ u4982 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ I don't know.  You're her brother you should know.
L179394 +++$+++ u4985 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ For what?
L179393 +++$+++ u4982 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ I mean at you.
L179392 +++$+++ u4985 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ For what?
L179391 +++$+++ u4982 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ She's doing this to get back at me
L179386 +++$+++ u4982 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ It's a conflict of interest.  And Paul was first.
L179385 +++$+++ u4985 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ We can't both run, can we?  We're brother and sister.  Can we?
L179327 +++$+++ u4982 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ LISA +++$+++ Sorry.
L179326 +++$+++ u4985 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Uhhh... teeth. Teeth.
L179788 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Thanks.  You too.  It was great working with you.
L179787 +++$+++ u4985 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Have a great summer.  And good luck at college.
L179786 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Yes, Paul?
L179782 +++$+++ u4985 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Oh, yeah, sure.  Hey Nolan, give my book to Tracy when you're done*
L179781 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Can I sign yours too?
L179780 +++$+++ u4985 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Sure, Tracy.
L179779 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Paul, will you sign my yearbook?
L179683 +++$+++ u4985 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ You know, I don't understand why everybody bad-mouthed Tracy all the time.  She was always super- nice to me.
L179682 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Yeah.
L179681 +++$+++ u4985 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Yeah, you too, Tracy.  I'm just glad it's over.
L179680 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Paul, I just want you to know that no matter how this turns out, you've run a wonderful campaign. It's been fun competing with you.
L179620 +++$+++ u4985 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Thanks!
L179619 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Good luck to you too, Paul.
L179618 +++$+++ u4985 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Hell, good luck!
L179617 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Yeah.
L179616 +++$+++ u4985 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Way to go, Tracy!  Isn't this exciting?
L179277 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Okay, Mr. Popular.  You're on.
L179276 +++$+++ u4985 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Well, I mean, you know, I talked to him and everything, but he just said he thought it was a good idea... and how there's all different kinds of fruit and...  It's nothing against you, Tracy. You're the best.  I just thought --
L179275 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ So Mr. McAllister asked you to run.
L179274 +++$+++ u4985 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Well, see, I was talking to Mr. McAllister about my leg and everything... and how I still want to, you know, do something for the school and --
L179273 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Thought what?
L179272 +++$+++ u4985 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ No.  Uh... I just... you know, I just thought --
L179271 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?
L179270 +++$+++ u4985 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What do you mean?
L179269 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Who put you up to this?
L179268 +++$+++ u4985 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Huh?  Oh, hi, Tracy
L179267 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Who put you up to this?
L179434 +++$+++ u4985 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Okay.  Great.  I feel good.
L179433 +++$+++ u4987 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TAMMY +++$+++ Sure, Paul.  No hard feelings.
L179432 +++$+++ u4985 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Yeah.  Oh, one more thing. Tammy. You know, all this election stuff. 'Cause, you know, everyone is saying it's so weird that you're running against me, and, well, it is kind of weird, and you haven't really told me why you're doing it and didn't tell me in advance or anything.  But that's okay, you know.  l respect your privacy.  I just want you to know that no matter who wins, if it's you or me, there's no hard feelings. We're still brother and sister.  Okay? Cause... and I hope you feel the same.
L179431 +++$+++ u4987 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TAMMY +++$+++ Now could you leave me alone?
L179430 +++$+++ u4987 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TAMMY +++$+++ Okay, Paul.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot.
L179429 +++$+++ u4985 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I just thought, well, last time you got suspended you fell so behind and -
L179428 +++$+++ u4985 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Oh.  Hi, Tammy.  I was just, you know, I went to all your teachers and got your assignments.
L179427 +++$+++ u4987 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TAMMY +++$+++ What do you want?
L179295 +++$+++ u4987 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TAMMY +++$+++ You know how they say one day a big meteor might come and crash into the Earth and kill everybody? Well, I think that would be a good thing.
L179294 +++$+++ u4985 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What'd I do?
L179293 +++$+++ u4987 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TAMMY +++$+++ You dumbshit!
L179291 +++$+++ u4985 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ So Mr. M. calls me in and tells me --
L179290 +++$+++ u4987 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TAMMY +++$+++ Paul, get out!
L179289 +++$+++ u4985 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.
L179288 +++$+++ u4987 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TAMMY +++$+++ Don't you fucking knock?
L179287 +++$+++ u4985 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Hey, Tammy, guess what happened today.
L182028 +++$+++ u4999 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You wanna buy your brother ten years...?  You don't have to say anything.  Just look at this list and point.  Here.
L182027 +++$+++ u4990 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BOXER +++$+++ You wanna get me a fuckin' snitch jacket?
L182026 +++$+++ u4999 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ We're looking for three colored guys who like to pop off shotguns. One of 'em owns a purple Merc coupe.
L182025 +++$+++ u4999 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ How'd you like to make it 1960?  I know the judge and Sergeant Exley here is friends with hte D.A.
L182024 +++$+++ u4990 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BOXER +++$+++ Till 19-fucking-70.
L182023 +++$+++ u4999 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You got a brother up in Folsom.  I know because I put him there.
L182022 +++$+++ u4990 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BOXER +++$+++ What do you want, Mr. Policeman?
L182021 +++$+++ u4999 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.  I like your style.
L182020 +++$+++ u4990 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BOXER +++$+++ What's it to you?
L182019 +++$+++ u4999 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ How's the left these days?
L182548 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ No.  Now.  You fucked him.
L182547 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ In the morning.
L182546 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ So tell me about it.
L182545 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ We talked.
L182544 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?
L182543 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ Come in out of the rain, Bud.
L182542 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ How'd you get to know so much about him?
L182541 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ He's the opposite of you.  He's more like me.  Cold, calculating.
L182540 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I want to know about Exley.
L182539 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ Come in out of the rain.  In the morning we'll have both our stories for breakfast.
L182538 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Did you talk to Exley?
L182272 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ That simple, huh?
L182271 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ You found Patchett.  You found me. You're smart enough.  Be a detective if that's what you want.
L182268 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I used to.  What I do now is strong-arm.  Sitting duck stuff... No, I don't like it.  If I could work Homicide like a real detective...
L182267 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ Do you like being a cop, Bud?
L182266 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yeah.  But not for long.
L182265 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ So you saved her.
L182264 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way.
L182263 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ It doesn't matter.  All they get is Veronica Lake.  You got the real Lynn Margaret Bracken...  Where'd this come from?
L182240 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ It's Bud.
L182239 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ I wondered when you might ring the bell again, Officer White.
L182083 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Forget I asked.  It was a mistake.
L182082 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ If it's a date I think you'd better tell me your first name because I --
L182081 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I don't know.
L182080 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ Are you asking me for a date or an appointment?
L182079 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Look.  I want to see you again.
L182077 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ No.  I'm really a brunette, but the rest is me.  And that's all the news that's fit to print.
L182076 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake?
L182075 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.  He makes us quit the life at thirty.  He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.  Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions?
L182074 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You look better than Veronica Lake.  Now, <u>Pierce Patchett</u>.
L182073 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ Actually, it was two.  You're different, Officer White.  You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute.
L182072 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today.
L182071 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ But you did it anyway.
L182070 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I'm not sure.
L182069 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ Did they deserve it today?
L182068 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ When they deserve it.
L182067 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ Do you enjoy it?
L182066 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yeah.
L182065 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ There's blood on your shirt.  Is that an integral part of your job?
L182064 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You fuck for money.
L182063 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ You say 'fuck' a lot.
L182062 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Maybe I'm just fucking curious.
L182061 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ I remember you from Christmas Eve.  You have a thing for helping women, don't you, Officer White?
L182060 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Miss Bracken, don't ever try to fucking bribe me or threaten me or I'll have you and Patchett in shit up to your ears.
L182059 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ It's Lynn.
L182058 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
L182057 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ He's waiting for you to mention mention.
L182056 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Tell me about Patchett.
L182055 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ Pierce meets people.  Sue came on the bus with dreams of Hollywood.  This is how they turned out.  Thanks to Pierce, we still get to act a little.
L182054 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ How'd she meet Patchett?
L182053 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
L182052 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?
L182051 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ I don't know.  I never heard of the Nite Owl till today.
L182050 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?
L182049 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.
L182048 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yeah I know.  Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  He doesn't want any attention.
L182047 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ Yes.  But do you know?
L182046 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You use words like that, you might make me mad.
L182045 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
L182044 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland?
L182043 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ Of course I am.  What kind of question is that?
L182042 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Are you sorry she's dead?
L182041 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ I was friendly with Sue Lefferts, but we weren't really friends. You know what I mean?
L182040 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yeah, plain scotch.
L182039 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ Can I get you a drink?
L181716 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ It's not what you think.
L181715 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Somebody hit you?
L181706 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ It's practically stamped on your forehead.
L181705 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ That obvious, huh?
L181704 +++$+++ u5001 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ LYNN +++$+++ Merry Christmas yourself, <u>Officer</u>.
L181703 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Merry Christmas.
L182501 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Sure, boss.  Sure you can.
L182500 +++$+++ u4996 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ DUDLEY +++$+++ You have your extracurricular secrets, I have mine.  We'll hold a clarification session soon.  For now, I need your fearsome old habits at the Victory Motel. We're going to brace a man who may know who killed Jack Vincennes. Can I count on you?
L182499 +++$+++ u4991 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You lost me, Dudley.  I don't know what you're talking about.
L182498 +++$+++ u4996 +++$+++ m332 +++$+++ DUDLEY +++$+++ Imagine crime limited to the criminal element who perpetrate it. Imagine the means to keep the nigger filth sedated.  But don't stop there.  Extrapolate.  Imagine the police in control.  It's big, lad.
