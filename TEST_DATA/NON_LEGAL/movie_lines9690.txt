L134032 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Thanks.
L134031 +++$+++ u4515 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ If you want to come in and wash your face -  I can get you some hot water to get that dirt off your trousers -
L134030 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ You're no Venus de Milo.
L134029 +++$+++ u4515 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Oh!
L134028 +++$+++ u4515 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ You are.  You look like you've been making mud pies.
L134027 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ What's funny now?
L134026 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ If these sidewalks were kept in condition - instead of the money going to some cheap grafter -
L134025 +++$+++ u4515 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ You've got some on your face.
L134024 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Hmm!
L134023 +++$+++ u4515 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Toothache.
L134022 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ What's the matter with you?
L134021 +++$+++ u4515 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Ow!
L133961 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ What are you waiting here for? Why don't you go?
L133960 +++$+++ u4515 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Charlie, please don't -
L133959 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Get out, both of you!
L133954 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ I know exactly what I'm doing.  Get out!
L133953 +++$+++ u4515 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Charlie, you're just excited.  You don't realize -
L133923 +++$+++ u4515 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Charlie, he said, unless you withdrew your name -
L133922 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ You can't blackmail me, Rogers, you can't -
L133907 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Rogers, I don't think I will postpone doing something about you until I'm elected.  To start with, I'll break your neck.
L133906 +++$+++ u4515 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I can't tell you the things he said, Charlie.  You haven't got any idea -
L133964 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Don't you worry about me.  I'm Charles Foster Kane.  I'm no cheap, crooked politician, trying to save himself from the consequences of his crimes -
L133963 +++$+++ u4514 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ ROGERS +++$+++ You're the greatest fool I've ever known, Kane.  If it was anybody else, I'd say what's going to happen to you would be a lesson to you.  Only you're going to need more than one lesson. And you're going to get more than one lesson. 
L133952 +++$+++ u4514 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ ROGERS +++$+++ I see! 
L133951 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Get out!  I've got nothing to talk to you about.  If you want to see me, have the Warden write me a letter.
L133950 +++$+++ u4514 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ ROGERS +++$+++ You're making a bigger fool of yourself than I thought you would, Mr. Kane.  You're licked.  Why don't you -
L133930 +++$+++ u4514 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ ROGERS +++$+++ Mrs. Kane, I'm not asking you to believe me.  I'd like to show you -
L133929 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ You do anything you want to do. The people of this state can decide which one of us to trust.  If you want to know, they've already decided. The election Tuesday'll be only -
L133918 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ I'm going to be elected governor. And the first thing I'm going to do -
L133917 +++$+++ u4514 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ ROGERS +++$+++ Anything you say, Mr. Kane.  Only we're talking now about what you are.  That's what the note is about, Mrs. Kane.  Now I'm going to lay all my cards on the table.  I'm fighting for my life.  Not just my political life.  My life.  If your husband is elected governor -
L133914 +++$+++ u4514 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ ROGERS +++$+++ I'm not a gentleman, Mrs. Kane, and your husband is just trying to be funny calling me one.  I don't even know what a gentleman is.  You see, my idea of a gentleman, Mrs. Kane - well, if I owned a newspaper and if I didn't like the way somebody else was doing things - some politican, say - I'd fight them with everything I had.  Only I wouldn't show him in a convict suit, with stripes - so his children could see the picture in the paper.  Or his mother.  It's pretty clear - I'm not a gentleman.
L133913 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ In case you don't know, Emily, this - this gentleman -  is -
L133912 +++$+++ u4514 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ ROGERS +++$+++ She doesn't know, Mrs. Kane.  She just sent it - because I made her see it wouldn't be smart for her not to send it.
L133752 +++$+++ u4518 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ You've made your point perfectly clear, Mr. Kane.  Good day.
L133751 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ I'm much obliged, Mr. President, for your concern about me.  However, I happen to be concerned at this moment with the matter of extensive oil lands belonging to the people of the United States, and I say that if this lease goes through, the property of the people of the United States goes into the hands of -
L133750 +++$+++ u4518 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ I understand that you have political ambitions.  Unfortunately, you seem incapable of allowing any other opinion but your own -
L133749 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Thanks.
L133748 +++$+++ u4518 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ I know the facts, Mr. Kane.  And I happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean.  You're a man of great talents, Mr. Kane.
L133747 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ It's the only vein I know.  I tell the facts the way I see them.  And any man that knows that facts -
L133746 +++$+++ u4518 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ I must refuse to allow you to continue in this vein, Mr. Kane.
L133745 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ I'm not suggesting anything, Mr. President!  I've come here to tell you that, unless some action is taken promptly - and you are the only one who can take it - the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks!
L133744 +++$+++ u4518 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ It is the unanimous opinion of my Cabinent - in which I concur - that the proposed leases are in the best interests of the Governement and the people.  You are not, I hope, suggesting that these interests are not indentical?
L134102 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ You can't.
L134101 +++$+++ u4508 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ MATISTI +++$+++ Mr. Kane, how can I persuade you -
L134100 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ If you're interested in what people say, Signor Matisti, I may be able to enlighten you a bit.  The newspapers, for instance.  I'm an authority on what the papers will say, Signor Matisti, because I own eight of them between here and San Francisco...  It's all right, dear. Signor Matisti is going to listen to reason.  Aren't you, maestro? 
L134099 +++$+++ u4508 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ MATISTI +++$+++ But, it is impossible.  I will be the laughingstock of the musical world!  People will say -
L134098 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Your job isn't to give Mrs. Kane your opinion of her talents. You're supposed to train her voice. Nothing more.
L134097 +++$+++ u4508 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ MATISTI +++$+++ Impossible!  Impossible!
L133447 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ You're right.  We did lose a million dollars last year.
L133446 +++$+++ u4516 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THATCHER +++$+++ I happened to see your consolidated statement yesterday, Charles.  Could I not suggest to you that it is unwise for you to continue this philanthropic enterprise -  this Enquirer - that is costing you one million dollars a year?
L133443 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ On the other hand -  I am the publisher of the Enquirer. As such, it is my duty - I'll let you in on a little secret, it is also my pleasure - to see to it that decent, hard-working people of this city are not robbed blind by a group of money- mad pirates because, God help them, they have no one to look after their interests!  I'll let you in on another little secret, Mr. Thatcher.  I think I'm the man to do it.  You see, I have money and property -
L133442 +++$+++ u4516 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THATCHER +++$+++ Charles, my time is too valuable for me -
L133441 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ As Charles Foster Kane, who has 			eighty- two thousand, six hundred and thirty-one shares of Metropolitan Transfer - you see, I do have a rough idea of my holdings - I sympathize with you.  Charles Foster Kane is a dangerous scoundrel, his paper should be run out of town and a committee should be formed to boycott him.  You may, if you can form such a committee, put me down for a contribution of one thousand dollars.
L133440 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ The trouble is, Mr. Thatcher, you don't realize you're talking to two people.
L133439 +++$+++ u4516 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THATCHER +++$+++ They're all part of your general attack - your senseless attack - on everything and everybody who's got more than ten cents in his pocket. They're -
L133438 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Mr. Thatcher, isn't everything I've been saying in the Enquirer about the traction trust absolutely true?
L133436 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Won't you step into my office, Mr. Thatcher?
L133435 +++$+++ u4516 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THATCHER +++$+++ I came to see you, Charles, about your - about the Enquirer's campaign against the Metropolitan Transfer Company.
L133428 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ I think we'll have to send our friend Wheeler a cable, Mr. Bernstein.  Of course, we'll have to make it shorter than his, because he's working on an expense account and we're not.  Let me see -  Mike!
L133427 +++$+++ u4516 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THATCHER +++$+++ You see!  There hasn't been a true word -
L133420 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Can you prove it isn't?
L133419 +++$+++ u4516 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THATCHER +++$+++ "Enemy Armada Off Jersey Coast."  You know you haven't the slightest proof that this - this armada - is off the Jersey Coast.
L133418 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ I don't know how to run a newspaper, Mr. Thatcher.  I just try everything I can think of.
L133417 +++$+++ u4516 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THATCHER +++$+++ Is that really your idea of how to run a newspaper?
L133399 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Where'm I going?
L133398 +++$+++ u4516 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THATCHER +++$+++ Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -
L133397 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ You goin', Mom?
L134229 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ I didn't used to be afraid of it.
L134228 +++$+++ u4512 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ No, I don't, Mr. Kane.
L134227 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ He was dead...  That's a poem.  Do you know what it means?
L134226 +++$+++ u4512 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ How did you get him to part with it, Mr. Kane?
L134225 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Persia.  It belonged to a king.
L134224 +++$+++ u4512 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ It's a wall you bought in China, Mr. Kane.
L134223 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Do you know what that is?
L134222 +++$+++ u4512 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Oh, yes, sir.
L134221 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Not my wife - not either of them.
L134220 +++$+++ u4512 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Yes, Mr. Kane.
L134219 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Mrs. Kane liked poetry -
L134218 +++$+++ u4512 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Can't say, sir.
L134217 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Do you like poetry, Raymond?
L134212 +++$+++ u4512 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Yes, sir -
L134211 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Raymond - 
L134210 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Lock it - and keep it locked.
L134209 +++$+++ u4512 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Yes, sir. 
L134208 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Close the door, Raymond.
L134176 +++$+++ u4512 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Marie has been packing since morning, Mr. Kane.
L134175 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Is Mrs. Kane - 
L134174 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ All right.
L134173 +++$+++ u4512 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Mrs. Kane would like to see you, Mr. Kane.
L134113 +++$+++ u4512 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L134112 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Get Dr. Corey.
L133996 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Hello, Charlie -  I didn't know we were speaking.
L133995 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Hello, Brad.
L133842 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ I couldn't possibly live on as little as that, Charlie.  We'll let the salary stay where it is.
L133841 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York.  It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth. 
L133840 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Yes.
L133839 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ You still want to be transferred to the other paper?
L133834 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Hey, Brad!  I've been analyzed an awful lot tonight - let's have another brandy.
L133833 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ I know you will.
L133832 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ She can leave me.  As a matter of fact, I've already left her.  Don't worry, Brad - I'll live.
L133831 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ It's simpler than that, Brad.  A society girl can't stand the gaff, that's all.  Other things are important to her - social position, what they're saying on the front porches at Southampton, is it going to be embarrassing to meet somebody or the other at dinner -
L133830 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ You want love on your own terms, don't you, Charlie -  Love according to your own rules. And if anything goes wrong and you're hurt - then the game stops, and you've got to be soothed and nursed, no matter what else is happening - and no matter who else is hurt!
L133829 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Nothing - if she dosen't love me -
L133828 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ That's all right.  What are you going to do about Emily?
L133827 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ You're not going to like it in Chicago.  They wind comes howling in from the lake.  And there's practically no opera season at all - and the Lord only knows whether they've ever heard of Lobster Newburg -
L133826 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Yes.  Now, will you let me go to Chicago?
L133825 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Are you finished?
L133824 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ You talk about the people of the United States as though they belonged to you.  When you find out they don't think they are, you'll lose interest.  You talk about giving them their rights as though you could make a present of liberty. Remember the working man?  You used to defend him quite a good deal. Well, he's turning into something called organized labor and you don't like that at all.  And listen, when your precious underprivileged really get together - that's going to add up to something bigger than - than your privilege and then I don't know what you'll do - sail away to a desert island, probably, and lord it over the monkeys.
L133823 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ You almost convince me.  I'm just drunk enough to tell you the truth.  I have to be a little drunk for that because I'm a coward.  You know that.  That's why you keep me around.  You only associate with your inferiors, Charlie.  I guess that's why you ran away from Emily.  Because you can't stand the company of your equals.  You don't like to admit they exist - the other big people in your world are dead. I told you that.
L133822 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ The personal note is all there is to it.  It's all there ever is to it.  It's all there every is to anything!  Stupidity in our government, complacency and self-satisfaction and unwillingness to believe that anything done by a certain class of people can be wrong - you can't fight those things impersonally. They're not impersonal crimes against people.  They're being done by actual persons - with actual names and positions and - the right of the American people to own their own country is not an academic issue, Brad, that you debate - and then the judges retire to return a verdict and the winners give a dinner for the losers.
L133821 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ There's no reason why this - this savage personal note -
L133819 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ You might have made the whole thing less personal!
L133818 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Do you think the "Enquirer" shouldn't have campaigned against the oil leases?
L133817 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ She hasn't any friends left sine you started this oil business, and she never sees you.
L133816 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Why is she leaving me?
L133815 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Sure I am.  She wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. If you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the President's wishes.  I can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong -
L133814 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Brad, you are drunk.
L133813 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Emily's going south next week with the child.  As far as anybody's to know, it's a holiday.  When they get back -
L133812 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ She was going to leave you anyway -
L133811 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ I don't think so, Brad.  We've just had word that the President is out of danger.  It seems I didn't kill him after all.
L133810 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ She's going to leave you -
L133809 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ All right.
L133808 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ No, that won't help.  Besides, you never get drunk.  I wanted to talk about you and Emily.
L133807 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ I'll tell you what I'll do, Brad - I'll get drunk, too - maybe that'll help.
L133806 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ I want to be transferred to the new paper.  You've been saying yourself you wish you had somebody to -  That's not what I wanted to talk about.
L133805 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Why, Brad?
L133804 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Charlie, it's just no go.  We can't agree anymore.  I wish you'd let me go to Chicago.
L133802 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ That's just a little promotion scheme. Nobody expects you -  Mike, will you try and get Mr. Leland some coffee?
L133801 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ First of all, I will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the "Enquirer."
L133800 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ I'll get you some coffee.
L133799 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ I'm drunk.
L133798 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ What's wrong, Brad?
L133797 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ First of all - 
L133786 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Go ahead.
L133785 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ I'd like to talk to you about that.
L133784 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ I've got to think of Emily -
L133783 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ What?
L133782 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ I don't have to.  I run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. I can't help that.  Besides, they all know I'm married to his niece.  I've got to think of her.
L133781 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Charlie!  Now you're not making sense.
L133780 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ What lesson?  Not to expose fraud when I see it?  Not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property?  Run it the way I said, Reilly - "This afternoon a great man was assassinated -"
L133779 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ There are the people of the United States, and they are blaming you - Oh, I know it doesn't make any sense, but at least you can learn a lesson from it.
L133778 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Look out that window.
L133777 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Oil belonging to the people of the United States was leased out for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks -  Nobody can blame me because -
L133776 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Charlie!
L133775 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ They're true!  Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason!
L133774 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months.
L133773 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -
L133772 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ - and that copy of the "Enquirer" said the President should be killed.
L133771 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the "Enquirer" in his pocket?
L133770 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Yesterday morning you called the President a traitor.  What do you think that crowd is doing down there?  They think you murdered him.
L133769 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ What do you mean by that?
L133764 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Why not?  Well - nobody's a great man in your estimation until he's dead.
L133763 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Why not?
L133762 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Do you think you're the one who should call him a great man?
L133761 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Yes?
L133760 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Charlie -
L133759 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Take dictation -  Front page editorial -  "This afternoon a great man was assassinated.  He was the President of the United States -"
L133718 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ You're wrong.  It does make a difference to you -  Rector's, Brad?  Come to think of it, I don't blame you for not wanting to be a war correspondent.  You won't miss anything.  It isn't much of a war. Besides, they tell me there isn't a decent restaurant on the whole island.
L133717 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ It doesn't make any difference about me, but one of these days you're going to find out that all this charm of yours won't be enough -
L133716 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Yes?
L133715 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Charlie -
L133714 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ You start tomorrow night.  Richard Carl in "The Spring Chicken."  I'll get us some girls.  You get tickets.  A drama critic gets them free, you know.  Rector's at seven?
L133713 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ I'd like that.
L133712 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
L133711 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Good.
L133710 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ I mean I've got a job for you.
L133709 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Yes?
L133708 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Say, Brad.  I've got an idea.
L133700 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ And I do it because they do it, and they do it - it's a vicious circle, isn't it?  I'm going over to Georgie's, Brad - you know, Georgie, don't you?
L133699 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ They do it only because you do!
L133698 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ How would the "Enquirer" look with no news about this non-existent war - with Benton, Pulitzer and Heart devoting twenty columns a day to it?
L133697 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Charles, I tell you there is no war! There's a condition that should be remedied - but between that and a -
L133693 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ All right, Brad, all right - you don't have to be a war correspondent unless you want to - I'd want to.  Hello, Georgie.
L133692 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ But there is no Front, Charlie. There's a very doubtful civil war. Besides, I don't want the job.
L133691 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ It'll be our first foreign war in fifty years, Brad.  We'll cover it the way the "Hickville Gazette" covers the church social!  The names of everybody there; what they wore; what they ate; who won the prizes; who gave the prizes -  I tell you, Brad, I envy you.  By Bradford Leland, the "Enquirer's" Special Correspondent at the Front. I'm almost tempted -
L133690 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.
L133689 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Well, gentlemen, are we going to war?
L133619 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ It's a good idea for a newspaper.  Four hundred sixy thousand.
L133618 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ The "Chronicle" is a good newspaper.
L133609 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ People are going to know who's responsible.  And they're going to get the news - the true news - quickly and simply and entertainingly.  And no special interests will be allowed to interfere with the truth of that news.
L133608 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ That's the second sentence you've started with "I" -
L133602 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ What're you going to do, Charlie?
L133601 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ I've changed the front page a little, Mr. Bernstein.  That's not enough - There's something I've got to get into this paper besides pictures and print -  I've got to make the "New York Enquirer" as important to New York as the gas in that light.
L133597 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ A wasted day.
L133596 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ It's been a tough day.
L133595 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Tired?
L133567 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ What makes those fellows think that a newspaper is something rigid, something inflexible, that people are supposed to pay two cents for -
L133566 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Poor Mr. Carter!
L133875 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ I think it's beginning to dawn on Mr. Rogers that I mean what I say. With Mr. Rogers out of the way, Reilly, I think we may really begin to hope for a good government in this state.  Well, Mr. Bernstein?
L133874 +++$+++ u4513 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ REILLY +++$+++ Rogers isn't even pretending.  He isn't just scared anymore.  He's sick.  Frank Norris told me last night he hasn't known Rogers to be that worried in twenty-five years.
L133873 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ It does seem too good to be true, doesn't it, Mr. Bernstein?
L133863 +++$+++ u4513 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ REILLY +++$+++ It was for twenty-five thousand dollars.
L133862 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Oh, yes, the bonus.
L133861 +++$+++ u4513 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ REILLY +++$+++ You made it out to him last week after he left for Chicago.
L133860 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ What check?
L133859 +++$+++ u4513 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ REILLY +++$+++ Mr. Leland sent back that check.
L133858 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ We'll withdraw support completely. Anything else?
L133766 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ What do you mean by that?
L133765 +++$+++ u4513 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ REILLY +++$+++ Maybe we'd better wait for more word on the President's condition.
L133414 +++$+++ u4506 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE SR. +++$+++ Yes.
