L52576 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank.  He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.
L52575 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ What happened?
L52574 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Yes.
L52573 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Ten years ago.
L52572 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ It wasn't planned or premeditated. I swear.  Things happened beyond my control.  I understood; I saw where they were leading and I suppose that it just made sense.
L52571 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ I don't believe that.
L52570 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I don't know.  It just happened.  I was here ten years ago, I'm here now.  That's it.
L52569 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ What is it?  I don't like this at all.  What is going on here?
L52568 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ You killed him here?  In this city, outside that bank?
L52567 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Yes.
L52566 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ For Nicholai?
L52565 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Ten years ago, I sat there in that same hotel window, sweat pouring off of me waiting --
L52564 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I was.
L52563 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ You can't know for sure, how can you?  I mean, you're not him.
L52562 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I told you, he will.
L52561 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.
L52560 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ What?
L52559 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Except --
L52558 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I've been thinking about it for a long time.
L52557 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Sounds pretty well figured out.
L52556 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine.
L52555 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ We split the money?
L52554 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I'll be walking out of the bank, unarmed.  You'll have the gun and I'll drive the car.
L52553 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ You'll have the money.  How do I know that you won't --
L52552 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ If things go well, I don't have to. You'll already be in a rented car waiting for me.
L52551 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ And with the mikes, I'll tell you when he leaves the hotel and you'll tell me when he leaves the bank.
L52550 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ That's right.
L52549 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ That means you won't have a gun.
L52548 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ He can't.  The bank has an expensive security system; metal detectors and X-ray machines.
L52547 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ What?  What if he brings it with him?
L52546 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ He won't be able to.  He'll have to go inside.  He'll have to see with his own eyes, whether or not I am there.  If the bank closes, he won't know for sure.  He'll come.  I'm sure.  And when he does you'll go into the hotel, go upstairs and take the gun.
L52545 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Why won't he wait until the bank closes?
L52544 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ The sun will be low, almost dark, the air cool and the bank will almost be closed.  5:45.  5:50.  He will put the rifle down, he will get up and he will walk across the plaza to the bank.
L52543 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ It will take the entire day, but he will begin to doubt himself.  He will begin to believe that he missed me, that somehow I slipped by and am already on a plane to Europe.
L52542 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Aiiee.  More waiting?  I don't know if I like this plan.
L52541 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Then, we wait.
L52540 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Okay.  Then what?
L52539 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ You'll be here.  A restaurant.  A public place far enough away that he won't notice you, but with a good enough view you'll be able to see him when he moves inside.
L52538 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ No.  It would be amateur.  A risk. He'll wait for the prime shot, that he knows is coming.  Once I'm inside, he'll move to the hotel. He'll go up the back, too much traffic in the front.
L52537 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ But he won't shoot you right then?
L52536 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ He will be hidden somewhere out here, probably somewhere low, in the crowd.  He'll stay there until he sees me enter the bank.
L52535 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Check.
L52534 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ This is the bank.  This is the hotel.  In the morning I will enter the bank.
L52533 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Fine.
L52532 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ It's too late now.  Okay?  We'll have to deal with these.
L52531 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ They saw you coming a mile away.  If I had known we'd be using --
L52530 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I paid a lot for these.
L52529 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Cheap as shit.
L52528 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Transmits and receives.
L52527 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Two way?
L52516 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ You should.  It's very important, that the body release the energy that builds in it.
L52515 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ I've always wanted to learn something like that.
L52514 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Thank you.
L52513 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Not that I would know, but you look like you're really good at it.
L52512 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Taiwan.
L52511 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Where did you learn it?
L52508 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ The beach?  It was nice.
L52507 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ How was the beach?
L52506 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Sorry.
L52505 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ You should knock.
L52504 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Book.  Sunglasses.  Great.
L52503 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ He won't be looking for you.  Just be careful.  Buy a book.  Keep your sunglasses on.
L52502 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Really?
L52501 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Okay.
L52500 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ I know what you are thinking.  I'm not going to disappear, okay?  I'm not going anywhere, just down there, to that beautiful beach.  I got to get out of this room, just for a little while.
L52499 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Why don't you bring it out here? It's beautiful out here.
L52498 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Breakfast.
L52496 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I don't know... But I'm sure he's not sleeping.
L52495 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ What do you think he's doing?
L52494 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Yes.
L52493 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ In Costa Blanca.
L52492 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Here?
L52491 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Do you think he's here?
L52489 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ You can have the bed.  The chair is fine for me.
L52488 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ I'm kind of tired.  I think I'd like to try and get some sleep.
L52487 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ That sounds nice.
L52486 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I don't know... maybe I'll live on a boat, sail to all the places I've never been.
L52485 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ What will you do if this works, if we get the money?
L52483 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ What happens if you do?
L52482 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ No.
L52481 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Not even a stalemate?
L52480 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ No.
L52479 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ But you've never figured out a way to win.
L52478 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Yes.
L52477 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Do you think about the game?
L52476 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Work.  The things I need to get done.
L52475 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Oh.  What do you think about?
L52474 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ It helps me to focus.  It centers me, helps me think.
L52473 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Why not?
L52472 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ No.
L52466 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I wasn't expecting this.  I need to think.
L52465 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ What?
L52464 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ That's where he'll be.
L52454 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ You were there?
L52453 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I don't know.
L52452 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ I've never been to the Gulf of Mexico.  Is it as nice as they say?
L52451 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Nothing.
L52450 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ About?
L52449 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Thinking.
L52448 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Hey, where are you?
L52445 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Mexico.
L52444 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Where is it?
L52443 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Good.
L52442 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Several.
L52441 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Do you have a passport?
L52437 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I don't.
L52436 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ You said you didn't trust it.
L52435 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ It.  Tell it.  For all I know it could be a machine.
L52411 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ No.  Something honest.
L52410 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Is that what you wanted to hear? Something cold blooded... something remorseless...
L52407 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Does that mean it didn't bother you?
L52406 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ This is fiction!  Don't you see that?  This is another reality.  And the people that come into the world to play this game -- nobody forces them!  They're here, they know the rules, the stakes, the risks!  Do you understand what I am saying?  No one is innocent -- including you!
L52405 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ That's fiction.
L52404 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Did it ever bother James Bond?
L52403 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Did it ever bother you?
L52402 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ They become complicated... messy.
L52401 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ After that?
L52400 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ No.  Just the first one.
L52399 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Are they usually like that?
L52398 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ It was... mechanical.  Very precise. It was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline.
L52397 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Because I want to know.
L52396 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Why?
L52395 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Yes.
L52394 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ My first take?
L52393 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Tell me about the first time.
L52392 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ The only thing different about the private sector is that a General Contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money.  Then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets.
L52391 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Then you went freelance?
L52390 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Yes.  It didn't matter much to them as long as I disappeared.
L52389 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ They tried to kill you?
L52388 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ The same reason everyone does.  You hear your name on C-SPAN and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you.
L52387 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Why did you leave the Agency?
L52386 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Because you are a women.
L52385 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Why?
L52384 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women.
L52383 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Why not?
L52382 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Women?  No... not really.
L52381 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ The exotic women.
L52380 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive.  The training, the weapons, the travel --
L52379 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Ahhhh...
L52378 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Of course.  I was going to be James Bond.
L52377 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ But you knew what they were training you for?
L52376 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ No, they didn't.
L52375 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ They didn't give you a choice, did they?
L52374 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ No.  I graduated from George Washington University.  Then I entered the Agency training program.
L52373 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ You went from high school to the Agency?
L52372 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I was just different.
L52371 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Why not?
L52370 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Some people said that.  I never thought so.
L52369 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ You were like a boy genius?
L52368 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Languages.  I was already fluent in nine languages.
L52367 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Jesus -- why?
L52366 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ They recruited me when I was in high school.
L52365 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ How old were you?
L52364 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ More or less.
L52363 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ The C.I.A.?
L52362 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
L52361 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ How did you get into the business?
L52360 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Yes.  As soon as you get into this business, all you can think about is getting to the top.  That's all there is.  Until then, there is nothing.  You are nothing.
L52359 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Where you wanted to be?
L52358 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Because that's how it works.  That's what it's about.  He was the best. He was on top.
L52357 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Why?
L52356 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I killed him.
L52354 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ He was killed.
L52353 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ He was... taken.
L52352 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Why didn't you finish this game?
L52351 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ We played with a code using <u>The New</u> <u>York Times</u> obituaries.  Over three years we played twelve matches.  I never won.
L52350 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ It looks like white's game.
L52348 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ He was Russian.  Nicholai Tachlinkov.  A legend in the business when I was just starting. I admired him.  When I heard he loved chess I became obsessed with the game.
L52347 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Had?
L52345 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Better than playing with yourself.
L52344 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ It's not the same, is it?
L52343 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ With computers.
L52341 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ This is crazy.  I can't trust you. You can't trust me.  How can we possibly help each other?
L52340 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Because I'm done.
L52339 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Why?
L52338 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ No.
L52337 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ If Bain hadn't taken the contract on me, would you have?
L52336 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ What do you want to know?
L52335 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ What I'm trying to say is that -- I'm not sure I can do this, help you, unless I know more about you.
L52334 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ No.  Just Electra.
L52333 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ As in daughter of Agamemnon?
L52332 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Yeah.
L52331 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Just Electra?
L52330 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Electra.
L52329 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Rath.  Robert Rath.
L52328 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Listen -- I don't even know your name.
L52323 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ He will know everything about you. Everything.  I know, because I've done it.  Once you've been inside a mark's home, you're in their head. If you're any good, you'll find the mark in a week, and Bain is good because I was the best and I couldn't take him.

L52321 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Right now, as we sit here, he is tearing through your apartment.  He is digging through your drawers, emptying your closets.  He will take your telephone and address books, your appointment books.  If you keep a diary, he is reading it.  He'll go into the kitchen and find out what kind of food you eat, liquor you drink, cigarettes you smoke.  In the bathroom he will find any prescription drugs you take and where you get them filled.  If you have video tape or recordings he will watch and listen to all of them.
L52320 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ How?
L52319 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ No.  It's the truth.  I know what you are.  Like me, like Bain, you're a ghost, you're not part of the real world.  You don't have a social security number.  You don't pay taxes.  You've probably used ten different names over the last ten years.  A long time ago something probably happened, something illegal and you ran, you disappeared and it was easy.  You think you can do it again.  But I'm telling you, fading from the law is nothing.  No matter what you do, where you go, I swear to you that Bain will find you.
L52318 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ You don't know that -- you're trying to scare me.
L52317 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Because he took a contract on you. He'll come for you and he'll find you.
L52316 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Why?
L52315 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ If you walk out that door, Bain will still come after you.
L52314 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ Then you can have the disks and I'll just walk out that door --
L52313 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ This is something that is never going to end.  You can never work in the business again with this contract, because he will find you. To survive, you have to go into deep hiding.  And that's going to take money, a lot of money.
L52312 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ I don't need the money.
L52311 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ If it hadn't been for me, you would be dead.
L52310 +++$+++ u3794 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ ELECTRA +++$+++ I don't need you to get the money -- my money!
