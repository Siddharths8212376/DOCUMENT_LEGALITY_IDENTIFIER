L315837 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Baby, I'm sorry. I feel terrible. I'd stay and talk but I'm so late. Look, don't be upset. We'll talk when I get home. See you around midnight.  Bye. And don't brood. Watch T.V. or something.
L315836 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ I don't believe this.
L315835 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ I don't know. That's all he said. He wasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He said your buddies backed down. They chickened out, he said.
L315834 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ What's he talking about?
L315833 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ He said you didn't have one.
L315832 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ What? What do you mean?
L315831 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ He didn't give me a chance.  Look, honey, don't get upset, but he's not taking your case.
L315830 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Why didn't you call me?
L315829 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ While you were in the shower.
L315828 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ He did? When?
L315827 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ I put a frozen dinner in the oven, a Manhandler. It'll be ready at a quarter of. I threw a little salad together. It's in the fridge. I also bought some apple juice, Red Cheek. Don't drink it all. Oh, and Jake, your lawyer called.
L315826 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ In a way. At least now I have some idea of what was happening. If we can only get them to admit ... to explain what they did ... I don't know. Maybe it'd clear things up in my head. I'll tell you something, Jez, honestly ... I thought they were real.
L315825 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ How come? The army?
L315824 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ You know what? I feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone.
L315823 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Remember that.
L315822 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Underneath all the bullshit, just love.
L315821 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ I know.
L315820 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ I love you, Jez.
L315819 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ We're all angels, you know ...  ... and devils. It's just what you choose to see.
L315818 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ With wings. You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.
L315817 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ So tell me ... am I still an angel?
L315664 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ You are the most unbelievable woman I have ever met. One second you're a screaming banshee and the next you're Florence Nightingale. Who are you? That's what I want to know. Will the real Jezzie Pipkin please stand up.
L315663 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Look, I'm horny. Keep it in mind.  Love me a little?
L315660 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ What?
L315659 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ You know, you really ought to get out today. You can't just sit around like this all the time. It's not healthy. It's not good for your mind. Go take a walk, or somethin'. Go to a movie. Christ, who's gonna know? You think I care? I don't give a shit. Go. Enjoy yourself. One of us should be having a good time.  Hello! Anybody home?  Anybody in there?
L315658 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ You're right here, Jake. You just rest.  The doctor said you had a virus. That's what they say when they don't know what it is. You can't do anything for a week. He says you gotta recuperate.  Now you just lie here. Mrs. Sandelman made you some chicken soup. It'll warm you up.
L315657 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Are we in Brooklyn?
L315656 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ You're here. Home. The doctor said you're lucky your brains didn't boil.  What a night, Jake. It was crazy. You kept sayin' "Sarah, close the window," over and over. And talkin' to your kids. Even the dead one. Weird. You know you melted 200 pounds of ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh?
L315655 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Am I home?
L315654 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Jake.  You're gonna be all right, Jake. You're gonna be fine.
L315596 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Here. I'll do it.
L315595 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Help me! Help me!
L315585 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Hey, I'm not dressed.
L315584 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Sam, Tony, come in here.
L315583 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Jezzie! My feet are throbbing!
L315582 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Lie down!
L315581 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Don't gimme that.
L315580 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ What kind of man are you?
L315579 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ I can't do it.
L315577 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ You're red hot, damn it. Get in there. I've got to get more ice.
L315576 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Look at me. I'm ice cold.
L315575 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ That's your decision.
L315574 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ You're out of your mind. I'm not getting in there. I'd rather die.
L315573 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Goddamn it. Get in here. I can't stand around waiting.
L315572 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Coming here?
L315571 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ He's coming right over.
L315570 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ That you'd die on the way to the hospital. Now get into that tub.
L315569 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ What'd the doctor say?
L315568 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Get your clothes off!
L315567 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ What are you talking about? I'm freezing.
L315566 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Get your clothes off.
L315565 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ What the hell are you doin'?
L315564 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ The numbers stop at 107.
L315563 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ How high is that?
L315562 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ It's gone to the top.
L315561 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ What does it say?
L315560 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ I don't believe this. I'm calling the doctor.
L315559 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ What's it say? A hundred and two?
L315550 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ If I could stop it, I'd stop it.
L315549 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Can't you stop it?
L315537 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Hey, I'm here.
L315536 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Show me Della!
L315535 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Why? What for?
L315534 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Where's Della? Bring her here?
L315533 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ What do you mean? Where do you think?
L315532 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Where?
L315531 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ We're at Della's.
L315530 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Where are we?
L315529 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Oh, come on. It's early.
L315528 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ I wanna leave. Get me out of here.
L315527 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ You okay?
L315461 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Come on. What were they, Jake?
L315460 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ They weren't human!
L315459 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the time.
L315458 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Those guys tried to kill me tonight. They were aiming right at me.
L315457 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Demons, Jake? Come on. They're winos and bag ladies. Low life. That's all they are. The streets are crawling with 'em. Don't make em into somethin' they're not.  It's the pressure, honey. That's all it is.
L315456 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ They're like demons, Jez.
L315455 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ New York is filled with creatures. Everywhere. And lots of stations are closed.
L315454 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ What does that have to do with anything? Does it explain the barricaded subway stations? Does it explain those Godforsaken creatures?
L315453 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ It's still there, Jake.  Even if you never say a word about it. You can't spend two years in Vietnam ...
L315451 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ It has nothin' to do with talkin'.
L315450 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ When was the last time I said a word?
L315449 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ 'Cause she's always on your mind.
L315448 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Why do you bring her up?
L315447 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Maybe it's all the pressure, Jake. The money. Things like that. Or your wife.
L315402 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ I enjoy crushing into you.
L315401 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ I'll be glad to avoid the crush.
L315400 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Well, I'll miss riding home with you. I was looking forward to it.
L315399 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Now? What about the boss? He's not gonna like it.
L315398 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ I don't know. One of these days, I'm gonna see Louis. My back's killing me.
L315397 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ What's wrong?
L315396 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ I'm going home.
L315395 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ How's it going?
L315394 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Jake!
L315374 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Just gettin' rid of the garbage.
L315373 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Ready?
L315370 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ I just want to look ...
L315369 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ I don't like things that make you cry.
L315368 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Wait. Don't.
L315366 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Gabe.
L315365 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Is that the one who died?
L315363 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Well, you didn't marry her.
L315362 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Not to me.
L315361 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ She looked good then.
L315360 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Look at her face. A real bitch.
L315359 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ What do you mean you can see?
L315358 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Why you left.
L315357 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ What?
L315356 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ That's Sarah?  I can see what you mean.
L315355 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Here. Look. This is me and Sarah when I was still at City College.
L315354 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Lemme see.
L315353 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Look at these, will ya? I don't believe it. Jesus, these are fantastic. Look, here's my Dad ... And here's my brother, when we were down in Florida.
L315352 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Pictures. Your wife was gonna toss 'em so "what's his name" brought 'em over on his way to school.
L315351 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ What's in here?
L315350 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Jake, you are never out of your head!
L315349 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ I must have been out of my head.
L315348 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ The best.
L315347 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ And look what I got.
L315346 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ A good lay.
L315345 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Yeah, but for what?
L315344 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me.
L315343 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ You're a real heathen, you know that, Jezzie? Jesus, how did I ever get involved with such a ninny?
L315342 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ I don't let anybody call me that.
L315341 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
L315340 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Well, personally, I never went for church names.
L315339 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ They're Biblical. They were prophets.
L315338 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ They're weird names.
L315337 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Eli. Why can't you remember their names?
L315336 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ No. The little one.
L315335 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Who? Jed?
L315334 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Your kid dropped it off.
L315333 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Thanks.  What's that?
L315332 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Maybe you left 'em in the bathroom.
L315331 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Jezzie, I can't see.
L315330 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Did you look around the headboard?
L315329 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ I don't know.
L315328 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Where'd you leave 'em?
L315327 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ No. Have you seen my glasses?
L315326 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ You up?
L315324 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Don't ask.
L315323 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ What happened to you?
L315322 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time.
L315321 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late?
L315320 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
L315319 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ The room!
L315318 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ What do you mean?
L315317 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ What do you think?
L315316 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Thanks.
L315315 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ That help?
L315314 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Where to?
L315313 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ I moved the couch. That's all.
L315312 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ If I knew I wouldn't have to ask. What did you do? I was happy the way it was.
L315311 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Where are you?
L315310 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Where is the lamp?
L315309 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Gee, thanks a lot.
L315308 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ I didn't want to wake you.
L315307 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Why didn't you turn on the light?
L315306 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ What the hell did you do, move all the furniture?
L315305 +++$+++ u1614 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JEZZIE +++$+++ Jake, is that you?
L316107 +++$+++ u1617 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Save the words ... Just send back my credit card.
L316106 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ I don't know what to say.
L316105 +++$+++ u1617 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ What? You want the Plaza? Don't be foolish. Here. Take this, too.  This is my place on Prince Street. It's got my phone, everything. Call if you need me ... but you won't. Everything's gonna work out. You just get outta town as fast as you can. The New York police can be effective when they want to be.
L316104 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ No. I couldn't.
L316103 +++$+++ u1617 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Here. I've got every credit card ever printed. Take this. Stay here till you can arrange to get away. It's on me.
L316101 +++$+++ u1617 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I'm sure. You've got nothing but troubles waitin' for you here.
L316100 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ I would have stayed there if I could.
L316099 +++$+++ u1617 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Glorious. I'm not surprised. I fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven. I'm just glad you came back.
L316098 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Mike, it was real. It was glorious.
L316097 +++$+++ u1617 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Well that's good to know.
L316096 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ It was paradise, Michael. You showed it to me. You were there.
L316095 +++$+++ u1617 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Better living through chemistry, that's my motto.
L316094 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ I don't believe this. It's a miracle, Michael. A miracle.
L316093 +++$+++ u1617 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ And no more demons. I told you they'd be gone.
L316087 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ What's happening? Help me.
L316086 +++$+++ u1617 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Just relax.
L316085 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ I can't move.
L316084 +++$+++ u1617 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Pleasant dreams.
L316083 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ I think I'm falling asleep.
L316082 +++$+++ u1617 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ It's strong stuff.
L316081 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ One drop?
L316080 +++$+++ u1617 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ "Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil," but no one ever said I wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh?  Stick out your tongue.  That'a boy. Now why don't you just lie down and relax.
L316079 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ I don't know.
L316078 +++$+++ u1617 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your head. Come on.
L316077 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ What is it?
L316076 +++$+++ u1617 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I'd hoped I'd never have to. Just open your mouth and stick out your tongue.
L316075 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Never?
L316074 +++$+++ u1617 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I came up with the formula back in Nam but I never got a chance to use it.
L316073 +++$+++ u1617 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Hey, I'm not the problem. You've got bigger problems than me.
L316072 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ How do I know this isn't just some kind of, you know, seduction or something?
L316071 +++$+++ u1617 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Sometimes. When it's convenient.
L316070 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ You come here often?
L316069 +++$+++ u1617 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Because I can get rid of the demons. I can block the Ladder. I have an antidote. We can kill them off, chemically speaking. They'll all disappear. It's chemistry, my friend. I know. I created it. Come with me. I can help.
L316068 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ So why tell me now?
L316067 +++$+++ u1617 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ The truth can kill, my friend. Five hundred men died out there. This isn't a story they'd ever want out. When Paul's car blew up I realized the scope of the thing. I knew they meant business.
L316066 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ If you knew, why didn't you say anything?
L316065 +++$+++ u1617 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I always suspected the effects might come back. That's why I had to follow you. I had a hell of a time getting hold of your records.
L316061 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Who then?
L316060 +++$+++ u1617 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Yeah. But not with the Cong.
L316059 +++$+++ u1612 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ But there was an attack. I can still see them coming. There was a fight, wasn't there?
L316058 +++$+++ u1617 +++$+++ m106 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ A couple of days later. It was fierce. You guys never saw it.
