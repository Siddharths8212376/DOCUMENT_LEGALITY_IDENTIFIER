L45123 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ You're scaring me. I think we should just go.
L45122 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ It isn't a broadcast studio. It's -- a surveillance post or something. That's why they have the dishes on top.
L45120 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Nobody does work like this on-line. It's in your PC, or in a mainframe. Self-contained. They'd have to be, like, watching people. Physically.  Oh Jesus.
L45119 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ They hack into people's programs?
L45118 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says "Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?" It's like they know what every kid's doing.
L45117 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.
L45116 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.
L45115 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Are you saying you think they had something to do with his death? Nelson said it was an airtight case.
L45076 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ It was a hate crime.
L45075 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ What're you -- what?
L45074 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Teddy was killed last night.
L45073 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ What!
L45026 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ You're right. It's -- a working relationship. Don't know what I was expecting.
L45025 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I mean, if one little comment from Gary is gonna upset you this much --
L45024 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ What's extreme is what that ER doctor said when he pumped your stomach. Eat another sesame seed and that's it.
L45023 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Isn't that -- extreme?
L45022 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
L45021 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I know, I know.
L45020 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ He's your boss. He's not your --
L45017 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ That's what I'm asking myself. Does he have some genius stowed away? Why not let him write Skywire.  'Not saying it makes sense.
L45016 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
L45015 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly.
L45014 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ He gave me some new code-fixes this morning. I said, "Did you really do this just today?" Cause I was impressed. He said "What're you implying?"
L45013 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.
L45012 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ To our new life.  ...What's wrong?
L44952 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Milo! What about --?
L44951 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ You know he's never been anybody's counselor before?
L44898 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ We're not gonna let it.
L44897 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ That took some fun out of --
L44879 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Prob'ly waiting by the phone for Outpost to call. We'll leave it for him?
L44878 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ When's Brian coming for the TV?
L44875 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ You saved my life in alot of ways.
L44874 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
L44873 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --
L44872 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ No way. You have this -- destiny.
L44871 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.
L44870 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Didn't you visit the campus?
L44869 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ ...But?
L44868 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I think that's great, Milo. I do.
L44867 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ If my dad'd leveled with me like that even once... The weird thing is, my fantasy he could somehow be like the old Gary? It's his fantasy, too.
L44826 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high?
L44825 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ When I was a kid? And he was moving us all over the place? I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest.
L44824 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Bully? Are we talking about Gary Boyd? Or your dad.
L44823 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
L44822 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ It's important.
L44821 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Then you've gotta ask him about that.
L44820 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ A lot of what Larry says is true. They just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they --
L44819 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ C'mon, how often do you talk to somebody who's been on the cover of Time. Three of four times.
L44818 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I think I kind of lost it. I was just so thrilled to be talking to the richest, most powerful... 'Didn't know I even cared about that stuff.
L45267 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ I don't think he knows how.
L45266 +++$+++ u355 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ He wasn't acting?
L45265 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ He said it made sense that Gary's code was like Teddy's, that that cliché about great minds was true. Said it was all about his own guilt.  Plus, he has a tendency to get Gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while. It always passes.
L45218 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Prick.
L45217 +++$+++ u355 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.
L45216 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
L45215 +++$+++ u355 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ That'll be a test, won't it?
L45214 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ He'll tell me when he gets home.
L45213 +++$+++ u355 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ Not like him, is it? To do a thing like that without telling you. You're not losing your hold on him, are you?
L45212 +++$+++ u344 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ ALICE +++$+++ No.
L45211 +++$+++ u355 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ PHIL +++$+++ 'Didn't mention he was going to the Justice Department?
L45210 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Yes sir.
L45209 +++$+++ u345 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ And Outpost? You're happy there?
L45208 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ 'Just didn't know who else to talk to.
L45207 +++$+++ u345 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area.
L45206 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.
L45205 +++$+++ u345 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.
L45204 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?
L45203 +++$+++ u345 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ My goodness.
L45202 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed in Silicon Valley.
L45201 +++$+++ u345 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Milo?
L45200 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I am. I am, sir.
L45199 +++$+++ u345 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ What seems to be the problem? You look a little upset.
L45198 +++$+++ u345 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Have a seat.
L45197 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.
L45196 +++$+++ u345 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Milo?
L45194 +++$+++ u345 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Give me two seconds with Lacy here?  Go on in, I won't be a moment.
L45193 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Yes sir. I need to talk to you.
L45192 +++$+++ u345 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ ...It's -- Milo, isn't it?
L45191 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Mr. Barton, do you remember me?
L44895 +++$+++ u345 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Like I said: shot in the dark.
L44894 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something...
L44893 +++$+++ u345 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark, here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do.
L44892 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Right... What's that mean again?
L44891 +++$+++ u345 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Don't worry, Milo. I'm here as a friend. Or maybe a supplicant.
L45563 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ You should've called a few times to bug me about your job prospects.
L45562 +++$+++ u346 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ ...When did you know?
L45551 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ He's working backwards, too.  Let's do number five?
L45550 +++$+++ u346 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ What?!
L45525 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Is it your dish?
L45524 +++$+++ u346 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Is it your software?
L45520 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Gimme the coordinates?
L45519 +++$+++ u346 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ You're interfaced with our dish.
L45507 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Wanna be a part of history?
L45506 +++$+++ u346 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ What?!
L45505 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door --
L45504 +++$+++ u346 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Okay.
L45503 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ What'd they ever do for you?
L45502 +++$+++ u346 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ What?
L45501 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ No. But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this. We're gonna bring down Outpost.
L45500 +++$+++ u346 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Will I get to work for Outpost?
L45499 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Brian! You wanna be a big deal, don't you? That's your dream in life.
L45498 +++$+++ u346 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ You can't pre-empt Yoga, that's our biggest show.
L45497 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ This is the biggest Beta demo in like the history of software. You'd be my partner.
L45047 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ 'Forgot to introduce you.  I have a girlfriend.
L45046 +++$+++ u346 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Well I parked illegally. See y'later?
L45045 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Sure, I'll see what I can do.
L45044 +++$+++ u346 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ 'Thought if I relocated it could help my case. I'm writing programs for the local public access station. Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show? God, does it suck.  Can you help me?
L45043 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ You're living here?
L45609 +++$+++ u347 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ CYBER PUNDIT +++$+++ You better believe everybody's trying to sign him up.
L45608 +++$+++ u351 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LARRY KING +++$+++ We tried!
L45607 +++$+++ u347 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ CYBER PUNDIT +++$+++ Milo. Surprised he's not your guest.
L45606 +++$+++ u351 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LARRY KING +++$+++ And the kid who wrote Skywire -- then gave it away? They're calling him the digital Robin Hood.
L45605 +++$+++ u347 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ CYBER PUNDIT +++$+++ Stigma? Larry! 60 billion buys you some slack in this world.
L45604 +++$+++ u351 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LARRY KING +++$+++ Isn't there a stigma? Bankrolling this guy?
L45603 +++$+++ u347 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ CYBER PUNDIT +++$+++ There's no hard evidence he knew about this. Anybody who could implicate him seems to've vanished.
L45602 +++$+++ u351 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LARRY KING +++$+++ That'd change with a criminal indictment.
L45601 +++$+++ u347 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ CYBER PUNDIT +++$+++ Conglomerates're lined up to finance the launch of the remaining satellites. They'll pay him a huge premium to get on-line.
L45600 +++$+++ u351 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LARRY KING +++$+++ Outpost doesn't own em.
L45599 +++$+++ u347 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ CYBER PUNDIT +++$+++ Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.
L45598 +++$+++ u351 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ LARRY KING +++$+++ That's gotta kill him, right?
L44835 +++$+++ u348 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ I think they call him the "Houseman." 'Cause "guard" sounds too weird.
L44834 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Who's that?
L44830 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ He just likes to write code. He's bummed there's so much secrecy and competition, everybody trying to own everything.
L44829 +++$+++ u348 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ We could move 'em up here.
L44828 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ He's pretty tight with his family.
L44827 +++$+++ u348 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ 'Couldn't convince Teddy to come?
L44804 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Oh hi.
L44803 +++$+++ u348 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ DANNY +++$+++ Milo? I'm Danny.
L45419 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ I do know. You focus on the big problem. But somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. Something gets destroyed. At first it's upsetting. You feel you've lost control.
L45418 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software.
L45416 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I thought I was coming here for a job. But it's meant a lot more.
L45415 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just because of what you're doing. Because of who you are.
L45414 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ You see what's hanging on the wall?
L45413 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Gary, I --
L45409 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Oh, that's right. You're "clueless."
L45408 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
L45407 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ You could've handwritten it.
L45406 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I couldn't do it at work cause of security or at home for -- obvious reasons.
L45405 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ "Dear Lisa. I've enjoyed working with you. I'd be lying if I didn't say I find you attractive. But in my heart I know that Alice..."  You left my party to send E-mail?
L45374 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ 'Sorry about the late notice...
L45373 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ That's great! Thanks.
L45296 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Don't be so hard on yourself. With a brain like yours, you could connive with the best of 'em I bet.
L45295 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Cause he was a liar. And I hated him.  "Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world." The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him --  Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one.
L45294 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ ...Worse?
L45293 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ No. I just went deeper into the machine. Preferred being the geek to having to explain. Lying would've been worse.
L45292 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ What would you tell the kids? At your new school? You had to come up with a good story, right?
L45291 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ ...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious.  His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again.
L45290 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid.
L45289 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Sure.
L45288 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ 'Have a look?
L45287 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I'm okay. It's going well!
L45286 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ You look a little tired.
L45285 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Gary, hi.
L45111 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ The answer's not in the box. It's in the band.
L45110 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ The wrong place?
L45109 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. And it came over me: it's in the wrong place.
L45108 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ 34,000. But they're real short lines. 'Just came out that way.
L45107 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of code there...
L45104 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ It helps. Alice said it would help. To focus on something.  'Don't know what I'd do without her.
L45103 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ You've been coming in early.
L45102 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Oh. Yeah.
L45101 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ I meant did you find other stuff to --
L45100 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Talk about work? Never!
L45099 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Did you?
L45098 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure.
L45097 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Had you talked to him much lately?
L45096 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Were the flags for Teddy?
L45095 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ I heard what happened.
L45010 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Definitely.
L45009 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ It scales, don't you think?
L45008 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ The purpose of this company isn't to destroy our competitors any more than the purpose of living is to breath. But the software business is binary: you're a zero or a one. Being obsessive isn't a crime. It's a character trait.
L45007 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I'm sure.
L45006 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Everything I do is under scrutiny. The questions they ask, trying to make anything strategic look sordid.  I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in business try to get ahead?
L45005 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Nothing!
L45004 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ What're you implying.
L45003 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ You really wrote this just today?
L45002 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Right... Right.
L45001 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Well -- you sent for me.
L45000 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Milo. What's up?
L44972 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ You're making me young again.
L44971 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ You did this -- overnight?
L44970 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Take a look at this. Slightly different approach.
L44969 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ It's okay. Really.
L44967 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Too fast? At least four companies're on the verge of workable convergence systems, Milo, they --
L44966 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Maybe I'm going too fast.
L44965 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ How's it going?
L44949 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Don't spend too much time searching. You ever vetted somebody's old code before?  It's a different skill. Stay close to the surface. The best-hidden secrets are in plain sight. You know the best place to hide a leaf, right?  In a tree.
L44948 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ Could work with a new switch. There may be a few more things hidden.
L44942 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ That's what I told her. My wife.
L44941 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
L44940 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.
L44939 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ ...Do I?
L44938 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ 'Think I should buy some originals?
L44937 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Okay. I'm Gary.
L44936 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ No! Just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself.
L44866 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ Yeah? I wanna feel like I did when I wrote that. But I'm 42, that's 100 in cyber-years. I look at you and see the things that got me here.  But somehow got away.
L44865 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ I do!
L44864 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ When you get to a certain age, you start wondering. About your legacy. I doubt you even remember Outpost 1.0 --
L44860 +++$+++ u349 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ GARY +++$+++ You'd have to start practically from scratch. But this is all you'd be working on. No marketing meetings, no product seminars. We can't waste the time. Half the Valley's working on convergence. So're media conglomerates, cable companies, phone companies. 'Can't finish second, Milo. There is no second... Now what would you like to ask me?
L44859 +++$+++ u354 +++$+++ m21 +++$+++ MILO +++$+++ It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?
