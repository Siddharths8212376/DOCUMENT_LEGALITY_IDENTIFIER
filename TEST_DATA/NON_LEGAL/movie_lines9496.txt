L653829 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ And?
L653828 +++$+++ u3489 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ PACE +++$+++ Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama talkin'.
L653827 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Course he ain't never killed nobody. Why'd you say that, Pace?
L653826 +++$+++ u3489 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ PACE +++$+++ My daddy ain't never killed nobody, has he, mama?
L653825 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Like you, sweetheart. You and your daddy got the same mouth, eyes, ears, and nose. Only difference is your color hair is like mine.
L653824 +++$+++ u3489 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ PACE +++$+++ I still ain't sure what my daddy looks like.
L653822 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Why, Pace Roscoe Ripley, ain't you got one cute mouth tonight?
L653821 +++$+++ u3489 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ PACE +++$+++ You ain't actin', mama.
L653820 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Nothin', honey.  Mama's just actin' strange.
L653819 +++$+++ u3489 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ PACE +++$+++ What I made you do, mama?
L653818 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Damn it, child! Now look what you made me do.
L653817 +++$+++ u3489 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ PACE +++$+++ How'll he know what we look like? He seen our photo?
L653816 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Don't give me no trouble now, Pace, please. This ain't the easiest day in a long time. And what do you mean how are we gonna know what your daddy looks like? You seen his photo.
L653870 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ SAILOR!!!!
L653869 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ LULA!!!!
L653855 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ What makes sense, is all.
L653854 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ How can you say that, Sailor?
L653853 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ He ain't never known me, Lula, so there ain't much for him to forget. Not seein' each other for six years makes it next best to simple for us, too.
L653852 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ What're you talkin' about? That's your son in there.
L653851 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ It's a mistake, honey. You two go on. I'll walk back to the depot.
L653850 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Really, Sail, I'll be okay.
L653849 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Boys frightened, Lula. This ain't no good.
L653848 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ I'm sorry, Sailor. I just can't help it. Give me a minute and I'll quit.
L653844 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Lead the way.
L653843 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ You hungry? Pace and I ain't had dinner yet.
L653841 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Shake hands with your daddy.
L653840 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ You must be my son.
L653748 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Thanks, darlin', I know you got my best interest in mind, and I 'preciate it sincerely. I love you, but I gotta sleep now.
L653747 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ That man's a black angel, Sailor. You hook up with him, you'll regret it. If you live to.
L653745 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Lula, he mighta did, I don't know. But it don't matter now. Lotta guys go outta control in a war and it ain't their fault.
L653744 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Was a massacre. Soldiers there murdered old folks, women and babies, and dumped 'em in a trench. Bobby Peru prob'ly killed the most.
L653743 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ What?
L653742 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Buddy told me about that thing at Cao Ben?
L653741 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Lula, I got to get some sleep.
L653740 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ He's the kind liked it.
L653739 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ That was in Vietnam.
L653738 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ That was a accident. I bet both our asses Bobby Peru done murdered all kinds of people, and meant it, too.
L653737 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didn't I?
L653736 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ He's a stone fuckin' criminal, honey, and you ain't.
L653735 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ What could I be up to, Lula?
L653734 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Who says I'm smart? You up to somethin' with Bobby Peru, Sailor?
L653732 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Rather be in El Paso than Big Tuna.
L653731 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ We got about forty bucks, sweetheart. That'd get us to El Paso.
L653730 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ I mean tomorrow.
L653729 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ We're goin' to, Lula, real soon.
L653728 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Let's leave here.
L653727 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Uh-huh?
L653726 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Sail?
L653725 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Went with Bobby.
L653724 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ So where'd you say you was?
L653723 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Oughta make 'em happy.
L653722 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Some... Sparky said Red's promised to have him and Buddy out of here by the weekend.
L653721 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ You talk to 'im some?...
L653720 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Yeah... He was lookin' for you.
L653719 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ And Bobby too, I hear...
L653718 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Buddy and Sparky come by earlier.
L653717 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ That smell's still fillin' this room good.
L653716 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Can't tell yet. Where'd you go?
L653715 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Few beers is all. Feelin' any better?
L653714 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ You been drinkin', huh?
L653621 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ I know this ain't easy, Lula, but I ain't gonna let things get no worse, I promise.
L653620 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ I know. Just I'm sorta uncomfortable about the way some things is goin', and this don't help soothe me.
L653619 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Love you, too.
L653618 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Really, Sailor, it ain't nothin' against you. I love you.
L653617 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Well, nothin' personal, but I ain't sure it's okay by me.
L653616 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ It's okay by me, peanut.
L653615 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Not that. Look at what I wrote down cause I can't say it.
L653614 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.
L653613 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Sailor? You know what?
L653612 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ No, I don't think so, Sail. I just need to lie down.
L653611 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Anything I can do for you?
L653609 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ I'll come along.
L653608 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Darlin', I still ain't feelin' so well. I'm goin' to bed.
L653573 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Come sit by me.
L653572 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Yeah?
L653571 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ A little, I think... Darlin'?
L653570 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ You sick?
L653569 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ I barfed. Tried to make it to the bathroom... Turned out it was the wrong door anyways... I sorta got it cleaned up.
L653568 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Maybe. Met a guy named Red, owns a garage, could have some work in about a week. Met a few hard luck boys who's stayin' here. What's that smell?
L653567 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ You find any work?
L653566 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ The only one.
L653565 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ That you, Sail, honey?
L653542 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Okay, honey, I'll see you later.
L653541 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ I'm gonna stay here in this room, Sailor. I don't feel so good? This heat makes me tired.
L653540 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ This ain't exactly my most thrillin' notion of startin' a new life.
L653539 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Yeah?
L653538 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Sailor?
L653537 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Let's get a sandwich and find out about some work.
L653536 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Now what?
L653535 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Fan works.
L653534 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ And no AC.
L653533 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ No radio or TV...
L653532 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Not bad for eleven dollars a day.
L653530 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Not quite as bad as the weather though... It must be a hundred and ten and it ain't even noon yet.
L653529 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Well, it ain't exactly Emerald City...
L653528 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Let's get outta here, honey.
L653527 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ She died right in front of me. Why'd she have to go and do that, Sailor?
L653525 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ I'm afraid she is, baby.
L653524 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ I can't take this, Sailor. She's dyin' right in front of our eyes...
L653520 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Don't know, but she's gonna bleed all over our car, I'll tell ya that...  Hey... Hello... Girl... You gotta come with us, honey.
L653519 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ You think she's gonna make it?
L653518 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Let's get ahold a' her quick.
L653516 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ I don't know, honey, but we gotta help that girl - get her to a town and hope no one catches on I broke parole.
L653515 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Sailor, what are we gonna do?
L653514 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ SAILOR!!!
L653513 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ One bad car accident...
L653512 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Oh God, Sailor.
L653511 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ I don't know... Looks like clothes.
L653510 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ What's that?
L653509 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ We'll be alright, peanut, long as we've got room to move.
L653508 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ I do trust you, Sailor. Like I ain't never trusted nobody before.
L653507 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Trust me on it.
L653506 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ If you say so.
L653505 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ There's worse places, honey.
L653504 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Well, we're really out in the middle of it now, ain't we?
L653503 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ It's a comfortin' idea.
L653502 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ I take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together.
L653501 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ They have, sugar.
L653500 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ My mama...  So Sailor, our histories have been somewhat intertwined.
L653499 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ I didn't want to say it... but I had a feelin' Santos was up to somethin' with your mama...
L653498 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ ...They was laughin' arm in arm like animals.
L653497 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ That night in the fire while my daddy was dyin'... I saw mama up in her room with Santos...
L653495 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ No, Sailor darlin'. Just shockin' sometimes when things aren't the way you thought they were... I been carryin' a secret too...
L653494 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ You upset with me?
L653493 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Yeah, I'm here.
L653492 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Lula, you there?
L653491 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Met him through Santos... Clyde - your daddy - had some sorta business deal with Santos.
L653490 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ How'd you know my daddy?
L653489 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ We all got a secret side, baby. Hope you don't think I been lyin' to you 'bout other things, sugar.
L653488 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ That's some big secret you been carryin', Sailor.
L653487 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ I know, sugar... But while the place was burnin'... Before Santos came out - I pitched some rocks at the second floor windows case anyone was upstairs sleepin'... Afterwards... When I met you, I always liked to think I mighta saved your life.
L653486 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ God, Sailor... That's the night my daddy died.
L653485 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ I quit workin' for 'im, but just before I did, I ended up one night at a house... I don't know what it is they all think I saw that night, but I was just sittin' out in the car till the whole place went up in flames.
L653484 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Oh shit...
L653483 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Yes I did... I sure did... The bad side of it is I did some drivin' for a man named Marcello Santos...
L653482 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ You knew my daddy?
L653481 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Well, there's a good side as well as a bad side to it... The good side is I knew your daddy, and I thought Clyde was a good ol' guy...
L653480 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ You're scarin' me, baby.
L653479 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Not exactly, sugar... One reason we're in all the trouble we're in right now is cause of what I was doin'... I tried to tell you this before...
L653478 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ I just figured you was out bein' Mr. Cool...
L653477 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ You know, Lula, I never told you what all I was doin' before I met you.
L653476 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Sure is a big deal round here... Alamo Road, Alamo Street, Alamo Square, Alamo Buildin', Alamo Alamo. They ain't forgettin' about it in a hurry. That's the thing 'bout memory? Some things you wish you could forget... What's troublin' you, sugar?
L653410 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ This ain't news, sweetheart. I hate to tell ya.
L653409 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ The world's gettin' worse, I think, Sailor. And it don't sound like there's much we can do about it, neither.
L653408 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ I can't take no more of this radio...  I ain't never heard so much concentrated weirdness in my life, Sailor Ripley, you find me some dancin' music right this minute... I MEAN IT!!
L653407 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ What's that, peanut?
L653390 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ That'd be good, Lula.
L653389 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ You want me to drive for a stretch? Give you a chance to rest.
L653388 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Not in Houston. We'd be better off in some place more out of the way.
L653387 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ You want to stick around here, Sailor? See if we can get some work?
L653386 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Under a hundred.
L653385 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ How much we got left, honey?
L653369 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Told you not to call your mama.
L653368 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin' your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp. How you figure I'm gonna feel?
L653367 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Honey, I'm sorry. It wasn't nothin'. Come on and get up and we'll take off.
L653366 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.
L653365 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ I was just wastin' time, peanut, till you come back.
L653340 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Pardon me? Y'all got a phone here I can use?
L653339 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ I ain't so sure it's a great idea, but that's up to you. Just don't tell her where we are.
L653338 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ I want to call her and tell her I'm okay. That we're okay.
L653337 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ More'n likely.
L653336 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Mama. I been thinkin' about her. She's prob'ly worried to death by now.
L653335 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ What's wrong, sweetheart? Somethin' botherin' you?
L653333 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ You think she's pretty?
L653332 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Honey, we bein' strangers here and all, this is the kinda place we don't want to make nothin' of nothin'.
L653331 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Well, she ain't talked to nobody and ain't nobody spoke to her that I could tell. What you make of that?
L653330 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Yeah.
L653329 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ You notice that woman when we come in? The white woman sittin' by herself?
L653328 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Uh huh.
L653327 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ I'll be damned if I'm leavin'. That band is too good?
L653320 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ We'll find out in a hurry.
L653319 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ You ready for this?
L653304 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Maybe there's a place we could hear some music. I feel like dancin'. We could ask someone.
L653303 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Hard to tell what's shakin' in a place like this, honey. You don't want to be walkin' in the wrong door.
L653302 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ I wouldn't mind a little night life. How about you?
L653274 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Do me a favor, Sailor? Don't pick up no more hitchers, okay?
L653273 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Just part of life on the road, peanut.
L653272 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ I know you're thinkin' that I got more'n some of my mama in me? Well, I couldn't help it. Sailor, I really couldn't. I'm sorry for that guy, but when he pulled that drippin' hunk of awful-smellin' meat out of his pocket? I near barfed. And them poor diseased puppies!
L653271 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ You don't feel you was a little hard on the guy, honey?
L653253 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ He's just a regular guy't needs help, honey. Look at him.
L653252 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Sure you wanna do this? Might be a way they could track us.
L653250 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Lula, darlin'... Makes no difference anyway... We're outta here.
L653249 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ He was sittin' there havin' a beignet at the Cafe Du Monde. Do you think he saw us?
L653248 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Who knows, baby?
L653247 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ You think he saw us?
L653242 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ I'm goin'.
L653241 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Never mind where... Get outta here... I mean it, Sailor.
L653240 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Where?
L653239 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Oh my God... It's Johnnie... Duck down!... Get goin'!
L653238 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ You do.
L653237 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Who do?
L653236 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Gotta hex from a voodoo?
L653235 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Let's get outta here... I suddenly got a funny feelin' about this place. Feelin' all that voodoo...
L653217 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ Well, I ain't upset about it, darlin'. Just give me an odd feelin' there a minute, is all.
L653216 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Sometimes dreams just don't mean nothin'... Stuff comes into your mind and you don't have no control over, you know? Anyways, dreams ain't no odder than real life. Sometimes not by half.
L653214 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ I know, peanut. But it wasn't all like you were so unhappy I was there, just you were upset. My bein' there was upsettin' to you. You had some kids there, little kids, and I guess you'd got married and your husband was comin' home any minute.
L653213 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Oh, baby, what an idea. I'd always be happy to see you, no matter what.
L653212 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ I know. I kept walkin', I headed for your house, only it wasn't your house, really. You let me in only you weren't real pleased to see me. You kept askin', 'Why'd you come to see me now? Why now?' Like it'd been a long time since we'd seen each other.
L653211 +++$+++ u3486 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ LULA +++$+++ Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay.
L653210 +++$+++ u3493 +++$+++ m229 +++$+++ SAILOR +++$+++ The water was rollin' off me. And I was dirty, too, like I hadn't had no bath in a long time, so the sweat was black almost.
