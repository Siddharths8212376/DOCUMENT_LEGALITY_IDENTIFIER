L442345 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Jack!
L442344 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Do you have any idea where you're going?
L442197 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ My name is Will Turner, the son of Bootstrap Bill Turner.  His blood runs in my veins.  You need my blood.  And on my word I will pull this trigger, and sink all the way down to Davy Jones' Locker!
L442196 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Will -- don't do anything stupid! Don't say anything stupid --
L442131 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'm sure.  When you've led the kind of life that I have, there are debts that must be paid.  Maybe I can balance the scales a little.
L442130 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Are you sure?  Jack -- this is not something you have to do.
L442129 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Go to the opposite end of the island, and signal the ship.  I'll keep 'em busy.
L442128 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'll lead them away.
L442127 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ No.
L442121 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ This way!
L442120 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Miss Swann!  We're here to rescue you!  It's going badly!
L442094 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ On whether the stories are all true.  If they are, that's a waterfall that spills over at high tide, with a short drop to an underground lagoon.  If not --
L442093 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ On what?
L442092 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Depends.
L442091 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ What's that?
L442082 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Barbossa.
L442081 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ But I survived.  And I still have that single shot.  It's meant for one man.  My mutinous first mate--
L442080 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ The pistol.  When a pirate is marooned, Will, he's given a pistol with a single shot.  No good for hunting, or surviving, really.  But after three weeks of starvation and thrist -- the option of that pistol begins to look good.
L442079 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Wait -- what about the pistol?
L442054 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ These are the only ones worth having.  And we're going to need them --
L442053 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Shut up, before you lose them all!
L442012 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Don't worry.  I've already got a Quartermaster -- there!
L442011 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Just do it quickly.
L442009 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Oh -- did I forget to mention that?
L442008 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Tortuga?
L442005 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Then that's not much incentive for me to fight fair, is it?
L442004 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You didn't beat me.  You ignored the rule of engagement.  In a fair fight, I'd kill you.
L442003 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Put it away, Will.  It's not worth getting beat again.
L442002 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ My father -- was not -- a pirate!
L442001 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Sure -- because he could always go pirating.
L442000 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.
L441999 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'
L441998 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ He was a merchant marine!  He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--
L441997 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
L441996 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ It's not true my father was a pirate.
L441995 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I swear, you look just like him.
L441994 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ That's not true.
L441993 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Good man.  Good pirate.  And clever -- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin.
L441992 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ 'Bootstrap?'
L441991 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I knew him.  Probably one of the few he knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill.
L441989 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ My father.  William Turner?
L441988 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Is that so?
L441987 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I worked passage from England as a cabin boy.  After my mother passed, I came out here ... looking for my father.
L441986 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ For a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats, you're a quick study.
L441919 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Aye!  Avast!
L441918 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Everybody stay calm.  We're taking over the ship!
L441917 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
L441916 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ This is either crazy, or brilliant.
L441915 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ So's breaking a man out of jail. Face it, Will: you may say you'll never be a pirate, but you're off to a rip-roaring start.  My advice -- smile and enjoy it.
L441914 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ It's still against the law.
L441913 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Commandeer.  We're going to commandeer a ship.  Nautical term.
L441912 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ We're going to steal a ship?  That ship?
L441910 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No worries there.  She's far more likely to rot out from under us.
L441909 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I haven't set foot off dry land since I was twelve, when the ship I was on exploded.  It's been a sound policy.
L441908 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Come aboard.
L441905 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Good.
L441904 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I'd die for her.
L441903 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ My business, Will.  As for your business -- one question, or there's no use going.  This girl -- what does she mean to you?  How far are you willing to go to save her?
L441902 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Why are brothering with that?
L441901 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ We need to go!
L441900 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Not without my effects.
L441898 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Agreed!
L441897 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Agreed.
L441893 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I helped build these cells.  Those are hook-and-ring hinges.  The proper application of strength, the door'll lift free.  Just calls for the right lever and fulcrum ...
L441892 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ How?  The key's run off.
L441891 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I can get you out of here.
L441890 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ So it is that you found a girl. Well, if you're intending to brave all and hasten to her rescue and so win fair lady's heart, you'll have to do it alone.  I see no profit in it for me.
L441889 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Never.  They took Miss Swann.
L441888 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ And you want to turn pirate yourself?
L441887 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Because you're a pirate.
L441886 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Why ask me?
L441885 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ The ship's real enough.  So its anchorage must be a real place. Where is it?
L441884 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
L441883 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Where does it make berth?
L441882 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Somewhat.
L441881 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Are you familiar with that ship? The Black Pearl?
L441783 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ No.  I can not just step aside and let you escape.
L441782 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Move!
L441781 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ No.
L441780 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Move away.
L441779 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Pirate.
L441778 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You cheated.
L441776 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You need to find yourself a girl.  Or maybe the reason you practice three hours a day is you've found one -- but can't get her?
L441775 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I do.  And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.
L441774 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Who makes all these?
L441769 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Only a little.
L441768 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You threatened Miss Swann.
L441767 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Do you think this is wise, boy? Crossing blades with a pirate?
L441766 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Ah.  Then it would be a shame to put a black mark on your record.  So if you'll excuse me ...
L441765 +++$+++ u2476 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
L441764 +++$+++ u2470 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?
L441874 +++$+++ u2472 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ MURTOGG +++$+++ Still --
L441873 +++$+++ u2471 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ MULLROY +++$+++ Mentioned it, is more what he did.
L441872 +++$+++ u2472 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ MURTOGG +++$+++ That Jack Sparrow ... he talked about the Black Pearl.
L441706 +++$+++ u2472 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ MURTOGG +++$+++ If he were telling truth he wouldn't have told us.
L441705 +++$+++ u2471 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ MULLROY +++$+++ He may be.
L441704 +++$+++ u2472 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ MURTOGG +++$+++ He's not telling the truth.
L441703 +++$+++ u2471 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ MULLROY +++$+++ I think he's telling the truth.
L441700 +++$+++ u2472 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ MURTOGG +++$+++ And no lies!
L441699 +++$+++ u2471 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ MULLROY +++$+++ What's your business in Port Royal, 'Mr. Smith'?
L441693 +++$+++ u2471 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ MULLROY +++$+++ Like I said, there's no real ship as can match -- Hey!
L441692 +++$+++ u2472 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ MURTOGG +++$+++ ... no.
L441691 +++$+++ u2471 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ MULLROY +++$+++ Oh, and no ship that's not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out could possibly have black sails and therefore couldn't possibly be any ship other than the Black Pearl.  Is that what you're saying?
L441690 +++$+++ u2472 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ MURTOGG +++$+++ But I've seen a ship with black sails.
L441689 +++$+++ u2471 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ MULLROY +++$+++ No.
L441688 +++$+++ u2472 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ MURTOGG +++$+++ ... No.
L441687 +++$+++ u2471 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ MULLROY +++$+++ You've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out?
L441686 +++$+++ u2472 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ MURTOGG +++$+++ Yes, I have.
L441685 +++$+++ u2471 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ MULLROY +++$+++ You haven't seen it.
L441684 +++$+++ u2472 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ MURTOGG +++$+++ Yes.
L441683 +++$+++ u2471 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ MULLROY +++$+++ You've seen the Black Pearl?
L441682 +++$+++ u2472 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ MURTOGG +++$+++ Yes.
L441681 +++$+++ u2471 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ MULLROY +++$+++ You've seen it?
L441680 +++$+++ u2472 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ MURTOGG +++$+++ Yes it is.  I've seen it.
L441679 +++$+++ u2471 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ MULLROY +++$+++ No, it's not.
L441678 +++$+++ u2472 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ MURTOGG +++$+++ The Black Pearl is a real ship.
L441677 +++$+++ u2471 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ MULLROY +++$+++ There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.
L441938 +++$+++ u2475 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ SWANN +++$+++ Dammit, man, it appears someone is stealing your ship!
L441937 +++$+++ u2473 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ NORRINGTON +++$+++ Please.
L441936 +++$+++ u2475 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ SWANN +++$+++ But --
L441935 +++$+++ u2473 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ NORRINGTON +++$+++ A moment.
L441934 +++$+++ u2475 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ SWANN +++$+++ Commodore --
L441796 +++$+++ u2473 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ NORRINGTON +++$+++ Bleak.  Very bleak.
L441795 +++$+++ u2475 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ SWANN +++$+++ Well, she had a very taxing day... Ghastly weather tonight.
L441794 +++$+++ u2473 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ NORRINGTON +++$+++ No.  She hasn't.
L441793 +++$+++ u2475 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ SWANN +++$+++ Has my daughter given you an answer yet?
L441612 +++$+++ u2473 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ NORRINGTON +++$+++ An explosion in the powder magazine. Merchant vessels run heavily armed.
L441611 +++$+++ u2475 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ SWANN +++$+++ What happened here?
L441609 +++$+++ u2475 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ SWANN +++$+++ Where did he come from?
L441608 +++$+++ u2473 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ NORRINGTON +++$+++ He's still breathing.
L441599 +++$+++ u2473 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ NORRINGTON +++$+++ My apologies, Governor.
L441598 +++$+++ u2475 +++$+++ m159 +++$+++ SWANN +++$+++ Captain Norrington... I appreciate your fervor, but I am concerned about the effect this subject will have on my daughter.
L444537 +++$+++ u2483 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SIM +++$+++ No.  The captain of the containment crew is closing down the main lab. He says the area has got to be evacuated.
L444536 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ Have you found Dr. Bright?
L444535 +++$+++ u2483 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SIM +++$+++ Dr. Argon, everything's starting to come apart here.  You hired me to take care of these matters of security and I am trying, but elements are making my job impossible.
L444523 +++$+++ u2483 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SIM +++$+++ Dr. Bright has escaped.
L444522 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ Speak.
L444521 +++$+++ u2483 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SIM +++$+++ Look, I don't mean to rain on everyone's ascension here, but we got a little problem.
L444076 +++$+++ u2483 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SIM +++$+++ You got it, Dr. Argon.
L444075 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ Mr. Sim, when you do locate him.  Do not scare him off again.  Just watch him.  I think you can handle that. Right, Mr. Sim?
L443995 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ Until he's done.
L443994 +++$+++ u2483 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SIM +++$+++ How long do you leave him in there?
L444463 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ A light mixture of oxygen, dioxide, and sodium pentothal.  He'll sleep, that's all.
L444462 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ What did you use?
L444460 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ Do?  Well, I suppose that depends on you.
L444459 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ What are you going to do to him?
L444369 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ Susan, I sense you are having difficulty understanding the situation you are presently in.  I ask that you keep in mind that I am ready to reduce an entire city to gelatin to get what I want.
L444368 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I swear to you, Argon, if you don't stop the meltdown that nanobot will be the last one I ever build.
L444361 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ I look behind us, I look to the past, to a world steeped in rot and decay.  I think of the Acropolis in another century reduced to little more than dust.  I see the faces of Rushmore eventually losing all distinction, and then I look at this...
L444360 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ How do you know we're not heading in the wrong direction?
L444359 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ This is our world, Susan, and once you realize that, you will understand that the only place our path can end is on the throne of heaven.  Science is the quest for divine perfection.
L444358 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ Do you know what I see?  I see man making his own clouds.  I see man coloring his own sky, and like this garden it is a site that makes my heart sing.
L444357 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Pollution?
L444355 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ I ask you what is the purpose of science?  What is the point of all our relentless exploration, investigation and experimentation? It is to understand a single physical phenomenon, or to understand them all?  To cure one disease, or to cure every disease? If science is simply a means, what then is the end?
L444354 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ I suppose you are going to tell me where it is going.
L444353 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ I brought you up here, Dr. Bright, because I want you to understand that we are on the path.  The only difference is that you are walking with your head down, afraid to look up, to see where the path is going.
L444351 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Does that mean Oppenheimer loved the atomic bomb?
L444350 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ We will always love most that which we create.  Don't you agree, Susan?
L444342 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ You'll forgive me but all the excitement has left me extremely parched.  Poppy?
L444341 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ No, thank you.
L444340 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ Something to drink, Dr. Bright?
L444339 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ Come with me, Susan.  I want to show you something.
L444338 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ You can't mean that.
L444337 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ To be brutally honest with you, Susan, as long as the nanobot does to me what it did to that idiot O'Brien, I don't give a rat's ass about what happens after that.
L444336 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ But in another twenty-four hours the core meltdown will be beyond the stabilization period.  There will be no way to stop it.
L444335 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ Dr. Bright, I don't have to do anything.
L444306 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ No.
L444305 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ Mr. Sim I want you to return to Dr. Bright's.  I believe she is hiding something of ours there.
L444300 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ You don't have to give it to us because Dr. Nebbleman can just cut it out of him.
L444299 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ If you think I would ever give you the nanobot after this, you are deluding yourself.
L444298 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ Not anymore, Mr. O'Brien.  The nanobot has changed that.
L444285 +++$+++ u2484 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Dr. Argon, I demand an explanation.
L444284 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ Wheelchair accessible.
L444625 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ That's right.  And making me was the biggest mistake you ever made!
L444624 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ You can't do this!  You owe me, O'Brien.  I made you plastic!  I made you!
L444623 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Yeah, I'm going to finish what you started --
L444622 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ Please, O'Brien, don't do this to me!  I'll give you anything you want!
L444614 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ You think you can use me to stop the meltdown.
L444613 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ You mean besides kicking your ass?!
L444612 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ I know what you're doing.
L444600 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ The only history I'm gonna write is your obituary!
L444599 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ It remains to be seen who is the good guy and who is the bad guy. History is written by the victor.
L444598 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Oh no.  You're not like me.  In fact, I'm betting you're the same greedy, remorseless, egomaniacal bad guy you always were.
L444597 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ As you can see I am a new man, just like you.
L444596 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Ain't it.
L444595 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ How apropos.
L444453 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ Maybe you should, but you can't.
L444452 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ I should kill you right now for what you did to me!
L444297 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ You egomaniacs make me laugh. Nature's going to bury you like she buries everyone else.
L444296 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ The body is just another part of nature and ever since we gave up trees for central air, there has been nothing sacred about nature. Nature is the enemy, Mr. O'Brien, and science is our greatest weapon against her.
L444293 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ You're lacking a few things too: ethics, morals, common decency and, oh yeah, deodorant.
L444292 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ Poison?  I'm surprised at you.  You lack vision, Mr. O'Brien.
L444291 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ Wow, that is one moving story.  Take it easy on my heart strings.  Now I really feel guilty complaining about you shooting me up with your poison.
L444290 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ ... plastic.
L444287 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ If you'd like, we can go straight to the authorities.  I understand they are very interested in talking to you.
L444286 +++$+++ u2481 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ O'BRIEN +++$+++ I can explain it.  Attempted murder wasn't enough for him.  He wants to add kidnapping to the charges.
L444584 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ Not that.
L444583 +++$+++ u2482 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ POPPY +++$+++ Did I?  I've been waiting for that for years.
L444582 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ Did you feel that?
L444483 +++$+++ u2477 +++$+++ m160 +++$+++ ARGON +++$+++ Poppy, this is not the time!
