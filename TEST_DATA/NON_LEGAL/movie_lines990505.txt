L648088 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Kambucha mushroom tea...
L648087 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What is it?
L648086 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Wow.  Got here just in time.  I brought you this.
L648085 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ And so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club.
L648084 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Well good.  So you're human.
L648083 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Okay, I'm a little tender.
L648082 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping...
L648081 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Why does everyone find that so surprising?
L648080 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ You are?
L648079 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Good.  I'm good.
L648078 +++$+++ u8862 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ JODY +++$+++ How you holding up?
L648842 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ MADISON!
L648841 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What?
L648840 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Mauduh...
L648839 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Shhhh.
L648838 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Mmmuh...
L648821 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ IT'S TRUE.  That's...you have to believe me!  Oh God, I'm telling you the truth!  I did what I had to, Claire.  She was gone.  There was nothing I could do for her.  I did...I put her in the lake.  I rolled the car in...and I watched it sink.  And I've lived with that image ever since.  I couldn't just stand there while everything-- my career, us, everything, just washed away.  Don't you see, Claire?  She's doing this!  This is exactly what she wants you to think!
L648820 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I don't believe you.
L648819 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I did NOT!  I did not kill anyone.  Jesus. Claire, listen to me.  I walked in and she was lying there dead.  I swear to you.  On my life!  She took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me!  To destroy us!  If I hadn't stopped by here before school, the painters would have--
L648818 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Don't I, Norman?  YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE.  Of a woman you killed!
L648817 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Okay.  Don't...you don't understand what this is.
L648816 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ She's out there isn't she?  She's in the lake.
L648811 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Fine.  I'll do the shopping.
L648810 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I know.
L648809 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ You don't have to do that.
L648808 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I'm cooking you dinner.
L648807 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Nothing.
L648806 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What's that for?
L648795 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Maybe we can stop there for lunch.
L648794 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Don't think so.
L648793 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Do you know it?
L648792 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Huh.
L648791 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.
L648790 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What?
L648789 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Adamant.
L648788 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Yep.  There's some great places nearby.
L648787 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Look for antiques...
L648786 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Incredible.  We should take a drive before they're gone.  Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast.
L648785 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ The leaves...
L648781 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Claire...
L648780 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I don't know, but I am.  She was there and then she was gone.  I felt it.
L648779 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ How can you be sure?
L648778 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ She can't be here without me.
L648777 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What?
L648776 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ She's gone.
L648775 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Can't you see, she's trying to kill us.
L648774 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ It's alright.
L648773 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ We have to get out of here.
L648723 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Of course she did, Norman.  What else could it be?
L648722 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ We don't know that for sure.
L648721 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ She did it.
L648718 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ How did she know where it was?
L648717 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ She was damaged and unstable.  The more I tried to distance myself, the more desperate she became.  Finally, she showed up at the new house...
L648711 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Get out of my way.
L648710 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Claire...
L648709 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ You should have tried harder.
L648708 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I tried to break it off!
L648707 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I'm not going to listen to this.
L648706 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ ...would do anything just to be around me.  And I slipped.  God help me, I slipped.
L648705 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Stop...
L648704 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ And then out of nowhere, some bright young woman found me attractive...
L648703 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Leave her out of this!
L648702 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ To Caitlin!!
L648701 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Who?
L648700 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ THAT'S NOT TRUE!  You wanted to quit!  And then when you did, you hated me for it... so you gave it all to her.
L648699 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ ...Oh BULLSHIT.  You had to topple perfect Daddy and that meant perfect wife, perfect family...
L648698 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I never asked you to quit!
L648697 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What did you think I would do?  Jesus Christ!  I gave up my life and my music...
L648696 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Claire, please don't...
L648693 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ DON'T touch me.  Just get away from me. Go!
L648692 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ That's not what I'm sayi--
L648691 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ So you fucked a student?!
L648690 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ It was last year.  We were having troubles.
L648689 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I snuck back to my car, trying to convince myself it never happened.  And when I woke up in the hospital...somehow it hadn't.  Until now.
L648688 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Oh God...
L648687 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house.
L648686 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Claire--
L648685 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I was there.
L648684 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What?
L648683 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ "You know..."
L648681 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ STOP IT!
L648680 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Your wife...
L648679 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Who?
L648678 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I think she's starting to suspect something.
L648677 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Why don't you shut up and fuck me, Professor.
L648676 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I don't like this, this...
L648675 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Since when?
L648674 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ It's too rough.
L648673 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What's the matter?
L648672 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Ow!
L648669 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Wouldn't go that far.
L648668 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I take it your not mad at me.
L648619 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ STOP IT!
L648618 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ It's Madison Fra--
L648617 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ ...Please stop...
L648616 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ ...I'm positive this time...
L648615 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Stop...
L648614 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I thought it was Mrs. Feur, but it's not...
L648613 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Yes.  The ghost.
L648612 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ The...
L648611 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ It's her.  This is the woman who I've seen.
L648610 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ No.  I'm afraid to ask what this is about.
L648609 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Not personally.
L648608 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I may have seen her on campus.
L648596 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What's wrong with me?
L648595 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
L648594 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ But I don't remember.
L648593 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving.  It was a hard time.
L648592 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ But why?  I can't understand how I could just completely--
L648591 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You shoved me away and ran out to the patio.  I took you home.
L648590 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ In the living room...
L648589 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you...
L648588 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I...
L648587 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You dropped a glass.
L648586 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ When she said it, there was something familiar...but no.
L648585 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You don't remember?
L648500 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ You told me that I was...
L648499 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ We walked all night...
L648498 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I felt you...looking through me...
L648497 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You were lost in the music...eyes closed...your chest heaving...
L648496 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Good.  You sat in front...I saw you there...
L648495 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You know I am.
L648494 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Are you glad?  I'm glad.
L648493 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What?
L648491 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Call ya later.
L648490 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Yep.
L648489 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Do I have everything?
L648488 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Really big bed.
L648487 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No, it's fine.  I'm fine.
L648486 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ ...I'm pulling up, Yuri.  I'll see you for dinner.  Sure you won't stay?
L648430 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Then where is she?
L648429 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I'm sorry...
L648420 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Claire, please...
L648419 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Maybe you're right.  Maybe I'm losing my mind...
L648418 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I will NOT.
L648417 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Keep your voice down.
L648414 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No!  Not sweetheart, no.  I believe in what's happening.  I don't want to, but I do.  I guess I was foolish enough to think that would be enough for you.
L648413 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Sweetheart--
L648412 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Norman, this isn't about you.  This is something that's happening to me.  It's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention.  Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not...
L648411 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ But then you've been so much better...
L648410 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ The accident...?
L648409 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or...
L648408 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Sabotage?
L648407 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ You know what I've got at stake with this paper.  You know that.  I can't help but think that you're doing this now to hurt me, or to sabotage me somehow.
L648406 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What are you...?  No.
L648405 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Maybe you resent how busy I've been.
L648404 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What?
L648402 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Jody brought a Ouija board and we summoned her.
L648401 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ How did you--
L648400 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Jody and I.  And she was there, Norman, she was.  It scared Jody so bad she had to leave.
L648399 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Who did?
L648398 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ We had a seance.
L648397 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ How do you know this?
L648396 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Yes.  And he's going to get away with it.
L648395 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ This is the Feur thing?
L648394 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--
L648393 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What are you doing out here?
L648323 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ No!  And I don't need a psychiatrist!
L648322 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Are you lonely?
L648321 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ ...and I don't think I'm some lonely, middle-aged woman cracking up.
L648320 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I never said...
L648319 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I never said I wasn't upset.  Of course I'm upset.  I miss her terribly.  But I know what I saw and what I heard...and it wasn't some "symptom" of something...
L648318 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Claire, she's been a huge part of your life for seventeen years.  If you weren't thrown off balance by this, then something would be wrong.
L648315 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What can it hurt to talk to someone?
L648314 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Norman...
L648313 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Harvey says he's amazing.
L648312 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I don't need a shrink.
L648272 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Well, that's a relief.
L648271 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ There we go.
L648270 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ We're going to be fine.
L648269 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
L648268 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ You're not at the center.
L648267 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Five minutes?
L648266 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Restaurant.  Let them know we're running late.
L648265 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ What are you doing?
L648264 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just...
L648263 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ ...like it never even happened...
L648262 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ ...Don't get all...
L648261 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ When you do this, I swear...
L648259 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Yes, tonight.  We're going to be--
L648258 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Tonight?
L648257 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ ...since Caitlin.  You don't remember this?
L648256 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Oh.
L648255 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ What do you mean?  Claire, we talked about it.  You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our first date since...
L648254 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ When?
L648253 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.
L648252 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Dressed?
L648251 +++$+++ u8867 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ NORMAN +++$+++ Claire, listen to me.  I know you're under some strain.  But there's no such thing as ghosts.  They don't exist.  Our neighbor did not kill his wife, and I...wait, why aren't you dressed?
L648250 +++$+++ u8859 +++$+++ m601 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ She was lonely, I talked to her.  Norman, I know how it looks, but--
