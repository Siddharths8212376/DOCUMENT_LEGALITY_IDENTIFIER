L497253 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Oh, see, I meant someone you've had sex with. That's part of the theory.
L497252 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Of course not.
L497251 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ You had sex with you therapist?
L497250 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Well, my therapist knows me intimately.
L497249 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I believe in it for some people. I mean, for me it was silly, I was confused going in. So I just formed my own personal theory that you should never take advice from someone of the opposite sex that doesn't know you intimately.
L497248 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ So you don't believe in therapy?
L497247 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Hah! No, I'm not. Actually, I used to be, but the therapist I had was really ineffectual in helping me deal with my problems. Of course, I lied to him constantly, so I guess I can't hold him totally responsible...
L497246 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Aren't you?
L497245 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ You're in therapy?
L497244 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ My therapist said that --
L497243 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ They are looking at you. Ann, you are truly breathtaking. I don't know if you understand how your appearance can affect people. Men want to possess you, women wish they looked like you. And those that don't or can't resent you. And the fact that you're a nice person just makes it worse.
L497242 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ What?
L497241 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Well, I've been watching you. I've watched you eat, I've watched you speak, I've watched the way you move, and I see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at. I think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time. And you know what?
L497240 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Why do you say I'm self-conscious?
L497239 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I am self-conscious, but not in the same way that you are. You have got to be the most attractive self- conscious person I've ever seen.
L497238 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Well... are you self-conscious about it?
L497237 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Not usually. I mean, honestly, I haven't known many guys that could think straight with an erection, so I feel I'm way ahead of the game as far as being clear-headed goes.
L497236 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Does it bother you?
L497235 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Well, let me put it this way: I cannot achieve an erection while in the presence of another person. So, for all practical purposes, I am impotent.
L497234 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ You are?
L497233 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Impotent.
L497232 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ You're what?
L497230 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Agreed.
L497229 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ As long as it's not... gross, you know? Like some scar or something. It has to be like mine, like something about you.
L497228 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Do you want me to?
L497227 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ So what's your personal thing? Are you really going to tell me something personal?
L497226 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I don't know, he just said he wants to wait. I quit asking.
L497225 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Why is that?
L497224 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Yeah, actually, I do. But John doesn't. At least not right now.
L497223 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Do you want them?
L497222 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Kids? What about them?
L497221 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ So what about kids?
L497220 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Yes! Yes! I think that's very true. Very.
L497219 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I think so. I remember reading somewhere that men learn to love what they're attracted to, whereas women become more and more attracted to the person they love.
L497218 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Do you understand what I'm trying to say?
L497217 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Okay. I think... I think sex is overrated. I think people place way too much importance on it. And I think that stuff about women wanting it just as bad is crap. I m not saying women don't want it, I just don't think they want it for the reason men think they do.  I'm getting confused.
L497216 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ It's up to you. But I warn you, if you tell me something personal, I might do the same.
L497215 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Can I tell you something personal? I feel like I can. It's something I couldn't tell John. Or wouldn't, anyway.
L497214 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Right, right. I don't feel connected to many people, either. Other than John.
L497213 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I know that I just don't feel a connection with very many people, so I don't waste time with people I don't feel one with.
L497212 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Hmm. Well, maybe you are. Really, I wouldn't pay much attention.
L497211 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I feel like they do.
L497210 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Yeah, I know. I mean, I'm not saying I know people think you're a bitch, I'm saying I know what you mean. And I don't even know that people think you're a bitch. Do they?
L497208 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ How do you mean?
L497207 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Maybe you'll understand this, because you know John, but he confuses me sometimes.
L497191 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Okay, I will!!
L497190 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ No.
L497189 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Would you mind?
L497187 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Lawyers.
L497186 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ What's the first?
L497185 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Do I pay taxes? Of course I pay taxes, only a liar doesn't pay taxes, I'm not a liar. A liar is the second lowest form of human being.
L497173 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Who's Elizabeth?
L497172 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I don't know.
L497162 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Younger.
L497161 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Sister older or younger?
L497160 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Mother, father, sister.
L497157 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Thank you.
L497156 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ This food is excellent.
L497149 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I would imagine that we are, now. I think I'm ready to use the bathroom, finally.
L497148 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.
L497147 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Oh, lots of reasons, most of them boring. But, up until I dropped out, John and I were... very much alike.
L497146 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Why'd you drop out?
L497145 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I knew him very well. We were extremely close until I dropped out.
L497144 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Why? Didn't you know him well?
L497143 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Yes. I was surprised that he accepted when I asked if I could stay here until I found a place.
L497142 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Nine years?
L497141 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Nine years.
L497140 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ How long has it been since you've seen John?
L497139 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Exactly. I would say the fact that you feel the first year of your marriage has gone by quickly means lots of things. Or could mean lots of things.
L497138 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ You mean like "time flies"?
L497137 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Anyway, I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned.
L497136 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Oh, uh-huh.
L497135 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Did you know that if you shut someone up in a room, and the only clock he has reference to runs two hours slow for every twenty-four, that his body will eventually adjust to that schedule? Simply because the mind honestly perceives that twenty-six hours are twenty-four, the body follows. And then there are sections of time. Your life can be broken down into the sections of time that formed your personality . For instance, when I was twelve, I had an eleven minute conversation with my father that to this day defines our relationship. Now, I'm not saying that everything happened in that specific section of time, but the events of my childhood involving my father led up to, and then were crystallized in, that eleven minutes.
L497134 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Oh, definitely. I mean, just this past year has gone by like phew! I hardly even knew it passed.
L497133 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile.
L497132 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ ...free-lance. You know.
L497131 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Well... well, the cliché about the security of it, that's really true. We own a house, and I really like that, you know? And I like that John was just made junior partner, so he has a steady job and he's not some...
L497130 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ What about it do you like? I'm not being critical, I'd really like to know.
L497129 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Oh, I like it. I like it very much.
L497128 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ No, I was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone. The whole thing was really... irrelevant. How do you like being married?
L497127 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ You play an instrument?
L497126 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Oh. Well, I did. I was in a band once, and the music was always secondary to just flat out offending as many people as possible.
L497125 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ No, not really.
L497124 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I used to take great pleasure in that, being purposefully different, rubbing people's noses in it. Didn't you do that when you were younger?
L497123 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Well...
L497122 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Oh. Well, maybe I'm uncomfortable with my appearance. I feel a little out of place in these surroundings.
L497121 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ No, I think you look... fine.
L497120 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Are you uncomfortable with my appearance?
L497119 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Oh, uh-huh.
L497118 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Yeah, I guess it is. My mother is a complete Anglophile, anything British makes her drool like a baby. She probably heard the name in some movie. She's a prisoner of public television now.
L497117 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Graham is an unusual name.
L497116 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Curious.
L497115 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ No. Why?
L497114 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Yes.
L497113 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Television?
L497112 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Have you ever been on television?
L497111 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Oh.
L497110 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Yes.  Oh, you mean to bring in! No. Yes, I have some other things, no, I don't need to bring them in. This is all I need to stay here.
L497109 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Do you have other things?
L497108 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Oh, no problem. It can wait.
L497107 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ We... don't usually let people smoke in the house. We have a patio if you --
L497106 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Oh. Well, please sit down.
L497105 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ False alarm.
L497104 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ That was quick.
L497098 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Graham Dalton.
L497097 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Yes?
L497096 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Ann?
L497827 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Yes.
L497826 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ God damn you!!
L497822 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You bitch. I knew it.
L497821 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I have thought about it, yes.
L497810 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Not very often.
L497809 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You son of a bitch!!
L497803 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ He does.
L497802 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Bastard...
L497800 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Yes.
L497799 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Goddam right.
L497774 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Yes!
L497773 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Answer me, godammit!! Did you make one of those tapes?
L497771 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I'm not going to discuss this with you anymore. You're making no sense.
L497770 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You're leaving me for him, aren't you? Well, that makes a sad sort of sense. He can't, and you won't.
L497769 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ No, but I wanted to. I really wanted to, partially just to piss you off.
L497768 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Goddammit, goddammit!! That son of a bitch!!  Well, at least I know you didn't fuck him.
L497767 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I drove around. Then I went to talk with Graham.
L497766 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Where did you go when you left here?
L497762 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ We'll call it uncontested or whatever. I just want out.
L497761 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Why?
L497760 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I want out of this marriage.
L497759 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What?
L497758 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I want out of this marriage.
L497757 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Jesus Christ! What the hell happened? I came home and your car was gone, the door was open, I thought for sure you'd been abducted by some mad fucker, I was literally just calling the cops when you walked in. What happened?
L497668 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I know.
L497667 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Quitting your therapy won't feed the children of Ethiopia.
L497666 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I don't know. Sometimes I feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world.
L497665 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Isn't therapy helping at all?
L497664 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I didn't say it was rational, I just said I was convinced.
L497663 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Yeah. Jeez, give me some credit.
L497662 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Loud.
L497661 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I don't, either. I mean, Cynthia, of all people. She's so...
L497660 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I'm sorry, too. I... I get these ideas in my head, you know, and I have nothing to do all day but sit around and concoct these intricate scenarios. And then I want to believe it so I don't think I've wasted the whole day. Last week I was convinced you were having an affair with Cynthia, I don't know why.
L497659 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I'm sorry. It's just... I'm under a lot of pressure with this Kirkland thing, it's my first big case as junior partner, and I work all day, I come home, I look forward to seeing you, and... it hurts that you accuse me like that.
L497658 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ You've made your point.
L497657 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Goddam right. I mean, can you imagine: "Your honor, I'm positive this man is guilty. I can't place him at the scene or establish a motive, but I have this really strong feeling."
L497656 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Always the lawyer.
L497655 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Look, this conversation is utterly ridiculous. Maybe when you have some evidence, we should talk, but don't give me conjecture and intuition.
L497654 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Why don't I believe you?
L497653 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I'm not either!!
L497652 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ But I'm not.
L497651 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I was just saying, you know? I didn't get paranoid when you didn't want to make love. I could have easily assumed that you didn't want to because you were having an affair.
L497650 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Is that supposed to comfort me?
L497649 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ For God's sake, Ann, I am not fucking your sister. I don't find her that attractive, for one.
L497648 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ My sister, for one. Is that who it is?
L497647 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Ann, you are completely paranoid. Not ten minutes ago I wanted to make love for the first time in weeks, and you act like I'm dipped in shit. You know, I think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young, straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on.
L497646 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I can't tell you how upset I would be if you were lying.
L497645 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ There's nothing to know, Ann.
L497644 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ If I'm right, I want to know. I don't want you to lie. I'd be very upset, but not as upset as if I'd found out you'd been lying.
L497643 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation.
L497642 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Well, are you?
L497641 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Jesus Christ, where'd that come from? I have a late lunch by myself and now I'm fucking somebody?
L497640 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Are you having an affair?
L497639 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Something wrong?
L497638 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I ate by myself.
L497637 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Who'd you have lunch with?
L497636 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Then maybe I saw an old message. There are a lot of them on my desk, you know.
L497635 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ That's interesting, because I didn't leave a message.
L497634 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Yes. I just got busy.
L497633 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Did you see a message to call me when you got back in?
L497632 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Tuesday. I had a late lunch.
L497631 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I called you Tuesday at 3:30 and they said you weren't in. Do you remember where you were?
L497630 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Mmmmm...
L497629 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ John?
L497176 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Stay away from the Garden District. Serious crime. I don't know what kind of place you're looking for, but there are a lot of studio-type apartments available elsewhere.
L497175 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Graham and I were talking about apartments and I told him to check the Garden District, there are some nice little places there, garage apartments and stuff.
L497171 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Are you going to see Elizabeth while you're here?
L497170 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Oh, we get along okay. She's just very... she's an extrovert. I think she's loud. She probably wouldn't agree. Definitely wouldn't agree.
L497152 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ You did that?
L497151 +++$+++ u2692 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ That's the first thing that ran through my mind when I saw you. I thought this is not the same man that rode the unicycle naked through the homecoming parade.
L497520 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I know, but this... I just feel like everybody I know right now is obsessed with sex.
L497519 +++$+++ u2690 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ There are many things that can exert control over one's life, good and bad. Religion, greed, philanthropy, drugs.
L497518 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Because all she thinks about are these guys she's after and I just hate her she's such a little slut I thought that in high school and I think that now. Why do people have to be so obsessed with sex all what's the big damn deal? I mean, it's okay and everything, but I don't understand when people let it control them, control their lives, why do they do that?
L497517 +++$+++ u2690 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Why?
L497516 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I hate my sister.
L497340 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ But you don't have hidden motives for feeling that way, right?
L497339 +++$+++ u2690 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ I'm glad you feel that way, because I feel that way, too.
L497338 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Yes.
L497337 +++$+++ u2690 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Do you feel there is more progress to be made?
L497336 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Not really.
L497335 +++$+++ u2690 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Do you want to leave therapy?
L497334 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Yes.
L497333 +++$+++ u2690 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ That you are under no obligation to me?
L497332 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Yes.
L497331 +++$+++ u2690 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ You understand that you are free to leave therapy at any time?
L497330 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I guess.
L497329 +++$+++ u2690 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ It's possible that Graham has hidden motives for disliking therapy and/or therapists. Perhaps he has problems of his own that he is unwilling to deal with, and he would like to see other people, you for instance, wallow in their situation just as he does. Do you think that's possible?
L497328 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ What do you mean? I don't understand.
L497327 +++$+++ u2690 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Ann, in life one has to be aware of hidden agendas.  Did it occur to you that Graham may have his own reasons for not wanting you to be in therapy?
L497326 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ That guy Graham I told you about. He said taking advice from someone you don't know intimately was... well, he said a lot of stuff.
L497325 +++$+++ u2690 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ I thought that's what I did. Who was it that you talked to?
L497324 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I've been thinking about it for awhile, and then I was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me.
L497323 +++$+++ u2690 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ What brought this on?
