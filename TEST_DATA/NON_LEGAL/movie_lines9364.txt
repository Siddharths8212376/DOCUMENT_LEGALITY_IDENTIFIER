L496698 +++$+++ u2682 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. REDI +++$+++ What were you talking about?
L496697 +++$+++ u2670 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ I did her hair.
L496696 +++$+++ u2682 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. REDI +++$+++ What did she want?
L497015 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ No, I'm glad....at least I've heard you say it...
L497014 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ I know —— I shouldn't have told you—
L497013 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I've never loved any one before, Gregory, and I do love you -— you must know it -- but Jacqueline's my sister —— whom I had lost and have found again....   
L497012 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ Perhaps, later, when things are settled, when Jacqueline's well again -- maybe we can arrange things differently.
L497011 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Yes.
L497010 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ No. Stay that way. I want to talk to you. I love you -— you know that?
L497008 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ It's what I should have done yesterday. I'll take her away somewhere where she can rest.
L497007 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Gregory ——  you'd better take Jacqueline with you tonight.
L497006 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ That was Dr. Judd. He was phoning to say that, Jacqueline is on her way here -
L496886 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Good night.
L496885 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ Good night, Jacqueline -- good night, Mary.
L496877 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You'd love that, Jackie. Remember that last summer with Mother in the Berkshires? You used to help the gardener.
L496876 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ I thought I might close up the apartment -- maybe get a place in Connecticut.
L496875 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ It will all be over in such a little while, Jacqueline, and everything will be all right again. Drink your coffee.
L496874 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ Any court in the land would understand. We'll wait a few days -- let you rest -- then we'll go to the police.
L496873 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Don't. We know what happened. Don't go on.
L496812 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ We've tried so long to find her.
L496811 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ She's got to be found. That's the first step. She's got to be found so that she can give herself up to the police.
L496560 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ What things? Why?
L496559 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ Things changed, Mary. The reasons for finding Jacqueline changed. I want to find Jacqueline to settle things.
L496558 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You could have told me any time you were Jacqueline's husband.
L496551 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ A poet. He's sitting right over there. That's his table —— the one at the feet of Dante.
L496550 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ Who the devil is he?
L496549 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Last night in this very restaurant Mr. Jason Hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear.
L496548 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ Please —- I can't explain things like this to your right ear.
L496496 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ There is a very simple way. Got a telephone book?
L496495 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Greg, it isn't a wild tale. It's true. If there were only some way --
L496494 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ Look, Mary, now that I know you better, I think I can be more frank with you. I don't believe you. I still can't understand the reason for such a wild tale. It's like some of Jacqueline's stories.
L496493 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You've never believed a word I told you about Mr. August.
L496492 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ Oh, I'm making investigations.
L496491 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++  What have you done about Irving August?
L496483 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Well, I'm glad you came to see me.
L496482 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ Oh, I had business with a man... but I missed him -—
L496481 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ What brought you down here, Greg?
L496437 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Yes.
L496436 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ The people at the restaurant?
L496435 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Maybe the Romaris might have a room. They seem nice.
L496434 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ It's not much money, but it's enough to live on. You'd have to move out of that hotel and into a furnished room.
L496433 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'd like that.
L496432 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ You told me you were pretty good with youngsters. Today I bumped into an old friend of mine, Mrs. Wheeler  She runs a settlement house down in the Village and is looking for a kindergarten teacher.
L496431 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ A job?
L496430 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ However, I won't say that I'll not take charge occasionally, and I'm going to take charge new. I've a job for you.
L496429 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ I won't do it again. We're friends. I'll never order you about again.
L496428 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ But you have treated me that way.
L496427 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ I'm sorry. I didn't intend to treat you like a child.
L496425 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ Drink your milk.
L496424 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ He was a kind little man in his way —— and I made him go down that hall into the darkness. I made him do it.
L496423 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ Yes, of course —— but the police would say you'd probably had a bad dream.
L496422 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I saw him on the floor. He was cut -—  --here. The blood was running out. He was dead. I'm sure of it. Then on the subway I saw him —— white —— and the men holding him up between them.
L496421 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ The important thing is, the police won't believe you.
L496420 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ But you do believe me?
L496419 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ This is about another murder —— a woman at Fifty Second Street
L496374 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ Goodnight, Mary.
L496373 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Thank you.. .goodnight.
L496372 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ You can't make it your life's work looking for Jacqueline.  ) You'll have to do other things... live...get some enjoyment out of life. I hope you'll let me help you.
L496371 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ But I reel guilty. It doesn't seem right for me to enjoy myself with Jacqueline gone.
L496370 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ Good.
L496369 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Thank you. It was a lovely dinner.
L496365 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'm not a youngster. I can understand.
L496364 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ Afraid she might commit suicide?  People who commit suicide don't talk about it. That room made her happy in some strange way I couldn't understand. She lived in a world of her own fancy. She didn't always tell the truth. In fact -— I'm afraid she didn't know what the truth was.  There were many things about Jacqueline I didn't understand, and yet, without understanding, I had to be with her —— to see her —— to touch her —— in order to be happy. It's hard to explain to a youngster.
L496363 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Weren't you afraid?
L496362 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ At least I can explain that, Mary. Your sister had a feeling about life —— that it wasn't worth living unless one could end it. I helped her get that room.
L496361 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Because I loved Jacqueline I thought I knew her. Today I found out such strange things ——frightening things. I saw a hangman's noose that she had hanging -— waiting —— I feel as if I'd never known her.
L496360 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ A man would look anywhere for her, Mary. There is something exciting and unforgettable about her -— something you never get hold of —- something that keeps a man following after her.
L496358 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ I love your sister, Mary. I love her very much.
L496357 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Why?
L496356 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ But I'd give a great deal to know.
L496355 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Then you know where Jacqueline is?
L496354 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ The Morgue? No wonder you fainted.  I wish you had come to me first.
L496353 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ No...At the morgue they told me a Mr. Gregory Ward had made inquiries about Jacqueline.
L496352 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ We're not exactly strangers, Mary. Jacqueline spoke about you often. I suppose she told you about me,
L496892 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ Not from me.
L496891 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ She'll have to know some time.
L496890 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ That you love Mary.
L496889 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ Let her know what?
L496823 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Verse -- verse that I wrote. I need it.
L496822 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ What's that?
L496819 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ I suppose so. I can pick him up somewhere.
L496818 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ Could you find him?
L496817 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ We could tell him.
L496816 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ He's clever and he's cautious in his way. If he knew I think he'd advise her to do what I want —- surrender herself to the police —— stand trial —— I don't think he knows.
L496815 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ I don't know.
L496814 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ Do you think he knows about this?
L496584 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ Well, that's illuminating.
L496583 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ I'm looking for a party -- a merry party.
L496582 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ All very nice but, what are you going to do - listen at every house in New York for Jacqueline's voice?
L496581 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ This is the part of New York I love. It is old. It has memories. If you listen, the houses will speak to you. Walt Whitman...Edna St. Vincent Millay... Eugene O'Neill...in their time they've all lived here.
L496580 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ Well?
L496576 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ Look here, just because Mrs. Romari asked you to amuse us.
L496575 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Mary, when you first came here, I told you to look into your heart. You didn't listen to me. You listened to the policeman instead. You didn't find your sister, did you?
L496574 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ It may make very fine poetry, Mr. Hoag, but it doesn't make good sense.
L496573 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ But I understand her. That may be more important.
L496572 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ You don't even know Jacqueline Gibson.
L496571 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ But I'm better than a detective. I have an understanding of people - and a love of them -- an understanding of the city - -
L496570 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ Don't be ridiculous. For months I've had the best private detective in New York looking for Miss Gibson.
L496569 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ But I'm not joking.
L496568 +++$+++ u2671 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ I don't think that's a good subject for jokes, Mr. Hoag.
L496567 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ I'm going to find your sister.
L497004 +++$+++ u2672 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JACQUELINE +++$+++ You will die.
L497003 +++$+++ u2676 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MIMI +++$+++ I don't know.
L497002 +++$+++ u2672 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JACQUELINE +++$+++ And then?
L497001 +++$+++ u2676 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MIMI +++$+++ I'm not going to wait. I'm going out -- laugh, dance --do all the things I used to do.
L497000 +++$+++ u2672 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JACQUELINE +++$+++ Why wait?
L496999 +++$+++ u2676 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MIMI +++$+++ I'm tired of being afraid -— of waiting.
L496998 +++$+++ u2676 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MIMI +++$+++ I'm afraid.
L496997 +++$+++ u2672 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JACQUELINE +++$+++ And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die -- always.
L496996 +++$+++ u2676 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MIMI +++$+++ Yes. It's been quiet, oh ever so quiet. I hardly move, yet it keeps coming all the time -—closer and closer. I rest and rest and yet I am dying.
L496995 +++$+++ u2672 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JACQUELINE +++$+++ No!
L496994 +++$+++ u2676 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MIMI +++$+++ I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
L496993 +++$+++ u2672 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JACQUELINE +++$+++ Who are you?
L496900 +++$+++ u2672 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JACQUELINE +++$+++ Yes.
L496899 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You'll be all right?
L496898 +++$+++ u2672 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JACQUELINE +++$+++ I won't get lonely.
L496897 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ If you get lonely, go down and see Mrs. Romari. I told her you were staying with me.
L496896 +++$+++ u2672 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JACQUELINE +++$+++ Good-bye.
L496895 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Good-bye, darling. I'll only be gone until three.
L496868 +++$+++ u2672 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JACQUELINE +++$+++ You know about the Palladists -- you know who they are -- what they are. I was one of them.
L496867 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Please, Jacqueline.
L497022 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Good. We all understand each other. You, Gregory and I. We all know. There is sunlight in the streets and work to do. Both of you -— you're off to work.
L497021 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I understand.
L497020 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Not I —- I am alive, yet every hope I had is dead,  Death can be good. Death can be happy.. If I were really dying I could speak like Cyrano -— "My courage like a white plume" — and all the other lovely words with which he greeted death. Then perhaps you might understand,
L497017 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I keep telling myself that.
L497016 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ I hate people who try to peddle comfort. But,Mary, you shouldn't mourn for Jacqueline. Life for her was full of the agony of a disordered mind. It's better this way.
L496966 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ They may have been friends of hers.
L496965 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Jacqueline. Mr. Romari phoned me. She went out this afternoon with two men he'd never seen before.
L496964 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ What's wrong, Mary?
L496963 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I can't find Gregory. I've been trying to find him.
L496808 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ He's Jacqueline's husband. I can't
L496807 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ He loves you, Mary, and you'll have to tell him.
L496806 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ And Gregory -- he loves her.
L496805 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ If it is true — there's all the more reason for you to find Jacqueline.
L496804 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I have to. It was Irving August -- everything Mrs. Redi said -— it fits in with what I saw -— she even knew I'd seen his body on the subway.
L496803 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ And you believe that?
L496802 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
L496801 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ You went to see Mrs. Redi... She told you something -- what was it?
L496800 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ It's because of Jacqueline —— I can't go on looking for her --
L496799 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ I had begun to write again -—that's whet I was doing when you came in.
L496798 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ I thought myself your friend, Mary. Just good-bye isn't enough for a friend.
L496797 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Don't make me tell you, Jason.
L496796 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ It isn't that -- you said, "have to go." What could compel you --
L496795 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ But you're happy here -- you like your work —-
L496794 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I have to go —-
L496793 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ I thought your coming up here to the third floor to see me —-that it was your advent into my world. It turns out to be good-by. Why?
L496792 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Jason, I'm going back to Highcliffe. I came to say good-by.
L496791 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ It's not a searchlight —— it's a sword blade cutting the blue cloak of a prince —- not stars --
L496790 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ It's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --
L496789 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ My window - - through which I see the world.
L496786 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ It's grown big with time -- I've lived here with the Romari's for ten years -- the room's become part of me. I want you to see it —— to know me better.
L496785 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ But it's a small room, Jason.
L496784 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ I want you to see my room. I want you to see all of it.
L496672 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Some time before those nice white gloves are dry you're going to go and find out a few things about Mrs. Redi.
L496671 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I can imagine.
L496670 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Look. I'm serious. It's a real and vary earnest society -- a dangerous society...
L496669 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Devil worshippers!
L496668 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ I thought it would be, but just to be sure, I'll tell you that the Palladists are a society of Devil worshippers --
L496667 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ It's all clear to me now -- so clear.
L496666 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Such a simple matter. This figure is the symbol of the Palladists.
L496665 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'm at sea, Jason.
L496664 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ That's it. And this figure --she traced it. The book I saw at the library had been marked "perfect" by the library inspector in March. Mrs. Redi had it out in April. No one else had read it since.
L496663 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I don't know.
L496662 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ But who is Judd, a psychiatrist. It's quite natural that he should read books on the history of old religious societies. But why should Mrs. Redi, a woman with a beauty parlor --?
L496661 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I don't think that's so revealing.
L496660 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ I went as a detective. I found out that Mrs. Redi reads the same books as Dr. Judd.
L496659 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ But you're always at the library.
L496658 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ I have been at the library.
L496652 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ I have something even better.
L496651 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ It's terribly sweet of you, Jason.
L496634 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I want you to look for Jacqueline.
L496633 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Yes. And now that I've shown you that I know that much, and can guess more -- will you trust me to look for Jacqueline?
L496632 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ And you knew he'd be here.
L496631 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Yes.
L496630 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ At least you knew about Dr. Judd.
L496566 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ You will have to make all the jokes, because I'm going to be very serious.
L496565 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Well,then I have spoiled your dinner -- "your food won't digest, and your wine will sour."
L496315 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Yes. I was going to tell you to look into your own heart -- do you really want to find your sister?
L496314 +++$+++ u2675 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Were you going to make a suggestion?
L496557 +++$+++ u2683 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. ROMARI +++$+++ But you should make her laugh, Jason. Come, make jokes for her. I'll bring your food to their table.
L496556 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ We are happy, Mrs. Romari, because you have everything —— and I am happy because I have nothing to lose.
L496555 +++$+++ u2683 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. ROMARI +++$+++ Why can't everyone be happy like we are -- laugh and have good times. Look at that poor little one — so sad because she can't find her sister. And that man with her -— he doesn't make her laugh —— he just sits and talks.
L496545 +++$+++ u2683 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. ROMARI +++$+++ Oh, the wine. I have forgotten the wine.
L496544 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ What are you thinking of, Bella? Can I eat dry?
L496542 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Bella Romari	If I were not seated, I would embrace you in three movements like a sonata.  Ah, my wonderful one. Fly with me tonight. We will take your coffee machine and live with the gypsies.
L496541 +++$+++ u2683 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. ROMARI +++$+++ Jason, my pet ——
L496317 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ I'm a good boy, but no one listens to what I say.
L496316 +++$+++ u2683 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MRS. ROMARI +++$+++ Ah, my Jason -- always laughing -- always trying to help others.  He's a good boy, Miss -- he just talks that way.
L496648 +++$+++ u2677 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MISS GOTTSCHALK +++$+++ Well, since, you're over twenty one——
L496647 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ I wouldn't want to take them out. I just want to look at them.
L496646 +++$+++ u2677 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MISS GOTTSCHALK +++$+++ Why, Mr. Jason. Most of these books are on the closed shelf. You have to get permission.
L496645 +++$+++ u2677 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MISS GOTTSCHALK +++$+++ No, not at all, Mr. Jason.
L496644 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Would it be asking too much, Miss Gottschalk, for you to get me these books?
L496643 +++$+++ u2677 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MISS GOTTSCHALK +++$+++ It's here, too.
L496642 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ Yes, Dr. Louis Judd.
L496641 +++$+++ u2677 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MISS GOTTSCHALK +++$+++ And the other was Judd?
L496639 +++$+++ u2677 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MISS GOTTSCHALK +++$+++ Who was the first one -- Mrs. Redi?
L496638 +++$+++ u2673 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JASON +++$+++ I want to see what they read so I'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. There's nothing nicer for a gift than a book.
L496637 +++$+++ u2677 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ MISS GOTTSCHALK +++$+++ Oh, Mr. Jason. I really shouldn't be doing this, you know. It's against the rules.  When did you say you wanted them?
L496969 +++$+++ u2674 +++$+++ m174 +++$+++ JUDD +++$+++ They may have found her.  Mrs. Cortez -— this morning I told her Jacqueline was no longer under my care.
