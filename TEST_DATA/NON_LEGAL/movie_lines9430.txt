L566503 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ The only reason I mentioned her at all is to say that I'm not going to talk about her anymore. I thought you'd appreciate that.
L566502 +++$+++ u3090 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Well, until now. Tend the pin.
L566501 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ I didn't mention her once today.
L566500 +++$+++ u3090 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Oh no?
L566499 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ I don't talk about her that much.
L566498 +++$+++ u3090 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Kinda.
L566497 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ What? Like, you didn't want to jinx it?
L566496 +++$+++ u3090 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I don't know. It's like not talking to a pitcher in the midst of a no hitter.
L566495 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Why?
L566494 +++$+++ u3090 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I didn't want to say anything.
L566493 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Haven't you noticed I didn't mention Michelle once today?
L566492 +++$+++ u3090 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ It's like "Hi, Mom. I'm not going to be starring in that sitcom and, oh by the way, I'm Goofy. Send more money."
L566491 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ You tested over a month ago. I'm sure they figured it out by now.
L566490 +++$+++ u3090 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Do you realize how hard it's going to be to tell my parents? I still haven't told them I didn't get the pilot.
L566489 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ What do you want? You're tall.
L566488 +++$+++ u3090 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ There's just something about being "Goofy". Any other Disney character would be fine. There's just this stigma associated with the character.
L566487 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Look, there's not much of a call for Shakespeare in this town.
L566486 +++$+++ u3090 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ It's definitely a step back for me.
L566485 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role.
L566484 +++$+++ u3090 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I mean, I need the money.
L566483 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ It's a gig.
L566482 +++$+++ u3090 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I don't think I'm gonna take it.
L566130 +++$+++ u3090 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Thanks. Thanks, man.
L566129 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Rob, I just want you to know, you're the only one I can talk to about her.
L566128 +++$+++ u3090 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ No problem.
L566127 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ ...It's just that you've been there. Your advice really helps.
L566126 +++$+++ u3090 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Hey man, don't sweat it.
L566125 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Thanks, man. Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time...
L566124 +++$+++ u3090 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ There's the rub.
L566123 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ There's the rub.
L566122 +++$+++ u3090 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Ah, see, that's the thing. Somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore.
L566121 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Unless she comes back first.
L566120 +++$+++ u3090 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I mean first you'll pretend not to care, not call -- whatever, and then, eventually, you really won't care.
L566119 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Right... Wait, what do you mean?
L566118 +++$+++ u3090 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Right... or more likely the opposite.
L566117 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ So it's almost a retroactive decision. So I could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like I just pretended to forget about her.
L566116 +++$+++ u3090 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ It sucks.
L566115 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Well that sucks.
L566114 +++$+++ u3090 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Right.
L566113 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ So the only difference is if I forget about her or pretend to forget about her.
L566112 +++$+++ u3090 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ The only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back. See, you can't do anything to make her want to come back. You can only do things to make her not want to come back.
L566111 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ So what's the difference?
L566110 +++$+++ u3090 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Right.
L566109 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ So I don't call either way.
L566108 +++$+++ u3090 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Right.
L566107 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ But you said I shouldn't call if I wanted to give up on her.
L566106 +++$+++ u3090 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ You don't call.
L566105 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ And what if I don't want to give up on her?
L566989 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ She's really special, guys.
L566988 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Good for you, man. He's being smart.
L566897 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Believe me, I know what that's like.  Yo, Double Down! What time are we leaving?
L566896 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Thanks, man.  I've been hating myself for the last two days.
L566895 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Don't sweat it, man. I needed a kick in the ass. We're better friends for it.
L566894 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ But most important, man, I'm sorry about what I said. I was drunk... My adrenaline was going...
L566893 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ We ran into them that night at Roscoe's. Tee cleared it up, I apologized, bought them some chicken and waffles. They fuckin love Tee. That boy can talk.
L566892 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ What are they doing here?
L566891 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ I'm so sorry, man. You were so right. I got rid of the gun
L566819 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ ...Whatever. You're like a whining little woman. Big deal. You got a fuckin' number. Whoopee! You'll fuck it up...
L566818 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ ...It was six months, and she didn't dump...
L566817 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ What about you, Mikey? At least I got balls. You're always whining about some bitch who dumped you a year ago...
L566816 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ You live in such a fantasy world...
L566812 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ ...People get carjacked...
L566811 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Yeah. Here it's easier to avoid trouble. It's not like you like in Compton where bullets are whizzing by your head every day. Nobody's mugging you on no subway. In New York the trouble finds you. Out here you gotta go look for it...
L566808 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Hey, man, you're not from here. You don't know how it is. I grew up in L.A...
L566807 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ You asshole. Why are you carrying a gun? What? In case someone steps to you, Snoop Dogg?
L566802 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ You asshole.
L566801 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ He's a bitch. He ain't gonna do nothing.
L566748 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ She didn't like me... I made a fool of myself...
L566747 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ She was cute.
L566705 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ I can't believe you.
L566704 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Big butt... you know, can't fly coach.
L566683 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Rejected?
L566682 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Not well.
L566681 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ How's it going for you two?
L566635 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Damned if I know...
L566634 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Who threw this party, anyway?
L566629 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ ...He's derivative...
L566628 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ ...How can you compare them? Tarantino totally bites everything from Scorsese...
L566565 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ He's trying to be an actor.
L566564 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ What's he do?
L566558 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ So, what? Eleven?
L566557 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ ...which means no one will get there 'til ten.
L566548 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Give me the money. I'll get it.
L566547 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Pause it. 
L566545 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ No, man, we're in the play-offs.
L566544 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Make someone bleed.
L566543 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ It's kinda money, actually.
L566527 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Hey, man. I took the Kings to the Cup.
L566526 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ You should play another team. The Kings are bitches in this game.
L566523 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Hey Sue. Gretsky's on his ass again.
L566522 +++$+++ u3091 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ You little bitch!
L566846 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Wow, I guess you were home... 
L566845 +++$+++ u3089 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ NIKKI +++$+++ Don't call me ever again.
L566844 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Nikki! Great! Did you just walk in, or were you listening all along?
L566843 +++$+++ u3089 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ NIKKI +++$+++ Mike?
L566842 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Hi, Nikki. Mike. I don't think this is working out. I think you're great, but maybe we should just take some time off from each other. It's not you, really. It's me. It's only been six months...
L566841 +++$+++ u3089 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ NIKKI +++$+++ Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
L566840 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Hi, Nikki. This is Mike again. Could you just call me when you get in? I'll be up for awhile, and I'd just rather talk to you in person instead of trying to squeeze it all... 
L566839 +++$+++ u3089 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ NIKKI +++$+++ Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
L566838 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ I just got out of a six-year relationship. Okay? That should help to explain why I'm acting so weird. It's not you. It's me. I just wanted to say that. Sorry.  This is Mike. 
L566837 +++$+++ u3089 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ NIKKI +++$+++ Hi. This is Nikki. Leaves a message. 
L566836 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ 213-555-4679. That's all. I just wanted to leave my number. I don't want you to think I'm weird, or desperate or something...  ...I mean, you know, we should just hang out. That's it. No expectations. Just, you know, hang out. Bye. 
L566835 +++$+++ u3089 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ NIKKI +++$+++ Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
L566834 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Hi, Nikki. This is Mike, again. I just called because it sounded like your machine might've cut me off before I gave you my number, and also to say sorry for calling so late, but you were still there when I left the Dresden, so I knew I'd get your machine. Anyway, my number is... 
L566833 +++$+++ u3089 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ NIKKI +++$+++ Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
L566832 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Hi, Nikki. This is Mike. I met you tonight at the Dresden. I, uh, just called to say I, uh, I'm really glad we met and you should give me a call. So call me tomorrow, or, like, in two days, whatever. My number is 213- 555-4679... 
L566831 +++$+++ u3089 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ NIKKI +++$+++ Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
L566355 +++$+++ u3093 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ WAITRESS +++$+++ Hang on, Voltaire.
L566354 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Excuse me. We're in a bit of a hurry.
L566339 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ I'll have "pancakes in the Age of Enlightenment".
L566338 +++$+++ u3093 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ WAITRESS +++$+++ That's right.
L566337 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Coffee...  Two coffees. It says "Breakfast Any Time", right?
L566336 +++$+++ u3093 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ WAITRESS +++$+++ Are you ready to order?
L566287 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Sorry. We got knocked out pretty quickly.
L566286 +++$+++ u3093 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ WAITRESS +++$+++ There you two are. I walked around for an hour with that stupid martini on my tray.
L566997 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ Oh. He's got it under control...
L566996 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Guys... Guys... I got it under control.
L566987 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ I know she liked me. I mean, it's not like I wanted to do anything with her tonight.
L566986 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ Don't give me that! She liked you, man.
L566985 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ It's not like that...
L566981 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ You were good. Did you see how she was vibing you?
L566980 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ I took a ballroom class with Michelle. I never danced with anyone but her, til tonight. That Lorraine chick is good.
L566979 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ You were off your ass back there! Where the hell did you learn to do all that twirly whirly shit?
L566800 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ What an asshole. Didn't you see "Boys in the Hood"? Now one of us is gonna get shot.
L566799 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ What the fuck..?
L566782 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ Yeah. I guess you could call it that.
L566781 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ So, two days?
L566778 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ No...
L566777 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Tomorrow?
L566776 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ A day.
L566775 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ How long do I wait to call?
L566766 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ No, baby!
L566765 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ You're not just, like, fucking with me?
L566753 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ We're not messing with you...
L566752 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Please, don't mess with me right now...
L566746 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ What's wrong? I saw you talking to that beautiful blonde baby.
L566745 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ What a surprise.
L566744 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ We got the digits, baby.
L566698 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ That doesn't matter.
L566697 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ She didn't see.
L566696 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ You asked her for her number, and then you tore it up.
L566695 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ Why, baby? What'd I do wrong?
L566694 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me.
L566693 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ Was I money?
L566680 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ Don't sweat it, baby. This one's a lay-up.
L566679 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L566676 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ She didn't notice.
L566675 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ You looked right at her, baby.
L566674 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ What?
L566673 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ What are you doing?
L566671 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ Minnie Pearl.
L566670 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Which one?
L566669 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ It's on.
L566668 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ How you guys doing?
L566624 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ ...It looked money.
L566623 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ ...Maybe. I mean you gotta hide all the lights...
L566618 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ ...through the kitchen...
L566617 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ ...the Copa, in New York...
L566563 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ Yeah. He's a "rounder".
L566562 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Yeah. You met him once.
L566561 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ Who? Rob?
L566556 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ It starts at eight...
L566555 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ What time's this party tonight?
L566553 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ Aww... He got away?
L566552 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ You guys are such assholes.
L566542 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ Yeah.
L566541 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ No.
L566537 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ What? That was the best part of the old game.
L566536 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ No. Doesn't that suck?
L566535 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ This version doesn't have fighting?
L566534 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ I wish the game still had fights so I could bitch-slap Wayne.
L566480 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ Baby, she's the one who should be thinking about you. Sounds to me like you cut loose some dead weight. Trust me, Mikey, you're better off.
L566479 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ I hear she's getting real fat.
L566478 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ Please. And you're sweating him? You're "all that" and you're sweating some lawn jockey?
L566477 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
L566476 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ What?!?
L566475 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ He drives a carriage.
L566474 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ See? And what does this guy she's with do?
L566473 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Selling scrap metal.
L566472 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ ...Whatever. It's work. You're doing what you love. What's she doing?
L566471 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ ...a day...
L566470 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ You just sat around drinking orange juice. Now look at you. Look how far you've come in just a few months. You got that part in that movie...
L566469 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Don't remind me.
L566468 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ Why? So you can beat yourself up? Sitting around in that stuffy apartment. It's just plain bad for you, man. It's depressing. You've come so far. Remember the first week? After she told you? You couldn't even eat.
L566467 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ I just need some time...
L566466 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ That's just plain silly. Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. It's no good, man. You gotta get out there. The ladies want to love you, baby.
L566465 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ I was younger... It was college. You didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like. You screw chicks you have no business being with. They're young, they don't know any better.
L566464 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ How?
L566463 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ That was different.
L566462 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ Michelle went for you, right.
L566461 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you.
L566460 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ Baby, you're so money you don't even know it.
L566459 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ I just don't think she liked me in that way.
L566458 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ Baby, you take yourself out of the game. You start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream, of course it's gonna be on the friend tip.
L566457 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ Yeah, a good friend.
L566456 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ I heard them talking. They both thought you were money.
L566455 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ I don't think so.
L566454 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ She thought you were money.
L566453 +++$+++ u3088 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ MIKE +++$+++ She didn't like me, anyway.
L566452 +++$+++ u3092 +++$+++ m202 +++$+++ TRENT +++$+++ No, baby. You're money.
