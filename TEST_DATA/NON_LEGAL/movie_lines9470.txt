L599907 +++$+++ u3285 +++$+++ m217 +++$+++ WARREN +++$+++ Piggyback ride.
L607893 +++$+++ u3296 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ MCNAMARA +++$+++ And I will only issue such instructions when ordered to by the President.  John Paul Jones... you don't understand a thing, do you, Admiral?
L607892 +++$+++ u3286 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ ADMIRAL ANDERSON +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L607891 +++$+++ u3296 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ MCNAMARA +++$+++ This was not the President's intention when he gave that order. What if the Soviets don't see the distention? What if they make the same mistake I just did?  There will be no firing anything near ANY Soviet ships without my express permission, is that understood, Admiral?
L607890 +++$+++ u3286 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ ADMIRAL ANDERSON +++$+++ With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we were not firing on the ship. Firing on a ship means attacking the ship. We were not attacking the ship. We were firing over it.
L607889 +++$+++ u3296 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ MCNAMARA +++$+++ I believe the President made it clear that there would be no firing on ships without his express permission.
L607888 +++$+++ u3286 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ ADMIRAL ANDERSON +++$+++ Get out of our way, Mr. Secretary. The navy has been running blockades since the days of John Paul Jones.
L607887 +++$+++ u3296 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ MCNAMARA +++$+++ Starshells.
L607882 +++$+++ u3296 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ MCNAMARA +++$+++ What --
L607881 +++$+++ u3286 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ ADMIRAL ANDERSON +++$+++ Yes, Captain, you may proceed. Clear your guns.
L607879 +++$+++ u3296 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ MCNAMARA +++$+++ Admiral, I asked you a question.
L607878 +++$+++ u3286 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ ADMIRAL ANDERSON +++$+++ Carrying out our mission, Mr. Secretary. If you don't mind, we're very busy right now. We need to be able to do our jobs.
L607877 +++$+++ u3296 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ MCNAMARA +++$+++ What are you doing?
L607876 +++$+++ u3286 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ ADMIRAL ANDERSON +++$+++ We've been hailing the Groznyy for the last hour, Mr. Secretary. The Groznyy refuses to stop.
L607595 +++$+++ u3296 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ MCNAMARA +++$+++ We're concerned about the possibility of an incident with an innocent cargo carrier. If it turns ugly, the Russians could use an ugly incident and bad world opinion as leverage to force us to remove the quarantine.
L607594 +++$+++ u3286 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ ADMIRAL ANDERSON +++$+++ Which is exactly what they appear to be preparing to do, Mr. President. We're tracking 26 ships inbound to Cuba. There's no sign they're changing course. The closest ships, the Gagarin and the Kimovsk, will make the quarantine line by this time tomorrow.
L608108 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Tomorrow...
L608107 +++$+++ u3289 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ DOBRYNIN +++$+++ Tomorrow...
L608106 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ With the caveat that it is not made public in any way, shape or form.  And we must have an answer tomorrow at the latest. I cannot stress this point enough.
L608105 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Of course. Our pledge can be relayed to any government official Secretary Khruschev sees fit to satisfy.
L608104 +++$+++ u3289 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ DOBRYNIN +++$+++ And it can be relayed beyond Comrade Khruschev's ears to the top circles of my government
L608103 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Yes.
L608102 +++$+++ u3289 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ DOBRYNIN +++$+++ This private assurance represents the word of the Highest Authority?
L608117 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ Doesn't matter to me. If I went down in history like Adams, I'd die happy. All they say about him today is --
L608116 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ How does a guy get a rep like that?
L608114 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ Yeah, but the country didn't even exist as a country yet. It was a mess, and he didn't have a leg to stand on.
L608113 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ He didn't have to worry about nuclear weapons.
L608112 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ We were just debating who had it worse, us or George Washington and his guys.
L608038 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ That's all well and good, but what do we say to 'em?
L608037 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ He gets it, but he's pissed.
L607770 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ McNamara's on his way back here now. We need to pick the right ship. No subs. No armed boarding parties either. We need a little more time to figure this one out.
L607769 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ We're going to have to stop a ship eventually, show the quarantine's got teeth, or we'll prove McCone right.
L607562 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ We've got bigger problems right now.
L607561 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ We have to pull him. He's not going to be able to handle the Soviets in front of the U.N. Zorin will eat him alive.
L607560 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ Somebody had to say it. I respect Adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser.
L607559 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Goddamn Stevenson. Jesus. Peace at any price. You'd think nobody learned anything from World War Two.
L607533 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Then you'll call, right?
L607532 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ Well, I'm not.
L607523 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What if I can't?
L607522 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ I want a consensus, Bobby. Consensus. Either air strike or blockade. Something everyone'll stand by even if they don't like it. I need it by Saturday. Make it happen.
L607521 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ We're split down the middle. If I held a vote I think airstrike would beat blockade by a vote or two.
L607520 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ Lying bastard. Lied to my face.
L607510 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ We keep 'em in the dark as long as we can. But I sure as hell am going to test him.
L607509 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ There's still no sign they know that we know about the missiles. Been a lot of cloud cover; probably think we aren't getting any good product.
L607470 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ Tonight, listening to Taylor and Acheson, I kept seeing Burke and Dulles telling me all I had to do was sign on the dotted line. The invasion would succeed. Castro would be gone. Just like that. Easy.
L607469 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ As if dealing with the Russians wasn't hard enough, we gotta worry about our own house.
L607406 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ We can't worry about everything right now. We've got to figure out what we're going to do before we worry about how we do it.
L607405 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What about the allies? Congress? I think we may need to start letting key people know. And they're all scattered across the country for the campaign. We're going to need to get the U.N. staff in and warmed up. Jesus... I don't even know if we've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the Soviets got that cryptographer of ours.
L607404 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ So if there are alternatives that make sense -- and I'm not saying there are -- we need 'em. Need 'em fast.
L607403 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ He's right, Jack. Taylor is saying we may have some time. We've got to use it.
L607357 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Complete snowjob. And then we went out and told the country they weren't putting missiles into Cuba.  By the way, you realize we just lost the midterms.
L607356 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ Did you have any indication of this from Georgi? Any possible warning or sense of motivation?
L607355 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Jesus Christ, guys. What the hell's Khruschev thinking?
L607353 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Where the hell are you?
L607352 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ Good.
L608126 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Kenny. It's over.
L608125 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Yeah?
L608085 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Just wanted to see for myself.  They're burning their documents.
L608084 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Smoke.
L608083 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Slow down. Smell that?
L608079 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else.
L608078 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ We gave so much to get here. I don't know. Sometimes I think what the hell did we do it for?
L608035 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ And if there has been a coup and there is no acceptable political solution?
L608034 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ So now you've got to talk him out of it. And then we've got to figure out an acceptable political solution.
L608033 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ All right, so maybe we overestimated how reasonable this trade would look. Okay? You happy? So now what?
L608030 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ -- Jesus, Mary and Joseph. I told you how stupid it was to float the Lippman article! But you wouldn't listen to me. What if there hasn't been a coup at all? What if it's you two who invited that second letter by raising the possibility of a trade?
L608029 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ The Jupiters are obsolete. They were supposed to have been dismantled last summer anyway --
L608028 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ And Jack wants to trade the missiles in Turkey.
L608027 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ And?
L607963 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ They want us to take our missiles out of Turkey along with the no invasion pledge. It looks like Fomin was a ploy after all, and they were just stalling for time.
L607962 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ What does the letter say?
L607961 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ We're getting everyone together as fast as we can.
L607960 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ We just got a second letter from Khruschev. The deal's off.
L607959 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Helen and I went out for breakfast. EXCOM's not supposed to convene til eight.
L607958 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Where've you been? We've been trying to find you all morning.
L607832 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ He better. Because nobody thinks he's up to this. Nobody.
L607831 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Adlai can handle Zorin. He knows the inning and the score.
L607830 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ -- I'm just trying to make a point. This idea is that fucking bad.
L607829 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ My father --
L607828 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Something your father would've come up with.
L607827 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Oh, still sore about this.
L607826 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What's gotten into you?
L607825 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Then talk to your brother, goddamn it. The two of you don't need any advice to get into trouble.
L607824 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Zorin will eat him alive!
L607823 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ You can't take him out this late in the game.
L607822 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Adlai's too weak! We have to convince Jack to pull him, get McCloy in there.
L607794 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ We can't do that, Bobby.
L607793 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Rescind the order. Can all the Chiefs. Put Nitze, Gilpatric and the Undersecretaries in charge.
L607792 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Jesus...
L607766 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Give it a rest. You were thinking the same thing, just didn't have the guts to take the heat.
L607765 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What happened to speak when spoken to?
L607468 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ He's right. And things are happening too fast. It smells like the Bay of Pigs all over again.
L607467 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Jack, I'm as conniving as they come, but a sneak attack is just wrong.
L607413 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ It'll be the principals, a couple of the key guys from each department: the Executive Committee of the National Security Council. We'll call it EXCOM.
L607412 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ It's too politicized with you in there, anyway. They need to be able to stick their necks out.
L607411 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I'll do it.
L607410 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ We got a bunch of smart guys. We lock 'em up together in there, kick 'em in the ass til they come up with options.
L607409 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ They're going to be pressing for a military solution soon. We can't afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats. We need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here.
L607408 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ ...I know. CIA and the military fucked us on the Bay of Pigs.
L607407 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ The other thing is...
L607359 +++$+++ u3287 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You mean there's something more important than votes? Didn't think I'd live to see the day, Ken.
L607358 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Who gives a shit about the midterms now? The Soviets are putting nuclear weapons ninety miles away from us.
L608144 +++$+++ u3288 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BUNDY +++$+++ Says what, Kenny?
L608143 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Every day the sun comes up... says something about us.
L608141 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ It shouldn't have. But it did.
L608140 +++$+++ u3288 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BUNDY +++$+++ Yeah.
L608139 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ The sun came up today.
L607810 +++$+++ u3288 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BUNDY +++$+++ You know I don't mean they're weak.
L607809 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ -- You listen to me. Nobody, nobody, talks about my friends that way. You're fucking here right now because of the Kennedys. They may be wrong. They make mistakes. But they're not weak. The weak ones are these 'people' who can't speak their own minds.
L607808 +++$+++ u3288 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BUNDY +++$+++ Jack and Bobby are good men. But it takes a certain character, moral toughness to stand up to --
L607807 +++$+++ u3288 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BUNDY +++$+++ No it isn't. They don't trust the people that feel this way. But these people are right. And the Kennedys are wrong.  We need you to tell 'em, Kenny. They'll listen to you.
L607806 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Yes it is.
L607805 +++$+++ u3288 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BUNDY +++$+++ Christ, Ken, you know it's not that easy.
L607804 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Then they should speak up.
L607803 +++$+++ u3288 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BUNDY +++$+++ You gotta stop 'em. We know it's Jack and Bobby's idea -- they leaked it to Lippman. The military guys are going ape, and they're not alone.
L607801 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ I think it's a bad idea.
L607800 +++$+++ u3288 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BUNDY +++$+++ What did you think of Lippman's column this morning?
L607716 +++$+++ u3288 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BUNDY +++$+++ I just checked myself.  They're being issued identity cards. Call comes, and evacuation officers meet them at pre-arranged departure areas. They go by helicopter to Mount Weather. We meet them there.
L607715 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Helen just asked me what sort of arrangements we have for the families.
L607334 +++$+++ u3288 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BUNDY +++$+++ Cuba.
L607333 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ What's it about?
L607330 +++$+++ u3288 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ BUNDY +++$+++ No, Ken. I need to see him now...
L607329 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Hey, Mac. You're up bright and early.
L607943 +++$+++ u3298 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ SCALI +++$+++ 48 hours. In 48 hours there can be no deals.
L607942 +++$+++ u3290 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ FOMIN +++$+++ John. How much time?
L607941 +++$+++ u3298 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ SCALI +++$+++ Time is of the essence.
L607940 +++$+++ u3290 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ FOMIN +++$+++ And the second condition?
L607939 +++$+++ u3290 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ FOMIN +++$+++ And, of course, the U.N. must be allowed to observe the redeployment of forces from the American Southeast.
L607938 +++$+++ u3298 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ SCALI +++$+++ Yes. From the Highest Authority. There are two conditions. The U.N. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.
L607937 +++$+++ u3290 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ FOMIN +++$+++ This is from the Highest Authority?
L607936 +++$+++ u3298 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ SCALI +++$+++ That is correct.
L607935 +++$+++ u3290 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ FOMIN +++$+++ So I understand you correctly. If the missiles in Cuba were dismantled, returned to the Soviet Union, and a guarantee was made not to reintroduce them, the United States would be prepared to guarantee that it would never invade Cuba?
L607934 +++$+++ u3298 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ SCALI +++$+++ I am instructed to tell you that the American Government would respond favorably to an offer along the lines you have discussed. If this solution were raised at the U.N. by Ambassador Zorin, he would find a favorable reply from Ambassador Stevenson.
L608005 +++$+++ u3291 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ GENERAL TAYLOR +++$+++ The Soviets are in control of the SAMs. It's hard to believe with their centralized command structure that it could be an accidental launch.
L608004 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ Does this attack on our plane represent a definitive, intentional escalation on the part of the Soviets?
L607988 +++$+++ u3291 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ GENERAL TAYLOR +++$+++ Understood, sir. We need to step up the overflights, finalize our pilots' target folders in order to be able to carry out the strikes.
L607987 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ Then we have no choice.  General, issue the warning orders to our forces. They will be prepared to execute the air strikes Monday morning and the follow-on invasion according to the schedule thereafter. I'll need the official release orders on my desk Sunday night.
L607976 +++$+++ u3291 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ GENERAL TAYLOR +++$+++ Mr. President, there is another possibility we haven't considered. This may not be a coup at all.
L607975 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ So which one of you geniuses can tell me how to explain ourselves to the world? How do we work with them if there's been a hard-line coup?
L607789 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ General, the Joint Chiefs have just signaled our intent to escalate to the Soviets. You have signaled an escalation which I had no wish to signal, and which I did not approve.
L607788 +++$+++ u3291 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ GENERAL TAYLOR +++$+++ We are not at war, sir, not until we're at DEFCON 1.
L607787 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ -- I have the authority. I am the commander-in-chief of the United States, and I say when we go to war!
L607702 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ All right. Then I guess it's time.
L607701 +++$+++ u3291 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ GENERAL TAYLOR +++$+++ Still heading for Cuba.
L607700 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ Guess we can't blame Khruschev for a few patriotic farmers. And the ships?
L607492 +++$+++ u3291 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ GENERAL TAYLOR +++$+++ We've just begun the mobilization under cover of a pre-arranged exercise, sir. We're looking at another week and a half, Mr. President.
L607491 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ How long until the army is ready?
L607441 +++$+++ u3291 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ GENERAL TAYLOR +++$+++ Yes, sir. Our best option is to commence the strikes before the missiles are operational. The invasion happens eight days later.
L607440 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ Is this the Chiefs' recommendation?
L607439 +++$+++ u3291 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ GENERAL TAYLOR +++$+++ Yes, sir. We can be sure we get all the missiles, and we remove Castro so this can never happen again.
L607438 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ An invasion...
L607437 +++$+++ u3291 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ GENERAL TAYLOR +++$+++ We have high confidence in the expanded air strike option.  The problem, Mr. President, is that it's a short-term solution. Khruschev can send more missiles next month. The Chiefs and I believe we should follow up the air strikes with the full version of OPLAN 316.
L607369 +++$+++ u3291 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ GENERAL TAYLOR +++$+++ McCone's been notified and is coming back from the West coast. Carter's here, though.
L607368 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ Max.
L608122 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ No. I'm glad I'm home.
L608121 +++$+++ u3292 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I saw you out there. You want him to call you back, need you.
L607957 +++$+++ u3292 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ A thing like this... who could even think of winning?
L607956 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ -- we got a back channel communication from Khruschev this evening feeling us out about a deal. He confirmed it just a little while ago in a letter to the President. I think we've won.
L607955 +++$+++ u3292 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ If you're home it means either Jack and Bobby have finally figured out what a con man you are and fired you, or --
L607712 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ I'll be evacuated with the President.
L607711 +++$+++ u3292 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ What happens to you? I'm not leaving without you.
L607710 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Nothing. Nothing you don't know about. Tomorrow's the big day. Just have the car ready to go if I call or if the Civil Defense Warning comes on.
L607709 +++$+++ u3292 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ What's happened?
L607708 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ I don't know, Helen. I want you to keep the kids close tomorrow. Leave the T.V. on, sleep with it on in the bedroom until I tell you you can turn it off.
L607707 +++$+++ u3292 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ When are you going to be home?
L607289 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Kids are supposed to get detention.
L607288 +++$+++ u3292 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Don't forget, Mrs. Higgins wants to talk to you this afternoon about Kevin. You need to do something about this.
L607541 +++$+++ u3297 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ RESTON +++$+++ This is about Cuba.
L607540 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Well, you know how Bobby has it in for the State of Mississippi.
L607539 +++$+++ u3297 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ RESTON +++$+++ There are major rail disruptions in the South, two airborne divisions are on alert. That exercise is an invasion.
L607478 +++$+++ u3297 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ RESTON +++$+++ I'm giving you a chance here: talk to me. You can influence how this thing unfolds.
L607477 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Why don't you ask him yourself? You can have him on the way home.
L607476 +++$+++ u3297 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ RESTON +++$+++ Yeah? Who was he talking to? Acheson? Come on, O'Donnell, everyone's wondering what's going on. What's Acheson doing in town? And don't give me some bullshit about DNC think tanks. Acheson's Mr. Cold War.
L607475 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ He was.
L607474 +++$+++ u3297 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ RESTON +++$+++ Kenny! What happened? They didn't let me up front, said the President was on the phone the whole time.
L607424 +++$+++ u3297 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ RESTON +++$+++ Deal.
L607423 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Tell you what. We're in Connecticut tomorrow for Ribicoff. I'll get you up front with him during the flight.
L607422 +++$+++ u3297 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ RESTON +++$+++ It's Tuesday. You said to call. When do I get my 45 minutes?
L607327 +++$+++ u3297 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ RESTON +++$+++ Let him talk to me, he makes Macmillan look good, I print it, the British public likes it, Macmillan owes you.
L607326 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Forget it, Scotty.
L607325 +++$+++ u3297 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ RESTON +++$+++ Pretending there isn't a problem won't fix it. He can clear the air on Anglo American relations.
L607322 +++$+++ u3297 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ RESTON +++$+++ I'm doing a piece on Skybolt. I hear Macmillan's meeting with him in Nassau.
L607321 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Well. There is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about.
L607320 +++$+++ u3297 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ RESTON +++$+++ Three weeks before midterm elections? You need me.
L607319 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ I said his heart, not his attention.
L607318 +++$+++ u3297 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ RESTON +++$+++ I want an hour with him.
L607317 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Busy. But you've got his heart.
L607316 +++$+++ u3297 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ RESTON +++$+++ How's my favorite President?
L608025 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Back to work.
L608024 +++$+++ u3294 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ What about you? Where are you going?
L608023 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Get back out there, kid. Remember to hit 'em hard.
L608021 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ I, uh...
L608020 +++$+++ u3294 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ I guess you won't be coming home tonight.
L608017 +++$+++ u3294 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Yeah.
L608016 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Hey, sport. You winning?
L607292 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Wrong, and you get to wax my car.
L607291 +++$+++ u3294 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Dean Rusk!
L607290 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ Secretary of Defense...
L608058 +++$+++ u3293 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ And we do it under the table so we can disavow any knowledge of it.
L608057 +++$+++ u3299 +++$+++ m218 +++$+++ THE PRESIDENT +++$+++ We give them something. We tell them we'll remove the missiles from Turkey say, six months from now so that there appears to be no linkage. We also tell them if they go public about it, we deny it and the deal is off.
