L310955 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Yes.
L310954 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Don't be silly. Nothing you can do. Must be tough on an old woman—a trip like this.
L310953 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I better go over and see her.
L310930 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Then I'll fire you. I'll do all the parts myself.
L310929 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I refuse to resign!
L310928 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ If you don't like it, you can resign from the company.
L310927 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ You always want to run everything.
L310926 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
L310925 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Oh, you are! Who made you the manager?
L310924 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.
L310923 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ How about Cinderella—or a real hot love story?
L310922 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ After that "The Three Musketeers."  I'd make a great D'Artagnan.
L310921 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Next week "East Lynne."
L310920 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ We could start a two-person stock company. If things get tough—we can play some small town auditoriums. We'll call this one "The Great Deception."[8]
L310919 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ You weren't so bad yourself.
L310918 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Say, you were pretty good. Jumping in like that. Got a brain, haven't you?
L310909 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Peter Warne, you've gone far enough. I won't stand being insulted like this another minute.
L310908 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Aw, nuts! You're just like your old man!  Once a plumber always a plumber! There isn't an ounce of brains in your whole family!
L310907 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Yeah, and gotten yourself arrested!
L310906 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I'm sorry I didn't take another sock at him.
L310905 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Well, you were!
L310904 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Oh, so now I was drunk!
L310901 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ He didn't make a pass at me! I told you a million times!
L310900 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You don't have to lose your temper!  That's what you told me the last time too. Every time I step in to protect you. At the Elk's dance[7] when that big Swede made a pass at you—
L310899 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Well, you don't have to lose your temper!
L310898 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ There you go again! How many times did I tell you to stop butting in when I have an argument?
L310897 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Don't get excited, Peter. They just asked a civil question.
L310879 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L310878 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yeah. I got a letter from Aunt Betty. She says if we don't stop over at Wilkes-Barre she'll never forgive us.
L310874 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Don't look at me. I didn't marry King Westley.
L310873 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ That's Father at work, What'll I do?  Peter, what'll I do?
L310872 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Detectives!
L310869 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I'd change places with a plumber's daughter any day.
L310868 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Just goes to show you. Twenty millions and you don't know how to dunk.
L310867 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Thanks, professor.
L310866 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop, into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it.
L310865 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
L310864 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
L310863 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged. 
L310862 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Oh. Is that how you met him?
L310861 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ King—King Westley was in it.
L310860 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Santa Claus?
L310859 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ It has its moments. It got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father's detectives. I—I did it once; actually went shopping without a body-guard. It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral. But it didn't last long. They caught up with me in a department store. I was so mad I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car I saw. Guess who was in it?
L310858 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ One consolation; you can never be lonesome.
L310857 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Thanks. Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even body-guards. Oh, it's been a lot of fun.
L310856 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Um. You're doing all right.
L310855 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
L310854 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yeah?
L310853 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, although I don't see how I can be. People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On the contrary, I've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I've ever been alone with a man!
L310852 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ No. No. It's too good a story.
L310851 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything.
L310850 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
L310849 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
L310848 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I thought maybe—uh—"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
L310847 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Must be the Spring.
L310846 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
L310845 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this.
L310844 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint.
L310843 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Nope. No complaints.
L310842 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Egg. One egg—doughnuts—black coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
L310841 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Thank you.  My, my! Scrambled eggs.
L310840 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I know a couple of truck drivers I'd like to have you meet sometime.  Come on, sit down.
L310839 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Well, I hope you're not going to dictate whom I can talk to.
L310838 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ If you didn't waste so much time on that wise-cracking drummer—we'd have been through with breakfast by this time.
L310837 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Why, Peter! Don't you want to hear about our lovely friends?
L310836 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Hurry up and get dressed.
L310835 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Very outspoken, too. Said I looked funny. Wasn't that cute?
L310832 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I met some very interesting women at the showers. We got to chatting about this and that. You know how time files.
L310831 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ High time you got back.
L310821 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I'll find it myself.
L310820 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Your hair's cute like that. You should never comb it.
L310819 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Where is the shower?
L310818 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Hey—you're little, aren't you?
L310817 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Where'd you say the showers—and things—were? 
L310815 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Here—take mine.
L310814 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Like this. I have no robe.
L310813 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Like what?
L310812 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I can't go out like this.
L310811 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside.
L310810 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Outside!
L310809 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You'll find the showers—and things—right back of the second cottage. 
L310804 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Listen, Brat—I'm going to count to ten. If you're not out of bed by then I'm going to yank you out myself.
L310803 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed? 
L310802 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.
L310801 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ What is it?  Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks.  You—you had it pressed.
L310800 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Here—
L310768 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ The pleasure is all mine.
L310767 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne ...
L310766 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning.
L310765 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Peter Warne? I don't like it.
L310764 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne.
L310763 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ You've got a name, haven't you?
L310762 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Who, me?  Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.
L310761 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Who are you?
L310756 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Not at all. 
L310755 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Do you mind putting out the light?
L310750 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Smart aleck!
L310749 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I have an idiosyncrasy all my own. You'll notice my coat came first—then the tie—then the shirt—now, according to Hoyle,[5] the pants should come next. But that's where I'm different.  go for the shoes first. After that I—
L310746 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ All right, don't join the Israelites. Perhaps you're interested in how a man undresses.  Funny thing about that. Quite a study in psychology. No two men do it alike. 
L310745 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ You're not really serious about this, are you?
L310744 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Do you mind joining the Israelites?
L310743 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Oh, this?—I like privacy when I retire. I'm very delicate in that respect. Prying eyes annoy me.  Behold the walls of Jericho![4] Maybe not as thick as the ones that Joshua blew down with his trumpet, but a lot safer. You see, I have no trumpet.  Now just to show you my heart's in the right place, I'll give you my best pair of pajamas.
L310742 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ That, I suppose, makes everything—uh—quite all right.
L310741 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Oh, yeah? It's all right with me. Go on out in the storm, but I'm going to follow you, see?  Yeah. And if you get tough I'll just have to turn you over to your old man right now. Savvy?  Now that's my whole plot in a nutshell. A simple story for simple people. Now if you behave yourself, I'll see that you get to King Westley; if not, I'll just have to spill the beans to papa. Now which of these beds do you prefer? This one? All right.
L310740 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Well, thank you. Thank you very much, but— you've been very kind. 
L310739 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ This?  Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishments. 
L310738 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Now isn't that just too cute? There's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there? You've got everything nicely figured out, for yourself, including this.
L310737 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Chalk up one for your side. Now listen, you want to get to King Westley, don't you?  All right, I'm here to help you. What I want is your story, exclusive. A day-to- day account. All about your mad flight to happiness. I need that story. Just between you and me I've got to have it.
L310733 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yeah. Yeah, not bad. How's your's?
L310732 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Your ego is colossal.
L310731 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I kind of half expected you to thank me.
L310730 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Oh, you did? What am I expected to do—leap for joy?
L310729 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Oh, I forgot to tell you. I registered as Mr. and Mrs. 
L310728 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband.
L310727 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift. 
L310726 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Darn clever, these Armenians.
L310721 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yeah. Come on—we're stopping here for the night.
L310720 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Are you talking to me!
L310719 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Hey, Brat—!  The VIEW moves to the rear door of the bus. Ellie stands on the bottom step.
L310706 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Shut up!
L310705 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Now, just a minute—you can't—
L310704 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You're on a budget from now on.
L310703 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ That's none of your business.
L310702 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ A dollar sixty! . . . You had four dollars last night! How do you expect to get to New York at the rate you're going?
L310701 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ You have your nerve!  Here, boy—!
L310700 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Beat it! 
L310699 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Of course I do. What do you mean—
L310694 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ No. It'd be useless. Father'd get the wire before they would.
L310693 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What'd you do? Wire one of your friends for money?
L310692 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Here, boy!
L310690 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Forget it. I didn't do it for you. His voice got on my nerves.
L310689 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ If you promise not to snap my head off, I'd like to thank you.
L310658 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Never mind. You know I had you pegged right from the start, you're the spoiled brat of a rich father. The only way you can get anything is to buy it. Now you're in a jam and all you can think of is your money. It never fails, does it? Ever hear of the word "Humility"? No, you wouldn't. I guess it never occurred to you to just say, "Please mister, I'm in trouble. Will you help me?" No; that'd bring you down off your high horse for a minute. Let me tell you something; maybe it'd take a load off your mind. You don't have to worry about me. I'm not interested in your money or your problems. You, King Westley, your father, you're all a lot of hooey to me.
L310657 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Listen, if you'll promise not to do it, I'll pay you. I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I'm willing to make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York.
L310656 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I never thought of that.
L310655 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ If you play your cards right, you might get some money out of it. 
L310654 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What for?
L310653 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ You're not going to notify my father, are you?
L310652 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ That's right. You didn't.
L310651 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I didn't ask for your advice. 
L310650 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Take my advice—grab the first bus back to Miami. That guy's a phony.
L310649 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Quit kidding!  It's all over the front pages, You know, I've always been curious about the kind of a girl that would marry King Westley.
L310648 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ You must have me confused with—
L310647 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.
L310646 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Will you please tell me what you're raving about!
L310645 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team.
L310644 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L310643 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. 
L310642 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Oh, thank you. Must have fallen out of my pocket.
L310641 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I found it on the seat.
L310640 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ My ticket?
L310639 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.  Here's your ticket.
L310638 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Don't tell me you did it on my account!  hope you're not getting any idea that what happened last night is—  You needn't concern yourself about me, young man. I can take care of myself.
L310636 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ What are you excited about? You missed the bus, too.
L310635 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What's the matter? Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you?  Say, how old are you anyway? Don't you know these busses work on a schedule? You need a guardian.
L310631 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Seems to me I've already thanked you for that.  What time is the next bus to New York?
L310630 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Remember me? I'm the fellow you slept on last night.
L310617 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ No, thank you.  Thank you so much.
L310616 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I hated to wake you up.  How about some breakfast?
L310615 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ That was foolish of me. Why didn't you shove me away?
L310614 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yes.
L310613 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Oh, thank you.  We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?
L310608 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Why, you ungrateful brat!
L310607 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported!  Please stay out of my affairs!  I want to be left alone.  A CLOSE-UP of PETER shows him glaring after her.
L310606 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Why, that's ridiculous! They're responsible for everything that—
L310605 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I don't want it reported!
L310604 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Don't be a fool. You lost your bag. The company'll make good. What's your name?
L310603 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ No. I'd rather you didn't.
L310602 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean.
L310601 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Why, no—I—  Yes . . . I guess I will.
L310600 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You can wire home for some money when we get to Jacksonville.
L310599 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ No, I've got that, all right. But my money. All I have here is four dollars. I've got to get to New York with it.
L310598 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Don't tell me your ticket was in it?
L310597 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ What am I going to do now?
L310596 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ That cadaverous-looking yegg who sat in front of us, just up and took it. Boy, how that baby can run!
L310595 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ What happened?
L310594 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yeah. I knew you'd catch on eventually.
L310593 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Oh, my heavens! It's gone!
L310592 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Well—of all the—well—  Maybe you'll be interested to know your bag's gone.
L310591 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I don't know what you're raving about, young man. And, furthermore, I'm not interested.
L310587 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Yes. Tell that man to drive slowly.
L310586 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Are you talking to me?
L310585 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Tell that man not to drive so fast. 
L310575 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Driver!
L310574 +++$+++ u1548 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to you—  scram.
L310573 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I beg your pardon!
L311262 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Won't I ever see you again?
L311261 +++$+++ u1549 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER'S VOICE +++$+++ Not interested. 
L311260 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ No harm in your coming to see us.
L311254 +++$+++ u1549 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER'S VOICE +++$+++ Yep! The Walls of Jericho. 
L311253 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Is that the Walls of Jericho going up?
L311132 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ You sound like a hobo.
L311131 +++$+++ u1549 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER'S VOICE +++$+++ I just want to be let alone, that's all. Life's swell if you don't try too hard. Most people want to get a strangle-hold on it. They're not living. They're just feverish.  If they didn't get themselves all balled up with a lot of manufactured values, they'd find what they want. Peace and calm. When you get right down to it, what's all the shootin' for, will you tell me? After all, you can only eat three meals a day, only sleep in one bed—  Right now, that hay feels pretty good to you, doesn't it? Sure it does. 'Cause you were tired—and it's the only thing around.
L311126 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Do you know?
L311125 +++$+++ u1549 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER'S VOICE +++$+++ Comical part of it is, it isn't what you want at all. In a couple of weeks you'll be looking for the nearest exit . . .  People like you spend all your life on a merry-go-round. I guess that's what makes you so dizzy.  You're always chasing after something. At least you think you are. Truth is, you're just running away.  From yourself, mostly. 'Cause you're miserable. You hate yourself. The world's full of people like you. Don't know what they want.
L311094 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Well, I am.
L311093 +++$+++ u1549 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER'S VOICE +++$+++ You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.
L311092 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ No, it isn't. I'm hungry and—and scared.
L310885 +++$+++ u1549 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ PETER'S VOICE +++$+++ Who—me?  Want to see me?
L310884 +++$+++ u1535 +++$+++ m103 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ There's a man here to see you, Sweetheart.
