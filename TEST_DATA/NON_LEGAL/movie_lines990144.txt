L401878 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ I wanted to let his family know....
L401877 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ You didn't think about it did you ? I read your file. It said you had a nervous breakdown.
L401876 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ I... I .....
L401874 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ I'm in charge of the conversions.  When First Bank buys another smaller bank, I'm in charge of converting them to our systems and way of doing things.
L401873 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ What do you do with the company, if I might ask ?
L401872 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ How can you just take a life ? I mean it's a life, life is so precious.  How does it feel ?
L401871 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ This is New York. No one notices anyone. Not even when someone disappears. At first it was the guy who was caught trying to steal McCay's Jag. Then it was dirty accountants that tried to walk away with millions. The Old Man got such a rush from it, I thought that he would start trying to send me people who used the copier after hours.
L401870 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ Doesn't anyone notice all the people missing ?
L401869 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I've since changed my mind. I designed this place, based on my belief that I was doing what the legal system couldn't or wouldn't do. McCay had the company buy the property and they pay the bills. It's a tax write off. On the books everything looks kosher. I have an office on 5th that I haven't seen in ten years.
L401868 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ And you believe that ?
L401867 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ McCay had a lot money done into researching psychological reactions to questions that are seemingly unrelated, but reveal everything. Like criminal impulses, homicidal impulses.....
L401866 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ What do you mean ?
L401865 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ There's more to it than trying to see if you'd steal from the company or if you'd lie or cheat.
L401864 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ Yeah, everyone has to when they get hired.
L401863 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ There are other things too. They had everyone start taking those psych tests. Did they make you take one ?
L401862 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ So you may have been duped this whole time. Killing innocent people, that must make you feel ..., how does it feel ?
L401861 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ It was there, clear as day. I saw the computer records. Matthew has been fed wiring money to his personal account.  I just knew something was wrong.
L401860 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ Then how come Matt and I showed up as guilty ?
L401859 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I do a very thorough background check. I go through police files, personel files, anything.
L401858 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ But how do you know if the people are guilty ?
L401857 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I was lured by all the money and I truly did convince myself that what I did was for justice. Since then, McCay has wanted to put anyone he can down here.
L401849 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I was hired in and started to do the boring old work routine. I was originally brought in as a technical advisor. First Bank had sponsored my scholarships.
L401848 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ He hired you to build this place ?
L401847 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering. That's when John McCay hired me.
L401846 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ Do you have something better to talk about ?
L401845 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Is this really the time ?
L401844 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ Why did you build this whole place ?
L401843 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Excuse me ?
L401842 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ So why this ?
L401840 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I'd say about thirty to forty minutes. Give or take a few.
L401839 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ How long till the room fills ?
L401838 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Once the room depletes it's oxygen, we have about 30 seconds, then a door opens on the bottom over there. Then we swim out.
L401837 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ Obviously, but what's the way out ?
L401836 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ We drown.
L401835 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ What's the trick here ?
L401829 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ At the subway station, we can get into a power duct that my little shit head of an assistant doesn't know about.
L401828 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ I'm listening.
L401827 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Look, there's another train. They'll send it through here. You're fucked if you don't STOP and listen to me.
L401826 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ Not listening !
L401825 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ It won't take them that long to figure out we weren't on the train when it wrecked.
L401807 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ You've been doing a bang up job so far. Right now Matt is probably dead and it's your fault.
L401806 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Hey ! I'm still your best chance to get out of here alive.
L401805 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ I'm not listening.
L401804 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ So you're telling me you were set up ? I knew something was wrong.
L401793 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ Why would he ? His parents are rich.
L401792 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Then he isn't embezzling either is he ?
L401791 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ NO ! I wouldn't do that.
L401790 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Then you didn't give him any passwords of any kind ?
L401789 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ I'M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW !
L401788 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ If you hadn't started boffing that weasel with an attitude, you wouldn't be here.
L401787 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ Look I don't even wanna know how I got in this mess. I just want out. It has nothing to do with me.
L401786 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ You took an awful big risk back there.
L401785 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ What ?
L401784 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Hey ! Hey ! I'm talking to you !
L401779 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ I'm leaving.
L401778 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ What are you doing ?
L401769 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Knows ? He watches every "Guest" on tape. This whole place is here for his sick amusement. And no so are we.
L401768 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ McCay knows ?
L401767 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ It's a tax write off for John C. McCay.
L401766 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ First Bank ? But how ?
L401765 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ It's called Murderland. It's paid for by First Bank.
L401764 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ Who the hell are you anyway ? What is this place ?
L401763 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I'm working on it.
L401762 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ So what do we do ?
L401761 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ No where. We've got about seven minutes before this thing slams into a concrete wall.
L401760 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ So where does this lead ?
L401739 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Give me a fucking.....
L401738 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ Come on, it works.
L401730 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ You have issues. I mean you have some serious issues that need to be ironed out.
L401729 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ There's enough force to push you twenty feet in the air. It won't kill you, but it will hurt.
L401726 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ We have to climb up that.
L401725 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ Now what the hell are we supposed to do ?
L401717 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ We wait. This is an elevator.
L401716 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ How do we get out of this room ?
L401697 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I don't know.
L401696 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ Now where do we go ?
L401667 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ I'm not fucking him..
L401666 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords.
L401665 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
L401664 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ You're both embezzling. I saw the records.
L401663 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ You said we were criminals, what did you mean ?
L401662 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Why should I ?
L401661 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ Why don't you tell us what the fuck is going on ?
L401648 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ No !
L401647 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Leave him, he's dead.
L401646 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ What about Matt ?
L401636 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I made this place..... now listen to me. I'll get out of this room, we have bigger troubles than this....
L401635 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ Why should we trust you ?
L401600 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ No time. Get him up.
L401599 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ Where are we ?
L401582 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Please don't be alarmed, Ma'am.
L401581 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ What's going on ?
L401580 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ You have 43 unpaid parking tickets, sir. You have the right to remain silent, anything you say can & will be held.....
L401981 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Don't have to tell me twice.
L401980 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ He's the liaison for McCay. Listen go. Go now.
L401975 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ In the jail cell is a spiral staircase. It leads to the surface. Take it all the way up.
L401974 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Where ?
L401973 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Almost. Look, you two get out of here.
L401972 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Is it over ?
L401750 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Thanks...
L401749 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Knock yourself out.
L401748 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ This probably isn't the bet time, but I really have to pee. Can I pee ?
L401741 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Ow...
L401740 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ You okay ?
L401737 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Swimming, you know, like in water, moron.
L401736 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ What the fuck are you talking about.
L401735 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Hey, try swimming. It works.
L401732 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ That's cute asshole.
L401731 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Issues ??? This guy has the damn subscription to every psychotic issue I've ever heard of.
L401728 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Look...
L401727 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ That's not to tough.
L401724 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Look pipsqueak, I'm having a real bad day here and we're just starting.
L401723 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Why don't you tell us a little about yourself ?
L401722 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ It's fine thanks.
L401719 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Yeah, we're about a hundred an fifty feet below the subway stations. We're heading a little higher up now.
L401718 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ An elevator ?
L401713 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ You were one of those guys that played Dungeons & Dragons with real swords, weren't you.
L401712 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ The room has sound sensors. If you wake it up, it breathes fire.
L401711 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Are you hunting wabbits ?
L401710 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Be very, very quiet...
L401709 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ So what happened ? Did you have a real bad theme park experience as a kid and this is your revenge ?
L401708 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ A dragon.
L401707 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ What's next Walt ?
L401699 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I did, but this room has four exits and only one opens, it's up to them in the control room. There's one right over there. The exit light is on, but he can change it.
L401698 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ I thought you made this place ?
L401688 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Why ?
L401687 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I'd get out of the water if I were you.
L401686 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ That's nice.  I think I lost my wallet.
L401680 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Not quite....
L401679 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Is it over ?
L401660 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Because of my charming personality ?
L401659 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Give me one good reason why I don't plug you right here, right now ? 
L401651 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I don't help criminals.
L401650 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Hey buddy, thanks for the help back there !
L401641 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ And that's different than this because...... ?
L401640 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Either you'll be shot with bullets, impaled with a large spike, or nailed like a super model. Basically you're fucked any way you go.
L401639 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Okay, NOW I'm worried. What exactly is on the other side of the door ?
L401634 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Trust me, if you open any door, you'll be dead a whole lot sooner.
L401633 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Wait for what ? i don't wanna alarm you but we'll be the special at the International House of Pancakes in about five minutes !
L401632 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ NO ! Don't open ANY of them ! They're all wrong. Just wait.
L401626 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I told him not to sit down in there.....
L401625 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ OUCH !!! GODDAMMIT that hurts !!!!
L401622 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Just shut the fuck up.
L401621 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Who are you anyway ? What the hell is this ?
L401620 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ NO. Don't. You'll get a shock from hell if you touch that seat.
L401584 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ 43 unpaid parking tickets, sir.
L401583 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Kojak here is arresting me for unpaid parking tickets.
L401579 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Hey , Hey !
L401578 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ That's very funny, sir. You are under arrest.
L401577 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or something ?
L401576 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Are you Matthew Parker ?
L401997 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ For once in your life, shut the fuck up.
L401996 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ You think I'm that easy, Bitch ?
L401894 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I'm sick of playing. I've got a better idea.
L401893 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Why don't you just stop fucking around and just die !
L401557 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Checking........
L401556 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ A real criminal.... I still think that's our in... What about her ?
L401555 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Yeah, but we're talking 43.
L401554 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Parking tickets ? That's it ?
L401553 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Checking..... Hah ! He has a shit load of unpaid parking tickets...
L401552 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Any priors ? Any police record ?
L401551 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Matthew lives on the Upper West Side, kinda posh for a temp don't you think ?
L401550 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Yeah, maybe.... Let's start the background checks. Let's see where they live and what kind of security systems....
L401549 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ He probably has a history of this shit.
L401548 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ He already had a balance of $600,000.
L401547 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ So ?
L401546 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I see here that this guy has made deposits into his own account for the last four months. Each one in the amount of $100,000. He then puts in deposits into his girlfriends account.
L401545 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ I just want to double check the facts.
L401544 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ What's wrong ?
L401515 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ That's right. Now who needs to trust who ? Trust me, when you're ready to work the controls, I'll put you in the hot seat.
L401514 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ You did.
L401513 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ And who bailed you out when a hit was put on you, you sorry sack of shit. Who put you up ? Who gave you a job ?
L401512 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ I made my bones on the street, you know. I did Riglioni in his own house. I was made in the Family, okay.
L401511 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ No.
L401510 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ I've been working with you for four years, don't you think that's worthy of at least one turn at the controls ?
L401509 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Not down here. I'll start trusting you when I feel there the time is right. It's not personal, it's just survival.
L401508 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ RESPECT is earned not given away, trust is given away to anybody.
