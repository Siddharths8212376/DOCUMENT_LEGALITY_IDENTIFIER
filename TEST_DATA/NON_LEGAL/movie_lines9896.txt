L265290 +++$+++ u5771 +++$+++ m381 +++$+++ STARLING +++$+++ Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.

L265288 +++$+++ u5771 +++$+++ m381 +++$+++ STARLING +++$+++ Sir, various drawings, done by Dr. Lechter, while in prison, stolen from the prison after his escape, have surfaced and are being sold at auction.  Several large reserve bids have been placed on them.  I have to ask if you've placed those bids.
