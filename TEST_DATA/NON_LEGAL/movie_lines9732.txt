L151579 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ It is so hot in here.
L151578 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Charming Carlton.
L151570 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Oh my god. I've never had that before. I've had guys say they want me to suck their dicks and gross stuff but no one's ever said "Hey there beautiful."
L151569 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I think he called you beautiful.
L151568 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ What did he say?
L151566 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ You're just saying that.
L151565 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Well whatever it was, seems to have worked cause you look great.
L151564 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I started out on that eye-of-newt diet the doctor gave me and wound up in the tub covered in chocolate.
L151559 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Great. George is meeting Carlton first for drinks. We can meet and go together. It'll be a blast.
L151558 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Okay. I guess so.
L151557 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ No he didn't. Come on, I don't want to be alone with those two. All they talk about is basketball and it bores the hell out of me.
L151555 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Hey, Carlton's in town -- come out with the three of us.
L151554 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ It's just as well. I'm afraid of getting hurt again. Mark seemed great at first too. I don't want to get too attached to Peter and then find out he's a creep.
L151553 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Frida, this hair thing is all in your head. You're using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone.
L151552 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ We almost slept together... and... then the hair started and I booked.
L151551 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ How'd it go with the cop?
L151550 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I looked like an Italian man!
L151549 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ You have to stop being so self- critical Frida.
L151548 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I'm freaking out. I'm like an animal and totally out of control. My arms keep getting really hairy.
L151527 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ You're at his place, and you come out of the bathroom looking all shy and say, "I'm so embarrassed but could you run out and get me some tampons?" If he says no, he's too embarrassed, then you know he's a wus. If he says he's got some in the bathroom, then you know there are other women around a lot. But if he says yes and goes to get you tampons, well then he's a decent guy. Then, while he's out...
L151526 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ What the hell is the tampon test?
L151525 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Give him the tampon test.
L151524 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I don't know much about him. How do you know if a guy is decent?
L151523 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Hmmm. Sounds suspicious.
L151522 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I don't think I've ever actually liked anyone I've dated before. Peter even likes me without makeup.
L151436 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Frida, I'm your friend. I'm not judging you... You didn't sleep with the creep did you?
L151435 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I'm sorry. I didn't want you to think I was still a doormat.
L151434 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Why didn't you tell me? You said you hadn't seen him for a month.
L151433 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
L151432 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Gross, so this is Mark's flesh? When did you see him?
L151420 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ He wasn't wearing a ring. But you don't want to date a cop Frida. They're so blue collar.
L151419 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I wonder if he's married.
L151418 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Rule one: always wear make-up.
L151417 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ He was cute, huh? Of course whenever I meet a guy, I'm wearing no make-up.
L151416 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Uh huh... good thing those cops didn't see that.
L151415 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No, Mark wears boxers. They must have been in the dryer already.
L151414 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Are those Mark's?
L151413 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ My vision got worse again.
L151412 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I thought you were going to stop wearing your glasses.
L151411 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ And my bra finally fits again.
L151410 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ At least your PMS is over.
L151409 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I think I went in and fell asleep. I guess Gregory walked home and got killed! I blacked out.
L151408 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ And then?
L151407 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ He was trying to get into my apartment and... I know this sounds gross but I was so turned on. I grabbed him and kissed him!
L151406 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ What? Why the hell did he do that?
L151405 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I couldn't stop eating steak. I felt out of control -- like I was making up for all those years being a vegetarian. I couldn't get enough. And then Gregory walked me home... and he peed in front of me.
L151404 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I guess you're off that vegetarian kick you've been on for ten years.
L151403 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with Gregory.
L151402 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Did you get smashed or what? You have to eat if you're drinking. And not just those little salads.
L151401 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I don't remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone.
L151400 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ You don't think so? You either did or your didn't.
L151399 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No. I don't think so.
L151398 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ No, did you fuck him?
L151397 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Did I kill him? Of course not!
L151396 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ So did you do it?
L151395 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ To sound like big macho cops. He was probably just found with a knife in his back.
L151394 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Why would they exaggerate?
L151393 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I'm sure they were exaggerating.
L151392 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ And he was ripped limb from limb?
L151391 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ There you go, blaming yourself for everything again.
L151390 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ He's dead? Am I bad luck or what?
L151322 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Oh, my glasses! Maybe my eyes got stronger from not wearing them.
L151321 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Hey, did you get contacts?
L151320 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ You are not Frida, we all have a little hair there. I didn't even notice till you showed me. We can bleach that, it's no big deal.
L151319 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Holy shit, I'm a freak.
L151318 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
L151317 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Where? Where do you think a mustache would be. Look!
L151316 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Where?
L151314 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ They better. Of course, trouble is, you never know what they'll expect for it. You gotta know what to order, and what you're willing to do. Like if a guy spends a fortune on you, he's gonna feel like you owe him something.
L151313 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I never thought of it like that. I never know what to do on dates. Do guys still pay?
L151312 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Are you kidding? He might as well say, "Can I date rape you?"
L151311 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Maybe they have to pee.
L151310 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ What I really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment. "Can I use your phone?" "How about a nightcap?" "I want to meet your cat." And my all-time favorite, the old standby, "I have to use your bathroom."
L151309 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ You're so lucky you have George and don't need to go on dates anymore.
L151308 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Maybe he likes you, ever think of that? It's good for you to go out -- get your mind off Mark.
L151307 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Why did Gregory ask me out? I mean he's cute -- he probably just wants to pitch his screenplay idea.
L151248 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I kind of asked him to. We were, you know... he got a little carried away...
L151247 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ George bit you?
L151246 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room.
L151245 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I think she broke the skin.
L151244 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Even on sale that stuff's a fortune. I worked all week to pay for a bra.
L151243 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ And she got the medium.
L151242 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Can you believe she fuckin' bit me?
L151236 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Frida, grab that red one.
L151235 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Where are all the mediums?
L151230 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ There's a sale. It's such a nice place -- classical music, relaxing atmosphere. You deserve to pamper yourself. Come on, it can't hurt.
L151229 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I don't know.
L151228 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ It's not about him seeing you in it. It's how you feel. You'll feel sexy in lingerie and it'll show. It's an inner thing.
L151227 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ What do I need overpriced fancy underwear for? Shouldn't a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie?
L151226 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Okay, just one more stop and you'll be all set. Victoria's Secret.
L151207 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Or if your boyfriend's an asshole.
L151206 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Or if there's a full moon.
L151201 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Try to get through dinner without them. You have beautiful eyes.
L151200 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.
L151199 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Can't you get contacts?
L151198 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Only to see.
L151197 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Do you really need these?
L151196 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ You're just saying that.
L151195 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ How about I give you a make-over? You'll feel better about yourself. You're actually pretty, you're just not bringing it out.
L151184 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I'd kill for just a little bloated.
L151183 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I get a little bloated sometimes.
L151182 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Sorry. It's just so bad lately. You're so lucky you never get PMS.
L151181 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Frida, I don't mean this as a criticism, but you might not want to talk about PMS around men.
L151180 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ My date always pays more attention to you than to me.
L151179 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Maybe he's just shy.
L151178 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ He hasn't said one word to me.
L151168 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ People notice you Frida.
L151167 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I wonder what it's like being you. Being noticed all the time.
L151164 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ So don't look in his eyes.
L151163 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I guess I have a weakness for him. It's those big brown Bambi eyes.
L151162 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Every woman at some point has to date a musician. I wish you'd get rid of Mark for good. Every time you break up you see him more than when you were going out.
L151161 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ He's a very talented musician.
L151160 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Your shrink always gives you bad advice. He only hears what you choose to tell him. Mark's an asshole, he cheated, he borrowed money and never paid it back, he's never had a regular job.
L151159 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ My shrink says he's not so bad.
L151158 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Anything's better than Mark.
L151157 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Translation: a total geek.
L151156 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Well that's not going to happen tonight. George said Carlton's a nice guy.
L151155 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Yeah even then look what happened: Michael Mortenson kissed you and Billy Sullivan threw a worm at me.
L151154 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Come on, we've been double dating since the fourth grade.
L151153 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I have cramps. I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
L151358 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Yeah. Whip it out. You want me to see it -- that's what this is all about, right?
L151357 +++$+++ u4731 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ So pee? Here?
L151356 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Uh huh. So pee.
L151355 +++$+++ u4731 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ I wouldn't mind doin' something else, but I do really have to pee.
L151354 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ You're just saying that to get into my apartment and then you're hoping that'll turn into something else.
L151353 +++$+++ u4731 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ Yes I do have to pee!
L151352 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ You don't have to pee.
L151351 +++$+++ u4731 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ Knock what off?
L151350 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Oh come on. Knock it off.
L151349 +++$+++ u4731 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ That's okay. I just have to use the bathroom and then I'll leave.
L151348 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ My apartment's just such a mess.
L151347 +++$+++ u4731 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ I didn't have to pee then.
L151346 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ You should have gone at the restaurant.
L151345 +++$+++ u4731 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ I really gotta pee.
L151344 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ What?
L151342 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Well I have it worse than cramps. Goodnight Gregory.
L151341 +++$+++ u4731 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ They say sex is great for cramps.
L151340 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS.
L151339 +++$+++ u4731 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ Come on, didn't all that steak make you thirsty?
L151338 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I'm really tired.
L151337 +++$+++ u4731 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ Hey, how about a little nightcap?
L151336 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I'd really feel more comfortable paying for my half of the dinner.
L151334 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ That's great. Highly original.
L151333 +++$+++ u4731 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ Well, whattdaya think?
L151332 +++$+++ u4731 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ So there I was, hanging from the edge of a bridge, when my mom said, "Son, you got into Harvard!" It took three of them to pull me back! Frida keeps eating.
L151328 +++$+++ u4731 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ You said you're starving. Come on, I can't stand a woman who won't eat.
L151327 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I'm not really hungry after all.
L151326 +++$+++ u4731 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ Man I'm starving too, I think I'll go for the Surf and Turf.
L151324 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Starving.
L151323 +++$+++ u4731 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ You hungry?
L151276 +++$+++ u4731 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ No, I'm serious. How about we have dinner and I tell you about it?
L151275 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ You're kidding, really?
L151274 +++$+++ u4731 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ Oh, a D-Girl. You know... I have a really great idea for a screenplay.
L151273 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I do development for TV movies.
L151272 +++$+++ u4731 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ So you're Grant's secretary?
L151271 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I know.
L151762 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Take your shower.
L151761 +++$+++ u4734 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Wow.
L151760 +++$+++ u4734 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Yeah?
L151759 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Mark.
L151756 +++$+++ u4734 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ I just need a place to lay low for a few days. Come on, I know you hate me but you can't wanna see me at the bottom of the East River?
L151755 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ My bra is my biggest supporter.
L151754 +++$+++ u4734 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ Come on, I'm your biggest supporter.
L151753 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Somehow this winds up being my fault? You always blame me.
L151752 +++$+++ u4734 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ It's the truth. If you'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened.
L151751 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ You think that story's gonna make me loan you money?
L151750 +++$+++ u4734 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ These guys aren't the kind that'll take an apology. They're the kind that'll break my thumbs.
L151749 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ So pay them back and apologize.
L151748 +++$+++ u4734 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MARK +++$+++ I did something stupid. I had a courier job -- picking up a package from the airport. It turned out to be money -- so I kind of borrowed it to pay my rent and now these dudes are after me.
