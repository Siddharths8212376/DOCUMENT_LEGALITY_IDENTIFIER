L472407 +++$+++ u7305 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ MERCUTIO +++$+++ Consort? What does thou make us minstrels? An thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing of discords. Here's my fiddlestick. Here's that shall make you dance! Zounds, Consort!
L472406 +++$+++ u7309 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ TYBALT +++$+++ Mercutio! Thou art consortest with Romeo?
L472405 +++$+++ u7305 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ MERCUTIO +++$+++ Could you not take some occasion without giving?
L472404 +++$+++ u7309 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ TYBALT +++$+++ You shall find me apt enough to that, sir. And you will give me occasion.
L472403 +++$+++ u7305 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ MERCUTIO +++$+++ OH, and but one word with one of us? Couple it with something. Make it a word and a...a blow.
L472402 +++$+++ u7309 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ TYBALT +++$+++ Follow me close. Gentlemen, gooday. A word with one of you?
L472452 +++$+++ u7307 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ ROMEO +++$+++ As if that name, Shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her, as that name's cursed hand did murder her kinsman.
L472451 +++$+++ u7306 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ O, she says nothing sir, but weeps and weeps, and then on Romeo cries and then falls down again.
L472450 +++$+++ u7306 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ Sir. Ah, sir. Death the end of all
L472449 +++$+++ u7307 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ ROMEO +++$+++ Nurse.
L472378 +++$+++ u7307 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ ROMEO +++$+++ Bid her to come to confession this afternoon; And there she shall at Father Laurence' cell Be shrived and married.
L472377 +++$+++ u7306 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ If ye should lead her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say: for the lady is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing, and very weak dealing.
L472279 +++$+++ u7306 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ His name is Romeo, and he's a Montague; The only son of your great enemy.
L472278 +++$+++ u7307 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ ROMEO +++$+++ Is she a Capulet?
L472277 +++$+++ u7306 +++$+++ m493 +++$+++ NURSE +++$+++ Madam, your mother craves a word with you. Come lets away.
L472852 +++$+++ u7314 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ GREGOR +++$+++ As my American friend Larry would say: are you fucking deaf?  It's under your seat.
L472851 +++$+++ u7310 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DAPPER GENT +++$+++ What?
L472850 +++$+++ u7314 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ GREGOR +++$+++ It's under your seat.
L472848 +++$+++ u7314 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ GREGOR +++$+++ To make a point.  I don't know her, and I was ready to splatter her brains all over the sidewalk.  I don't particularly like you, so imagine what I'll do if you try anything...
L472847 +++$+++ u7310 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DAPPER GENT +++$+++ Why did you do that?
L472841 +++$+++ u7310 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DAPPER GENT +++$+++ You know it is.
L472840 +++$+++ u7314 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ GREGOR +++$+++ Do you really think so?
L472839 +++$+++ u7310 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DAPPER GENT +++$+++ This is important.
L472838 +++$+++ u7314 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ GREGOR +++$+++ Always in a rush, you are.  All these years I've known you, you could never wait for anything.
L472837 +++$+++ u7310 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DAPPER GENT +++$+++ Do you have it?
L473280 +++$+++ u7323 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ I'm up for that...
L473279 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ I don't know.  I was thinking...Maybe the three of us might partner up -- guns for hire, that sort of thing.
L473278 +++$+++ u7323 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ So where do you go from here?
L473277 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ Only the stupid ones.  Cigarettes kill more patriots than bullets.  Besides, I'm not IRA no more.
L472815 +++$+++ u7323 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ I don't want you dead, woman, I want the the truth!
L472814 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ You go shoot me if you want, Vincent, but you'll be dead before I hit the ground.
L472813 +++$+++ u7323 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ And I don't believe you...
L472812 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ Well I don't!
L472811 +++$+++ u7323 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ When this whole thing started you made it clear: you're running the show.  And I don't believe you'd be running this show if you didn't know what was going on.
L472810 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ I don't know.
L472809 +++$+++ u7323 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Finding this package is a thing easier said than done.  We don't even know what it is.  What did we steal?
L472808 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ Of course.
L472789 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ Very good.  Now all we have to do is live long enough to get paid.
L472788 +++$+++ u7323 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ And then Sam, you and I clean up whatever's left to be cleaned.
L472780 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ Leaving...
L472779 +++$+++ u7323 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ While Sam and I take out the back two cars...
L472730 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ Is that right?
L472729 +++$+++ u7323 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ We kept it...
L472607 +++$+++ u7323 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Of course.
L472606 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ Coordinate all you want, but make sure whatever you do gets cleared through me.  Are we in sync on this, Vincent?
L472901 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ I drink what every civilized man, woman and child in the world drinks: Guinness.
L472900 +++$+++ u7316 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Oh yeah?  Whatta you drink, then?
L472899 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ Budweiser?  You talk to me of beer and you've the unbridled gall to mention Budweiser in the same sentence?  That's not beer!  Christ, it's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss.
L472898 +++$+++ u7316 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for me, thanks.
L472897 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ Best beer in the world known to man or God.
L472896 +++$+++ u7316 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ What is?
L472895 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ Some places, not all.  Italy, for instance, they're serious about their food.  But try bloody Britain, anywhere in the U.K., you don't get much fancier than a deep-fried bar egg.  Food's not our thing, you see.
L472894 +++$+++ u7316 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ This...this is incredible. Is the rest of Europe like this?
L472828 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ That's why you were riding with him.
L472827 +++$+++ u7316 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ I never did trust that blonde fuck...
L472824 +++$+++ u7316 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ How do we know that?
L472823 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ And you believed me?  But it wasn't my people who did it.
L472787 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ And then...
L472786 +++$+++ u7316 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Then Swede and I split with the package and meet you back at the rendezvous.
L472774 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ Which leads us to...
L472773 +++$+++ u7316 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ You call me with the target's route, I follow along until we've reached the attack point and then I run his squag ass off the road.
L472735 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ The deal?  The deal is we leave for Nice at first light.
L472734 +++$+++ u7316 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ So what's the deal?
L472602 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ And who are you?
L472601 +++$+++ u7316 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ I drive -- and my name is Larry.  Larry from the States.
L472593 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ The name is Deirdre, and I'm running this show.
L472592 +++$+++ u7316 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Who the fuck are you?
L472591 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ It's good to see you've all got such faith in our little undertaking.
L473170 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ No, Seamus.  I heard you the first time.
L473169 +++$+++ u7320 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ Do I need to repeat myself?
L473168 +++$+++ u7320 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ Shut up!!!  Shut up and drive!  I'm your superior officer and you will do as I goddamn well say, is that understood?!?
L473167 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head...
L473166 +++$+++ u7320 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ Plastic fucking surgeon?  You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre lass?  It's the mark of the patriot, and I'll wear it like a badge.  As for those who done it to me, I'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over.
L473165 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ You better be careful, Seamus, before something happens a plastic surgeon can't fix.
L473151 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ They're good!
L473150 +++$+++ u7320 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ Good Christ!  Can't you lose these jokers?
L473149 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ Not yet...
L473148 +++$+++ u7320 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ About time!
L473142 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ You lose them!
L473141 +++$+++ u7320 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ Lose them!
L473126 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ That's him.
L473125 +++$+++ u7320 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ From Interpol?
L473124 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ They're part of the team.  One of them's the guy I told you about.
L473123 +++$+++ u7320 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ What in bloody hell is going on?
L473033 +++$+++ u7320 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ Nothing.
L473032 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there?
L473031 +++$+++ u7320 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ Problem my ass!  I think you're lying to me, and if you are you're a dead man!
L472970 +++$+++ u7320 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ I thought I did.
L472969 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ Not to me, you know that.
L472968 +++$+++ u7320 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ It's been known to happen.
L472967 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ So you thought that maybe I'd grown too attached to this charade I've been playing, is that it?
L472966 +++$+++ u7320 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ It means I was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you.  You've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun, I might note.  There's no glory to it, but there are those that like it.
L472965 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?
L472964 +++$+++ u7320 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ Now there's the Deirdre I know.
L472963 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ When we're done with this, I want to do for that one myself.
L473282 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ Come off it, Sam -- if we weren't friends already we wouldn't be here now, would we?
L473281 +++$+++ u7319 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Not me.  You work too often with the same people and you become friends -- clouds your judgement.
L473250 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ Alright?  It's bloody fucking freezing in here!
L473249 +++$+++ u7319 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Are you alright?
L473116 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ Bloody fucking hell...
L473115 +++$+++ u7319 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I didn't say I was.
L473114 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ Where do you get off saying word one? All the time pretending to be one of us, it's the same thing we were doing, Seamus and myself.  And here you are so high and mighty, like you're so different from the rest of us.
L473113 +++$+++ u7319 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Don't even think that I'm buying that.
L473112 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ I'm a patriate.
L473111 +++$+++ u7319 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Oh please..you're on some sort of holy mission?
L473110 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ Well, if it isn't Mr. Interpol himself.  I can't believe I misjudged you like I did.
L472835 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ That we're too stupid to trace his calls.
L472834 +++$+++ u7319 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Check this out.  Gregor's a spook, or he was one until recently.  When he was a spy he lived the life -- you know, a prince in some Eastern Bloc country where nobody had shit and Gregor had everything.  Then the wall goes down.  No more Cold War.  And Gregor is out of a job.  No apartment, no special stores with Western food and video tapes.  I would bet dollars against shit that Gregor liked that phone and he doesn't want to give it up.  And I wouldn't be surprised if he's arrogant enough to think...
L472833 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ I bought it for him -- all the stuff he was using, it was in his contract.  Cost a nice penny, too, especially that goddamned phone: Gregor had expensive tastes.
L472826 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ Exactly.  Gregor, he was the Russian's man.  It was my people came up with the idea for this run, but the Russians who had the capital to finance it.  Gregor, he was their insurance, and I was ours. Everybody else was supposed to be neutral.  Gregor must've got to Swede...
L472825 +++$+++ u7319 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Because if they had she'd be gone along with the package, instead of sitting here with us.
L472820 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ I don't know...  Well I don't!  It's a goddamned mystery to me just like it is to you.  But I do know who we're working for.  My people, and the Russian mob.
L472819 +++$+++ u7319 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Now, what did we steal?
L472769 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ Just business.
L472768 +++$+++ u7319 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Duty calls?
L472767 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ I better be getting that.
L472766 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ Exactly.  And last night I wanted to be with someone who was just like me.
L472765 +++$+++ u7319 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You're a hired gun, Deirdre -- just like me.
L472764 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ I know I don't have to, Sam, it's just that, for once, I want to.  when I was a -  Patriot, it was a given I'd sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with.  You know: any man who needed setting up.  Sometimes so we might blackmail him, sometimes so he could be killed.  Sometimes so I could kill him myself. IRA isn't exactly an enlightened feminist organization, Sam.  To most of the men I with I was always the girl.  "Send the girl to do it."  "Tell The girl to take care of it."  "Have the girl fuck him."  But I look at you and I get this feeling you take me for what I am: no more, no less.
L472763 +++$+++ u7319 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You don't have to explain yourself to me, Deirdre.
L472762 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ Look, Sam, don't take it the wrong way when I tell you we won't be doing this again.
L472745 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ I probably do.  But for the time being, I'm willing to forget about it...
L472744 +++$+++ u7319 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
L472743 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ Nobody's saying they don't.
L472742 +++$+++ u7319 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Part of me says I should just look at this as a perk.  You know, a bonus.  But then I remember you're you -- Deirdre who used to belong to the IRA -- and it occurs to me that deceit and subterfuge come very naturally to you.
L472741 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ That's right.
L472740 +++$+++ u7319 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Is that right?
L472739 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ I still am.
L472738 +++$+++ u7319 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I didn't think to see you again tonight. You were pretty pissed.
L472737 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ I feel as if I've wandered onto the set of Enter The Dragon.  Could you teach me to do that?
L472733 +++$+++ u7319 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ We weren't real thrilled about it either...
L472732 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ The two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to fucking war...
L472731 +++$+++ u7319 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Hazard pay...
L472600 +++$+++ u7319 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Once.
L472599 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ You were a soldier, were you?
L472598 +++$+++ u7319 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Sam.  I'm a weapons guy.
L473246 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ He'll kill me anway, Sam, shoot though me and kill this fucker.
L473245 +++$+++ u7314 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ GREGOR +++$+++ Shut up!
L473244 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ Don't do it, Sam!
L473243 +++$+++ u7314 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ GREGOR +++$+++ Go ahead, shoot... Shoot and kill the bitch, I don't care.  And yet you don't shoot.  Interesting. Put down your weapon and walk away.
L473207 +++$+++ u7314 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ GREGOR +++$+++ Should any of you decide to rush me, I'll kill myself and whoever happens to be near me at the time.
L473206 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ That fucking figures...
L473030 +++$+++ u7314 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ GREGOR +++$+++ There's a problem...
L473029 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ Where's the case?
L472791 +++$+++ u7314 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ GREGOR +++$+++ Ready when you are...
L472790 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ Alright, Gregor, I'm...
L472772 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ Next.
L472771 +++$+++ u7314 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ GREGOR +++$+++ I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target.  I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you.
L472770 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ Now then, let's run through it one more time, shall we?  What's your job?
L472630 +++$+++ u7314 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ GREGOR +++$+++ In this business, your life and your reputation are more often than not one and the same.
L472629 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ But would you stake your life, that's the question...
L472628 +++$+++ u7314 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ GREGOR +++$+++ I'd stake my reputation.
L472627 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ You sure about this?
L472626 +++$+++ u7314 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ GREGOR +++$+++ I intend to.  This phone is wired like no other: it's got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition, it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand.  With my custom hardware and this phone I can trace the target's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes...
L472625 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
L472624 +++$+++ u7314 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ GREGOR +++$+++ It's quite satifactory.
L472597 +++$+++ u7314 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ GREGOR +++$+++ These days they they call me Gregor -- and I'm a tech.  I do electronic work, surveillance, computer runs.
L472596 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ From here on in you want something you pay cash for it: no credit cards, no bank accounts are in place: ten percent up front, the rest when the job is done.  You.  What do you do and what should we call you?
L472595 +++$+++ u7311 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ DEIRDRE +++$+++ Not likely.  Once, yeah, I was -- but there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and I'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my meaning.  I'm a hired gun, same as the rest of you, and that's all any of us needs to know about the other.
L472594 +++$+++ u7314 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ GREGOR +++$+++ Who are you?  IRA?
L472919 +++$+++ u7314 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ GREGOR +++$+++ I think not.  After you...
L472918 +++$+++ u7312 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ EDVARD +++$+++ Perhaps we could both go at the same time...
L472917 +++$+++ u7314 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ GREGOR +++$+++ You first, Edvard.
L472916 +++$+++ u7312 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ EDVARD +++$+++ Do you have the material?
L472915 +++$+++ u7314 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ GREGOR +++$+++ Really?  Do you have the money with you?
L472914 +++$+++ u7312 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ EDVARD +++$+++ We'll double your price.
L472913 +++$+++ u7314 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ GREGOR +++$+++ I'm sure.  But I'm sorry to say that it's too late for trust: we have a serious problem.
L472912 +++$+++ u7312 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ EDVARD +++$+++ That was a mistake, trying to kill you. Mikhi did it without consulting me, I'd have never allowed it.
L472911 +++$+++ u7314 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ GREGOR +++$+++ I'm touched, really, that they'd send someone of your caliber.  It's nice to know that they didn't make the mistake of underestimating me twice.
L472910 +++$+++ u7312 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ EDVARD +++$+++ Yes, Gregor, they sent me.
L472713 +++$+++ u7323 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Then you better find it in your heart to tell me, Francois, because while your death is inevitable, it still isn't decided how painful it's going to be.
L472712 +++$+++ u7313 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ FRANCOIS +++$+++ In here...
L472711 +++$+++ u7323 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Where's my information?
L472710 +++$+++ u7313 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ FRANCOIS +++$+++ Of course.
L472709 +++$+++ u7323 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ I take it you still want the money...
L472708 +++$+++ u7313 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ FRANCOIS +++$+++ If you say a word in English, Vincent, my friend with the high powered sporting rifle will shoot you in the throat. Sorry to screw you over like this, but the information you want might get me killed if I give it to you, and that's a price I'm not willing to pay.
L472707 +++$+++ u7323 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ What's that?
L472706 +++$+++ u7313 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ FRANCOIS +++$+++ There's been a slight problem.
L472705 +++$+++ u7323 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Here's yours.
L472694 +++$+++ u7313 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ FRANCOIS +++$+++ He's a cop, Vincent, he's French and he's a cop and you better shoot him in the fucking head right now!
L472693 +++$+++ u7323 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ What do you mean?
L472692 +++$+++ u7313 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ FRANCOIS +++$+++ Bad company...
L472691 +++$+++ u7323 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ He's company.
L472690 +++$+++ u7313 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ FRANCOIS +++$+++ Not so fast.  Who's that?
L472689 +++$+++ u7323 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Do you have it?
L473221 +++$+++ u7317 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ MIKHI +++$+++ You'll die if you leave here.
L473220 +++$+++ u7314 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ GREGOR +++$+++ We'll die if we stay here!
L473209 +++$+++ u7314 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ GREGOR +++$+++ I'll destroy whatever's in the case.
L473208 +++$+++ u7317 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ MIKHI +++$+++ And more importantly --
L473195 +++$+++ u7314 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ GREGOR +++$+++ Enough!
L473194 +++$+++ u7317 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ MIKHI +++$+++ I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him.
L473193 +++$+++ u7314 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ GREGOR +++$+++ Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.
L473192 +++$+++ u7317 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ MIKHI +++$+++ Whatever you wish...  This has all been a terrible mistake, Gregor.  I wanted to play straight with you, but Edvard insisted we try and kill you.
L473191 +++$+++ u7314 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ GREGOR +++$+++ No, Mikhi, I wouldn't.  Since I won't speak your language, and you can't speak mine, English will do nicely.
L473190 +++$+++ u7317 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ MIKHI +++$+++ Sit, sit...  Would you like one?
L473205 +++$+++ u7314 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ GREGOR +++$+++ I think not.  I have, of course, taken the precaution of wiring the briefcase to explode five seconds after it opens.  Unless, of course, I deactivate it before it goes off.
L473204 +++$+++ u7320 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him.
L473203 +++$+++ u7314 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ GREGOR +++$+++ So, you've got it all figured, do you?
L473201 +++$+++ u7320 +++$+++ m494 +++$+++ SEAMUS +++$+++ What's a little hate between business partners?
