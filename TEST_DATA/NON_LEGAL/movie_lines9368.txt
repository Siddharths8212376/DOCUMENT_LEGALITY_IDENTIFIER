L497274 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I guess, but not because of the way he looked or anything. He's just so different, somebody new to have a conversation with. I'm just tired of talking to other couples about whether or not they're going to buy the station wagon, you know? It's just boring. I don't know, he was just different. And he's really on about truth a lot, being honest, and I like that, I felt comfortable around him.  After he left I had a dream that he signed a lease to rent our guest room.
L497273 +++$+++ u2690 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Let me rephrase. Were you attracted to him?
L497272 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ What do you mean, like physically?
L497271 +++$+++ u2690 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Did you find him attractive?
L497270 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ No, he left last week.
L497269 +++$+++ u2690 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Is he still at your house?
L497268 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Oh, Graham. No, I didn't talk to him about that. Actually, that turned out to be pretty interesting. I expected Graham to be this... well, like John, you know? I mean, he said they had gone to school together, so I was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff. But he turned out to be this... this kind of character, I mean, he's kind of arty but okay, you know?
L497267 +++$+++ u2690 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ The friend of John's that was staying at your house.
L497266 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ What visitor?
L497265 +++$+++ u2690 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Did you confront John about the visitor?
L497264 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Well, the cumulative effect is not good, let me tell you.  I knew I shouldn't have watered those plants.
L497263 +++$+++ u2690 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ No, I haven't.
L497262 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Yes, it's this radioactive gas in the ground, and houses kind of act like magnets to pull it up, and -- you've never heard of this?
L497261 +++$+++ u2690 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Radon leakage?
L497260 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Well, I don't know. The week started off okay, but then I was outside watering the plants, and I started feeling dizzy from the heat and that got me thinking about the Greenhouse Effect, so I went inside and turned on the air-conditioner full blast, and that made me feel a little better until I started thinking about radon leakage coming up through the floor, and --
L497067 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Well, kind of recently, I guess. But not too recently.
L497066 +++$+++ u2690 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ So it was recently that you tried this.
L497065 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Well, I kind of tried once. It just seemed stupid, I kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid, and kind of, uh, I don't know, and then I was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this, and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we don't know what to do with all that garbage, you know?
L497064 +++$+++ u2690 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ I take it you've never masturbated?
L497063 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ God, no.
L497062 +++$+++ u2690 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Did you masturbate?
L497061 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ What do you mean?
L497060 +++$+++ u2690 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Did you do anything?
L497059 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ But see, he stopped before I got that feeling, that's why it seems weird to me. I mean, I'm sure he wishes I would initiate things once in awhile, and I would except it never occurs to me, I'm always thinking about something else and then the few times that I have felt like starting something I was by myself.
L497058 +++$+++ u2690 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Perhaps he senses your hesitance at being touched.
L497057 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Oh, yeah.  But see, I've never really been into sex that much, I mean, I like it and everything, it just does't freak me out, I wouldn't miss it, you know? But anyway, lately we haven't been doing anything at all. Like I said, it's not that I miss it, but I'm curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden.
L497056 +++$+++ u2690 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him?
L497055 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ About a week ago. I don't know what brought it on, I just started feeling like I didn't want him to touch me.
L497054 +++$+++ u2690 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ When did you begin having this feeling?
L497053 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Fine, I guess. Except right now I'm going through this where I don't want him to touch me.
L497052 +++$+++ u2690 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ This unexpected visit notwithstanding, how are things with John?
L497051 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Yeah, I know.
L497050 +++$+++ u2690 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ But he asked you to quit your job, and you do have housework.
L497049 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I guess I'm upset because I can't really justify being upset, I mean, it's his house, really, he pays the mortgage.
L497048 +++$+++ u2690 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ What upsets you about that?
L497047 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ No. I don't know. I haven't told him about the garbage thing because I'm pissed off at him right now. He's letting some old college buddy stay at our house for a couple of days, and he didn't even ask me about it. I mean, I would've said yes, I just wish he would've asked.
L497046 +++$+++ u2690 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Are you afraid of his reaction? Of his finding you silly for thinking of such things?
L497039 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Well, do you think many people run around thinking about how happy they feel and how great things are? I mean, maybe they do, but I doubt those people are in therapy. Besides, being happy isn't all that great. My figure is always at its best when I'm depressed. The last time I was really happy I put on twenty-five pounds. I thought John was going to have a stroke.
L497038 +++$+++ u2690 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ If you think about it, I think you'll see that the object of your obsession is invariably something negative that you couldn't possibly have any control over.
L497037 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Yeah, so?
L497036 +++$+++ u2690 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Well, last week we talked about your obsession with the families of airline fatalities, and now we're talking about your concern over the garbage problem.
L497035 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ What do you mean?
L497034 +++$+++ u2690 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Ann, do you see a pattern here?
L497033 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Well, this weekend John was taking out the garbage, and he kept spilling things out of the container, and I started imagining a container that grew garbage, like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself, and how could you stop that if it started happening?
L497032 +++$+++ u2690 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Do you have any idea what triggered this concern?
L497031 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Don't you think that's a lot of garbage? I'd really like to know where it's all going to go.
L497030 +++$+++ u2690 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ No, I didn't.
L497029 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Nothing. I mean, nothing. I try not to do anything that will produce garbage, so obviously we're talking about eating and basic stuff like that. Did you know that the average person produces three pounds of garbage a day?
L497028 +++$+++ u2690 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ DOCTOR +++$+++ Yes, I remember. What do you do when these moods overtake you?
L497992 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Bye.
L497991 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Bye.
L497990 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Okay.
L497989 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I get real busy between two and four.
L497988 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ No.
L497987 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Do you have my work number?
L497985 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Well. I can't stay.
L497984 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Thank you.
L497597 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Thirty-two dollars.
L497596 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ So what's my share of the dress?
L497582 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Hold on.
L497581 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I was just trying to --
L497577 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ It does not.
L497576 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ It looks like a tablecloth.
L497575 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ It's a sun dress.
L497574 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ What is it?
L497573 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Here it is.
L497564 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Then why do you keep asking about it?
L497563 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I don't want to discuss it.
L497562 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Ann, I don't understand why this freaks you out so much. You didn't do it, I did, and if it doesn't bother me, why should it bother you?
L497561 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ You are in serious trouble.
L497560 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ No. I don't think they all did what I did.
L497559 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ So he's got this catalogue of women touching themselves? That doesn't make you feel weird?
L497558 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ He's harmless. He just sits around and looks at these tapes. What's the big deal?
L497557 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ That doesn't mean you do. You can't possibly trust him, he's... perverted.
L497556 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ I feel like I do.
L497555 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ You know what I mean, you don't even know him!
L497554 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ You couldn't do it, period.
L497553 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I mean, I couldn't do that in front of John, even.
L497552 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Why?
L497551 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I can't believe you did that!!
L497550 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Listen to you!! You sound like Mom. What are you talking about?
L497549 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ You are in trouble.
L497548 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ In front of him, Ann, yes.
L497545 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ You touched him?
L497544 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ No, but I did.
L497543 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Did he touch you?
L497542 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Well, it's too late now, isn't it?
L497541 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ You don't know that for sure.
L497540 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ He wouldn't do that.
L497539 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Cynthia, who knows where that tape may end up? He could be... bouncing it off some satellite or something. Some horny old men in South America or something could be watching it.
L497538 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ I wanted him to see me.
L497537 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ But why did you want to?
L497536 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Because I wanted to.
L497535 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Why did you do that?
L497534 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ What!?
L497533 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Cynthia!
L497532 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Yes, I did.
L497529 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Did he ask you to take your clothes off?
L497528 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Apparently.
L497527 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Oh, so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape, but you won't tell your own sister?
L497526 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Well, like, I don't want to tell you, exactly.
L497525 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Well, like what did he ask, exactly?
L497524 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Questions about sex.
L497523 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ What kinds of questions?
L497522 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ He just asked me questions.
L497406 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I don't know.
L497405 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Then why'd you call me?
L497404 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I don't want to talk about it.
L497403 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Well, what, then?
L497402 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ No, he's not dangerous. Not physically.
L497401 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Well, what? Is he dangerous?
L497400 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ No, it's nothing like that.
L497399 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Then what's the story, what's this "strange" bullshit all of a sudden? Is he drowning puppies, or what?
L497398 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ No!
L497397 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ What the hell happened over there? Did he make a pass at you?
L497396 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Because. Cynthia, look, John was right. Graham is strange. Very strange. You don't want to get involved with him.
L497395 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Well, why?
L497394 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Because I never got around to it.
L497393 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Why not?
L497392 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ No, I didn't.
L497391 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?
L497390 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I don't... he doesn't want you to come over.
L497322 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I was thinking maybe I shouldn't be in therapy anymore.
L497321 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Good. Now, if you'll pardon me, I have to go to work.
L497320 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Fine.
L497319 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Okay, Ann, okay. How about this: you buy her something nice, and I'll pay for half. All right?
L497318 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I just thought it might --
L497317 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Will you stop? Jesus.
L497316 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Don't you think she deserves a little more than a card? I mean, the woman gave birth to you. It's her fiftieth birthday --
L497315 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ What's wrong with that?
L497314 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ A card? For her fiftieth birthday?
L497313 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ I don't know, I'll get her a card or something.
L497312 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Are you getting Mom something for her birthday?
L497311 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ That goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune.
L497310 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Lose something?
L497309 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ And... do whatever it is you do.
L497308 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ And what?
L497307 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I don't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and...
L497306 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Why? Just give me the address, you won't even have to be involved.
L497305 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Let me talk to him first.
L497304 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Oh, please. Okay, so give me the Zen master's address, I'll think of a reason to stop by.
L497303 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.
L497302 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L497301 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ But he won't.
L497300 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Well, I'll call him when he does.
L497299 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ He doesn't have a phone.
L497298 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Ann, you don't have a clue. Look, I don't even know why we're discussing this, I'll just call him myself.
L497297 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I have a pretty good idea.
L497296 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ "My type"? What is this bullshit? How would you know what "my type" is?
L497295 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Oh, for God's sake. Really, Cynthia, really, I don't think he's your type.
L497294 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ I think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together. I think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me.
L497293 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Well, I wonder why.
L497292 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Ann, you always underestimate me.
L497291 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.
L497290 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ I say it because it's descriptive.
L497289 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ You know what. You say it just to irritate me.
L497288 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ What?
L497287 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Do you have to say that?
L497286 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Besides, even if I decided to fuck his brains out, what business is that of yours?
L497285 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Jesus, Ann, get a life. I just asked what he looked like.
L497284 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Why, so you can go after him?
L497283 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ I just want to know what he looks like, is all.
L497282 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Why?
L497281 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Uh-huh. So what's he look like?
L497280 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Not really. Maybe if I just saw him on the street I'd have said that, but after talking to him... he's just kind of... I don't know, unusual.
L497279 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Is he? Strange, I mean?
L497278 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ No, not at all. Actually, I don't think John likes him much anymore. He said he thought Graham had gotten strange.
L497277 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Must be nice. So, what's he like, is he like John?
L497276 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I don't know. He went to school here, then he was in New York for awhile, then Philadelphia, and then just kind of travelling around.
L497579 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ So will you, someday.
L497578 +++$+++ u2689 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYTNHIA +++$+++ Well, why would she want a sun dress? She's got spots on her shoulders and varicose veins.
L497572 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ It was busy.
L497571 +++$+++ u2689 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYTNHIA +++$+++ There's a phone here.
L497570 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ I wish you'd get an answering machine.
L497547 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Wait a minute. Do you mean... don't tell me you... in front of him.
L497546 +++$+++ u2689 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYTNHIA +++$+++ No, I touched me.
L497531 +++$+++ u2687 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ ANN +++$+++ Did you take your clothes off?
L497530 +++$+++ u2689 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYTNHIA +++$+++ Did he ask me to take my clothes off? No, he didn't.
L497624 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ No.
L497623 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Goddamit, give me my tape, then.
L497622 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I'm sorry. I can't do it.
L497621 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ I can't believe you're doing this after I let you tape me.
L497620 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Cynthia, I don't know.
L497619 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
L497618 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I would.
L497617 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ How about if you record over the one we already made? You could have the same date and not use another tape. Who would know?
L497616 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ No.
L497615 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ So make an exception.
L497614 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Ouch. Okay, I deserved that. Cynthia, don't you understand? After the first time it's just not spontaneous. There's no edge anymore. Look at the tapes, there is only one date on each label. I have never taped anyone twice.
L497613 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ But I want you to do it, I want somebody who will ask the right questions and everything, somebody I can play to and feel safe because you can't do anything.
L497612 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I'm sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer.
L497611 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
L497610 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ No. You'll have to get somebody else.
L497609 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ I can't talk you into it?
L497608 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I never do more than one. I'm sorry.
L497607 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ No? Not even one more?
L497606 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ No.
L497605 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ I'd like to make another tape.
L497604 +++$+++ u2691 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Okay.
L497603 +++$+++ u2688 +++$+++ m175 +++$+++ CYNTHIA +++$+++ Look, I'm just going to come right out and tell you why I'm here, okay?
