L126812 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I'm afraid it is important.
L126811 +++$+++ u4416 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ FÉLIX +++$+++ The money is unimportant.
L126810 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ How much is it worth?
L126809 +++$+++ u4416 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ FÉLIX +++$+++ I know them as one knows his own face, even though I have never seen them. This yellow one -- a Swedish four shilling -- called 'De Gula Fyraskillingen' -- issued in 1854.
L126808 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps.
L126807 +++$+++ u4416 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ FÉLIX +++$+++ Have you ever, in your entire life, seen anything so beautiful?
L126805 +++$+++ u4416 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ FÉLIX +++$+++ The man who bought them last week was American. I did not see him but I heard. I knew you would come.
L126804 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Yes.
L126803 +++$+++ u4416 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ FÉLIX +++$+++ I was expecting you. You are American too, of course.
L126802 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Monsieur Félix -- ?
L126497 +++$+++ u4425 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ TEX +++$+++ The kid said --
L126496 +++$+++ u4417 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ What do you mean, no?
L126478 +++$+++ u4417 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ Nachurly. And that goes for Herman, too.
L126477 +++$+++ u4425 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ TEX +++$+++ Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you.
L126476 +++$+++ u4417 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ You know I'd tell you if I had it.
L126475 +++$+++ u4425 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ TEX +++$+++ You don't s'pose one o' us has it, like the man said -- I mean, that'd be pretty distasteful -- us bein' vet'rans o' the same war 'n' all.
L126474 +++$+++ u4417 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ Meaning what?
L126473 +++$+++ u4425 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ TEX +++$+++ You think that mebbe we're fishin' the wrong stream?
L126472 +++$+++ u4417 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ Not unless we're blind.
L126471 +++$+++ u4425 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ TEX +++$+++ There sure ain't nothin' here worth no quarter of a million.
L126470 +++$+++ u4417 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ No. The police have kindly provided us with a list.
L126469 +++$+++ u4425 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ TEX +++$+++ You sure nuthin's missin'?
L126468 +++$+++ u4417 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ Why bother him?
L126467 +++$+++ u4425 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ TEX +++$+++ And if it is?
L126466 +++$+++ u4417 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ What for? If it's not here, why bother him?
L126148 +++$+++ u4425 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ TEX +++$+++ That's right -- it's like ticklin' a alligator's belly.
L126147 +++$+++ u4417 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ I suggest you get about your business -- nothing soothes Herman like success.
L126131 +++$+++ u4425 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ TEX +++$+++ And then some. If you'd only told us you was goin' to her room we could've kept 'em busy --
L126130 +++$+++ u4417 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ That was a dumb move, Herman -- a dumb move.
L126430 +++$+++ u4417 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ She isn't going to be anybody's mother unless you answer some questions.
L126429 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ But his mother --
L126428 +++$+++ u4417 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ I'm afraid that will have to wait, Mrs. Lampert.
L126055 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Stop it!
L126054 +++$+++ u4417 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --
L126053 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Leave me alone -- !
L126052 +++$+++ u4417 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead.
L126051 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I don't know anything.
L126050 +++$+++ u4417 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- you do know that, don't you?
L126049 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Tell me what?
L126048 +++$+++ u4417 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
L126047 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ What do you want?
L126046 +++$+++ u4417 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ Mrs. Lampert --
L126680 +++$+++ u4418 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ GRANDPIERRE +++$+++ It stands to reason you are telling the truth -- for why would you invent such a ridiculous story?
L126679 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ No -- in my room.
L126678 +++$+++ u4418 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ GRANDPIERRE +++$+++ In Mr. Dyle's room?
L126677 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I was, too.
L125880 +++$+++ u4418 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ GRANDPIERRE +++$+++ And this? And this?
L125879 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I don't understand.
L125878 +++$+++ u4418 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ GRANDPIERRE +++$+++ And this?
L125877 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Of course it is.
L125876 +++$+++ u4418 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ GRANDPIERRE +++$+++ One more question. Is this your husband's passport?
L125875 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Is that all? Can I go now?
L125874 +++$+++ u4418 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ GRANDPIERRE +++$+++ If you will sign this list you may take the things with you.
L125873 +++$+++ u4418 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ GRANDPIERRE +++$+++ Yes. Your appointment has been changed.  One key to your apartment -- one comb -- one fountain pen --  one toothbrush -- one tin of tooth powder  -- that is all.
L125872 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Did you?
L125871 +++$+++ u4418 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ GRANDPIERRE +++$+++ We took the liberty of calling your dentist -- we thought, perhaps, we would learn something.
L125870 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ "My dear Regina: I hope you are enjoying your holiday. Megeve can be so lovely this time of year. The days pass very slowly and I hope to see you soon. As always, Charles. P.S. Your dentist called yesterday. Your appointment has been changed."  Not very much, is it?
L125869 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ A letter? May I see it?
L125868 +++$+++ u4418 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ GRANDPIERRE +++$+++ Obviously.  One ticket of passage to South America -- one letter, stamped but unsealed, addressed to you --
L125867 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody.
L125866 +++$+++ u4418 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ GRANDPIERRE +++$+++ One wallet containing four thousand francs -- one agenda --  -- his last notation was made yesterday -- Thursday --  "Five p.m. -- Jardin des Champs- Elysées"  Why there?
L125862 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I wish you wouldn't.
L125861 +++$+++ u4418 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ GRANDPIERRE +++$+++ Is it all right?
L125860 +++$+++ u4418 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ GRANDPIERRE +++$+++ It is all right.
L125859 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I know.  I'm sorry.
L125858 +++$+++ u4418 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ GRANDPIERRE +++$+++ C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment absurde!
L125857 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I don't know.
L125856 +++$+++ u4418 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ GRANDPIERRE +++$+++ Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?
L125855 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I don't know.
L125854 +++$+++ u4418 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ GRANDPIERRE +++$+++ Where did he keep his money?
L125853 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I don't know.
L125852 +++$+++ u4418 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ GRANDPIERRE +++$+++ About how wealthy would you say?
L125851 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I don't know. I suppose so.
L125850 +++$+++ u4418 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ GRANDPIERRE +++$+++ He was a wealthy man?
L125849 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ He didn't have one.
L125848 +++$+++ u4418 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ GRANDPIERRE +++$+++ Oh. Swiss. His profession?
L125847 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Swiss.
L125846 +++$+++ u4418 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ GRANDPIERRE +++$+++ He was American?
L125845 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I'm very confused.
L125844 +++$+++ u4418 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ GRANDPIERRE +++$+++ Your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the 'Maranguape.' It sailed from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this morning at seven.
L125843 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Leave?
L125842 +++$+++ u4418 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ GRANDPIERRE +++$+++ We discovered your husband's body lying next to the tracks of the Paris- Bourdeaux railroad line. He was dressed only in his pajamas. Do you know of any reason why he might have wished to leave France?
L125841 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I'm very cold.
L125840 +++$+++ u4418 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ GRANDPIERRE +++$+++ You loved him?
L125837 +++$+++ u4418 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ GRANDPIERRE +++$+++ I am Inspector Edouard Grandpierre of the Police Judiciaire. Would you be so kind as to come with me, please?
L125836 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Yes.
L126795 +++$+++ u4419 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ JEAN-LOUIS +++$+++ No -- but I will ask.
L126794 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do you know where this Monsieur Félix lives?
L126793 +++$+++ u4419 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ JEAN-LOUIS +++$+++ But he is gone.
L126789 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Oh no! What man, Jean-Louis --  where?
L126788 +++$+++ u4419 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ JEAN-LOUIS +++$+++ A man traded with me -- all those for only four.
L126787 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Jean-Louis -- thank heavens! Do you have -- !  What's that?
L126499 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ No, Jean-Louis.
L126498 +++$+++ u4419 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ JEAN-LOUIS +++$+++ Up there! It is up there!
L126491 +++$+++ u4419 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ JEAN-LOUIS +++$+++ We won! We won!
L126490 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy.
L126489 +++$+++ u4419 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ JEAN-LOUIS +++$+++ I found it! I found it!
L126488 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I hope I don't find any little hairy things living up here -- wait! There is something! If I can just -- yes, I'm getting it -- a case of some sort -- it's heavy.
L126486 +++$+++ u4419 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ JEAN-LOUIS +++$+++ Up there! I would put it up there!
L126485 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Voilà what?
L126484 +++$+++ u4419 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ JEAN-LOUIS +++$+++ Oh.  Neither do I.  Voilà!
L126483 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.
L126482 +++$+++ u4419 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ JEAN-LOUIS +++$+++ I know. I would bury it in the garden.
L126481 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Come on, now -- if you wanted to hide something, where would you put it?
L126459 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ What should we give him?
L126458 +++$+++ u4419 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ JEAN-LOUIS +++$+++ Oh, la! If I find the treasure, will I win a prize?
L125830 +++$+++ u4419 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ JEAN-LOUIS +++$+++ Okay.
L125829 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ -- you could have the stamps. I'll get you some here, okay?
L125828 +++$+++ u4419 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ JEAN-LOUIS +++$+++ Yes, of course -- but if you went back and wrote me a letter --
L125763 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Don't tell me you didn't know it was loaded.  Sylvie!
L125762 +++$+++ u4419 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ JEAN-LOUIS +++$+++ Oh, la.
L126200 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Good night.
L126199 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Yes, I'll remember. Good night.
L126198 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that.
L126197 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Don't put yourself out.
L126196 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the morning.
L126195 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Words can hurt very much.
L126194 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words.
L126193 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L126192 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I don't -- but as long as they think you have the money, or know where it is, or have it without knowing where it is, or don't even know you have it --
L126191 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ How do you know what they're doing?
L126190 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ They're only trying to scare you, that's all.
L126189 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I believe what he said.
L126188 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I wouldn't take that too seriously.
L126187 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ He -- he said if I didn't give the money, he'll kill me.
L126186 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What'd he say?
L126184 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What is it, Reggie -- what's he saying?
L126183 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Yes -- that's right.
L126179 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ The man you had the fight with.
L126178 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Who is it?
L126174 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Do you tell lies?
L126173 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
L126172 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
L126171 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.
L126170 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I'm so hungry I could faint.  I've -- I've gotten your suit all wet.
L126169 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Of course I'll help -- I told you I would, didn't I? Come on now --
L126168 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Please help me, Peter -- you're the only one I can trust.
L126167 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ No, they won't -- I won't let them.
L126166 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ But he didn't! I've looked everywhere --  And if I don't find it --  Those men going to kill me.
L126165 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ So they think he left it with you.
L126164 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I don't know.  Those men killed Charles to get it. But he must not have had it with him on the train.
L126163 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ No, it isn't -- where's the money?
L126162 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ That's all.
L126161 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Go on.
L126160 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ A quarter of a million dollars.
L126159 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What?
L126158 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ There are three men -- he's one of them -- they think I have something that belongs to them.
L126157 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ There was no trace of him. All right, Reggie -- suppose you tell me what this is all about.
L126125 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You took the words right out of my mouth.
L126124 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Be careful, Peter.
L126123 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Lock the door and the window -- and don't let anyone in except me. I'll be back in a minute.
L126122 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Out of the window, I guess -- I didn't see him.
L126121 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I think I sprained my pride.  Where'd he go?
L126120 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Peter -- are you all right?
L126113 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Good night.
L126112 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Nothing. Good night.
L126111 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What?
L126110 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Do you know what's wrong with you?
L126109 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Then stop acting like one. If you're really in some kind of trouble, I'd like to hear about it. Otherwise, it's late, I'm tired and I'm going home to bed.
L126108 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop treating me like a child.
L126107 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ How would you like a spanking?
L126106 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Him: 'Do you mind if I come in for a nightcap, Reggie?' Her: 'Well -- it is awfully late.' Him: 'Just one, all right?' Her: 'Promise you'll behave yourself.' Him: 'Sorry, baby, I never make promises I can't keep.'
L126104 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ How about once more around the park?
L126103 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ On the street where you live.
L126102 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Where?
L126101 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ We're here.
L126100 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Don't you know I could already be arrested for transporting a minor above the first floor?
L126099 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Look, I know it's asking you to stretch your imagination, but can't you pretend for a moment that I'm a woman and that you're a --
L126098 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What your husband was mixed up in.
L126097 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ What was what?
L126096 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What was it?
L126095 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ How do you shave in there?
L126094 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You said this afternoon that your husband was mixed up in something.
L126087 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Yes, you were -- you called it nonsense. Being murdered in cold blood isn't nonsense. Wait until it happens to you sometime.
L126086 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I wasn't --
L126085 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me.
L126084 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Stop this nonsense! If you're in some sort of trouble I want to know about it.
L126083 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ That's what I'm not supposed to say.
L126082 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Who said?
L126081 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ He said if I told anybody it could prove fatal for them as well as me.
L126080 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I don't think I follow you.
L126079 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.
L126078 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You haven't said a word since we left the club -- what happened back there?
L126077 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ Having a nervous breakdown.
L126076 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What are you doing in here?

L126036 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Right there, between your eyes -- see? Worry lines. You're much too young and too pretty to have anything like that. How about making me vice- president in charge of cheering you up?
L126033 +++$+++ u4421 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ REGGIE +++$+++ He's only pretending, to teach her a lesson -- only --  only he is dead, Peter -- I saw him -- he's not pretending. Somebody threw him off a train. What am I going to do?
L126032 +++$+++ u4420 +++$+++ m293 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Of course? I thought he was dead.
