L78677 +++$+++ u3983 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ DELIA +++$+++ Don't you <u>dare</u>.
L78613 +++$+++ u3983 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ DELIA +++$+++ Don't you <u>dare</u> talk to others about me.  I'm an <u>artist</u>!  The only thing that scares me is being embarrassed in front of my friends.  Do you know how hard it is to get civilized people to set foot in this part of Connecticut? Not a solitary word of this pubescent tripe to anyone.
L78612 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ I <u>told</u> them you were too mean to be afraid.
L78611 +++$+++ u3983 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ DELIA +++$+++ I can't believe you are doing this to me!  <u>Ghosts</u>.  I am giving a dinner party for seven people tonight.  Otho has agreed to come back for the demolition of the attic.  My agent, Bernard, is bringing some woman who writes for <u>Architectural Digest</u>.  In fact, no one here tonight has not been in <u>Vanity Fair</u>.  Except you.
L78407 +++$+++ u3983 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ DELIA +++$+++ Joke!  Joke!  Aspirin!  It doesn't matter what brand.
L78406 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Any particular kind?
L78405 +++$+++ u3983 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ DELIA +++$+++ <u>You jerks</u>!  That is my art, and it is <u>dangerous</u>!  You think I want to die like that?  Lydia.  Moving is a family affair. So buckle down now and go get Mommy some drugs.
L78383 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ I say let's keep it the way it is.
L78382 +++$+++ u3983 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ DELIA +++$+++ We'll be <u>the</u> art center of summer New York.  I'll teach those phony gallery creeps to refuse my sculpture.  And when Otho and I get through with this house, you people are not going to recognize it.
L78376 +++$+++ u3983 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ DELIA +++$+++ This is our first meal in this house, Lydia.  Why don't we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one?
L78375 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ I plan to have a stroke from the amount of MSG that's in this food.
L78945 +++$+++ u3988 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ OTHO +++$+++ I don't know.
L78944 +++$+++ u3983 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ DELIA +++$+++ What's happening to them?
L78909 +++$+++ u3988 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ OTHO +++$+++ Oh, they're still here.  They're Just not showing up.
L78908 +++$+++ u3983 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ DELIA +++$+++ Are they still here, Otho?
L78748 +++$+++ u3983 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ DELIA +++$+++ Look at the tiny figures.
L78747 +++$+++ u3988 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ OTHO +++$+++ Look at that <u>detail</u>!
L78715 +++$+++ u3988 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ OTHO +++$+++ We're dealing with Tracy and Hepburn here, a very sophisticated pair.  We must protect them, treat them with respect, <u>nur</u>ture them.
L78714 +++$+++ u3983 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ DELIA +++$+++ It does indicate a marvelously urbane sense of humor on the part of these ghosts -- that they actually appear in <u>sheets</u>!
L78695 +++$+++ u3983 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ DELIA +++$+++ She's been without therapy up here and I will not allow her to ruin...
L78694 +++$+++ u3988 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ OTHO +++$+++ Oh, Delia, lighten up!
L78693 +++$+++ u3983 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ DELIA +++$+++ <u>No</u>!  Do not encourage this little... person.
L78692 +++$+++ u3988 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ OTHO +++$+++ Now, Lydia... Favor us about your ghosts.
L78355 +++$+++ u3983 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ DELIA +++$+++ Probably the world's largest <u>Reader's</u> <u>Digest</u> collection!  C'mon, let's have some chablis, Otho, I'm laid bare by this experience.  Entirely bare.
L78354 +++$+++ u3988 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ OTHO +++$+++ I have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.
L78353 +++$+++ u3983 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ DELIA +++$+++ Maybe Charles does.
L78352 +++$+++ u3988 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ OTHO +++$+++ You don't have a key?
L78348 +++$+++ u3988 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ OTHO +++$+++ Let's see.  We could turn that into a media room.
L78347 +++$+++ u3983 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ DELIA +++$+++ Attic space.
L78346 +++$+++ u3988 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ OTHO +++$+++ 'I' will tell you what is boring.  Once you cover up the wallpaper, knock down a few walls, alter the traffic patterns, and -- perhaps -- only perhaps -- think about an inground pool -- the place <u>might</u> just be livable.  What's on the third floor?
L78340 +++$+++ u3988 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ OTHO +++$+++ Oh, as long as we're here...
L78339 +++$+++ u3983 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ DELIA +++$+++ That's Charles' study.  But you don't have to even look in there. He'll love whatever you do to it.  He's such a sheep.
L78338 +++$+++ u3988 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ OTHO +++$+++ Is there much more of this torture?
L78337 +++$+++ u3988 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ OTHO +++$+++ Be brave!  Otho take care!  Onward!
L78336 +++$+++ u3983 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ DELIA +++$+++ Otho, I can<u>not</u> <u>live</u> with these cheap domestic floor tiles.
L78329 +++$+++ u3988 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ OTHO +++$+++ <u>I know</u>!  We just have to <u>pray</u> that the other closets are bigger than this one.
L78328 +++$+++ u3983 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ DELIA +++$+++ <u>Oh my God</u>!
L78326 +++$+++ u3983 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ DELIA +++$+++ Of course, her favorite color! How <u>beautiful</u>!
L78325 +++$+++ u3988 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ OTHO +++$+++ Blue-green!  Hydrated chromic oxide!  Remember I'm schooled in chemistry.  I was a hair analyst! Briefly.  Interior design is a <u>science</u>, Delia!  Think of me as Doctor Otho.  And this patient is truly <u>sick</u>!
L78324 +++$+++ u3983 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ DELIA +++$+++ Viridian?  What is...?
L78323 +++$+++ u3988 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ OTHO +++$+++ Viridian?
L78322 +++$+++ u3983 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ DELIA +++$+++ What do you think?
L78320 +++$+++ u3988 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ OTHO +++$+++ Gooood!
L78319 +++$+++ u3983 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ DELIA +++$+++ <u>I know</u>... I read your book, <u>The</u> <u>Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf</u>.
L78318 +++$+++ u3988 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ OTHO +++$+++ You read my <u>mind</u>!  I love clients who can read my mind.  I don't think people realize how strong a connection there is between interior decoration and the supernatural.
L78317 +++$+++ u3983 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ DELIA +++$+++ Okay?
L78316 +++$+++ u3988 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ OTHO +++$+++ I thought I saw something.
L78315 +++$+++ u3983 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ DELIA +++$+++ What's wrong?
L78304 +++$+++ u3988 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ OTHO +++$+++ No time like the present, as my wicked stepmother used to say.
L78303 +++$+++ u3983 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ DELIA +++$+++ The rest of the house is probably worse.  When can you and I get started?
L78302 +++$+++ u3988 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ OTHO +++$+++ Is the rest of the house as bad as this?
L78299 +++$+++ u3983 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ DELIA +++$+++ I'm <u>so</u> glad you could leave the city to consult me, Otho.
L78298 +++$+++ u3988 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ OTHO +++$+++ That was the single most unattractive window treatment I have ever seen in the entire of my existence.
L79013 +++$+++ u3984 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Well, I just placed a call to your mother.  She had stepped out but I have some news for her.
L79012 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ It's okay.  How's the dirt business?
L79011 +++$+++ u3984 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Hellooo!  How's school?
L78402 +++$+++ u3984 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Remind me to talk to your mother about the dress code.  I'm sure you're going to be very happy there.
L78401 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Yes, but I'm going to live at home.
L78400 +++$+++ u3984 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Are we going to be seeing you at Miss Shannon's Boarding School?
L78399 +++$+++ u3984 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ That's a skeleton key.  It'll open any door in that house.  Will you give it to your father?  And you might mention that I single-handedly decorated the house.  In case he needs advice in that area.  Come see me.
L78398 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Is this the key to the attic?
L78395 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ What happened to the people who used to live here?
L78394 +++$+++ u3984 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ JANE +++$+++ Well there's a Little Deetz at least.  Boy, when you city people do something, you do it right, don't you?
L78941 +++$+++ u3988 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ OTHO +++$+++ As flies the lizard Serpent fell; As goblin vizard, At the spell Of pale wizard, Sinks to hell; The buried, dead, and slain... Rise again.
L78940 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ <u>Adam</u>!  <u>Adam</u>!
L78920 +++$+++ u3988 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ OTHO +++$+++ Their wedding clothes.
L78919 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Their wedding clothes.
L78917 +++$+++ u3988 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ OTHO +++$+++ I'll need something personal of theirs.
L78916 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Wait a minute!  What am I worried about?  Otho, you can't even change a tire!
L78764 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ That's slavery and murder.  You don't know these people.  They're just like you and me.  They're nice people!
L78763 +++$+++ u3988 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ OTHO +++$+++ Perhaps if I were properly motivated.
L78733 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ The attic.
L78732 +++$+++ u3988 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ OTHO +++$+++ All presences have a home space. A place where they live, so to speak.  Where do they hide out?
L78725 +++$+++ u3988 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ OTHO +++$+++ Why not?
L78724 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ They don't want to come down.
L78306 +++$+++ u3988 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ OTHO +++$+++ My sentiments exactly.  Porcelain is for teeth!
L78305 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Otho, that's terrible.
L78297 +++$+++ u3986 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ LYDIA +++$+++ Hold your breath and we'll pull.
L78296 +++$+++ u3988 +++$+++ m265 +++$+++ OTHO +++$+++ It's bad luck.  And I believe hugely in luck.
L81598 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, Robert - I am.  I'll go tell Eve about Ben now, Robert.
L81597 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ I see...  ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you?
L81596 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I love Eve very much.
L81595 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ ... You've become quite a close friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr...  ... Chance...?
L81594 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Eve is going to stay. The house will not be closed.
L81593 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ In a day or two, yes.
L81592 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Will you be leaving now, Robert?
L81591 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Yes, I suppose that's true.
L81590 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, Robert. I have seen it before. It happens to old people.
L81589 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ ... He's gone, Chauncey.
L81025 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Oh, really?
L81024 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you?
L81023 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I would like to walk today.
L81022 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Thank you, Robert.
L81021 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ ... It's five of, you'd best get on in there.
L81020 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ How do I know when it's ten o'clock?
L81019 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
L81018 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, Ben told me to be in his room at ten o'clock.
L81017 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ He does, does he?
L81016 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. Ben called me. He wants me to meet the President.
L81015 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ ... Oh? You've heard?
L81014 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, Robert. I know about the President.
L81013 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ ... Oh.  ... My God, I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He's due here soon, I believe.
L81012 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No, Robert.
L81011 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ ... Were you going somewhere?
L81008 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Hardly any, Robert.
L81007 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ ... Benjamin has been hounding me to allow him to address the annual meeting of his Financial Institute today, but obviously, the strain would be impossible... How about here, Chauncey, any soreness?
L81006 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, Robert. But it's not bad.
L81005 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ I swear, Chauncey, between you and Benjamin, I've got my hands full...  ... Say, that is coming along, the swelling has gone down considerably...  ... Any pain here?
L81004 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Shame on you, Chauncey - you should let me be the judge of that.  Please, sit in the chair.
L81003 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ It's fine today, Robert.
L81002 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Chauncey, there you are. What are you doing on that leg?
L80955 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, Robert. I will.
L80954 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ ... And please call me Robert.
L80895 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, I will.
L80894 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ I'll send Wilson up to take you for X-rays, Mr. Gardiner. Feel free to use the telephone, and please let me know if you have any discomfort.
L80893 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ No.
L80892 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Fine. Would you like me to speak to your personal physician?
L80891 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.
L80890 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Good, keep your weight off that leg, Mr. Gardiner. In fact, it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two, if that would be would be possible. Since Benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs. I can promise you the finest in care, unless, of course, you would prefer to go elsewhere.
L80889 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Thank you.
L80888 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Oh, I see...  ... Well, then... You're a very funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught me off guard, I must admit...
L80887 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ There's no need for a claim, the garden is a healthy one.
L80886 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys?
L80885 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes.
L80884 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ An attorney?
L80883 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Thomas Franklin, an attorney.
L80882 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Thomas? Who's Thomas?
L80881 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Claim...? ... Oh, claim, that's what Thomas asked me.
L80880 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Yes. Are you planning on making any sort of claim against the Rand's?
L80879 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ ... Straight out?
L80878 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Just to take the proper precautions, Mr. Gardiner, I'd recommend we take you downstairs and X-ray your leg.  ... By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I would like to ask you something straight out.
L80877 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Oh, fine.
L80876 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ You can pull your trousers up, now.
L80875 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I see.
L80874 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ However, with injuries such as this, I have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after.
L80873 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Yes. I think so, too.
L80872 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ It's good that there was no apparent damage to the bone.
L80871 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ But not for long...
L80870 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ You were wrong, it did hurt.
L80869 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Now, you'll barely feel this. It won't hurt at all.
L80868 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I understand. I've seen it done before.
L80867 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ The injection will ease the pain and swelling, Mr. Gardiner.
L81573 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ I know, Robert... But, strangely enough, I don't feel too bad about now... I feel all right... I guess it's easier... knowing Chauncey is here... to take care of things...
L81572 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ It's not good, Ben - I'm sure you can feel it.
L81571 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ No more, Robert... No more needles...
L81315 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ In a minute, Robert - in a minute... Chauncey, I would like to ask a favor of you...
L81314 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ And you, Benjamin, must be strong and brave for me. Turn over, please.
L80982 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ We have common foes, Chauncey - kid lawyers and our physician!
L80981 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Some pain is to be expected...  ... And I think what would be best for the two of you is a good night's rest.  ... It's late, I'm afraid it's time for my patients to prepare for bed.
L80972 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ That is so true. You're different, Chauncey... Quite different than most men.
L80971 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ ... No, of course you don't. Excuse me for being so presumptuous. No man knows everything about another man - however, very few are honest enough to admit it.
L80938 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ Of course! By kid-lawyers!
L80937 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ To everyone, I'm afraid. The Government controls are so restricting that the Medical Profession, as we know it, is being legislated out of existence.
L80936 +++$+++ u4012 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ RAND +++$+++ I know exactly what you mean. Today the businessman is at the mercy of kid-lawyers from the SEC. All they want to do is regulate our natural growth! It's happening across the country!
L81621 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ I think we'd better go look for him.  David!
L81620 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I do - we do - both of us, Ben and I feel so much for Chauncey...
L81619 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ You really care for him, don't you, Eve?
L81618 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ We have to find him, Robert - he could be lost, something may have happened, we can't leave him!
L81617 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I wish he were here...
L81616 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ I don't think so, he should be along soon...
L81615 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... Do you think we should look for him?
L81610 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Chauncey is so sensitive... He was overcome with grief...
L81609 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ ... He walked off...
L81165 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ He's resting comfortably now. There's no cause for alarm, yet...
L81164 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... But he's...?
L81163 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ ... Eve - this has been an exhausting day for Ben...
L80906 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ No, Eve... I'm sorry.
L80905 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days.  ... Robert... Is there any improvement...?
L80904 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ At times, yes. But that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident. Actually, I found him to have quite a sense of humor.
L80903 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ He's very intense, and internal, don't you think?
L80902 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a welcome change of pace.
L80901 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Yes, he is different... Not the kind of person one usually meets in Washington.
L80900 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Not necessary, but preferable. I don't think he'll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of man.
L80899 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Stay here? Is that necessary?
L80898 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ A rather large contusion, but I don't feel there is any serious damage. I'd like to keep an eye on him, though - I suggested that he stay here for a couple of days.
L80897 +++$+++ u3998 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?
L80896 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Good God, Eve - you'll freeze out here.
L81478 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Certainly, glad to be of help.
L81477 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin.
L81476 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Of course, Doctor, I understand.
L81475 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ I see.  Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and Miss Hayes to keep this incident with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves. There's no telling what he was involved in, and the matter may be extremely confidential. So please, not a word.
L81474 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Well, he said it was his, he walked us through it.
L81473 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ Hmmm. You say he showed you his garden?
L81472 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ Another thing that baffles me, Doctor - what was his connection with the deceased? Major financial dealings, obviously - but our firm has no record of any such transactions.
L81471 +++$+++ u3990 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ ALLENBY +++$+++ I have no idea...
L81470 +++$+++ u4000 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ FRANKLIN +++$+++ ... And he told us that he had been living there since he was a child, working as a gardener. He showed us a room in the garage, where he said he stayed, and I... Well, I didn't really believe him, of course - but why the act?
L81553 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Gentlemen, needless to say, there is going to be a full Congressional investigation of your respective operations.  Good night.
L81552 +++$+++ u3991 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ BALDWIN +++$+++ Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.
L81551 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
L81550 +++$+++ u3991 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ BALDWIN +++$+++ I don't think that's entirely true, Grover.
L81547 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Very well... Can we rule out inefficiency...?
L81546 +++$+++ u3991 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ BALDWIN +++$+++ Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out.
L81545 +++$+++ u4011 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ PRESIDENT +++$+++ Gentlemen, I didn't call you here at such an hour to make accusations, I just want to explore the possibilities. Now, I have three questions; Is the man a foreign agent? Or, have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient? Or, thirdly, have the man's files been destroyed? Now, I'd like some answers.
L80929 +++$+++ u3992 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ BILLINGS +++$+++ Please, hold still, Mr. Gardiner.
L80928 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ I understand. I've never seen anything like this on television.
L80922 +++$+++ u3992 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ BILLINGS +++$+++ Well, I still don't believe I know the man, Mr. Gardiner. Now, hold still.
L80921 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ A Black man gave me the message.
L80920 +++$+++ u3992 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ BILLINGS +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L80919 +++$+++ u3993 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ CHANCE +++$+++ Oh. I have a message for him.
L80918 +++$+++ u3992 +++$+++ m266 +++$+++ BILLINGS +++$+++ No sir, I don't believe I do.
