L149461 +++$+++ u4692 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ELLY +++$+++ She's dead.  She's gone.  And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too.  I hate this place; it isn't fair.
L149460 +++$+++ u4693 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ You brought flowers.  As long as you don't forget her, Elly, she lives.
L149457 +++$+++ u4693 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ A remembrance.  A closure.
L149456 +++$+++ u4692 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ELLY +++$+++ What's going on...?
L149248 +++$+++ u4693 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ I have to go.
L149247 +++$+++ u4692 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ELLY +++$+++ You gotta go now, I bet.
L149246 +++$+++ u4693 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ No.
L149245 +++$+++ u4692 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ELLY +++$+++ Do you feel okay.
L149243 +++$+++ u4692 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ELLY +++$+++ No name.  You sure ask a lot of questions.
L149242 +++$+++ u4693 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Does she have a name?
L149241 +++$+++ u4692 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ELLY +++$+++ Can you play "Teddy Bears' Picnic?"  It used to be her favorite.
L149240 +++$+++ u4693 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ I can pick out a tune now and again.
L149238 +++$+++ u4692 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ELLY +++$+++ He has a room, upstairs.  I don't like him very much.
L149237 +++$+++ u4693 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Mister Funboy lives there?
L149236 +++$+++ u4692 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ELLY +++$+++ Mister Funboy.
L149235 +++$+++ u4693 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Who?
L149234 +++$+++ u4692 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ELLY +++$+++ My mom works over there.  I'm waiting for her, but she's probably with him, right now.
L149214 +++$+++ u4693 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ I dabble.  May I?
L149213 +++$+++ u4692 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ELLY +++$+++ You look like a rock star without a job.
L149363 +++$+++ u4698 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Oh.
L149362 +++$+++ u4692 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ELLY +++$+++ Mom tried to cook.
L149361 +++$+++ u4698 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Chili dog for breakfast... it's original.
L149032 +++$+++ u4692 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ELLY +++$+++ She's still dead.
L149031 +++$+++ u4698 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Well, how's your friend?
L149030 +++$+++ u4692 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ELLY +++$+++ I went to see a friend of mine.
L149029 +++$+++ u4698 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ What's goin' on, Elly?
L149375 +++$+++ u4696 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ GRANGE +++$+++ I need to find him kind of soon, Elly.
L149374 +++$+++ u4692 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ELLY +++$+++ You buying?  He kinda wanders around.  You'll see him if you pay attention.
L149373 +++$+++ u4692 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ELLY +++$+++ Right.
L149372 +++$+++ u4696 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ GRANGE +++$+++ I'm looking for a good guitar man.
L149371 +++$+++ u4692 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ELLY +++$+++ You're not a cop, either.  What do you want him for?
L149370 +++$+++ u4696 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ GRANGE +++$+++ I'd like to get in touch with him.
L149369 +++$+++ u4692 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ELLY +++$+++ I don't know you.
L149368 +++$+++ u4696 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ GRANGE +++$+++ I know your friend, too -- the one that looks like a rock star.
L149137 +++$+++ u4693 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Victims.  Aren't we all.
L149136 +++$+++ u4701 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ TIN-TIN +++$+++ Holy shit... you're dead, man...
L149135 +++$+++ u4701 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ TIN-TIN +++$+++ I don't know you...
L149134 +++$+++ u4693 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin.
L149133 +++$+++ u4701 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ TIN-TIN +++$+++ Hey, I got my rocks off, so fuck you in the ass, man.
L149132 +++$+++ u4693 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ You cut her.  You raped her.  You watched!
L149131 +++$+++ u4701 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ TIN-TIN +++$+++ Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...  Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her too, I think.
L149130 +++$+++ u4693 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ A year ago.  Halloween.  A man and a woman.  In a loft.  You helped to murder them.
L149127 +++$+++ u4693 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Murderer.
L149126 +++$+++ u4701 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ TIN-TIN +++$+++ Little early from trick-or-treat, homie.  This dick trying to bushwack me.
L149410 +++$+++ u4693 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Rowdy.  Let me fill in some gaps for you.
L149409 +++$+++ u4702 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ TOP DOLLAR +++$+++ I never forget anything, dickhead. That building was a sweep-and- clear; the bitch was a nuisance with her goddamned petition.  It got a little rowdy... end of story.
L149408 +++$+++ u4693 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ You don't even remember...
L149407 +++$+++ u4702 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ TOP DOLLAR +++$+++ Who gives a fuck!  I'm a businessman.  You gonna do me, then do me and shut you're face!
L149406 +++$+++ u4693 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ It's yesterday!  Do you know what you destroyed?
L149405 +++$+++ u4702 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ TOP DOLLAR +++$+++ That's ancient history.
L149404 +++$+++ u4693 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ A year ago.  A very nice lady circulated a petition.  She died. Last Halloween.  Answer yes or no.
L149403 +++$+++ u4702 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ TOP DOLLAR +++$+++ Take the dope, too.
L149402 +++$+++ u4693 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Do you know what you destroyed?
L149401 +++$+++ u4702 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ TOP DOLLAR +++$+++ Five large, in the drawer right over there.  I never saw you.
L149400 +++$+++ u4693 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Top Dollar, you're the only one here still wasting good air...
L149180 +++$+++ u4693 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ A whole club of pirates, with pirate names...
L149179 +++$+++ u4695 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ Like the car.  He hangs out with Skank. that little ass-hair, and they hang at the Pit -- hell, Funboy lives there.  Ask Top Dollar.
L149178 +++$+++ u4693 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ T-Bird?
L149177 +++$+++ u4695 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar.
L149176 +++$+++ u4693 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Another jolly nickname?
L149175 +++$+++ u4695 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ Top Dollar.
L149170 +++$+++ u4693 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Wrong answer.
L149169 +++$+++ u4695 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ I ain't got no fuckin' ring.
L149168 +++$+++ u4693 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Cute nickname, don't you think?
L149535 +++$+++ u4697 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ LAO +++$+++ I took yours from you.  Your little girlfriend?  I took hers, too.  Your meaningless, petty life?  I took it so that tonight your existence might gain a purpose.  You're no avenger. You're mine.
L149534 +++$+++ u4693 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ And how many lives have you destroyed?
L149512 +++$+++ u4697 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ LAO +++$+++ I don't believe that. Lao motions to Grange with the killing blade.  Grange RELAXES his deathgrip on the crow.  MOVE IN CLOSE on Eric so we may perceive a palpable degree of relief.
L149511 +++$+++ u4693 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ You're too late.  There was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to.  But he turned to dust and blew away.  I don't have any power for you to take.
L149510 +++$+++ u4697 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ LAO +++$+++ Sooner or later, my action were destined to bring me a genuine Fury.  And it turned out to be you. At last.  I appreciate your abilities as few mortals can. That's why I desire them.
L149509 +++$+++ u4697 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ LAO +++$+++ I know.  That is why I will prevail.  Mr. Grange... ?
L149508 +++$+++ u4693 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.
L149507 +++$+++ u4697 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ LAO +++$+++ I wish to possess what you have now.
L149501 +++$+++ u4697 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ LAO +++$+++ Of course you can. ANGLE - GRANGE IN THE GALLERY --  in darkness.  The running lights on his night-scoped, laser-sighted sniper's rifle which THROWS vague sprays of eerie red and green light.
L149500 +++$+++ u4693 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ I can see her.
L149499 +++$+++ u4697 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ LAO +++$+++ I believe our friend Elly call you Mister Crow.  Please acknowledge; the mike will pick you up.
L149293 +++$+++ u4693 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Your pain ends now.
L149292 +++$+++ u4694 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ FUNBOY +++$+++ No, wait, no WAIT, that's too much, man, that's like overkill, nobody can take that much, you're wasting it -- !
L149290 +++$+++ u4694 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ FUNBOY +++$+++ Does it hurt?!  You dead-ass, clown-faced fuck, of course it fucking hurts!  What the shit are you gonna do about this?!
L149289 +++$+++ u4693 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Does it hurt?
L149288 +++$+++ u4694 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ FUNBOY +++$+++ Owwwaaaa -- fuck me!  Look what you did to my sheets, you lame piece'a shit!  AAAAaa!  Goddd!
L149285 +++$+++ u4694 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ FUNBOY +++$+++ Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.
L149284 +++$+++ u4693 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Neither.
L149282 +++$+++ u4693 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Magic.
L149281 +++$+++ u4694 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ FUNBOY +++$+++ How the hell did you do that?
L149497 +++$+++ u4699 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ SKULL COWBOY +++$+++ Very well, it's your ass.
L149496 +++$+++ u4693 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Don't waste my time.
L149492 +++$+++ u4693 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ I'm already alone.
L149491 +++$+++ u4699 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ SKULL COWBOY +++$+++ You'll be alone.
L149490 +++$+++ u4693 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Fine with me.
L149489 +++$+++ u4699 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ SKULL COWBOY +++$+++ Do this thing and you will be vulnerable.  The blood will not return.  No powers.  No reunion.  Nothing.
L149488 +++$+++ u4693 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Tell me I'll get hurt.  That I might die.  I've already done that.  I don't need anyone's help.  Yours included.
L149487 +++$+++ u4699 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ SKULL COWBOY +++$+++ Your job is done.  You interfere with the living again.
L149299 +++$+++ u4699 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ SKULL COWBOY +++$+++ Maybe I was wrong about you.
L149298 +++$+++ u4693 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Shut up.
L149297 +++$+++ u4699 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ SKULL COWBOY +++$+++ You need to learn to mind your own business or you'll never get where you think you're going.
L149296 +++$+++ u4693 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Go away.
L149295 +++$+++ u4699 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ SKULL COWBOY +++$+++ Getting a little ambitious and extracurricular, aren't we?
L149143 +++$+++ u4699 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ SKULL COWBOY +++$+++ You work for the dead.  Forget that, and you can forget it all.
L149142 +++$+++ u4693 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy.
L149141 +++$+++ u4699 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ SKULL COWBOY +++$+++ Glad to see you're finally with the program.
L149115 +++$+++ u4693 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Leave me alone -- !
L149114 +++$+++ u4699 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ SKULL COWBOY +++$+++ Get it?
L149111 +++$+++ u4699 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ SKULL COWBOY +++$+++ Kill the men who killed you both, and the Day of the Dead will be your reunion.
L149110 +++$+++ u4693 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Yes.
L149109 +++$+++ u4699 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ SKULL COWBOY +++$+++ Miss her?
L149108 +++$+++ u4693 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ Shelly?
L149107 +++$+++ u4699 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ SKULL COWBOY +++$+++ Having fun yet?  No?  I'll give you a hint.  Remember whatshername?
L149034 +++$+++ u4699 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ SKULL COWBOY +++$+++ Interested?  Follow the crow.
L149033 +++$+++ u4693 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ ERIC +++$+++ What the hell are you?
L149079 +++$+++ u4700 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ T-BIRD +++$+++ Yeah, I know, fatso.  Do us all a favor.  Make Top Dollar smile.
L149078 +++$+++ u4695 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ What's this -- a little, ah, bloodstain, right?  Fifty bucks for the box, and I'm doin' you a --
L149077 +++$+++ u4700 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ T-BIRD +++$+++ Leather purse...
L149076 +++$+++ u4695 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ Nineteen bucks at Sears.  Fake,
L149075 +++$+++ u4700 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ T-BIRD +++$+++ ...necklace... pearls...
L149074 +++$+++ u4695 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ 18k.  Crap.
L149073 +++$+++ u4700 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ T-BIRD +++$+++ Coupla more rings... 24k.
L149071 +++$+++ u4700 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ T-BIRD +++$+++ Whoa, hey, whoa.  Business.
L149070 +++$+++ u4695 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ GIDEON +++$+++ Blow yourself, bigmouth.
L149506 +++$+++ u4696 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ GRANGE +++$+++ Move in, guys.
L149505 +++$+++ u4697 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ LAO +++$+++ No shooting.
L149504 +++$+++ u4696 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ GRANGE +++$+++ I've got him if you want him.
L149494 +++$+++ u4697 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ LAO +++$+++ Is he inside?
L149493 +++$+++ u4696 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ GRANGE +++$+++ We've got company.
L149453 +++$+++ u4696 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ GRANGE +++$+++ Kill a dead guy?
L149452 +++$+++ u4697 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ LAO +++$+++ Who is only invulnerable so long as he cares about the dead.  When he begins to care about the living, you'll find his heart can bleed... and I want it to bleed for me.
L149450 +++$+++ u4696 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ GRANGE +++$+++ Only thing you'll get from that clown is a faster way to die. LAO To the contrary...
L149449 +++$+++ u4697 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ LAO +++$+++ Mmm.  But tonight I can take what is his.
L149448 +++$+++ u4696 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ GRANGE +++$+++ Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.
L149447 +++$+++ u4697 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ LAO +++$+++ Do you know of spirit assassins? You do know the dead can rise? Properly motivated, of course.
L149446 +++$+++ u4696 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ GRANGE +++$+++ Not a Plymouth Fury, I bet.
L149445 +++$+++ u4697 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ LAO +++$+++ I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is.  I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury.
L149444 +++$+++ u4696 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ GRANGE +++$+++ Give me a break.  That guy's a wacko...
L149443 +++$+++ u4697 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ LAO +++$+++ Extremely so.  You and I are the recipients of unwanted good fortune, in the form of a man everyone is calling The Crow.
L149442 +++$+++ u4696 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ GRANGE +++$+++ That thing is poisonous.
L149441 +++$+++ u4697 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ LAO +++$+++ This is a cobra, Mr. Grange.  Yes, it is real.
L149440 +++$+++ u4696 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ GRANGE +++$+++ What... the hell is that?
L149327 +++$+++ u4696 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ GRANGE +++$+++ No.  I saw a guitar.  This isn't some rock-n-roller you forgot to pay, is it?  There was a drawing on the wall that looked like a bird.  In blood.
L149326 +++$+++ u4697 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ LAO +++$+++ Did you see an animal of any kind? Did you see a bird?
L149389 +++$+++ u4697 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ LAO +++$+++ Your comprehension is not required.  Your cooperation and, indeed, your ability are the issues on the table.
L149388 +++$+++ u4702 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ TOP DOLLAR +++$+++ Nice speech.  What's it supposed to mean?
L149387 +++$+++ u4697 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ LAO +++$+++ Do you think this childish machismo impresses me?  When I was a boy in Saigon I watched my country change one block at a time,  one building at a time.  Whole lives erased.  A way of life, polluted.  Today, no one forces me to move.  I use my powers to change your country, one block at a time,  one building at a time.
L149382 +++$+++ u4702 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ TOP DOLLAR +++$+++ The night is young.
L149381 +++$+++ u4697 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ LAO +++$+++ Come now.  You've seen the graffiti -- all over the city in the few hors it has taken your men to drop like plague victims. What about your turf, Top?  You don't seem to have ripped out anyone's heart yet.
L149380 +++$+++ u4702 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ TOP DOLLAR +++$+++ "Our" Crow...?
L149379 +++$+++ u4697 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ LAO +++$+++ Sounds like our "Crow" is out-maneuvering you.
L149226 +++$+++ u4697 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ LAO +++$+++ To be sure.  Now tell how your friend died.
L149225 +++$+++ u4702 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ TOP DOLLAR +++$+++ Anybody violates my turf -- our turf -- I'll rip out there heart and show it to 'em.
L149224 +++$+++ u4697 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ LAO +++$+++ I know of no one.  But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?
L149223 +++$+++ u4702 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ TOP DOLLAR +++$+++ I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
L149222 +++$+++ u4697 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ LAO +++$+++ I had heard something like this.  Describe it for me.  The "hit".
L149221 +++$+++ u4702 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ TOP DOLLAR +++$+++ One of mine.  And it wasn't a standard hit.
L149220 +++$+++ u4697 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ LAO +++$+++ Who got himself what?
L149219 +++$+++ u4702 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ TOP DOLLAR +++$+++ Bad news.  Alot of action on the streets tonight, and nobody bothered to clear it with me.  Tin- Tin got himself whacked.
L149218 +++$+++ u4697 +++$+++ m311 +++$+++ LAO +++$+++ An unexpected pleasure.
L150516 +++$+++ u4704 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ ANNETTE +++$+++ I know.
L150515 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ You can't do this to me. It could ruin me.
L150514 +++$+++ u4704 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ ANNETTE +++$+++ Actually, I was planning on running down to Kinkos. Do you think you could give me ride?
L150513 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ You didn't show it to anybody?
L150512 +++$+++ u4704 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ ANNETTE +++$+++ His journal. He sent it to me the day before he died. Everything about you is in it. The blow jobs, the hand jobs, the menages, your bout with bulimia, the affair you had with your guidance counselor and how he gave you... eww. Let's see, then there's your coke problem... You still keep it in your crucifix, don't you? It's all in there.
L150511 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ You what?
L150510 +++$+++ u4704 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ ANNETTE +++$+++ I have his journal.
L150509 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Sebastian was a pathological liar. I wouldn't believe a word he -
L150508 +++$+++ u4704 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ ANNETTE +++$+++ Kathryn, I know all about you and Sebastian.
L150507 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have some respect.
L150506 +++$+++ u4704 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ ANNETTE +++$+++ You heard me.
L150505 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Excuse me?
L150504 +++$+++ u4704 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ ANNETTE +++$+++ Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.
L150503 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can't go on I...  turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but -
L150502 +++$+++ u4704 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ ANNETTE +++$+++ Thank you.
L150501 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Well, I'll leave you alone now. I just came in here to get something of mine.
L150500 +++$+++ u4704 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ ANNETTE +++$+++ I'll be fine.
L150499 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Are you okay?
