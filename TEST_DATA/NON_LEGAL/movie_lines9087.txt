L236663 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Just promise you'll do it.
L236662 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you.
L236661 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun.
L236660 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L236659 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ I've been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and convince people that we're like these totally rich yuppies...
L236658 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ What, is she black now?
L236657 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ "Funky"?
L236655 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Somewhere downtown.
L236654 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ We're not sure yet, that's why we're looking.
L236645 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Forget it, I can't explain it...
L236644 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Not really...
L236643 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Yeah, but... you know what I mean.
L236642 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ That guy is many things but he definitely isn't "cool"... This one would be okay, but there's no kitchen...
L236641 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I dunno... I kind of like him... He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate... In a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool...
L236640 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one  ...Oh wait...  you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...
L236639 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Oh yeah...
L236638 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ What about the "striking redhead in the yellow dress"?
L236637 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ It was so cute how he had his own little bags. I thought I was going to start crying!... Do you think they're gay?
L236636 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ He was so excited when you bought that record -- you're a saint!... God, these apartments are super expensive...
L236635 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I know... I still can't get over that his name was "Seymour."
L236634 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ That was truly pathetic.
L236602 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Ew, it's like some gross rat...
L236601 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I think it's cute - look at his little weasel teeth.
L236600 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Gross!
L236599 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Ew, look at this...
L236598 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Come on, it's too late now...
L236597 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ What should we do? What if he recognizes us?
L236594 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Bingo!
L236593 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ The W.C. Fields Fan Club Newsletter...  Oh my God, The National Psoriasis Foundation!
L236589 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I'm afraid if I see him, I'll start feeling really bad again.
L236588 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ He won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance.
L236587 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ This is way too creepy.
L236584 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ This kind of thing must happen to him all the time.
L236583 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?
L236582 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ He doesn't even look that bummed out, really.
L236575 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ We should follow him home.
L236574 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ He's insane!
L236573 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Totally! Look!
L236572 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Are you sure?
L236566 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I dunno...
L236565 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Do you think he knows?
L236561 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ He's still just sitting there. God, this is totally unbearable!
L236560 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ What's he doing now?
L236558 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Oh my god, he just ordered a giant glass of milk!
L236557 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ What's going on now? What's he doing?
L236556 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ I can't believe it!
L236555 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ It's obviously him!
L236550 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ What exactly is a cardigan anyway?
L236549 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Is he wearing a green cardigan?
L236544 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ She says she wants to MMPH!
L236543 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ SHUT UP!
L236540 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I'm going to tell him you said that.
L236539 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ I want to "make love" to him.
L236534 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ It's still twenty-five minutes early.
L236533 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Look, maybe that's him!
L236532 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Yeah, Josh, c'mon... MOVE IT!
L236531 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.
L236530 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ God, I think Josh is too mature for us.
L236501 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Shh, it's his answering machine...  We hear the indistinct traces of a musical message followed by a faint BEEP.
L236500 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ What does it stand for?
L236499 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I remember when I first started reading these I thought DWF stood for "dwarf!"
L236498 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ You're better at it.
L236497 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Why do I always have to do it?
L236496 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ You call.
L236495 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Oh yeah.
L236494 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ You know, the green cardigan guy.
L236493 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Which loser?
L236492 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Hey! We forgot to call the loser!
L236491 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Fuck you!
L236490 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ That Larry guy -- what look was he going for? A gay tennis player from the forties?
L236489 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ What are you talking about -- who?
L236488 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I bet! Actually he reminds me of that one creep you went out with -- you always go for guys with some lame, fake shtick.
L236487 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ I want to do him!
L236478 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ No, she was the second wife. The third one was the super-bitch - Maxine.  There! Look at her!
L236477 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch?
L236476 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ There's my dad with Joanie.
L236475 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ I remember every minute of that party.
L236474 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Look, that's back when I hated you.
L236473 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ What a little hosebag.
L236472 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Look at how cute I am!
L236471 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I've been looking all over for this.
L236470 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
L236469 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Hey - why do you have this?
L236466 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I dunno. John Ellis always puts on all this sick stuff that I have to fast-forward past to get to the good stuff.  There's supposed to be a Don Knotts movie on here someplace.
L236465 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ What is this?
L236464 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Wait... I just want to see what's on this tape.
L236463 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ So what should we do?
L236461 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Isn't it weird? It's her favorite.
L236460 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Does Oomie really like this show?
L236455 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Oh, we totally have to.
L236454 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ We should call him and pretend to be the redhead.
L236453 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I know. And he's like psychotically obsessing over every little detail.
L236452 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ God, that's so pathetic. I bet she didn't even notice him.
L236451 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Jesus! Listen to this one: "Do you remember me? Airport shuttle, June 7th. You: striking redhead with yellow dress, pearl necklace, brown shoes. I was the bookish fellow in the green cardigan who helped you find your contact lens. Am I crazy, or did we have a moment?"
L236448 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Gross.
L236447 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Okay, well here's yours...  "Who said all the most eligible bachelors are taken? Not this one! Stunning bod, very snugglelicious ocean sunset dreamer."
L236446 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ You can have that one.
L236445 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ God, this paper is so boring. Who reads all this shit?  Here we go...  "Windsurfing Doctor, Mensan IQ, maverick Sagittarius. Let's hit the clubs, make each other laugh!"
L236444 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Check out the Personals... maybe our future husbands are trying to contact us.
L236443 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ What does that even mean?
L236442 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ I know... and instead of "dessert" it says "Mindbenders."
L236441 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Did you notice all those weird things on the menu? Like "The Salad Explosion"?
L236439 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ You loser!
L236438 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ I might actually get the pasta special.
L236433 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Can we call you "Weird Al"?
L236432 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Hi, Al!
L236429 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I feel as though I've stepped into a time warp!
L236428 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Who can forget this great hit from the 50's?
L236427 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ God, it's so totally pathetic.
L236426 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ "Authentic 50's diner"? Since when were there mini-malls in the 1950's?
L236425 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Hey, look at this...
L236424 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Okay, okay!
L236423 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and --
L236422 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Or maybe not.
L236421 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Maybe there's some weird secret satanic society that meets at the Quality Cafe and all of the other regular customers are in on it except for us.
L236420 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ That lets us off the hook.
L236419 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...
L236418 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ What do you do if you're a satanist, anyway?
L236417 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ In fact, never.
L236416 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Much later.
L236411 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ We should follow them!
L236410 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Hey, look, the satanists are leaving!
L236401 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I know, it hasn't really hit me yet.
L236400 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ God, it's so weird that we're finally out of high school... We've been waiting for this our whole life! Now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want.  It's such a weird feeling.
L236399 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Yeah, I just picked the one that sounded the easiest.
L236398 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Did you sign up yet?
L236397 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.
L236396 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ So, when are we going to start looking for our apartment?
L236395 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Just look at them!
L236394 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Why?
L236393 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Look at these people behind you. I'm totally convinced they're Satanists.
L236392 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Hi.
L236391 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ God, think about that... that's actually totally depressing.
L236390 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Good.
L236389 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ God, just think, we'll never see Dennis again.
L236388 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ He better watch out or he'll get AIDS when he date-rapes her.
L236387 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ How perfect.
L236386 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Oh my god, look! Is Stacy Himmler going out with Rod Harbaugh?
L236369 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ I know, she needs to die immediately.
L236368 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Since when is she an "actress"?
L236360 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Forget it...
L236359 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ What? Why?
L236358 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Uh oh... don't turn around...
L236357 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Shut up!
L236356 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Unless they're in your Summer school class!
L236355 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Just think, we'll never have to see any of these creepy faces ever again.
L236354 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again...
L236353 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ This is so bad, it's almost good.
L236352 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ You loser.
L236351 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Remember that stupid hippie art teacher who failed me sophomore year? I didn't think that just because you get an "F" that means you have to take the class over again.
L236350 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ Why?
L236349 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ These assholes are saying that I have to go to Summer school and take some stupid art class!
L236348 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ What?
L236347 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ What?... Oh suck my fucking dick!
L236346 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ It's totally sickening.  Let's see if they gave me the right diploma...
L236345 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I know, I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her.
L236344 +++$+++ u1106 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ REBECCA +++$+++ I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
L236343 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ God, what a bunch of retards...
L236384 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ See, that's exactly the kind of thing we're trying to avoid. 
L236383 +++$+++ u1110 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications.
L236382 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ What are you going to be when you grow up, Todd?
L236379 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Just because.
L236378 +++$+++ u1110 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Really? Both of you?... Why not?
L236377 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ We're not.
L236374 +++$+++ u1110 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ TODD +++$+++ Oh, hey Enid...  So... we finally made it!
L236373 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ What about me? Am I not even here?
L236650 +++$+++ u1105 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ MELORRA +++$+++ I love this place... it's so - you know, "funky."
L236649 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Well, we won't keep you.
L236648 +++$+++ u1105 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ MELORRA +++$+++ My acting workshop is across the street from here. I'm just on my break.
L236647 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ What are you doing here, Melorra?
L236646 +++$+++ u1105 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ MELORRA +++$+++ Oh my god, what are you guys doing here?
L236367 +++$+++ u1105 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ MELORRA +++$+++ Well, bye you guys... CONGRATULATIONS!
L236366 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Oh yeah, that'll definitely happen...
L236365 +++$+++ u1105 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ MELORRA +++$+++ I'm going to be in this actor's workshop, and I'm hoping to start going on auditions soon. I'm so excited to finally have some free time. We have to get together this summer!
L236364 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Nothing.
L236363 +++$+++ u1105 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ MELORRA +++$+++ So what are you guys doing this Summer?
L236362 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.
L236361 +++$+++ u1105 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ MELORRA +++$+++ Oh my God, you guys! I can't believe we made it!
L237460 +++$+++ u1104 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ Listen, young lady... I know you don't like me -- I don't really care whether you do or not -- but I will not allow you to treat your father the way you do.
L237459 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
L237458 +++$+++ u1104 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death!
L237457 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Shhh!
L237456 +++$+++ u1104 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ May I ask what you're doing?
L237156 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I'm taking a remedial high school art class for fuck-ups and retards.
L237155 +++$+++ u1104 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ MAXINE +++$+++ It's really quite something to see you all grown up like this, Enid.  I'd love to hear about what you're doing. I can't help but feel that I had some small part in how you turned out...  What are you studying? You were always such a smart little girl.
L237314 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Where did you get those pants?
L237313 +++$+++ u1097 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Don't mind me, I'll just be in my room.
L236733 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ It's kind of falling apart.
L236732 +++$+++ u1097 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...
L236731 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ I thought it wasn't for sale.
L236730 +++$+++ u1097 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You still interested in that?
L236615 +++$+++ u1097 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Him. Seymour. He's the man with the records.
L236614 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Who does?
L236613 +++$+++ u1097 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Seymour does.
L236612 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ Do you have any other old records besides these?
L236611 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ That's okay...
L236610 +++$+++ u1097 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Perhaps the "Jam-in-ator" appeals to you.  Absolutely no practice necessary.  You shread like a giant. Just press a button.
L236608 +++$+++ u1097 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Umm... That's not officially for sale... I might have to hang onto that for the time being.
L236607 +++$+++ u1094 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ ENID +++$+++ How much is this?
L236606 +++$+++ u1097 +++$+++ m72 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ A mongoose... they eat snakes... you never heard of a mongoose?  That's a classic piece of vintage taxidermy. Nobody alive today knows how to do work like that.
