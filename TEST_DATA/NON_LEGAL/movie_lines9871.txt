L249821 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Can we do it at my office?
L249820 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Just meet with the boy once a week.
L249819 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Not Rick? You didn't send him to Rick?
L249817 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Five.
L249816 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ He's from Southie? How many people did you try before you came to me?
L249815 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ You're from the same neighborhood. South Boston.
L249814 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ My kind of background?
L249813 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ I need someone with your kind of background.
L249812 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Why me?
L249811 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ They worked together for the remainder of their lives, producing some of the most exciting math theory ever done. Ramanujan's genius was unparalleled, Sean. This boy is like that. But he's very defensive and I need someone who can get through to him.
L249810 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Where he contracted pneumonia and died at a young age--
L249809 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ --That's right, Sean. He mailed it to a professor at Cambridge who immediately recognized the brilliance in his work and brought Ramanujan to England.
L249808 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ And he mailed it to Hardy--
L249807 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ He was alive over a hundred years ago. He was Indian. Dots, not feathers...
L249806 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Yeah.
L249805 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Not much free time, Gerry. LAMBEAU Have you ever heard of a man named Ramanujan?
L249804 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ This kid's special, Sean. I've never seen anything like him.
L249803 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ I've been busy, Gerry. I got a full schedule.
L249784 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ I got your card.
L249783 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ I'm sorry, that damn conference--
L249782 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Since Nancy died.
L249781 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ You were missed.  How long has it been since we've seen each other?
L249780 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ I've been busy.
L249779 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ I didn't see you at the reunion.
L249765 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Is there someplace we can talk?
L249764 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Good to see you.
L249763 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Good to see you.
L249762 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ The Field's Medal is the Nobel Prize for math.  But it's only given out every four years.
L249761 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Hello.
L249760 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Well, it seems we're in the presence of greatness. Professor Gerald Lambeau is a Field's Medal winner. Combunatorial Mathematics. 1986.
L249759 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ Sean.
L250329 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ The boy was here. He came in, sat down and we worked together.
L250328 +++$+++ u5620 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ What should I do?
L249756 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ He was my roommate in college.
L249755 +++$+++ u5620 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Who is he?
L249754 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ There is somebody...
L249753 +++$+++ u5620 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ What do you want to do?
L249752 +++$+++ u5611 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ LAMBEAU +++$+++ What's the point?
L249751 +++$+++ u5620 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I called Mel Weintraub this morning, to check for availability.
L250450 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ So what do you got, a fuckin' Hyundai engine under there? Can I make it back to my house?
L250449 +++$+++ u5612 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ Had one, now I'm fucked again.
L250448 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ So, you finally got a job Morgan?
L250042 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Yeah, Morgan. It's a real rarity that we'd be out drinkin'.
L250041 +++$+++ u5612 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ Will, I can't believe you brought Skylar here when we're all wrecked. What's she gonna think about us?
L249625 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Hold up.
L249624 +++$+++ u5612 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ There goes that fuckin' Barney right now, with his fuckin' "skiin' trip." We should'a kicked that dude's ass.
L249563 +++$+++ u5612 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ How fuckin' retarded do you have to be to get shit-canned from that job? How hard is it to push a fuckin' broom?
L249562 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Yeah, Morgan. I got fired.
L249561 +++$+++ u5612 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ What happened?  You got fired, huh?
L249535 +++$+++ u5612 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ I don't got a crush on her.
L249534 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Well, she out did herself today...
L249507 +++$+++ u5612 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ Let's hit "Kelly's."
L249506 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I could go for a Whopper.
L249463 +++$+++ u5612 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ MORGAN +++$+++ You guys are fuckin' sick.
L249462 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ It's walkin' pretty slow at this point.
L249706 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You're getting defensive...Henry. And hey, cheif--tell the wife, at least. Christ, set her free.
L249705 +++$+++ u5614 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ PSYCHOLOGIST +++$+++ Well, I can see this is pointless...
L249704 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ If you wanna hit "Ramrod," take your shot. Take some pride in it. You go to church? So fuckin' what, God loves you. I mean, Christ. A guy as well known as you? By the time you put your disguise on and skulk out of the house Sunday nights you probably look like "Inspector Cluseau."
L249703 +++$+++ u5614 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ PSYCHOLOGIST +++$+++ Who is "Danny Terrio?"
L249702 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Look, man. I don't care if you're putting from the rough. There are solid arguments that some of the greatest people in history were gay; Alexander the Great, Caeser, Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Napoleon, Gertrude Stein, not to mention Danny Terrio, not many straight men can dance like that.
L249701 +++$+++ u5614 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ PSYCHOLOGIST +++$+++ You're getting defensive, Will.
L249700 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I'm sure you do. You probably got a real nice house, nice car -- your book's a best seller.
L249699 +++$+++ u5614 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ PSYCHOLOGIST +++$+++ Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children.
L249698 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Buddy, two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump.
L249697 +++$+++ u5614 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ PSYCHOLOGIST +++$+++ That's very presumptuous.
L249696 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ C'mon, I read your book. I talked to you. It's just something I know to be true.
L249695 +++$+++ u5614 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ PSYCHOLOGIST +++$+++ What?
L249694 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay?
L249693 +++$+++ u5614 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ PSYCHOLOGIST +++$+++ I might understand that.
L249692 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Certain, clubs.  Like, Paradise. It's not bad.
L249691 +++$+++ u5614 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ PSYCHOLOGIST +++$+++ What places?
L249690 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I go places, I interact.
L249689 +++$+++ u5614 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ PSYCHOLOGIST +++$+++ Like what, Will?
L249688 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ No, but, I mean you know...I do other things. That no one knows about.
L249687 +++$+++ u5614 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ PSYCHOLOGIST +++$+++ Will, your not getting off that easy.
L249686 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You're right. I know.
L249685 +++$+++ u5614 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ PSYCHOLOGIST +++$+++ Yes. The pressures you feel, and again, I am neither labeling nor judging them, are keeping you from fulfilling your potential -- you're in a rut. So stop the Tom Foolery -- the Shenanigan's, Will.
L249684 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Yeah, I read your book. "Mike" had the same problems as "Chad" the stockbroker.
L249683 +++$+++ u5614 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ PSYCHOLOGIST +++$+++ --you have a quality-- something you were born with, that you have no control over- and you are, in a sense, hiding that by becoming a janitor. And I'm not saying that's wrong. I'm friends with the janitor that works in my building. He's been to my house for dinner. As a matter of fact I did some free consultation for "Mike" -- that's not his real name. That's in my book.
L249682 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I could work the pit maybe, but I could never drive like Dale Ernhart--
L249681 +++$+++ u5614 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ PSYCHOLOGIST +++$+++ Now you know Will, and I know, what you need to be doing. You have a gift.
L249680 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ That's why I love stock-car racin'. That Dale Ernhart's real good.
L250468 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Good luck.
L250467 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ See ya.
L250466 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Only if you grab my ass.
L250465 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?
L250464 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ No. Thank you.
L250462 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ I'm gonna travel a little bit, so I don't know where I'll be.
L250461 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I'll keep in touch.
L250460 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ You're Welcome, Will.
L250459 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I just want you to know, Sean...
L250458 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ We're done. You did your time. You're a free man.
L250457 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Thanks you.  So, that's it? We're done?
L250456 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Good for you. Congratulations.
L250455 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Yeah, I think so.
L250454 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ That's what you want?
L250453 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Over at Tri-tech. One of the jobs Professor Lambeau set me up with. I haven't told him yet, but I talked to my new boss over there and he seemed like a nice guy.
L250452 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Which one did you take, Will?
L250422 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I know, I know...
L250421 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ It's not...
L250420 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I know.
L250419 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ It's not your fault.
L250418 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Don't fuck with me.
L250417 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ It's not your fault.
L250416 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I know.
L250415 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ It's not your fault.
L250414 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I know.
L250413 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ It's not your fault.
L250412 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I know.
L250411 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ It's not your fault.
L250410 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Oh, I know.
L250408 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Cause fuck him, that's why.
L250407 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ The wrench, why?
L250406 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I used to go with the wrench.
L250405 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Gotta go with the belt there...
L250401 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ It sure ain't good.
L250400 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Yes.
L250399 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ --No, have you had any experience with that?
L250398 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Twenty years of counselling you see a lot of--
L250397 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ No.  Have you had any experience with that?
L250396 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ You want to read it?
L250395 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You're not going to fail me are you?
L250394 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Oh, this is your file. I have to send it back to the Judge with my evaluation.
L250393 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Do you want to talk about it?
L250392 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Look, a lot of that stuff goes back a long way.  And it's between me and him and it has nothing to do with you.
L250391 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Well, I'm here.  So, is that my problem? I'm afraid of being abandoned? That was easy.
L250326 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Look at me. What do you want to do?
L250325 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ That's right. And you fuckin' lost! And some people would have the sack to lose a big hand like that and still come back and ante up again!
L250324 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ I been there. I played my hand.
L250323 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ What?
L250322 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ If you won't answer my questions, you're wasting my time.
L250321 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ What?
L250320 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ You're right, Will. Any man who takes a forty minute train ride so those college kids can come in in the morning and their floors will be clean and their trash cans will be empty is an honorable man.
L250319 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Why is it a cop-out? I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. There's honor in that.
L250318 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop-out.
L250317 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I didn't ask for this.
L250316 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ It's not about that job. I'm not saying you should work for the government. But, you could do anything you want. And there are people who work their whole lives layin' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have. What do you want to do?
L250315 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I didn't want the job.
L250314 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Don't give me you line of shit.
L250313 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Oh, what? You're going to take the professor's side on this?
L250312 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road.
L250311 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no...
L250310 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ But you can't give back to them, Will.
L250309 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Not to me, they're not.
L250308 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ They're all dead.
L250307 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Yeah.
L250306 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Someone who challenges you in every way. Who takes you places, opens things up for you. A soul-mate.
L250305 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Define that.
L250304 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Do you have a soul-mate?
L250303 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ What?
L250302 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Do you think you're alone?
L250301 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ What did I think?
L250300 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ What did you think?
L250299 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I guess.
L250298 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Gerry says the meeting went well.
L250297 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I don't know.
L250296 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ So you might be working for Uncle Sam.
L250012 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Well hell, I didn't know Pudge was gonna hit the home run.
L250011 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Would have been nice to catch that game though.
L250010 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ No Will, I'm not kiddin' you. If I had gone to see that game I'd be in here talkin' abouta girl I saw at a bar twenty years ago. And how I always regretted not goin' over there and talkin' to her. I don't regret the eighteen years we were married. I don't regret givin' up couseling for six years when she got sick. I don't regret being by her side for the last two years when things got real bad. And I sure as Hell don't regret missing that damn game.
L250009 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You're kiddin' me.
L250008 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ They could see that I meant it.
L250007 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ "I gotta go see about a girl"? What did they say?
L250006 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ I just slid my ticket across the table and said "sorry fellas, I gotta go see about a girl."
L250005 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I don't care if Helen of Troy walked into that bar! That's game six of the World Series!
L250004 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ You should have seen this girl. She lit up the room.
L250003 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ So wait a minute. The Red Sox haven't won a World Series since nineteen eighteen, you slept out for tickets, games gonna start in twenty minutes, in walks a girl you never seen before, and you give your ticket away?
L250002 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ That's right.
L250001 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You missed Pudge Fisk's homerun to have a drink with a woman you had never met?
L250000 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ I was havin' a drink with my future wife.
L249999 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Where were you?
L249998 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ October 21, 1975. Game six of the World Series. Biggest game in Red Sox history, Me and my friends slept out on the sidewalk all night to get tickets. We were sitting in a bar waiting for the game to start and in walks this girl. What a game that was. Tie game in the bottom of the tenth inning, in steps Carlton Fisk, hit a long fly ball down the left field line. Thirty-five thousand fans on their feet, screamin' at the ball to stay fair. Fisk is runnin' up the baseline, wavin' at the ball like a madman. It hits the foul pole, home run. Thirty-five thousand people went crazy. And I wasn't one of them.
L249997 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ When did you know she was the one?
L249996 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her.
L249995 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You don't regret meetin' your wife?
L249994 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ What? Do I wonder if I'd be better off if I never met my wife?
L249993 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you never met your wife?
L249992 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Lon? He got married. He has a kid. I kind of lost touch with him after Nancy got sick.
L249991 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ What happened to that guy from Kentucky?
L249990 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Yeah.
L249989 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Well, I've read you colleagues. Your book was good, Sean.  All those guys were in your platoon?
L249988 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ I didn't write anything else 'cause nobody, including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one.
L249987 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Is that why you didn't write anything else?
L249986 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ I gave that up when my wife got sick.
L249985 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Why not?
L249984 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ No, I don't.
L249983 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Really? How'd the date go? WILL Do you still counsel veterans?  I read your book last night.
L249967 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Well I think that's a wonderful philosophy, Sean. That way you can go through the rest of your life without having to really know anyone.
L249966 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ My wife's dead.
L249965 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Hence, the word remarried.
L249964 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ My wife's dead.
L249963 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ You ever think about gettin' remarried?
L249962 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ I teach this shit, I didn't say I knew how to do it.
L249960 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ And right now you're perfect too. Maybe you don't want to ruin that.
L249959 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Why? So I can realize she's not so smart. That she's boring. You don't get it. Right now she's perfect, I don't want to ruin that.
L249958 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ So Christ, call her up.
L249957 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ I know what I'm doing. She's different from the other girls I met. We have a really good time. She's smart, beautiful, fun...
L249956 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Jesus Christ, you are an amateur.
L249955 +++$+++ u5621 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ WILL +++$+++ Haven't called her.
L249954 +++$+++ u5615 +++$+++ m373 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Why not?
