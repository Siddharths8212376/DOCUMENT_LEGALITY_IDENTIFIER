L147660 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Give it to me, Sami.
L147659 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ No.
L147658 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be angry... but I'm the one who took the ball and that makes it mine.
L147653 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ No! You can't have the baseball! You're not entitled to the fuckin' baseball!
L147652 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ The baseball is mine.
L147651 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ This is great. After everything we've been through we've got eight hundred euros and an autographed baseball.
L147485 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Hey, you know you can't this in France.
L147484 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ God, I want to go home.
L147483 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ It's good.
L147233 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Yeah and he can't stand it that I tried to do something to better myself.
L147232 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ You guys used to work together?
L147226 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Whatever! He never told me about the Van Gogh or any of the other paintings.
L147225 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ "Vase with twelve Sunflowers."
L146975 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ 
L146974 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Why would they want us to rob the Mafia?
L146971 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ No, that's not Mr. Taylor.
L146970 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Mr. Taylor?
L146969 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ We have a problem. Problem isn't the right word. Dilemma. No that really doesn't describe --  Do you know who that is?
L146957 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Okay.   You can be Elvis.
L146956 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you do.
L146955 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ It's my idea.
L146954 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ -- I want to be Elvis.
L146712 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ I've still got a few legal problems back in the States.
L146711 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ You lived there. You know the city.
L146710 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Me?
L146709 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Normally I'd be breaking your fingers right now, but I'm going to give you a chance to make enough to pay me back and have some extra for yourself. We have a group going to Chicago to do a job. You're going with them.
L146708 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Yeah, I can see that.
L146707 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Today's your lucky day, Sami.
L146704 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Oh, Marcel! I thought you were somebody else. If I knew it was you I would have never run.
L146703 +++$+++ u4663 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ MARCEL +++$+++ Going somewhere?
L147490 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ I see. Well, get back out on the street and find them before I "sort of" kill you.
L147489 +++$+++ u4664 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ NICKY "THE RAKE" +++$+++ They sort of got away.
L147488 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ What happened?
L147298 +++$+++ u4664 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ NICKY "THE RAKE" +++$+++ Just tell me who's closer to the wall?
L147297 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Get in the car.
L147296 +++$+++ u4664 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ NICKY "THE RAKE" +++$+++ Who is closer to the wall, Joey or me?
L146864 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ I said a clean break.
L146863 +++$+++ u4664 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ NICKY "THE RAKE" +++$+++ He's over at St. James. They had to put two pins in his arm.
L146862 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ How's my brother?
L147619 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Fuck me?   Fuck you!
L147618 +++$+++ u4665 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAPHAEL +++$+++ Fuck you, grease-ball!
L147617 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ And I'm tellin' you it ain't! Now, turn your taco-eating ass around and get the hell out of here.
L147616 +++$+++ u4665 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAPHAEL +++$+++ I'm telling you that's my car!   And someone's gonna pay for it!
L147615 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ The hell it is.
L147614 +++$+++ u4665 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAPHAEL +++$+++ No.   It's mine.
L147613 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Yeah.   It's mine.
L147612 +++$+++ u4665 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAPHAEL +++$+++ Anybody know about that car outside?
L147581 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ The papers for the car will arrive tomorrow.
L147580 +++$+++ u4670 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ VINNY +++$+++ No shit?
L147579 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ It's yours. A gift. A gift you could give to your brother... or anyone you owe money to as partial payment.
L147578 +++$+++ u4670 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ VINNY +++$+++ Yeah.
L147577 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ You see that car?
L147576 +++$+++ u4670 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ VINNY +++$+++ How?
L147575 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ I understand. The person who sent me wishes to help you.
L147574 +++$+++ u4670 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ VINNY +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about.
L147573 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ I represent a person who wishes to remain anonymous, but is aware of your current financial problems with your brother.
L147572 +++$+++ u4670 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ VINNY +++$+++ Uh huh.
L147571 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Mr. Zammito?
L147188 +++$+++ u4671 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Cool.
L147187 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ I would like to thank you for your hospitality.  If you are ever in Paris here is my number.
L147111 +++$+++ u4671 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ I know where she went.
L147110 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ How are we going to do that?
L146778 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Although a cartoon I feel he shares a universal theme: We are all searching for love. No?
L146777 +++$+++ u4671 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ Yeah, I dig him.
L146776 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Oh, Pepe Le Pew. He is very funny and quite well known in France.
L146775 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ No thank you.
L146774 +++$+++ u4671 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ WAYNE +++$+++ No problem, man.  Hey, you wanna hit?
L146773 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ I am Raymond.     Thank you for allowing us to stay here.
L147501 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Glenmorangie is very good.
L147500 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Glenmorangie.
L147499 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ J&amp;B?
L147498 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself.
L147497 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ The new Beaujolais' come out in France next week. You like wine?
L147412 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ He's right. Do you have any idea what Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve Sunflowers" is worth?
L147411 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ I say we make him pay first. After that you can do whatever you want to him.
L147264 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Julien, what you're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress. You're projecting your anger onto us.
L147263 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ You're not helping.
L147241 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ It's simple. Bastaldi's moving up. He's closing down his operation and this is his way of saying thanks to all of us.
L147240 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ I said knock it off! Now as far as I'm concerned you two girls can bitch slap yourselves silly when this is over, but right now we've got to figure out what's going on.
L147127 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Where is it, Sophie?
L147126 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ The money isn't here.
L147116 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Wait here.
L147115 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ How do we know what room she's in?
L147093 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ What?
L147092 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Holy shit.
L146916 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Oh, you think?
L146915 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ I think we went the wrong way.
L146901 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Watch this.
L146900 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ I'm glad you didn't get something flashy.
L146735 +++$+++ u4666 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Feel free to correct him if you want.
L146734 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ He speaks about himself in the third person?
L147419 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ He's right. The tapes give us leverage with Bastaldi.
L147418 +++$+++ u4673 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZERO +++$+++ They killed our friend. It's personal now. Besides, if we do that, then Julien died for nothing. The tapes are the key.
L147282 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ I don't know.
L147281 +++$+++ u4673 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZERO +++$+++ And how do we do that?
L147172 +++$+++ u4673 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZERO +++$+++ We don't know that for sure.
L147171 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ It has to be at Sophie's. She didn't have time to go anywhere else before she came here.
L147138 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ You wanna tell him?
L147137 +++$+++ u4673 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZERO +++$+++ What does arresting us get them?
L147136 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ They send us to Zammito's house. The FBI is right across the street watching the whole thing, but they don't move. A crime is going down and they don't move. Why?  Because they were waiting for us to come out so they could arrest us.
L146826 +++$+++ u4673 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZERO +++$+++ How are we supposed to sleep with this noise?
L146825 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ I can't even hear myself think.
L146767 +++$+++ u4673 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZERO +++$+++ Zero did not put it in his bag.    He put it in yours.
L146766 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ You put a loaded gun in your bag and brought it through customs? How stupid is that?
L146731 +++$+++ u4673 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZERO +++$+++ -- Zero isn't interested in your life story.  Who gets killed?
L146730 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Well, you know, not all Algerians speak French. It's a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really --
L146729 +++$+++ u4673 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZERO +++$+++ And you don't speak French?
L146728 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Algeria.
L147154 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ Vincent Bastaldi is in jail.
L147153 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Why?
L147131 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ Stick around and find out.
L147130 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Who are you waiting for?
L147125 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ After last night I could say the same for you.
L147124 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ I really thought we had something special going. I can't tell you what a disappointment you've turned out to be.
L147071 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ It's three in the morning.    Not much else to do.
L147070 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ Sounds boring.
L147069 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ I thought I'd listen to some of the tapes. See what's so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe.
L147068 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ What are you doing?
L147067 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ It's not your fault.
L147066 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ I'm sorry things went so wrong today.
L147065 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ No.
L147064 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ Can't sleep?
L146891 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ The lucky ones.
L146890 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Who's gonna see it there?
L146889 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ I've been thinking about getting tattoo. You know, a flower or something. On my ass.
L146888 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ It's okay.   It was a long time ago.
L146887 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ Sorry.   I didn't mean to pry.
L146886 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ No. I got it in prison. I went in for three years. When I came out she was married to my best friend. Happy?
L146885 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ You got it in a bar?
L146884 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ I don't remember.    I was drunk.
L146883 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ That's how you get to know someone.       Did it hurt when you got it?
L146882 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ You ask a lot of questions.
L146881 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ It looks old.     Did you get it a long time ago?
L146880 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Something like that.
L146879 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ Did she break your heart?
L146878 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Something like that.
L146877 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ Casandra. Old girlfriend?
L146875 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ They're not nice people.
L146874 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ So you arranged to have the people you worked for robbed?
L146873 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ The art world doesn't fully appreciate my talent yet. I needed some way to pay the rent. Laurant and Vincent pay well for information.
L146872 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's?
L146871 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ So, how did you get hooked up with these guys?
L146870 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ It belongs to Vincent Bastaldi. He left it last time he was here. I'm sure he wouldn't mind if you used it.
L146869 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight.
L146868 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ You like shoes?
L146822 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ Take a nap.
L146821 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ You ever hear of jet lag?
L146818 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ Tonight.
L146817 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ When do we go?
L146771 +++$+++ u4667 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SAMI +++$+++ Thanks.
L146770 +++$+++ u4668 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ SOPHIE +++$+++ I wasn't expecting this many of you. I've got a few sleeping bags you can use.
L147607 +++$+++ u4670 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ VINNY +++$+++ I'll get you the papers tomorrow.
L147606 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Okay.    Okay.
L147605 +++$+++ u4670 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ VINNY +++$+++ I don't know. Sell it. It's gotta be worth something. Someone gave it to me. C'mon Frankie, I'm trying to make good here.
L147604 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ For me? What am I going to do with a piece of shit like this?
L147603 +++$+++ u4670 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ VINNY +++$+++ It's for you.
L147602 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Oh really? Thanks. I thought it was a sewing machine. What the hell is it doing here?
L147601 +++$+++ u4670 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ VINNY +++$+++ A car.
L147600 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ What's this?
L147351 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ What are you nuts? A debt is a debt. I was thinking I'd throw a little extra work your way. You know, you come down to the club, make espresso for the boys... wash their cars... run some errands... things like that.
L147350 +++$+++ u4670 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ VINNY +++$+++ You gonna forget about the money I owe you?
L147349 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So, I've decided to make it up to you.
L147348 +++$+++ u4670 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ VINNY +++$+++ A little?
L147347 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ I don't want anything. I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day.
L147346 +++$+++ u4670 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ VINNY +++$+++ Yeah. I'm going home today.    What do you want, Frankie?
L147345 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating you all right? Food okay?
L147344 +++$+++ u4670 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ VINNY +++$+++ You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
L147343 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ So, I just come by to see how you're doin'?
L147342 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ That's good.    That's what a stand-up guy does.
L147341 +++$+++ u4670 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ VINNY +++$+++ She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
L147340 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ She seems pleasant enough.
L146808 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ That's why we're only breaking one arm.
L146807 +++$+++ u4670 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ VINNY +++$+++ Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother!
L146806 +++$+++ u4672 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ ZAMMITO +++$+++ -- Shut up! Don't you try to make me feel bad about this. You knew what would happen to you if you didn't pay. This is on your head, not mine.  Break his arm.
L146805 +++$+++ u4670 +++$+++ m309 +++$+++ VINNY +++$+++ Frankie, I --
L148159 +++$+++ u4674 +++$+++ m310 +++$+++ AUNT WU +++$+++ Well, Li Mu Bai can do it.
L148158 +++$+++ u4688 +++$+++ m310 +++$+++ YU +++$+++ I didn't have the heart.
L148157 +++$+++ u4674 +++$+++ m310 +++$+++ AUNT WU +++$+++ She's crazy.  You should have killed her.
L148116 +++$+++ u4674 +++$+++ m310 +++$+++ AUNT WU +++$+++ I'll go and make up his room!
L148115 +++$+++ u4688 +++$+++ m310 +++$+++ YU +++$+++ Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.
L148114 +++$+++ u4674 +++$+++ m310 +++$+++ AUNT WU +++$+++ Much better.  You've been gone so long.
L148113 +++$+++ u4688 +++$+++ m310 +++$+++ YU +++$+++ How's the arm?  Still sore?
L148112 +++$+++ u4674 +++$+++ m310 +++$+++ AUNT WU +++$+++ You're back!
L147832 +++$+++ u4687 +++$+++ m310 +++$+++ TSAI +++$+++ Pardon me, but I doubt you can handle her.  My wife was quite a martial arts expert.  Jade Fox killed her.  So you see, this is personal.  Leave her to me.
L147831 +++$+++ u4675 +++$+++ m310 +++$+++ BO +++$+++ Then leave her to me.
L147830 +++$+++ u4687 +++$+++ m310 +++$+++ TSAI +++$+++ Yes.
L147829 +++$+++ u4675 +++$+++ m310 +++$+++ BO +++$+++ This Jade Fox is a woman?
L147828 +++$+++ u4687 +++$+++ m310 +++$+++ TSAI +++$+++ I'm looking for someone.  Jade Fox. I'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.  Jade Fox is a master criminal.  I hear she infiltrated the Yus.  She must have come with them when they transferred here.  But with Yu's reputation, I can't just go in and accuse her.
L147827 +++$+++ u4675 +++$+++ m310 +++$+++ BO +++$+++ Why were you spying on the Yus?
L147826 +++$+++ u4687 +++$+++ m310 +++$+++ TSAI +++$+++ I don't care about your sword.
L147825 +++$+++ u4675 +++$+++ m310 +++$+++ BO +++$+++ Wait!  I'm a friend!
L147824 +++$+++ u4687 +++$+++ m310 +++$+++ TSAI +++$+++ Who are you?
L147945 +++$+++ u4682 +++$+++ m310 +++$+++ LI +++$+++ That's a risk I'm willing to take. Deep down, you're good.  Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you.
L147944 +++$+++ u4676 +++$+++ m310 +++$+++ FIGURE +++$+++ And if I use them to kill you?
L147943 +++$+++ u4682 +++$+++ m310 +++$+++ LI +++$+++ I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
L147942 +++$+++ u4676 +++$+++ m310 +++$+++ FIGURE +++$+++ Why do you want to teach me?
L147941 +++$+++ u4682 +++$+++ m310 +++$+++ LI +++$+++ Why should I?  You need practice. I can teach you to fight with the Green Destiny, but first you must learn to hold it in stillness.
L147940 +++$+++ u4676 +++$+++ m310 +++$+++ FIGURE +++$+++ Go ahead.
L147938 +++$+++ u4682 +++$+++ m310 +++$+++ LI +++$+++ Real sharpness comes without effort.
L147937 +++$+++ u4676 +++$+++ m310 +++$+++ FIGURE +++$+++ On guard!
