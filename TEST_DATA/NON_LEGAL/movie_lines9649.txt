L115636 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L115623 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ I'm, like, yelling at her, 'What are you doing?'  And she's going 'Jeffrey, Jeffrey!'  Way mental.
L115622 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Oh, please!  When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?
L115621 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ I really was way way too too.
L115159 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Seriously, Buffy.  That look was way twisted.  What were you thinking about?
L115158 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Buffy, the ape-woman.
L115110 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Nice much.
L115109 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Smell of booze much.
L115098 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Well, look who's here.
L115097 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Can't they make exceptions?  Maryanne Heinel?  She's such a scud.  Can't we have a Maryanne clause?
L115096 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ If we don't invite all the seniors we can't use the school funds, you know that.
L115072 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Right!
L115071 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Oh, yeah!
L115061 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Okay.
L115060 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Environment.  That's cool with me.
L115040 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Oh, please.
L115039 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ The homelesses?
L114970 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Like we don't have rights too?
L114969 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ God!  Take a chill lozenge.
L114963 +++$+++ u4307 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ He is so bald.
L114962 +++$+++ u4311 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ NICOLE +++$+++ Oh, God.
L115464 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Run.
L115463 +++$+++ u4314 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ ZEPH +++$+++ Hey.  What should I do if I see Benny?
L115462 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ I am.
L115461 +++$+++ u4314 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ ZEPH +++$+++ All right.  Take care of yourself.
L115460 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ I don't think so.
L115459 +++$+++ u4314 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ ZEPH +++$+++ Ah, you'll be coming back.
L115458 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ You should think about leaving, too, man.  Sell this place... Something's going on here.  I don't know.  Something real weird.
L115457 +++$+++ u4314 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ ZEPH +++$+++ No...  You want me to give him a message?
L115456 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Hey, have you seen Benny lately?
L115455 +++$+++ u4314 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ ZEPH +++$+++ Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
L115454 +++$+++ u4312 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ I'm leaving, man.  I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy.
L115453 +++$+++ u4314 +++$+++ m287 +++$+++ ZEPH +++$+++ What nasty bug crawled up your bungus and where the hell are you going?
L117556 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ Don't worry.
L117555 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh--don't think too much.
L117554 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ I think I'm ready for the Show.
L117553 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Neither will I.
L117552 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ I won't be needing these anymore.
L117551 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well I guess this is it.
L117480 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ How can I possibly thank you?
L117479 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ That's great!
L117478 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ I gotta leave first thing in the morning.
L117474 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ Yeah, Skip, it's me.  Jeez...Jeez...God...Jeez...
L117473 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It's Skip, for you.
L117470 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ Crash says I gotta quit worrying about him--c'mon, honey, we got a lotta catching up to do--
L117469 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ --but you're father's in there!
L117468 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ Aw hell, let's have a quickie right here--
L117467 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ So am I.  Nuke, honey, we need to talk--
L117466 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ I'm starting to understand what you're teaching me.  I mean the panties and the nostrils and all that shit...I mean I'm getting it--
L117465 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You don't have to...
L117464 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ I couldn't dump my old man but maybe later I can sneak away from him...
L117456 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh--won't YOU come in?
L117455 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ I'd like you to meet my father.
L117454 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ it's okay..
L117453 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ We lost.
L117347 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ I'll be back when we lose.
L117346 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ He did?
L117345 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ He said if I gave in to you I'd start losing again.
L117344 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What'd he say?
L117343 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ I did.
L117342 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Nuke!  You got things all wrong! There's no relation between sex and baseball.  Ask Crash.
L117341 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ You're exotic and mysterious and cute--that's why I better leave.
L117340 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Cute?!  I hate cute!  Baby ducks are cute!  I wanta be exotic and mysterious!
L117339 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ I think you're real cute.
L117338 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Of course I'm seducing you for Godsakes, and I'm doing a damn poor job of it--  Aren't I pretty?
L117337 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ I knew it--you're seducing me!
L117336 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I'm trying to play with your body!
L117335 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ No!  You're playing with my mind!
L117330 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh...  Crash is a very smart man.  Now c'mon, honey, give it a try.
L117329 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ He didn't mean it nasty.  He said that gettin' lost and disappearing from the face of the earth was sometimes a good thing to do-- especially like that.
L117328 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What a nasty thing to say.
L117327 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ Well--he calls it the Bermuda Triangle.  He said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again.
L117326 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yes I do...
L117325 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ Crash once called a woman's, uh-- pussy--y'know how the hair kinda makes a "V" shape?--
L117324 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Sure.  Unsnap my stockings.
L117323 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ Fundamentals?
L117322 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I figure we could work on some fundamentals even if we don't make love.
L117321 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ I know what it is.
L117320 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ That's my leg.
L117318 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I'm not gonna try to seduce you, sweetie...
L117317 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ You can't seduce me.
L117316 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I'll tuck you in.
L117315 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ No, that's okay.  All I need's a little nap.
L117314 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ How 'bout a back rub?
L117313 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ No, no, it was great.
L117312 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I'm so proud of you and all the guys.  Want some more soup?
L117283 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh--
L117282 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ No.
L117281 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Get over here.
L117280 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ Just till I lose.
L117279 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Nuke?!
L117278 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ You know what it feels like to throw a three hitter?  We better not fuck.
L117277 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Now don't go overboard, I look incredibly hot, right?
L117276 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ Not that.  I mean the re-channeling of my sexual energy.  Maybe we shouldn't make love for awhile.
L117275 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Breathing through your pingala always works, honey--
L117274 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games.
L117273 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I'm yours.
L117220 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yes.  And so is birth.  Now look me in the eyes, Nuke--  You haven't been wearing my panties, have you?
L117219 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ Death is like spring training?
L117218 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh don't be silly.  Death is nothing to be scared of.  It's just another way of living.  It's just a fresh start--kinda like spring training.
L117217 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ God...I think I'm gonna be sick--
L117214 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It's all the same thing.
L117213 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ I can't keep up with you.  First you say sex is gonna make me a better pitcher--now no sex is gonna do it?!
L117210 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Much better.  Your delivery was fully integrated because you weren't thinking about it 'cause you were pissed off at me.  This is progress.
L117209 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ How ya like that?
L117208 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ Gimme the God damn ball!
L117207 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ A little better.
L117206 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ How was that?
L117205 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ He's handled a lotta pitchers whose records were better than one and six.
L117204 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ If I throw too hard I'll hurt the kid.
L117203 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You're patronizing me!  I will not be patronized--
L117202 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Right.  Okay, fire a couple in there.
L117201 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ Switch nostrils?
L117200 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ The pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball.  And if you discover before a game you're in the wrong nostril, it's easy to switch.
L117199 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ I'm really beat.  I need some serious "z's"--
L117198 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ The ida originates at the right testicle and terminates at the left nostril.
L117197 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ There are two important psychic conduits called the "pingala" and the "ida".  The pingala starts with the left testicle  and ends at the right nostril.
L117196 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ My right nostril?
L117195 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ The right nostril.  Good.
L117194 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ Which nostril am I breathing through?
L117193 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Just do what I say.  Now, which nostril are you breathing through?
L117192 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ This in ridiculous.  I'm a pro.
L117189 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ Catch?
L117188 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
L117187 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ Sorry.  You look great.  I'm totally exhausted.
L117186 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What is this "I, I, I" stuff? You only talk about yourself? Aren't you glad to see me?  Don't I look nice?
L117185 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ God I'm tired.  What a trip I was lousy.  I was worse than lousy. Everytime I pitched--it was like throwing gasoline on a fire. Kaboom.  I--
L117083 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ They did when they were in the Carolina League.
L117082 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ Big League pitchers don't use these.
L117081 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain.  These'll help move things to the right side.
L117080 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ Jesus, Annie, I don't know--
L117079 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ They'll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that you'll start seeing things differently--plus they'll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those nasty hitters.
L117078 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ What?
L117077 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I want you to wear these on the road trip when you pitch.
L117002 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ There is a lot of things you never thought of, sweetie--now get some rest for tonight's game.
L117001 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ God, I never thought of that.
L117000 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Y'know if you make it to the Bigs you could still become the host of Dance Fever.  Baseball's a good stepping stone for things like that.
L116999 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ I wanted to be the host of Dance Fever, somethin' like that...
L116998 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You can learn to like it.
L116997 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ Mmm, hmmm.  You shoulda seen how many people came to the airport to see me off.  When I got drafted first it was the happiest day of my Father's life.  He likes baseball more than I do...
L116996 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You see how nice things are when we go slow?
L116995 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ Yeah maybe you're right.
L116994 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Would you rather me be making love to him, using your name, or making love to you, using his name?
L116993 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ You said "Crash".
L116992 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Honey, don't ever listen to a woman when she's making love. They'll say the strangest things.
L116991 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ You said "Crash".
L116990 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I didn't say "Crash".  I said Nuke.
L116989 +++$+++ u4325 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ NUKE +++$+++ You mean Nuke.  You said "Crash".
L117424 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ We all deserve to wear white.
L117423 +++$+++ u4324 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ MILLIE +++$+++ Five hours.  We both just know.  Do you think I deserve to wear white?
L117422 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ No, no--I'm fine.  Millie, how much time did you and Jimmy spend together before he proposed?
L117421 +++$+++ u4324 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ MILLIE +++$+++ You should be at the game.
L117395 +++$+++ u4324 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ MILLIE +++$+++ He's a virgin.
L117394 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Omigawd, honey, I'm so happy for you.
L116790 +++$+++ u4324 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ MILLIE +++$+++ Well, he fucks like he pitches. Sorta all over the place
L116789 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well let's get down to it, honey-- how was he?
L116771 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ That's better.  Got the radar ready?
L116770 +++$+++ u4324 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ MILLIE +++$+++ "I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
L116769 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You didn't get "lured".  Women never get lured.  They're too strong and powerful for that. Now say it--"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
L116768 +++$+++ u4324 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ MILLIE +++$+++ I got lured.
L116767 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ --Millie, you've got to stay out of the clubhouse.  It'll just get everybody in trouble.
L117605 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I can do that, too.
L117604 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ I got a lotta time to hear your theories and I wanta hear every damn one of 'em...but right now I'm tired and I don't wanta think about baseball and I don't wanta think about Quantum Physics...  I don't wanta think about nothing...  I just wanta be.
L117603 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What?
L117602 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ Annie---
L117601 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You'd be great, just great...  'Cause you understand non-linear thinking even though it seems like baseball is a linear game 'cause of the lines and the box scores an'  all--but the fact is that there's a spacious-"non-time kind of time" to it...
L117600 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ You think I could make it to the Show as a manager?
L117599 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Not yet.  It takes years of practice...
L117598 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ Yeah...you a witch?
L117597 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Salem, Massachusetts?  Where all the witches were?
L117596 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ There  might be an opening for a manager at Salem next spring.
L117595 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I'm quitting too.  Boys, not baseball.
L117594 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ I quit.  Hit my dinger and hung 'em up.
L117593 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ What happened?
L117579 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It doesn't work like that.  God, you're gorgeous.  Want to dance?
L117578 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous?  How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo?
L117577 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ ...  so you see in a former lifetime I'm sure that I was Alexandria, the Czarette of Russia? What do you think?
L117575 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I heard already.
L117574 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ I got released.
L117390 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Whatta you mean "why not"?  Are you gonna play forever?!
L117389 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ Why not?
L117388 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well...I used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to.  Lately I'm not so sure.
L117387 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ Are you gonna be waking up next to 20 year old ballplayers when you're 60?
L117386 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ No.
L117385 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ It's possible.
L117384 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It's true, It's true!  Least it used to be true.  It ain't possible that baseball's not enough anymore, is it, Crash?
L117383 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ I don't know if I'd go that far.
L117382 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ If you know where home plate is, then you know where 1st base is, and 2nd, and everything else-- 'cause they're always in the same place in relation to home.  Don't you see?  If you know where home plate is, then you know where everything else in the universe is!
L117381 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ What's so great about baseball?
L117380 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Thurman Munson.  He was covered with dirt and he was fighting with everybody--it was beautiful ...  And he called the ump a cocksucker and got thrown out of the game even though it was an exhibition!  So I stayed in the bleachers all spring and gradually came to understand what's so great about baseball.
L117379 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ Who?
L117378 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I crossed the street--it was the New York Yankees spring training field--tok, tok, tok, was the sound of a ball hitting a bat-- and I sat in the warm bleachers to think about my mother...  And I saw him.
L117375 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I was raised in a Baptist church got dipped in the water when I was 5-- born again before kindergarten...by the time I was 10 I knew it was bullshit and at 15 I ran away from home...
L117374 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ Why baseball?
L117372 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ You okay?
L117371 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ God damn you--what is happening? Is there no man who'll have me?  This is the weirdest season I ever saw--the Durham Bulls can't lose and I can't get laid!
L117370 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ Annie, I think you should leave.
L117369 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I said when I think about you, I get wet.
L117368 +++$+++ u4317 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ CRASH +++$+++ --and as soon as we lose a game, he'll be back in your arms.
L117367 +++$+++ u4315 +++$+++ m288 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I'm ready for a complicated man.
