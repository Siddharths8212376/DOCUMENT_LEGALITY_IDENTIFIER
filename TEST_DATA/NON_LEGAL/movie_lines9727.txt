L149566 +++$+++ u4708 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ DR. GREENBAUM +++$+++ This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
L149565 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer.
L149564 +++$+++ u4708 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ DR. GREENBAUM +++$+++ No. This is going to be our last session.
L149563 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Same time next week?
L149562 +++$+++ u4708 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ DR. GREENBAUM +++$+++ I think that's all the time we have for today.
L149561 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Let me tell you something, doctor. Chicks love a guy with a bad rap. They say they don't, but they don't mean it. They all think that they're the ones that are going to "save me." The trick is to let them think it's true.
L149560 +++$+++ u4708 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ DR. GREENBAUM +++$+++ Don't you want to change that?
L149559 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ I do.
L149558 +++$+++ u4708 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ DR. GREENBAUM +++$+++ But you said you have the worst reputation.
L149555 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ I know.
L149554 +++$+++ u4708 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ DR. GREENBAUM +++$+++ And you haven't made an ounce of progress.
L149553 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ I know.
L149552 +++$+++ u4708 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ DR. GREENBAUM +++$+++ Jesus. We've been at this for six months.
L149592 +++$+++ u4715 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I don't know. He was just so charming. All he did was talk about how I had killer legs and how we wanted to photograph them. Things just got out of hand from there.  Mom? Are you there? Mom?  Mother!!!!
L149591 +++$+++ u4708 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ DR. GREENBAUM +++$+++ Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid?
L149590 +++$+++ u4715 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Nudie pictures, what do you think?
L149587 +++$+++ u4715 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Would you cut the psycho babble bullshit, mom. There's pictures of me on the internet.
L149586 +++$+++ u4708 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ DR. GREENBAUM +++$+++ Alright honey, just calm down, take a deep breath, and step out of the circle.
L149585 +++$+++ u4715 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You don't know him. I'm so stupid.
L149584 +++$+++ u4708 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ DR. GREENBAUM +++$+++ Who told you?
L149583 +++$+++ u4715 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ He told me he loved me and I believed him.
L149582 +++$+++ u4708 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ DR. GREENBAUM +++$+++ Honey, is something wrong?
L149581 +++$+++ u4715 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Hi, mom.
L150299 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Grand Central. You better not be fucking with me cause it's your ass on the line.
L150298 +++$+++ u4709 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ GREG +++$+++ Alright. She's staying with some friends of her parents. The O'Sheas. She caught the train twenty minutes ago into Grand Central.
L150297 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ One.
L150296 +++$+++ u4709 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ GREG +++$+++ I told you I don't know.
L150295 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ McConnell, I'm gonna out your ass in two seconds if you don't tell me where she is.
L150294 +++$+++ u4709 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ GREG +++$+++ I don't know. Why don't you leave her alone.
L150293 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Where is she?!
L150292 +++$+++ u4709 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ GREG +++$+++ No.
L150291 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Sebastian, you faggot. Is she with you?
L150290 +++$+++ u4709 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ GREG +++$+++ Who is this?
L150289 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Is she with you?
L149955 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ I'll be in touch.
L149954 +++$+++ u4709 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ GREG +++$+++ She bought it.
L149953 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Pretty sure or sure sure?
L149952 +++$+++ u4709 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ GREG +++$+++ I'm pretty sure she did.
L149951 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ And you think she bought it?
L149950 +++$+++ u4709 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ GREG +++$+++ Yes!
L149949 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ You told her that people are jealous cause I'm loaded?
L149948 +++$+++ u4709 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ GREG +++$+++ Yes!
L149947 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ You told her I never said I love you before?
L149946 +++$+++ u4709 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ GREG +++$+++ Yes.
L149945 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Did you do everything I asked you to?
L149944 +++$+++ u4709 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ GREG +++$+++ Positive.
L149883 +++$+++ u4709 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ GREG +++$+++ I swear on my life, I never said a word to her about you.
L149882 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Come on Greg. You're the only one who knows her. The truth will save you.
L149881 +++$+++ u4709 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ GREG +++$+++ Annette Harrison? I don't know what you're talking about.
L149877 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Your career? What about your family? Can you imagine the humiliation your father's going to feel when he finds out his pride and joy is a fudge- packer.
L149876 +++$+++ u4709 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ GREG +++$+++ Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career.
L149875 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ -- really drunk and blah blah blah blah blah.
L149872 +++$+++ u4709 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ GREG +++$+++ I told you to lock the door.
L149871 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Whoa!
L149870 +++$+++ u4709 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ GREG +++$+++ Get out of here.
L149869 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Greg, is that you under the covers?
L149868 +++$+++ u4709 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ GREG +++$+++ Jesus!
L149867 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Hey Blaine, did I leave my... holy shit.
L149865 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Baby?  Right on time.
L149864 +++$+++ u4709 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ GREG +++$+++ Oh baby... oh baby...
L150456 +++$+++ u4716 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Don't worry about it. I'll stay.
L150455 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and --
L150454 +++$+++ u4716 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in.
L150453 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to.
L150452 +++$+++ u4716 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Racist piece of shit.
L150451 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ It's been going on for a while.  Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.
L150450 +++$+++ u4716 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ And this happened before you and I hooked up?
L150449 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ And when I confronted him about his affair with Cecile he told me it was none of my business. Then when I said "Well what about Ronald," he said you were nothing more than a stupid... the n word and that you deserved what you got...
L150443 +++$+++ u4716 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ I'll be right there.
L150442 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ I think he's high on drugs. He hit me, then took off. I'm afraid to be alone. Please come over.
L150441 +++$+++ u4716 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ What do you mean?
L150440 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.
L150439 +++$+++ u4716 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ What's wrong?
L150438 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ No.
L150437 +++$+++ u4716 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Hi Kathryn. Is everything okay?
L150436 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ It's Kathryn.
L150435 +++$+++ u4716 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Yeah?
L150434 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Ronald?
L150433 +++$+++ u4716 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Hello.
L150059 +++$+++ u4716 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ But I can't even see her. She doesn't have her own phone, I don't even know her e-mail address.
L150058 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ What do you do? Tell her you love her.
L149735 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Likewise I'm sure.
L149734 +++$+++ u4716 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Pleased to meet you.
L150414 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ War it is.
L150413 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ I think you have your answer.
L150412 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Then I will consider it a declaration of war. One. Two... three.
L150411 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ And if I don't?
L150410 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ I'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed.
L150409 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Get out!
L150408 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy.
L150407 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Didn't you hear what I said?
L150406 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Get out? We had an arrangement.
L150405 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ I accept. Now get out.
L150404 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ I'm very sorry about that. I apologize.
L150403 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Fine! Get off me!
L150402 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Will you calm down?
L150401 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Get off me!
L150399 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't fuck losers.
L150398 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ In any event, you still owe me my reward.
L150397 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ You were very much in love with her and you're still in love with her. But it amused me to make you ashamed of it. You gave up on the first person you ever loved because I called you names. Don't get me wrong, I'm flattered that you chose me over her, but please understand, I never loved you, Sebastian. You're just a toy. A little toy I play with. And now you've completely blown it with her. I think that's the saddest thing I've ever heard.  Cheers.
L150396 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Come again?
L150395 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her. It's over you.
L150394 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Not my choice of toast, but it's your call. To your triumph over Annette.
L150393 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ To my triumph, of course.
L150392 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Thank you. Now, where were we?
L150391 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Well done.
L150389 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Not that it's any of your business but yes.
L150388 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Ronald?
L150387 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm expecting some company.
L150386 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ I thought we should celebrate.
L150385 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Well done.
L150384 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Devastated beyond repair. I doubt she'll ever trust a man again.
L150383 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Annette?
L150382 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ You wanted an answer to your question.
L150381 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?
L150380 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ I have a flair for drama.
L150379 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ A little melodramatic, don't you think.
L150353 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ I knew this guy last summer in the Hamptons. He and his girlfriend at the time were madly in love with each other. But she had this huge weight problem. His friends taunted him mercilessly about it. You know, "How do you breathe when she sits on your face?" "It's embarrassing for you to be seen with her." Finally he couldn't take it anymore and decided to dump her. She flipped and he went on the defensive. I distinctly remember him saying the same thing over and over again. "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm completely fucked up."  Poor fatty never had a chance.
L150352 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Screening calls. Any suggestions?
L150351 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ How have you dumped girls in the past?
L150350 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ I've never done this before.
L150349 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Why so nervous?
L150348 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Then do me a favor and get rid of her. If not for me, then do it for you. Look at yourself. You're a joke. She's turned you into jelly. What do you want to be, one of those losers who walk down the halls holding hands and smiling. People used to respect you. They feared you and now you're going to throw that all away.
L150347 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ That's not fair. You're taking all the fun out of it.
L150346 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Is that what you think?
L150345 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ I can't believe you're reacting this way. You're just saying this because you lost the bet.
L150344 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.
L150343 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Kathryn, you know I love you. I've always loved you.
L150342 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ At first it was, but now it's become something bigger.
L150341 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a contest.
L150340 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ I'm sorry. It's just upsetting. You're in love with her. You don't love me anymore.
L150339 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ What's wrong with you? Why are you acting this way?
L150338 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ P-whipped, p-whipped.
L150337 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ No, I'm not.
L150336 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Oh my God. You're completely p-whipped.
L150334 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ And I don't.
L150333 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ I want to fuck.
L150332 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ It clearly is why.
L150331 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ And that's why you're leaving?
L150330 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ I'm not in the mood.
L150329 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Excuse me?
L150328 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Some other time.
L150326 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Mock, mock, mock.
L150325 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.
L150324 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ It was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part.
L150323 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ No, tell me.
L150322 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ I know. That's the amazing part of it. I mean, it wasn't like Cirque du Soleil acrobatics, just standard missionary stuff, but it was... ah forget it. I'm going to sound like a Hallmark card.
L150321 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Oh come on. For her first time?
L150320 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ It was... Fantastic.
L150319 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Tell me all the details.
L150318 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Oh yes.
L150317 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ You didn't?
L150312 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Well, you obviously wanted me to witness your little adventure or else you wouldn't have invited me in.
L150311 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Kind of.
L150310 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Bad time?
L150286 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ She wouldn't say. She apologized to your aunt and told her she was going to stay with some friends.  You blew it, Sebastian. That girl has come to her senses and she will never go near you again.
L150285 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Where'd she go?
L150284 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ You don't know?  She left thirty minutes ago.
L150283 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Where is she?
L150282 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ If you're heading towards her room, you won't find her.
L150281 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ A momentary lapse of judgment, soon to be rectified.
L150280 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ You're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't. God are you a chump.
L150279 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ I don't know. She was lying on the bed, ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I was... I just didn't feel right about it.
L150278 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ So what went wrong?
L150277 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Exactly the opposite.
L150276 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ She shot you down.
L150275 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ If your asking if I nailed her the answer is no.
L150274 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Well I know how it went with Cecile. She won't shut up about it. How'd it go with Mrs. Jesus?
L150273 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ With who?
L150272 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ So? How'd it go last night?
L150271 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Morning.
L150270 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Morning!
L150210 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Kathryn, the only thing you're going to be riding is me. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some work to do.
L150209 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
L150208 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected.
L150207 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ And that's why you're losing your bet?
L150206 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ If you must know, yes. I don't know what to do. I can't stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet, I'm completely infatuated with her.  She made me laugh.
L150205 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ She's really getting to you, isn't she?
L150204 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Nothing.
L150203 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ What's your problem?
L150202 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Shut up.
L150201 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Jesus, she reeks of Laura Ashley.  Oh, she's crying. Wittle baby's upset by the big bad book.
L150200 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Yeah.
L150199 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ That her?
L150198 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Take a look for yourself.
L150197 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Who are you spying on?
L150196 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Yippy.
L150195 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ I just had a nice chat with Cecile. I don't think she'll be giving you anymore problems.
L150072 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Eat me, Sebastian. It's alright for you to fuck everyone, but because I'm a girl it's wrong. Well let me tell you something, I didn't ask to be a girl. Do you think I relish the fact that I have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty four seven, so I can be considered a "laaaady." Do you think I take great delight when I hear - "Kathryn is so wonderful." "Kathryn is a model child." "Kathryn is going to make an excellent wife one day."  I'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the upper East Side and sometimes I want to kill myself for it. No, I don't enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer. So there's your psychoanalysis Doctor Freud. Now are you in or are you out?
L150071 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ You amaze me.
L150070 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ What is that? Oh my God, it's your conscience.
L150069 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Are you really? I mean, we've done some pretty fucked up shit in our time but this... I mean, we're destroying an innocent girl. You do realize that.
L150068 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ I'm aware.
L150067 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Before we go through with this, I just want you to be aware of the damage we're going to cause.
L150066 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Cecile.
L150065 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Who are you calling?
L149989 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Well, let me know when you do. Until then.
L149988 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Any day now.
L149987 +++$+++ u4710 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ KATHRYN +++$+++ Have you succeeded in your task?
L149986 +++$+++ u4717 +++$+++ m312 +++$+++ SEBASTIAN +++$+++ Moving along quite well.
