L445801 +++$+++ u7080 +++$+++ m474 +++$+++ ELIAS +++$+++ What didn't she do. She fucked the living shit outta me, that's what she did!
L445800 +++$+++ u7078 +++$+++ m474 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ ...But what'd she do?
L445770 +++$+++ u7080 +++$+++ m474 +++$+++ ELIAS +++$+++ Feelin' good's good enough.

L446167 +++$+++ u7078 +++$+++ m474 +++$+++ CHRIS +++$+++ Not just me... it's the way the whole thing works. People like Elias get wasted and people like Barnes just go on making up rules any way they want and what do we do, we just sit around in the middle and suck on it! We just don't add up to dry shit.
L446166 +++$+++ u7083 +++$+++ m474 +++$+++ KING +++$+++ Way out of anything, man. Just keep your pecker up, your powder dry, the worm WILL turn. How many days you short?
