L15583 +++$+++ u3574 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ RINGO +++$+++ Oh, they seem all right to me.
L15582 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ And if they get you on the floor watch out for your brisket.
L15581 +++$+++ u3574 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ RINGO +++$+++ Me!
L15580 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ That sergeant's a body-blow veteran if ever I measured one. One of us has got to escape. I'll get the boys. Hold on son, I'll be back for you.
L15579 +++$+++ u3574 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ RINGO +++$+++ Have they?
L15578 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ Keep your voice down, this lot'll paste you, just for the exercise. Oh they're a desperate crew of drippings and they've fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you.
L15577 +++$+++ u3574 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ RINGO +++$+++ What?
L15576 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
L15575 +++$+++ u3574 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ RINGO +++$+++ Well I'm not exactly a voluntary patient.
L15574 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ Ringo, me old scout, they grabbed yer leg for the iron too, did they?
L15343 +++$+++ u3574 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ RINGO +++$+++ I'm going parading before it's too late!
L15342 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ Where are you off to?
L15341 +++$+++ u3574 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ RINGO +++$+++ I'm not wrong.
L15340 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ You're only right.
L15339 +++$+++ u3574 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ RINGO +++$+++ Yeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it?
L15338 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ When you could be out there betraying a rich American widow or sipping palm wine in Tahiti before you're too old like me. A fine neat and trim lad the class of you should be helping himself to life's goodies before the sands run out. Being an old age pensioner's a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the Friday queue at the Post Office.
L15337 +++$+++ u3574 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ RINGO +++$+++ Yeah ... a bloomin' book!
L15336 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ A book!
L15335 +++$+++ u3574 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ RINGO +++$+++ Yeah ... what's in it for me?
L15334 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ And what's it all come to in the end?
L15333 +++$+++ u3574 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ RINGO +++$+++ Yeah ... that's right.
L15332 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ And that lot's never happier than when they're jeering at you ... and where would they be without the steady support of your drum beat, I'd like to know.
L15331 +++$+++ u3574 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ RINGO +++$+++ Oh ... I dunno.
L15330 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ Do you think I haven't noticed ... do you think I wasn't aware of the drift? Oh ... you poor unfortunate scuff, they've driven you into books by their cruel, unnatural treatment, exploiting your good nature.
L15329 +++$+++ u3574 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ RINGO +++$+++ What's that mean?
L15328 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ So you <U>are</U> a man after all.
L15327 +++$+++ u3574 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ RINGO +++$+++ Aaah ... stop picking on me... you're as bad as the rest of them.
L15326 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ At least I've a backlog of memories, but all you've got is that book!
L15325 +++$+++ u3574 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ RINGO +++$+++ Eh ... you're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you?
L15324 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
L15323 +++$+++ u3574 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ RINGO +++$+++ Well, I <U>am</U> living, aren't I?
L15322 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ That's it, parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living!
L15321 +++$+++ u3574 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ RINGO +++$+++ Parading?
L15320 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ Parading's better!
L15319 +++$+++ u3574 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ RINGO +++$+++ Books are good!
L15318 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ Any old where ... but not our little Richard ... oh no! When you're not thumping them pagan skins, you're tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish!
L15317 +++$+++ u3574 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ RINGO +++$+++ Out where?
L15316 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ Can you now? Aah ... sheeps' heads! You learn more by getting out there and living.
L15315 +++$+++ u3574 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ RINGO +++$+++ You can learn from books.
L15314 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ Have you no natural resources of your own? Have they even robbed you of that?
L15313 +++$+++ u3574 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ RINGO +++$+++ Well ... what's the matter with that?
L15312 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ Will you ever look at him, sitting there wid his hooter scraping away at that book!
L15014 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ Quite right, invites to gambling dens full of easy money and fast women, chicken sandwiches and cornets of caviar, disgusting!
L15013 +++$+++ u3574 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ RINGO +++$+++ Ah.
L15586 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ You see, sly villains.
L15585 +++$+++ u3576 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ SERGEANT +++$+++ Would you two like a cup of tea?
L15573 +++$+++ u3576 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ SERGEANT +++$+++ Get Lloyd George over there with that mechanic in the cloth cap while I sort this lot out.
L15572 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.
L15571 +++$+++ u3576 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ SERGEANT +++$+++ What's he on about?
L15570 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ I'll go on a hunger strike. I know your caper. The kidney punch and the rabbit-clout. The third degree and the size twelve boot ankle-tap.
L15569 +++$+++ u3576 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ SERGEANT +++$+++ Eh?
L15568 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ You ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated British kisser.
L15567 +++$+++ u3576 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ SERGEANT +++$+++ Is there a fire, then?
L15566 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ Well, you got me here so do your worst but I'll take one of you with me.  Oh, I know your game, get me in the tiled room and out come the rubber hoses but I'll defy you still.
L15648 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ But I'm clean.
L15647 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You see.  You know your trouble -- you should have gone West to America. You'd have wound up a Senior Citizen of Boston. As it is you took the wrong turning and what happened, you're a lonely old man from Liverpool.
L15079 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ Who are these ruffians?... I've never seen them before in my life! ... 
L15078 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Stay where you are everybody this is a raid and we want him.
L15001 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ It's your nose, y'see. Fans are funny that way. Take a dislike to things. They'll pick on a nose...
L15000 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ That'll keep you busy.
L14973 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Every morning.
L14972 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ That's right; convict without trial ... Habeas corpus.
L14873 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ Before you go, I think it's only fair to warn you about me Grandson ... don't let our Paul have his own way all the time, 'cos if you do he won't respect you!
L14872 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Come on let's get this coffee.
L14793 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ I'll look after meself.
L14792 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ And we're looking after him, are we?
L14789 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ He can talk then?
L14788 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ Hello.
L14787 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Hello, Grandfather!
L15638 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ Here, Pauly.
L15637 +++$+++ u3572 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ And another thing, where's that old mixer?
L15126 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ We've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture.
L15125 +++$+++ u3572 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Anything to spare?
L14995 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ Well, it may be a joke, but it's his nose. He can't help having a horrible great nose, it's the only one he's got. And his poor little head's trembling under the weight of it.
L14994 +++$+++ u3572 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Oh for Pete's sake, It's only a joke.
L14993 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ Don't mock the afflicted, Pauly.
L14992 +++$+++ u3572 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ With a trombone hooter like yours it'd be unnatural if you didn't.
L14964 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ And I take a left-handed view of life, I've got to.
L14963 +++$+++ u3572 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Well, don't be daft, I've got to.
L14962 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ Why do you always use your left hand?
L14961 +++$+++ u3572 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Yeah ... so what?
L14960 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
L14959 +++$+++ u3572 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?
L14958 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
L14957 +++$+++ u3572 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ All right, how about Ringo? I mean ... he's very upset, you know ... and as far as your girlfriend, little Audrey's concerned, she's finished with men for the rest of her natural, and another thing ...
L14954 +++$+++ u3572 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Don't dramatise.
L14953 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ And to think me own grandson would have let them put me behind bars!
L14939 +++$+++ u3572 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Oh, well that's all right.  What?
L14938 +++$+++ u3568 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ GRANDFATHER +++$+++ It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
L14937 +++$+++ u3572 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Oh no, you're not. You've gone too far this time ... and who's paying for all this?
L15214 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I think you're soft or something.
L15213 +++$+++ u3577 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ SHAKE +++$+++ Hiding.
L15212 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What are you doing there?
L15064 +++$+++ u3577 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ SHAKE +++$+++ Aye, come on, honest, that grandfather of yours is worse than any of you lot.
L15063 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Well, what are we waiting for?
L15058 +++$+++ u3577 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ SHAKE +++$+++ You're undressed. Where are your clothes?
L15057 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Aye, he looks a right lurker.
L15004 +++$+++ u3577 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ SHAKE +++$+++ For Ringo.
L15003 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Is that yours?
L14809 +++$+++ u3577 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ SHAKE +++$+++ Oh yes, he's clean all right.
L14808 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Clean though, isn't he?
L14807 +++$+++ u3577 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ SHAKE +++$+++ That's all right then.
L14806 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ No, that's his other one.
L15646 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ That's right, but he's only asking us to pay attention to him, aren't you?
L15645 +++$+++ u3572 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
L15644 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Practising to be thick-headed, you're there already.
L15643 +++$+++ u3572 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Y'what?
L15642 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You needn't bother.
L15641 +++$+++ u3572 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What's old got to do with it?
L15640 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.
L15639 +++$+++ u3572 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Well, I got a few things to say to you, two-faced John McCartney.
L15351 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Can't he? He's done it, son!
L15350 +++$+++ u3572 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ We've got only half an hour till the final run-through. He can't walk out on us.
L15301 +++$+++ u3572 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ So's mine.
L15300 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ She's going to show me her stamp collection.
L15288 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Nothing, he's trying to brainwash me and give me personality doubts ... oh, he's a swine but a clever swine, mind.
L15287 +++$+++ u3572 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What's he know?
L15280 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Foreign devil ...
L15279 +++$+++ u3572 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Behave...
L15276 +++$+++ u3572 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Eh, don't take out me lines.
L15275 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You won't interfere with the basic rugged concept of my personality, will you, girl?
L15130 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Aye, before anyone stops us.
L15129 +++$+++ u3572 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Let's go and muck in.
L14976 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Well, I've got me gob stopper.  Look, a genuine Stradivarius, hand tooled at Dagenham.
L14975 +++$+++ u3572 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Like what?
L14974 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Gaw, it's depressing in here, isn't it? Funny...  'cos they usually reckon dogs more than people in England, don't they? You'd expect something a little more palatial.  Come on. Let's have a little action. Let's do something, then.
L14969 +++$+++ u3572 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Oh, it's a laugh a line with Lennon.  Anyroad up ... It's all your fault.
L14968 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Don't worry, son, we'll get you the best lawyer trading stamps can buy.
L14929 +++$+++ u3572 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Will you stop it! Sorry to disturb you, miss...
L14928 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ We've broken out, oh, the blessed freedom of it all!  Eh, have you got a nail file, these handcuffs are killing me. I was framed. I was innocent.
L14919 +++$+++ u3572 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Don't be callous.
L14918 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ I hope he fell off.
L14879 +++$+++ u3572 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Shall I?
L14878 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Give 'em a pull.
L14840 +++$+++ u3572 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Shurrup! Look, Mister, we've paid for our seats too, you know.
L14839 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Gie's a kiss!
L14796 +++$+++ u3572 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Him, he costs you a fortune in breach of promise cases. He's a villain and a right mixer as well.
L14795 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ He's got you worried, then?
L14794 +++$+++ u3572 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Aye, that's what I'm afraid of!
L14786 +++$+++ u3572 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Oh yeah, he's very clean, y'know.
L14785 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Eh, he's a nice old man, isn't he?
L14784 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Oh, I see.
L14783 +++$+++ u3572 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ No ... it was his sweetbreads. She was dead kinky for sweetbreads. Anyroad, me mother thought it'ud give him a change of scenery, like.
L14782 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Aye and fond of fresh meat and all.
L14774 +++$+++ u3572 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Well, me mother thought the trip 'ud do him good.
L14773 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Well we know that but what's he doing here?
L14772 +++$+++ u3572 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Well ... everyone's entitled to two, aren't they, and this is me other one.
L14771 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ How d'you reckon that one out?
L14766 +++$+++ u3572 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Oh, that one. That's me Grandfather.
L14765 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ That little old man.
L14764 +++$+++ u3572 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ What little old man?
L14763 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Eh ... pardon me for asking but who's that little old man?
L15658 +++$+++ u3571 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ NORM +++$+++ You're a swine. So hurry up ... we're travelling!
L15657 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ What?
L15656 +++$+++ u3571 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ NORM +++$+++ No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.
L15655 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Now, look here, Norm ...
L15654 +++$+++ u3571 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ NORM +++$+++ You've got a midnight matinee.
L15653 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Tonight? We can't make it ...
L15652 +++$+++ u3571 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ NORM +++$+++ The office was on the phone, they think it'd be better if we pushed straight to Wolverhampton.
L15551 +++$+++ u3571 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ NORM +++$+++ Aye, let's try the dressing room.
L15550 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Control yourself or you'll spurt. He's bound to be somewhere.
L15540 +++$+++ u3571 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ NORM +++$+++ Hi, our lot!
L15539 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Hi Norm!
L15303 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Oink! Oink!
L15302 +++$+++ u3571 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ NORM +++$+++ John, I'm talking to you. This final run through is <U>important</U>. Understand? Important.
L15294 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Gear! Come on, girls, let's have a bit of a dance.
L15293 +++$+++ u3571 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ NORM +++$+++ They're nearly ready for you. They're just finishing the band call.
L15286 +++$+++ u3571 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ NORM +++$+++ I would though.
L15285 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ You wouldn't!
L15284 +++$+++ u3571 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ NORM +++$+++ Leave him alone, Lennon, or I'll tell them all the truth about you.
L15267 +++$+++ u3571 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ NORM +++$+++ Sit down, the lot of you.
L15266 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Leave him alone, he's got swine fever.
L15221 +++$+++ u3571 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ NORM +++$+++ Oh shurrup and come on John. They're waiting for you in the studio.
L15220 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Don't cane me, sir, I was led astray.
L15164 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Come on speedy!
L15163 +++$+++ u3571 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ NORM +++$+++ Let's have you.
L15109 +++$+++ u3569 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ JOHN +++$+++ Well, you shouldn't have had bacon for your breakfast, you cannibal.
L15108 +++$+++ u3571 +++$+++ m235 +++$+++ NORM +++$+++ Will you all stop it, you're like a gang of school kids. I knew this was going to happen one day.
