L661541 +++$+++ u3507 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ VERNON +++$+++ As long as it looks like her, I don't care. You know what I'm saying?
L661540 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Boy or girl?
L661539 +++$+++ u3507 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ VERNON +++$+++ Shoot.
L661538 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Hey, Vernon. Can I ask you a question?
L661525 +++$+++ u3507 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ VERNON +++$+++ And you're saying it's some kind of sign? What the fuck's the matter with you?
L661524 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ 'Fraid so.
L661523 +++$+++ u3507 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ VERNON +++$+++ Let me get this straight. All that paper that went into the river. That was the only copy?
L661507 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ A Manhattan book editor murdering a Mormon girl's clutch.
L661506 +++$+++ u3507 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ VERNON +++$+++ Who the hell is that?
L661498 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ No, really...
L661497 +++$+++ u3507 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ VERNON +++$+++ Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And that's a gun.
L661496 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ It's just a souvenir. They don't even make the caps anymore.
L661493 +++$+++ u3507 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ VERNON +++$+++ Shut up.  Cupcake. Please. Inside.
L661492 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Not true. You're the only Vernon I know. Actually, I'm wrong. I once knew a Vernon Peabody at Penguin U.K.
L661489 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Relax, Vernon...
L661488 +++$+++ u3507 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ VERNON +++$+++ You've got a gun, motherfucker. Drop it!
L661487 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Who's got a gun?
L661486 +++$+++ u3507 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ VERNON +++$+++ Move away, cupcake. He's got a gun.
L661485 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Vernon.
L661132 +++$+++ u3505 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA'S VOICE +++$+++ How you choose to live your own life is your business. But you be careful with that boy, Grady. With James. He belongs to somebody else.
L661131 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Yea?
L661130 +++$+++ u3505 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA'S VOICE +++$+++ Trust me, I understand. I just want to say something to you, Grady.
L661129 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ No. Sara, you don't understand...
L661128 +++$+++ u3505 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA'S VOICE +++$+++ Goodbye, Grady.
L661127 +++$+++ u3505 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA'S VOICE +++$+++ Are you there to not reconcile with her?
L661126 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ ...reconcile with Emily.
L661120 +++$+++ u3505 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA'S VOICE +++$+++ Just what? Doing a little dusting?
L661119 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ What? No. There's no one here. I'm just... just...
L661118 +++$+++ u3505 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA'S VOICE +++$+++ With Emily?
L661117 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Yes. But that's not why I called...
L661116 +++$+++ u3505 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA'S VOICE +++$+++ You're in Kinship?
L661115 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I'm in Kinship. Listen, Sara, there's some things we need to talk about...
L661114 +++$+++ u3505 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA'S VOICE +++$+++ Where are you, Grady? An elevator?
L661113 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Sara? Hi. It's Grady.
L661000 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Could you hold on a minute, honey?
L660999 +++$+++ u3505 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ SARA'S VOICE +++$+++ Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You won't believe what's happened.
L660998 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Hello?
L661428 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Even if I end up going to jail....
L661427 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Yes, James.
L661426 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Professor Tripp...?
L661425 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Well, let's see if we can keep that from happening.
L661424 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I probably should be expelled.
L661423 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I'm a little worried, James.
L661422 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. Professor Tripp?
L661421 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Don't worry, James, I'll figure something out.
L661414 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ It's Walter's dog and yes, she does know. But let's spare her the details. Come on, your shoes are in the hail.
L661413 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Does she mean -- does she know about... her dog?
L661404 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ I'm fine, right. Fit as a fucking fiddle.
L661403 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ And we both thank you for that, but we're... we're... fine.
L661325 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Ah, wear whatever you want.
L661324 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Can I -- I mean -- do you mind -- if I wear this again. Professor Tripp?
L661247 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ In the crawl space, with the rats and the casks of Amontillado. Come on. Up.
L661246 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ That's why she hates me. That's why she makes me sleep in the basement.
L661245 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Get out of here.
L661242 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ I'm sorry about all that. I just -- I don't like to talk about my family. They treat me like a freak.  She makes me sleep in the basement of my own house. It's mine. My parents left it to me.
L661241 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Near Carvel?
L661240 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton.
L661239 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I remember that. Five or six years ago.
L661236 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Parents? They're not my parents. They're my grandparents. My parents are dead.
L661235 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ James, like it or not, they're your parents.
L661234 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ I'm not going, with them.
L661233 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ James. Listen. Things -- things are a little weird with me right now and I -- well --I have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. And if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. That's why I need you to go home. Understand?
L661232 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ I'm not going with them.
L661217 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Nowhere. You just sit here and... eat.
L661216 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Where you going?
L661215 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Okay.
L661214 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?
L661212 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ When nobody's looking.
L661211 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ When?
L661210 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I eat.
L661209 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ It's because you don't eat.
L661208 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I don't know... 'Episodes.'
L661207 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ What would you call them then?
L661206 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells.
L661205 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ That's why you're having them. Your spells.
L661204 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ No thanks.
L661203 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Want a bite?
L661199 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ In a minute. Get us a table.
L661198 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ You coming?
L661195 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Arsonist's Daughter meant something.
L661194 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Let me spell it out for you, James. Books don't mean anything. Not to anybody. Not anymore.
L661193 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ And don't be so goddamn sensitive. Who cares what anybody thinks anyway? You want to be a good writer? You want to be a great writer? Then stop giving a damn what other people think. Most of them haven't thought in years.
L661192 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L661191 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Who cares what I said last night, James I -- I was drunk, I was stoned. I'd been bitten by a dog. My wife had left me. How 'bout cutting me some slack?
L661190 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ But, last night...
L661189 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Shut up, James. You're annoying. Carrie and Howard don't know what the fuck they're talking about, okay? The entire class combined -- including the lovely Hannah Green -- has about one tenth of one percent the talent you have, okay?
L661188 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ It's okay, Professor Tripp. Carrie, Howard, the others -- they're right. My stories are annoying. They go on and on and on, and the longer they go on the more annoying they become, until finally you just want to grab something heavy and --
L661187 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I didn't mean it that way.
L661186 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Yes you did. Last night. To your friend Crabtree. "Is he any good?" he said. And you said: "Not yet he isn't." I heard you myself.
L661185 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I never said that.
L661184 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself.
L661183 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ The hell I am.
L661182 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ You're lying.
L661181 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Not you. Your talent.
L661180 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Jealous? Of me?
L661179 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you.
L661178 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Because of my coat?
L661177 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ That's why they all give you such a hard time in workshop.
L661176 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ James, fall semester, first day of class, it was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat.
L661175 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ It's warm.
L661174 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I don't know, James. I don't know why I do half the things I do. Who does?  Why do you wear that coat?
L661173 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ So, why did you take me up there?
L661172 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Thanks for the halo, James, but I've never done that much thinking ahead in my life -- ever.
L661171 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Sure you do. You were thinking: 'That's no cap gun in that kid's overcoat.' You were thinking 'I can't let that kid get on the bus alone -- he might never get on the bus again.' You were thinking: 'I've got to find a way to distract this kid.' So you did. It was -- in its way -- a noble act.
L661170 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Okay, James, I wish you hadn't shot my girlfriend's dog. Even though Poe and I weren't exactly what you'd call simpatico, that's no reason for him to take two in the chest. Still, the fact remains that I'm the one who took you up into the Chancellor's bedroom. I'm the one who has to take the blame. I don't know what the hell I was thinking.
L661169 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ It wasn't her dog. It's her husband's --  Who said anything about girlfriend?
L661168 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's dog.
L661167 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ What?
L661166 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ You're mad at me, aren't you?
L661165 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Jesus...  Look, James, you appear to possess -- like many an aspiring writer before you, by the way -- a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made. However, I think it's best if, for the moment at least  ...we abstain.
L661164 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Probably about the time you gave me the codeine pills last night.
L661163 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I just wanted a little sip? Tell me, James, exactly what point was it that you turned into Serpent Boy?
L661162 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ I just wanted a little sip.
L661110 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I know. It's the house you want to wake up in on Christmas morning.  Make yourself at home. I'll be right back.
L661109 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ It feels really... good... here.
L661108 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Oh. Right. Well, let's try not to think about that.
L661107 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ It's not that. It just reminded me of -- you know -- of what's in the car. In the trunk.
L661106 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Relax. Emily hasn't carried a house key since she was twelve years old. And your hips are as slim as hers.
L661105 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ She came here. We'll just wait. In the meantime, I need you to shimmy through.
L661104 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Maybe she didn't come here.
L661103 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Smoke the rest of that joint, James, and you can start on the box.
L661102 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Want one. They're incredible. Incredible.
L661101 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ You can see the outline of a butt.
L661100 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ How can you tell?
L661099 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Someone jumped on your car with their butt...
L661098 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ That's right. That one.
L661097 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ The one that left you?
L661096 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Unless I miss my bet... my wife.
L661095 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Kinship. And what's here?
L661094 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Kinship.
L661093 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy would live. What's it called again?
L661092 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Maybe I just needed the moment to present itself.
L661091 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I thought you were the guy who didn't like to lose control of his emotions.
L661090 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Amazing.
L661089 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ When we fall, we fall hard.
L661088 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic school?
L661087 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ I'm telling you what I was told by my uncle. And he should know. He ran half a dozen men's clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt.
L661086 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
L661085 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
L661084 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ What kind of dancer?
L661083 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Seitz Plastics. That's where he met my mom. She was a fry cook in the cafeteria. Before that, she'd been a dancer.
L661082 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Your father worked in a mannequin factory?
L661081 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five years.
L661080 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I never heard of it.
L661079 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Outside Scranton.
L661078 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Carvel? Where's Carvel?
L661077 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Carvel.
L661076 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Where's that?
L661075 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ It's a bit of a scandal. My parents live in a small town.
L661074 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Jesus, James. Wow.
L661073 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Colon cancer.
L661072 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Glaucoma?
L661071 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ It's my father. He gets it from his doctor.
L661070 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Maybe...
L661069 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Humboldt County?
L661067 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Your aunt?
L661066 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ I've got a thing about, places like this. I know what those houses are like. I know what the people are like.
L661064 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ No.
L661063 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Don't be proud, James. We're in Sewickley Heights. We could find you a nice golf course to barf on.
L661060 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Yeah, well, actually...
L661059 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ She seemed to take it pretty well.
L661026 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Shit, James, you're hungover. What do you think's the matter with you?
L661025 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ I can't help myself. I don't know what's the matter with me.
L661023 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Hm.
L661022 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Isn't this...?
L661019 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I don't know...  Me.
L661018 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Who?
L661017 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Jesus, James, you should've told someone.
L661016 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had the gun. For protection.
L661015 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ But James. I mean... How long?
L661014 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ It's not so bad. I know the night janitor. And there's a broken locker I can put my stuff.
L661013 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ The bus station.
L661012 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ So where have you been staying?
L661011 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ There is, but it's not that interesting.
L661010 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I guess there's probably a story behind that.
L661009 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ I got kicked out. Well, not exactly kicked out. I was asked to leave.
L661004 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Well done, James.
L661003 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ How's that?
L660975 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Well, James, you did shoot the Head of the English Department's dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia.
L660974 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ And... and before that. Did I do anything? Anything bad?
L660973 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch.
L660972 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ How did I get here last night?
L660971 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Hm.
L660970 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Professor Tripp?
L660966 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Ah. I don't believe in writer's block.
L660965 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Blocked.
L660964 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Washed up?
L660963 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Nothing, it's just that, well, it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were...
L660962 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ But... ?
L660961 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
L660960 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
L660959 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ That's a big book you're writing.
L660958 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Afraid so.
L660957 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ I thought maybe you'd won a radio contest or something. Is that single- spaced?
L660956 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right.
L660955 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ Yes.
L660954 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ What'd you tell him?
L660953 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ He wanted to know if a Grady Tripp lived here and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 with black interior.
L660952 +++$+++ u3497 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ GRADY +++$+++ What'd he say?
L660951 +++$+++ u3501 +++$+++ m230 +++$+++ JAMES LEER +++$+++ The guy on the phone.
