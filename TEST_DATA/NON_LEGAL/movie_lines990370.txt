L558767 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Lenny, ,you pathetic product of the public school system. Your Uncle Lex has had only one thing on his awesome mind during his incarceration . . . Destroying Superman!
L558766 +++$+++ u8019 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Are we going to skip the country, Uncle Lex?
L559200 +++$+++ u8022 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ NUCLEAR MAN +++$+++ I am master now.
L559199 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Stop! I command you . . . you mutant!
L559183 +++$+++ u8022 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ NUCLEAR MAN +++$+++ Destiny.
L559182 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team? It's like I'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. What could I have to fear?
L559181 +++$+++ u8022 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ NUCLEAR MAN +++$+++ What do you fear?
L559180 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Nice bit. You're good. With my brain and your, well, frankly, brawn, the possibilities  are staggering. I could be . . . Emperor, King! Did you see how scared those guys were?
L559146 +++$+++ u8022 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ NUCLEAR MAN +++$+++ First, I have fun.
L559145 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Nifty, huh?  Goodnight Sweet Prince, parting is . . . inevitable  Now, destroy Superman.

L559046 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ I made you, and I can destroy you.
L559045 +++$+++ u8022 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ NUCLEAR MAN +++$+++ I am an experiment? I am freako?
L559041 +++$+++ u8022 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ NUCLEAR MAN +++$+++ You are . . . nothing. I am father now.
L559040 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ What? A genius? . . . an inspiration?
L559039 +++$+++ u8022 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ NUCLEAR MAN +++$+++ You are . . .

L558881 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ For dignity. My reputation is at stake. Just put it on.
L558880 +++$+++ u8022 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ NUCLEAR MAN +++$+++ What I need this for?
L559264 +++$+++ u8023 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ No . . . it's the way it always is . . . on the brink . . . with good fighting evil.
L559263 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ But . . . but isn't the world about to be osterized?
L559262 +++$+++ u8023 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ High School Physics, Luthor. While I was recuperating I had time to figure out that if your foul creature was born from the sun, it must have been his source of energy.
L559261 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ But . . . how could you beat him?
L559236 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Right, good. Tell you what, we'll wait right here. Till you get back.
L559235 +++$+++ u8023 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ I'll deal with you later.
L559232 +++$+++ u8023 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ Still having delusions, Lex Luthor?
L559231 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Superman. . .  But you're... dead!
L559144 +++$+++ u8023 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ A mind is a terrible thing to waste, Lex Luthor. And you've wasted yours on this foul monstrosity. I'm taking you in.
L559143 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.
L559142 +++$+++ u8023 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.
L559141 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Precisely. And then it came to me. My greatest ever plan. I made a deal with some minor league Bad Boys. Arms Dealers, Renegades Generals, You know the type. With you gone, we'll make a fortune rearming the world.
L559140 +++$+++ u8023 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ Which explains why you sent his organic matter to the sun.
L559139 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ I'll ignore that . . . So, I created a monster who didn't work nearly as well as I might have liked -- you were clearly his better  --  he needed more energy, more power.
L559138 +++$+++ u8023 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ I'm not going anywhere.
L559137 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ No, no, listen. I escaped with only one thing on my mind . . . the end of Superman.
L559136 +++$+++ u8023 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ Your time in prison has twisted you into a delusionary state, Luthor.
L559129 +++$+++ u8023 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ You've broken all the laws of man, Luthor. And now you've broken the laws of nature! . . .  I assume you must have hidden a device in one of the missiles I hurled into the sun!
L559128 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Look closely at his cell structure. See anything familiar?
L559127 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Why? Because I want to be the first one to introduce you to a new kid on the block.
L559126 +++$+++ u8023 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
L559125 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
L559124 +++$+++ u8023 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ If you have any social skills, you've learned them from a rattlesnake. Just what are you up to?
L559123 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Silly me. How do I ever think I can fool the super guy. You're right, no bomb. I just knew you were too busy with the world peace bit to make a social call.  I confess . . . I tricked you. Hey, you look great!
L559122 +++$+++ u8023 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.
L559121 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Guess who? It's your old friend, Lex.
L560716 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Not you.  You.  Tell me again.
L560715 +++$+++ u8025 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ Me?
L560712 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Got it? Otis?
L560711 +++$+++ u8025 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ Yes, Mr. Luthor. The XK101 can travel anywhere in the world undetected. It also has a sensory device built into it so that it can detect any obstacle in its path and avoid it. It just goes around it or over it.  The XK101 never quits! It will not stop until it reaches its pre-targeted target!
L560710 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ One of them should've been you.
L560709 +++$+++ u8025 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ Yes, so, well, Werner would've gotten to that too but  --  --  but the XK101 flies only eight feet above the ground...well below the radar limit!  So what? We could have done that soon. We had ways to make people ta-- ways to avoid the radar. And this XK101  -- they think it's so smart that they keep it in 'missile silos' underground. Hah!  We kept many things underground.
L560707 +++$+++ u8025 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ --  thought about a rocket that carries a nuclear warhead in its nosecone and can strike with an impact of  --
L560706 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Albert!
L560705 +++$+++ u8025 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ It's very simple, Otis.  Very simple, the XK101 rocket. It's nothing, forty years ago we in the Fatherland were working on this. Five more years, we would've had it. But then  --  --  that silly war...Why, my cousin Werner had already  --
L560675 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ And stop interrupting. his is the big scene.  Your finest hour! You rose to the challenge, baby! And you lost. That's the best part!
L560674 +++$+++ u8025 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ But Mr. Luthor, sir, I already  --
L560669 +++$+++ u8025 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ We're running out of smoke.
L560668 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Ah! The guest of honor at last! And about time, too!
L560630 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Otherwise, you're a Mongoloid idiot.  It's reasonable to assume that fragments of the planet were shot out into space by the force of the explosion, and  --
L560629 +++$+++ u8025 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ Thank you.
L560628 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ You're a great architect, Albert.
L560627 +++$+++ u8025 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ He's thirty-five years old.
L560626 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ That the planet blew up on May 23, 1937. That the rocket ship with the revolting little freak in it took three years to reach Earth. Ergo?
L560397 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Shut up, apple-polisher.
L560396 +++$+++ u8025 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ Nobody else.
L560395 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Ahhhh, my favorite part of the day. Who else could have thought of this aquarium?
L560392 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Wonderful. Otis will go above and steal some Big Macs.
L560391 +++$+++ u8025 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ There's some slice American cheese...and...a half a bottle of club soda, I think.
L560350 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ I take the man out of Argentina - and it was no picnic finding him y'know? And what does he think about? Bunkers. Still living in the past, when I am about to realize the greatest real estate scheme in the history of the world!
L560349 +++$+++ u8025 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ Bunkers!
L560348 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ You'll be designing monuments soon, Albert! Hotels! Palaces!
L560344 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Stop saying you know when I say 'y'know.' I know you know.  Yes, I know you're here, Otis. What do you want, a brass band?
L560343 +++$+++ u8025 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ ALBERT +++$+++ I know, but  --
L560700 +++$+++ u8029 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ It's for that piece she's doing on women and competition. She's off to the Women's Western Golf Classic.
L560699 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ What's she doing in California?
L560698 +++$+++ u8029 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ She's in California. That's wild enough, I guess.
L560697 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Lois isn't here?
L560696 +++$+++ u8029 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ You and Lois, you get all the action.  There she is, out in the wild West and everything.
L560695 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ It was hot, yes.
L560694 +++$+++ u8029 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ A hot story, huh?
L560693 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ I've been on the job.
L560692 +++$+++ u8029 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ JIMMY +++$+++ You'd better get a new alarm clock. The chief has been hollering for you.
L560238 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ I will.
L560237 +++$+++ u8035 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Keep warm now.
L560236 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ North. It's north
L560235 +++$+++ u8035 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Do you know where you're headed?
L560231 +++$+++ u8035 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ I know son, I know...
L560230 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Mother...
L560229 +++$+++ u8035 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ He's a good man, Ben is. Your father always said so.
L560228 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ I talked to Ben Hubbard this morning. He'll be more than glad to bring in the crops on shares.
L560225 +++$+++ u8035 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ I know.
L560224 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Mom...
L560217 +++$+++ u8035 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Anyway, we Kent's don't like showoffs, ain't that so? A body's got to be humble even if he knows that he's better'n his neighbors.
L560216 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Don't worry, Mom. I know.
L560211 +++$+++ u8035 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ I know you're a good boy, Clark. No mother could ask for better. It's just that...
L560210 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ No, Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise.
L560209 +++$+++ u8035 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ MARTHA +++$+++ Clark...Son...that...thing you did with the Sheriff today... those...stunts...you don't do those things at school, do you?
L560562 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Yes, but I'm the only one who knows him. I  --  I really like the guy. And he likes me.  I think. I mean, I could talk to him, you know? And he could talk to me.  Anytime...
L560561 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ You're not the only one.
L560560 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Oh, what a chance! If I could just  --  get to him.
L560530 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ No thanks.
L560529 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ It isn't that I still don't like you, Clark. It's just that...well, once you've had something like that happen to you, it kind of changes a girl.  I'm going to make some coffee. You want some?
L560528 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Super...man. Hmmm...
L560527 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ They will once I hang it on him in tomorrow's edition.
L560526 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Is that what they're calling him?
L560525 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Superman.  Pretty good name for him, isn't it?
L560524 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ What'd you call him?
L560523 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Of this...Superman.
L560522 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Jealous? Of what?
L560521 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ You're just jealous.
L560520 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.
L560519 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip.
L560518 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Look, there was probably a trampoline on the roof somewhere and this joker just took a big bounce.
L560517 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ He grabbed me! He held me! He set me down gently! How could that be done with mirrors?
L560516 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Mirrors, then. It's done with mirrors.
L560515 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ There weren't any wires. I looked.
L560514 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ It was done with wires. They must have rigged him like they do with Peter Pan.
L560513 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Clark Kent, if you had only seen it the way I did, you -
L560512 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Oh sure. A man flies in the sky like a pigeon and it wasn't a trick.
L560511 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ It wasn't a trick!
L560510 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ You were probably so scared you didn't look to see what the trick was.
L560509 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ I'm telling you, I was there.
L560426 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Come again?
L560425 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Not unless you can fly.
L560424 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Can I take you to the airport?
L560422 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Lois, you should see what the inside of your lungs look like.
L560421 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ There's no real proof that tobacco  --
L560420 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ No. I'm just thinking that you smoke too much, if you don't mind my saying so.
L560419 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ For what? Oh, I've see the way the other half lives. My sister, for instance. it looks terrific, but is that what I really want? Three kids, two cats, and fifteen needlepoint pillows? I'd go bananas after one week. Hell, I need this crazy existence of mine.  Like I need the plague, right? That's what your thinking.
L560418 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Don't you ever give up?
L560417 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ It's not what you think. Darn it. I'm going out on a story. The Secretary of Defense is landing at the airport tonight and this kid's going to be there to make sure he answers a few questions he'd rather duck.
L560416 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Oh.
L560415 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Thanks, Clark, but I'm booked for the night.
L560414 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Oh, not really. I guess I'll just watch a little TV and --  --  unless...would you be interested in dinner?
L560413 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Big night coming up?
L560412 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Huh?
L560411 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ What now, my love?
L560336 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ I just took a shot at it.
L560335 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ You described the exact contents of my purse.
L560334 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Know what?
L560332 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Supposing that man had hurt you? Is it worth risking your life over ten dollars, two credit cards, and a lipstick? I mean, it's not as if --
L560331 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ You're great with the advice, Clark. Maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column.
L560330 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ It isn't worth getting a heart attack over, Lois.
L560328 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Oh, for God's sake!
L560327 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ He may have a gun!
L560326 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Stop him, Clark!
L560325 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ What the  --  !
L560324 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Hey!
L560323 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Not in Metropolis it isn't. This is the home of the sneak attack, the stab in the back, the --
L560322 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Unbelievable.
L560321 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ See? Didn't I tell you this was a tough town?
L560303 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ 'Swell.' When  was the last time I heard anybody say  -  where are you from , anyway?
L560302 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ But otherwise it's swell.
L560301 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Some people aren't the athletic type.
L560300 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ I think I lost a week's salary at the dart board.
L560299 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Well, how are you enjoying your first day on the job?
L560298 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Not really, no.
L560297 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Are there any more at home like you?
L560296 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Not really, no.
L560295 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Not...gray.
L560294 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Actually, she's silver-haired.
L560293 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ I know. He sends a check every week to his dear gray-haired old mother.
L560292 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ No.
L560291 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Your bookie?
L560279 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Hey, you're getting a better class of people in your office these days, Boss.
L560278 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ I'll bet you have some good ideas.
L560275 +++$+++ u8033 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Well!
L560274 +++$+++ u8026 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ I'd like to.
L560789 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ Okay.  Take me to your leader.
L560788 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ What can I tell you? He's my leader.
L560787 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ Look, lady, you saved my life once. I owe you a favor. But I can't understand why you follow a man like that.
L560786 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Oh.
L560785 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.
L560784 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Couldn't we forget the plane? You could lift me in your big strong arms?
L560783 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ I'd better get you down.
L560782 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice.
L560781 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?
L560780 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ He wants to see you. Lex Luthor.
L560779 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ Besides that.
L560778 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Screaming
L560777 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L560776 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Help! I mean  --  I can't stop saying it. Silly, isn't it  -  There's nothing to worry about. Help! See.
L560775 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ You! The girl from the volcano!  Kryptonite...
L560689 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ You too.  I just...I can't get it on for good guys. Y'know?
L560688 +++$+++ u8038 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ Listen...thank you.
L560771 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Of course I can. I love you.
L560770 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ You can't do this to me!
L560769 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ What other one?
L560768 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I mean the other one!
L560767 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ I'm wearing it.
L560766 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Good. Fine. Now where's my parachute?
L560765 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Miss Teschmacher, Superman is a fairly bright individual. My understanding of the way he works is that he won't be fooled by a simple trick.
L560764 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Where's mine?! Where's my parachute?
L560763 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ Lex is going bye-bye.
L560762 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Danger??  Somebody??? Lex  -- where are you going?
L560761 +++$+++ u8034 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ LUTHOR +++$+++ He always shows up when somebody's in danger.
L560760 +++$+++ u8027 +++$+++ m544 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?
