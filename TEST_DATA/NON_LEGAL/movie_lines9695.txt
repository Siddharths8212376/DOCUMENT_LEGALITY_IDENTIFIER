L134760 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ And the second one was still being built when they blew it up.
L134759 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Luke blew it up. Give credit where it's due.
L134758 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the Rebels destroyed it.
L134757 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Yeah.
L134756 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ So they build another Death Star, right?
L134755 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ There's more?
L134754 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ You know what else I noticed in Jedi?
L134751 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ I think they were Catholics.
L134750 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief.
L134749 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ More or less.
L134748 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Hence, the Empire was a fascist theocracy, and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution.
L134747 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ It would stand to reason, yes.
L134746 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.
L134745 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Yeah.
L134744 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Now, he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule.
L134743 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ I guess.
L134742 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Well, he's like the pope for the dark side of the Force. He's a holy man; a shaman, kind of, albeit an evil one.
L134741 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ How do you mean?
L134740 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?
L134739 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ The Emperor.
L134738 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ All right, Vader's boss...
L134737 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ What's that?
L134736 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ There was something else going on in Jedi. I never noticed it until today.
L134735 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett.  It ends on such a down note. And that's life-a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.
L134734 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Blasphemy.
L134733 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Empire.
L134732 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.
L134731 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married.
L134730 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Return of the Jedi.
L134729 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Me pulling a can off some moron's fist.
L134728 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ You know what I just watched?
L134727 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Do you know that article is accurate? Caitlin's really getting married!
L134659 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ You, Veronica, Caitlin...  ...and Caitlin's fiancé.
L134658 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ All four?
L134657 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Then I think all four of you had better sit down and talk it over.
L134656 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ I think it's safe to say yes.
L134655 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Caitlin's on the same wave-length?
L134654 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ I think the arguments Veronica and I are having are some kind of manifestation of a subconscious desire to break away from her so that I can pursue the possibility of a more meaningful relationship with Caitlin.
L134653 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ What about Veronica?
L134652 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ ...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level.
L134651 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ No, no, I'm listening. She's leaving college, and...?
L134650 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ I'm talking to myself here.
L134649 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Oh shit, I've got to place an order.
L134648 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ They are. When she calls me now, she's a different person-she's frightened and vulnerable. She's about to finish college and enter the real world. That's got to be scary for anyone.
L134647 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ You think things would be any different now?
L134646 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ I'm serious. Aside from the cheating, we were a great couple.  That's what high school's all about-algebra, bad lunch, and infidelity.
L134645 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Oh yeah.
L134644 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Because there was a lot of good in our relationship.
L134643 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ In light of this lurid tale, I don't see how you could even romanticize your relationship with Caitlin-she broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles.
L134642 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ It takes different strokes to move the world.
L134641 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ That's frightening.
L134640 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ The two moved to Idaho together after graduation. They raise sheep.
L134639 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Chess team Allan Harris?!
L134638 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Allan Harris.
L134637 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Your mother.
L134636 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Interesting postscript to that story: Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom?
L134635 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ That girl was vile to you.
L134634 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Great story, isn't it?
L134633 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Oh, my God.
L134632 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party.
L134631 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ What do you mean?
L134630 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson.
L134629 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ That's not cheating. People say crazy shit during sex. One time, I called this girl "Mom."
L134628 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ She called me Brad.
L134627 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ She called you Brad?
L134626 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ In the middle of it, she calls me Brad.
L134625 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ That's cheating?
L134624 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.
L134623 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Eight and a half?
L134622 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Eight and a half.
L134621 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times?
L134620 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Five years.
L134619 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Chick's nuts about you. How long did you date Caitlin?
L134618 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Seven months.
L134617 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ I'm going to offer you some advice, my friend: let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been with Veronica for how long now?
L134616 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ You win.
L134615 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ I'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree.
L134614 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ I guess it's not really fighting. She just wants me to leave here, go back to school, get some direction.
L134613 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ What do you two fight about?
L134612 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks.
L134611 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Did you tell Veronica?
L134610 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ She called me.
L134609 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ You called Caitlin again?
L134608 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ You don't want to know.
L134606 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ I wanted to use your car.
L134605 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Why?
L134604 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Who was on your phone this morning at about two-thirty? I was trying to call for a half an hour.
L134603 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ No, thanks.
L134602 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Want something to drink? I'm buying.
L134601 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ I can't stand a voyeur. I'll be back.
L134600 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Don't screw with it. It makes us look suspicious.
L134599 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class, especially since I rule.  Is the Pelican flying?
L134598 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Shocking abuse of authority.
L134597 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Some guy just came in refusing to pay late fees. He said the store was closed for two hours yesterday.  I tore up his membership.
L134593 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Go open the sore.
L134592 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ What smells like shoe polish?
L134591 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ He assured me that he'd be here by twelve.
L134590 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ What time do you have to stay till?
L134589 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Shit, if I'd known you were working, I would've come even later.
L134588 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ That's what I said.
L134587 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Bunch of savages in this town.
L134586 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Someone jammed gum in the locks.
L134585 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ Why are the shutters closed?
L134584 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ The boss called. Arthur fell ill.
L134583 +++$+++ u4535 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ RANDAL +++$+++ What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one.
L134582 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ You're late.
L135308 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Jesus Christ, what next?
L135307 +++$+++ u4528 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ I'm surprised you never found out about it, Dante. Everybody in school knew-even in my class.
L135302 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ THE GLADES MOTEL?
L135301 +++$+++ u4528 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ I still remember Caitlin telling us about that time you two went to that motel-the one with the mirrors and the hot tub in the room.
L135295 +++$+++ u4528 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Caitlin used to talk about him all the time.
L135294 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ You know him?
L135278 +++$+++ u4528 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Yep. I remember you got caught in my parents' room with Caitlin once.
L135277 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?
L135276 +++$+++ u4528 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ I'm her sister.
L135275 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Caitlin Bree. Yeah?
L135274 +++$+++ u4528 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung out with...
L135273 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Do I know you?
L135263 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ I don't have love handles.
L135262 +++$+++ u4528 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ He's got those love handles.
L135248 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ I know I can bench more than that!
L135247 +++$+++ u4528 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ I'd say about sixty, seventy-tops.
L135240 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Thirty-fire.
L135239 +++$+++ u4528 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Just the paper.
L135238 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Yes.
L135237 +++$+++ u4528 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ HEATHER +++$+++ Are you open?
L135327 +++$+++ u4538 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ TRAINER +++$+++ Forget it. I don't want to deal with a guy that sells cigarettes to a five-year-old.  Can I offer you a ride somewhere?
L135326 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! Hey!
L135306 +++$+++ u4538 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ TRAINER +++$+++ Hey man, that was a long time ago. Don't let it get to you.
L135305 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ What? When? When did all this shit happen?
L135300 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ I... I don't believe this...
L135299 +++$+++ u4538 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ TRAINER +++$+++ All the time. That girl was like a rabbit.
L135298 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Wait a second!  You used to sleep with Caitlin Bree? While I was dating her?
L135291 +++$+++ u4538 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ TRAINER +++$+++ While you two were dating in high school. We're talking four, five years ago, back when I drove a Trans- Am.
L135290 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ What?
L135287 +++$+++ u4538 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ TRAINER +++$+++ To you?
L135286 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ No, she's getting married.
L135285 +++$+++ u4538 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ TRAINER +++$+++ Oh man! Hey, you still going out with her?
L135284 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ How do you know that?
L135283 +++$+++ u4538 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ TRAINER +++$+++ And your name is Dante Hicks? You went to high school with her? You played hockey?
L135282 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Yeah?
L135281 +++$+++ u4538 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ TRAINER +++$+++ Pretty girl, about this girl's height- dark hair-gorgeous body?
L135280 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Yeah.
L135279 +++$+++ u4538 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ TRAINER +++$+++ Did you say Caitlin Bree?
L135257 +++$+++ u4538 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ TRAINER +++$+++ See? You're ashamed. You know you're out of shape. Take my card.  I can help you tone that body up in no time. Get you on an aerobics and free-weights program.
L135256 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Oh for God's sake!
L135246 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ I don't know.
L135245 +++$+++ u4538 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ TRAINER +++$+++ How much can you bench?
L135244 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ I am not.
L135236 +++$+++ u4538 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ TRAINER +++$+++ No fat, but no tone either. You don't get enough exercise.
L135235 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body.
L135234 +++$+++ u4538 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ TRAINER +++$+++ Yes, they are. You're out of shape.
L135233 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ They are not.
L135232 +++$+++ u4538 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ TRAINER +++$+++ Oh, I do. You made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash. Your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized.
L135231 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ I don't think so.
L135230 +++$+++ u4538 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ TRAINER +++$+++ I don't think so. That was a grunt; a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid in the stretching of muscles. I'm a trainer. I know what that sound signifies: you're out of shape.
L135229 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ I didn't strain. I sighed.
L135228 +++$+++ u4538 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ TRAINER +++$+++ I heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag. That milk only weighs about seven pounds.
L135227 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Excuse me?
L135226 +++$+++ u4538 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ TRAINER +++$+++ Sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym.
L135713 +++$+++ u4531 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ I don't know. She was senile and shit. Used to piss herself all the time. C'mon Silent Bob.
L135712 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Meaning?
L135711 +++$+++ u4531 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ I've had girlfriends, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit.  Shit, my grandma used to say, "Which is better: a good plate with nothing on it..." No, wait. I fucked up. She said "What's a good-looking plate with nothing on it?"
L135710 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ She's my girlfriend.
L135709 +++$+++ u4531 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Damn. She sure goes out of her way.
L135708 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ I jacked the car up. All she did was loosen the nuts and put the tire on.
L135707 +++$+++ u4531 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ I don't know dude. That Caitlin chick's nice. But I see that Veronica girl doing shit for you all the time. She brings you food, she rubs your back... Didn't I see her change your tire one day?
L135706 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Maybe.
L135705 +++$+++ u4531 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ And what-you were gonna dump her to date that Caitlin chick?
L135704 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Lasagne.
L135703 +++$+++ u4531 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Is she that girl who's down here all the time? She came here today carrying a plate of food.
L135702 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Veronica.
L135701 +++$+++ u4531 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Don't you already have a girlfriend?
L135700 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ We were going to start again, I think.
L135699 +++$+++ u4531 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ You used to go out with her?
L135698 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Knock it off. That used to be my girlfriend.
L135697 +++$+++ u4531 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Probably saw that Caitlin chick. I know I felt like beatin' it when I saw her.  Come here, bitch! You like this? Is this what you want? Hunhh?
L135696 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ I don't know. I wasn't watching.
L135695 +++$+++ u4531 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he was jerkin' off.
L135694 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ He died in the bathroom.
L135693 +++$+++ u4531 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Hey, man, what happened with that old guy?
L135692 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ I can't believe you just rolled a joint in here.
L135691 +++$+++ u4531 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ So why do you sell it for so much more? I'll tell you why-because people come here and they're like "A dollar eighty for soda? I should get it at Food City. But I don't feel like driving there. I'll just buy it here so I don't have to drive up there." That's exploiting a weakness, too, isn't it?
L135690 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ So.
L135689 +++$+++ u4531 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ At Food City it's ninety-nine cents, plus tax.
L135688 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.
L135687 +++$+++ u4531 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ All right. How much is Pepsi here?
L135686 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ You sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction.
L135685 +++$+++ u4531 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ What's that mean?
L135684 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ The difference is you exploit a weakness.
L135683 +++$+++ u4531 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ And these aren't my drugs-I just sell them.
L135682 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ It's not my store.
L135681 +++$+++ u4531 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Relax brother. What I mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around. A dollar seventy-nine for wraps-what's that shit?
L135680 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ How do you figure... HEY! You can't roll a joint in here!
L135679 +++$+++ u4531 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ I work, just like you. You're more of a crook than I am, dude.
L135678 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ Nothing personal.
L135677 +++$+++ u4531 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Listen to you. Oh shit. "Oh, I don't hang out with drug dealers."
L135676 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ With you? I don't think so.
L135675 +++$+++ u4531 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ JAY +++$+++ Wanna come to this party tonight? There's gonna be some pussy there, man!
L135674 +++$+++ u4525 +++$+++ m299 +++$+++ DANTE +++$+++ I should start.
