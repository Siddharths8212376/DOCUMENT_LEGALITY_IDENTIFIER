L279505 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ You really think it would make a difference either way?
L279504 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Of course it is.
L279503 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Jesus Christ, Rob.  Is that really what's bothering you?
L279502 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Well.  Sex, I guess.  Is sex with him better?
L279501 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Is what better?  Better than what?
L279500 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Is it better?
L279499 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Just ask it!
L279498 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ You won't like it.
L279497 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Nevermind.
L279496 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ It sounds stupid.
L279495 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Fine.  One.
L279494 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ No problem.  If I can ask one question.
L279493 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I'm too tired for this now.  I know I'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up?  I need to be able to think while I do it and I can't think while you're here.
L279492 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Yeah.  Great.
L279491 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?
L279490 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Well if you could tell me roughly it would help.
L279489 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ -- I don't fucking know what chance you fucking have!
L279488 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Hey, I just want to know where I stand.  What chance --
L279487 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Oh, Rob, shut up.
L279486 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ So we have a chance of getting back together again.
L279485 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I suppose so.
L279484 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Well, if you don't know, there's a chance, right?  It's like, if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said, I don't know if he's got a chance of survival or not, then that doesn't mean the patient's definitely going to die, now does it?  It means he might live.  Even if it's only a remote possibility.
L279483 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I don't know.
L279482 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together?
L279481 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Look.  Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me.  Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know.  All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here.
L279479 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Well then why don't you quit it while you seem to not be ahead?
L279478 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I am not living with him.  I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  You know that, don't you?  I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.  Probably nothing.
L279477 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Why is that childish?  Your living with the guy!  I'm just asking how it's going.
L279476 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Rob.  Don't be childish.
L279475 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ No.  So.  Is it working out with Ian?
L279474 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Did you say something?
L279473 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ What, what?
L279472 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ What?
L279470 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ No.
L279469 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I guess it's not that obvious, then.
L279468 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I don't know.
L279467 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ What's the obvious stuff?
L279466 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Just the obvious stuff.
L279465 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ What were the others?
L279464 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I don't know.  It's one of the things I thought of.
L279463 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ What?  Gimme a fucking break.  Is that what you think?  That your not big enough a deal for me?  Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob.
L279462 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Good.  So.  Is it my job?
L279461 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I'm sorry.  I haven't been very fair to you.  That's why I came here to the store this evening.  I feel terrible, Rob.  This is really hard, you know.
L279460 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Had to work it out for myself, though, didn't I?
L279459 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I think you know that.
L279458 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ So.  Where have you been staying for the last week?
L279456 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Don't you think there are more important things to talk about than my record collection?
L279455 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Have you tackled the Great Reorganization yet?
L279451 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Not really.
L279450 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ And do you like it that way?
L279449 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Yes.  Look at me.  Look at our -- the apartment.  What else do I have, other than records and CDs?
L279448 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ You really believe that?
L279447 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ But Laura... that's me.  That's all there is to me.  There isn't anything else.  If you've lost interest in that, you've lost interest in everything.
L279446 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Yeah, sure.  More so then than I am now.  That's life though, isn't it?
L279445 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ So you weren't interested in music at all?
L279444 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Well, I liked you.  You were a deejay, and I thought you were hot, and I didn't have a boyfriend, and I wanted one.
L279443 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ You used to care more about things like Marvin Gaye than you do now. When I first met you, and I made you that tape, you loved it.  You said -- and I quote -- "It was so good it made you ashamed of your record collection."
L279441 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I remember the song.  I just couldn't remember who sang it.
L279440 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ But don't you remember?
L279439 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Is that right?  I'd like a word with him.
L279438 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Hey!  Marvin Gaye! "Got to Give It Up!" That's our song!  Marvin Gaye is responsible for our entire relationship!
L279437 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ -- and who says I like Marvin Gaye, anyway?
L279436 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ -- Alright, alright but --
L279435 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ -- whatever, and the Israelis and the Palestinians don't.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute, and the Israelis and the Palestinians are. Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye --
L279434 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ -- Made.  Made.  Marvin Gaye is dead, his father shot him in --
L279433 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records --
L279432 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye?  It's like saying you support the Israelis and the Palestinians.
L279429 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ My house?
L279428 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.
L279427 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Are you coming home?
L279426 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I thought I could give you a lift back.
L279425 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Hi.
L279424 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ Hi.
L279423 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Shit!
L279324 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ I should be so lucky.
L279323 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Jeez.  He goes on long enough.
L279096 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Well stay for tonight, then.
L279095 +++$+++ u1319 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LAURA +++$+++ We've done the hard part now.  I might as well, you know...
L279094 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ You don't have to go this second. You can stay until whenever.
L279874 +++$+++ u1320 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ If by "we" you are referring to men, then I have to say that just the once would do.
L279873 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Only because it's never the time.  I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know?
L279872 +++$+++ u1320 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Maybe I've been a little unfair. But is this really the time?
L279871 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I know I can't speak now because Laura's father died, and I just have to take it because otherwise I'm a bad guy, with the emphasis on guy, self-centered.  Well, I'm fucking not, not all the time, anyway, I'm really sorry Jo.  But you know, Liz... I can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself.  And maybe you think I should, but it's not much of a life, you know?
L279870 +++$+++ u1320 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Enough of what?
L279869 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Enough, Liz.
L279860 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Isn't that how it is for everybody?
L279859 +++$+++ u1320 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ No.  They don't know him.  And Ken liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know.  It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story.
L279858 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Is Ray going?
L279857 +++$+++ u1320 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ What difference does it make?
L279856 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.
L279855 +++$+++ u1320 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ It's a crematorium.
L279854 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ So the minister says nice things, and then, what, we all troop outside and they bury him?
L279369 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Well she --
L279368 +++$+++ u1320 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Rob!  Two years ago you got Laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her!  You borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back!  And then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were "kind of looking around for somebody else!"
L279367 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ It's true!
L279366 +++$+++ u1320 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ To think I sympathized with you for two seconds!  Poor Rob!  Laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs.  You let me believe that!
L279365 +++$+++ u1320 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ -- No, no, no, don't even.  I talked to Laura, Rob.  I talked to her and she gave me a little background. And you're a fucking ASSHOLE.
L279364 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ What's the -- hey, Liz --
L279302 +++$+++ u1320 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Yeah.  Like I said, I don't want to take sides.  And I like Laura with you.  She's more fun, more open. You guys are good together.  I just wish you two could, I don't know.  I don't think much of this Ian guy --
L279301 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Actually, I'm fine.  I'm great. Last night I got to thinking, "you know what?  Maybe it is time to move on.  Maybe we're just not right for each other.  Or maybe we are.  But time will tell and at this point I'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be." You know?
L279300 +++$+++ u1320 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ How're you holding up?
L279299 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Yeah.  I just wanted to thank you for that message last night.  It made me feel like... like less of an asshole.
L279298 +++$+++ u1320 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ You called this morning?
L279297 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ What's happenin'.
L279296 +++$+++ u1320 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Hey.  It's Liz.
L279295 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Rob here.
L279563 +++$+++ u1321 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Right.
L279562 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I'll call you.
L279561 +++$+++ u1321 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ And so it is.  I'll talk to you later.
L279560 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ That way.
L279559 +++$+++ u1321 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ That way.  You?
L279558 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Which way are you going?
L279555 +++$+++ u1321 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ God, you ask a lot of questions.
L279554 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Would you like me to turn the lights out?  Or would you like them on?
L279552 +++$+++ u1321 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Good.
L279551 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Yeah.
L279550 +++$+++ u1321 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ So you'll stay?
L279549 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
L279548 +++$+++ u1321 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.
L279547 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Oh, right.  Alright.
L279546 +++$+++ u1321 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ I'd like it if you could stay the night.
L279545 +++$+++ u1321 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ When I said before that I hoped it wasn't the end of the evening, I was, you know... talking about breakfast and stuff.
L279544 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I'd better go.  I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'.
L279543 +++$+++ u1321 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees Rob, standing and holding his jacket.
L279542 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Whiskey.
L279541 +++$+++ u1321 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Good.  In that case, I'll fix us something else to drink.  You sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee?
L279540 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I'm sure it isn't.
L279539 +++$+++ u1321 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ For now.  But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening.
L279538 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Yes.  You?
L279537 +++$+++ u1321 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Are you okay?
L279535 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Nor have you!
L279534 +++$+++ u1321 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ You haven't even seen it!
L279533 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Exactly!  Fucking ex-actly!
L279532 +++$+++ u1321 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ The Conformist.
L279531 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Yeah, but you know what's his best film and nobody's even seen it?
L279530 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Books, records, films -- these things matter.  Call me shallow but it's the damn truth, and by this measure I was having one of the best dates of my life.
L279529 +++$+++ u1321 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Yeah, I know the Crumblers!  I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it.  My everything changed for a couple of weeks.
L279528 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.
L279527 +++$+++ u1321 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --
L279526 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Awhile back, Dick and Barry and I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like...
L279525 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I understand completely.
L279524 +++$+++ u1321 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  I'm way to unattached for that.
L279523 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ You share a place with T-Bone?
L279522 +++$+++ u1321 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Yup.
L279521 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Is that why you came to Chicago in the first place?  Because of, you know, dividing up your record collection and stuff?
L279520 +++$+++ u1321 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Thank you.
L279519 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ It's a great song.
L279518 +++$+++ u1321 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ God, I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before I came here.  You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play?  That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.
L279517 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ She just wanted to pick up some stuff. No big thing.  A relief, actually.
L279516 +++$+++ u1321 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Everything go alright?
L279515 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Hi, Marie.
L279310 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ No, no, I love, it's just, thinking you're, you must be so sick of it... Well.
L279309 +++$+++ u1321 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Don't you like that?
L279281 +++$+++ u1321 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Yup.  Not far from here, actually.
L279280 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ So you live in Chicago now?
L279279 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Good.
L279278 +++$+++ u1321 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Good.  'Cause I'm enjoying myself.
L279253 +++$+++ u1322 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Well I don't know what happens now, apart from you meet someone, you move in, she goes.  You meet someone, you move in, she goes.
L279252 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Mom!  For the last fucking time, I'm telling you Laura didn't want to get married!  She is not that kind of girl!  To use a phrase.  That's not what happens now.
L279251 +++$+++ u1322 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ So you say.  I'd like to hear her side of it.
L279250 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.
L279249 +++$+++ u1322 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ What did Laura say?  Do you know why she left?
L279248 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Then what are you getting so upset about?
L279247 +++$+++ u1322 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ I knew this was going to happen.
L279246 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out.
L279245 +++$+++ u1322 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ And after that?
L279244 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed.  Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.
L279243 +++$+++ u1322 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ I knew this would happen.  What are you going to do Rob?
L279242 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?
L279241 +++$+++ u1322 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ You know that's not what's upsetting me.
L279240 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you.
L279239 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Hello?  Anybody there?
L279237 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ She just called.  She doesn't even know.  It's probably the last time I'll ever hear her voice.  That's weird, isn't it?  You spend Christmas at somebody's house, you know, and you worry about their operations and you see them in their bathrobe, and... I dunno...
L279236 +++$+++ u1322 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Well call her mother.
L279235 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ How would I know?  Gone.  Girlfriend. Leave.  Not say where gone.  Laura move out.
L279234 +++$+++ u1322 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ What do you mean?  Where did she go?
L279233 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ She left.  She's gone.
L279232 +++$+++ u1322 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Your lucky Laura's doing so well. If it wasn't for her, I don't think either of us would ever sleep...
L279231 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ So so.  Up and down.
L279230 +++$+++ u1322 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ How's the store?
L279229 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Great.  Super-fantastic.
L279228 +++$+++ u1322 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Everything all right?
L279227 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Hi, Mom.
L279226 +++$+++ u1322 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ MOM +++$+++ Hi, Rob.  It's your mother.
L279225 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Yeah?
L279361 +++$+++ u1325 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Okay.  Because you took the trouble to come up here.  And because you've got principles.  But that's it.  I'm not selling them to you one by one.
L279360 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Oh, come on!  Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care.
L279359 +++$+++ u1325 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Sure.  Ten cents.
L279358 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Can I buy this Otis Redding single off you?
L279357 +++$+++ u1325 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Fine.
L279356 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.
L279355 +++$+++ u1325 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ With eleven hundred he could come home, and that's the last thing I want.
L279354 +++$+++ u1325 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ And I won't take a penny over ninety.
L279353 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest offer.
L279352 +++$+++ u1325 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Seventy-five.
L279351 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Thirteen hundred.
L279350 +++$+++ u1325 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Sixty.
L279349 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen-hundred?  They're worth five times that.
L279348 +++$+++ u1325 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Suit yourself.  There are plenty of others who will.
L279347 +++$+++ u1323 +++$+++ m88 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Look... I... I'm sorry.  I don't want to be any part of this.
