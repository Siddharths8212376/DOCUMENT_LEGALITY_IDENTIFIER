L130373 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ How do they do that?
L130372 +++$+++ u4474 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ No. The albacore. It's a fish. My grandson's a member and they take very nice care of us.
L130371 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ The apple core?
L130370 +++$+++ u4474 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ The apple core club.
L130369 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Where did you get this material?
L130368 +++$+++ u4474 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Thank you...
L130367 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ That's just lovely.
L130366 +++$+++ u4474 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Not anymore. Oh, some time ago, my late husband owned a good deal of beach property in Long Beach, but we lost it.
L130365 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Well you own a lot of land.
L130364 +++$+++ u4474 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ I'm not.
L130363 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Did you know that you're a very wealthy woman?
L130362 +++$+++ u4474 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Why?
L130361 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ I've been wanting to meet you.
L130360 +++$+++ u4474 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EMMA +++$+++ Yes.
L130764 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ Jake, you're very disturbed. You're crazy. That's her father.
L130763 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Get him away from her. He's responsible for everything. Get him away from her!
L130762 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ An accident?
L130761 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ Take it easy, take it easy, it was an accident.
L130760 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Who is he, get his name? I'll kill him.
L130755 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ Gittes, stay outta this.
L130754 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Lou, she will kill you. Let her go for now. You don't know.
L130753 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ I'm sorry, Mrs. Mulwray.
L130752 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.
L130751 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law. It's a felony.
L130750 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later.
L130749 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ Mrs. Mulwray, you don't want to run around like that.
L130665 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Gee, thanks, Lou.
L130664 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ Give you three minutes.
L130663 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ I guess not.
L130662 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ You never learn, do you, Gittes?
L130660 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Do me a favor, will you, Lou?
L130659 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ Well, let's go.
L130658 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Yeah.
L130657 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ That's it?
L130656 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ Tell us about it on the way to Pedro.
L130655 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.
L130654 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ If she's not there, you're going downtown, and you're staying there til she shows up.
L130653 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ What for?
L130652 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ No, Gittes, you'll show us.
L130651 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ She lives in Pedro. I'll write it down for you.
L130650 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ What's the maid's address?
L130649 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Her maid's house. I think she knows something's up.
L130648 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ Where?
L130647 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Matter of fact I do.
L130646 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ I don't suppose you got any idea Where she went?
L130544 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ Shut up.  Go on.
L130543 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ I know what he says.
L130538 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ They only dump the water at night.
L130537 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ Too late for what?
L130536 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ It's too late.
L130534 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ C'mon I'll show you.
L130533 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L130532 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ He found out somebody was dumping water there. That's what they were trying to cover up by moving him.
L130531 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ And why's that?
L130530 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Mulwray was murdered and moved because somebody didn't want his body found in the ocean.
L130529 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Why do you think Mulwray's body was moved you dimwit? Evelyn Mulwray knocked off her husband in the ocean and thought it would look like more of an accident if she hauled him up to the Oak Pass Reservoir?
L130528 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ I want those photographs, Gittes. We're talking about accessory after the fact, conspiracy, and extortion. Minimum.
L130527 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Well, I hope she wasn't too much of a disappointment to you, Lou.
L130526 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ Yeah, I once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest. That's where she drew the line.
L130525 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ I don't think I need a day or two. You're even dumber than you think I think you are. Not only that, I'd never extort a nickel out of my worst enemy, that's where I draw the line, Escobar.
L130524 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ Absolutely.
L130523 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ You accusing me of extortion?
L130522 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ You were following him night and day. You saw who killed him. You even took pictures of it. It was Evelyn Mulwray. She's been paying you off like a slot machine ever since her husband died.
L130521 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ C'mon, you think you're dealing with a bunch of assholes? Mulwray had salt water in his goddam lungs! Now how did he get that... in a fresh water reservoir?
L130520 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ I heard it was an accident.
L130519 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake down Mulwray, she hired you, and that's how you happen to know Mulwray was murdered.
L130518 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Yeah?
L130517 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ This broad hired you, Gittes, not Evelyn Mulwray.
L130516 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ What pictures?
L130515 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ I want the rest of the pictures.
L130514 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ I don't think about it one way or the other. But if you want, give me a day or two, and I'll get back to you. Now I'd like to go home.
L130513 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ You really think I'm stupid, don't you, Gittes?
L130511 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ How did she...  ...happen to have them?
L130510 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Yeah, I took 'em. So what?
L130506 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ Just to be on the safe side, we had Loach here give you a ring.
L130505 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often.
L130504 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ Isn't that your number?
L130503 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ Let me show you something.
L130502 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ I don't.
L130501 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ How do you happen to know her?
L130500 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Didn't you call?
L130499 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L129938 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ When I do, you'll hear about it.
L129937 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Oh yeah? Can you think of something to charge me with?
L129936 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ No, he drowned a cousin of mine with about five hundred other people. But they weren't very important, just a bunch of dumb Mexicans living by a dam. Now beat it, Gittes, you don't come out of this smelling like a rose, you know.
L129933 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ You mean that's what you're going to call it.
L129932 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ No. It was an accident.
L129931 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ No?
L129930 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ I don't want it anymore.
L129918 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ No.
L129917 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ Or her name?
L129916 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ No.
L129915 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ You wouldn't happen to know the present whereabouts of the young woman.
L129892 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ You're welcome to try. There he is.
L129891 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ I'd like to talk to him.
L129890 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ Oh yes.
L129889 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?
L129888 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ Who?
L129887 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Looking for someone.
L129886 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?
L129885 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Congratulations.
L129884 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ Since I made Lieutenant.
L129883 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Since when?
L129882 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ You're behind the times, Jake. They've got steam irons now.  And I'm out of Chinatown.
L129879 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ Well, sometimes it takes a while for a man to find himself and I guess you have.
L129878 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ I get by.
L129877 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ You've done well by yourself.
L129876 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Well, to tell you the truth, I lied a little.
L129875 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ How'd you get past the guards?
L129874 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Thanks, Lou.
L129871 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ Yeah, they are.
L129870 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Summer colds are the worst.
L129869 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ I have a cold I can't seem to shake but other than that, I'm fine.
L129868 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ How are you, Lou?
L129867 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ Hello, Jake.
L129920 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ I don't think so, Mrs. Mulwray. Of course you have my deepest sympathy and if we need anymore information, we'll be in touch.
L129919 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Will you need me for anything else, Lieutenant?
L129911 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Well yes.
L129910 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ Mr. Gittes.
L129909 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ A private investigator?
L129908 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ But I thought you'd hired a private investigator.
L129907 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Yes.
L129906 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ A complete surprise?
L129905 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ He... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name.  We quarreled over her... of course. It came as a complete surprise to me.
L129904 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ You and your husband never discussed her?
L129903 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Certainly not!
L129902 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ Do you know where she might be?
L129901 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ No.
L129900 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ Mrs. Mulwray, do you happen to know the name of the young woman in question?
L129899 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ No.
L129898 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
L129897 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ ...Well, it didn't make him happy...
L129895 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ Obviously the fall must have knocked him out.
L129894 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Of course.
L129893 +++$+++ u4475 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ ESCOBAR +++$+++ It looks like he was washed the entire length of the runoff channel. Could he swim?
L130742 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Sure, but I'd like to handle it.
L130741 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ I'm all right.
L130740 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Let me handle that.
L130634 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ He didn't wear bifocals.
L130633 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ How do you know?
L130631 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Okay...
L130630 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ On his day off. Get the exact address.
L130629 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ With us.
L130628 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ ...where does Kyo live?
L130627 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Where can we go?
L130626 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ I'll take care of it.
L130625 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ I have to go home and get my things.
L130624 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ That's worse... Just get out of here. Walk out, leave everything.
L130623 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ How about a plane?
L130622 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ You can't go by train. Escobar'll be looking for you everywhere.
L130621 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Back to Mexico.
L130620 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Yeah... where are you taking her now?
L130618 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ ...so that's why you hate him...
L130617 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Hollis came and took... care of me... after she was born... he said... he took care of her... I couldn't see her... I wanted to but I couldn't... I just want to see her once in a while... take care of her... that's all...  but I don't want her to know... I don't want her to know...
L130616 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ To Mexico...
L130615 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ ...he had a breakdown... the dam broke... my mother died... he became a little boy... I was fifteen... he'd ask me what to eat for breakfast, what clothes to wear!... It happened... then I ran away...
L130612 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ She's my sister and my daughter!
L130611 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ I said I want the truth.
L130607 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ She's my sister.
L130606 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ I said the truth!
L130605 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ She's my daughter.
L130604 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Katherine?... Katherine who?
L130603 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Katherine.
L130602 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ That's good. Now what's her name?
L130600 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Who is she? And don't give me that crap about it being your sister. You don't have a sister.
L130599 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ ...no...
L130598 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Stop it!  I'll make it easy. You were jealous, you fought, he fell, hit his head. It was an accident, but his girl is a witness. You've had to pay her off. You don't have the stomach to harm her, but you've got the money to shut her up. Yes or no?
L130597 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about. This is the most insane... the craziest thing I ever...
L130596 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license.
L130595 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ What are you saying?
L130594 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Yes positively. That's where he was drowned...
L130593 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ I don't know. I mean yes, probably.
L130592 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ I found these in your backyard... in your fish pond. They belonged to your husband, didn't they?... didn't they?
L130591 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ What the hell is this all about?
L130590 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ Don't worry. I can recommend a couple. They're expensive but you can afford it.
L130589 +++$+++ u4476 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ No...
L130588 +++$+++ u4477 +++$+++ m296 +++$+++ GITTES +++$+++ You know any good criminal lawyers?
