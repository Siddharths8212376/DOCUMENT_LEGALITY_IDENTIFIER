L282156 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ I don't know why.
L282155 +++$+++ u1349 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ ROMIREZ +++$+++ You feel you know me.
L282154 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ It is less.
L282153 +++$+++ u1349 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ ROMIREZ +++$+++ Does it change with me in the room?
L282152 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ Yes.  Always.
L282151 +++$+++ u1349 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ ROMIREZ +++$+++ Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
L282150 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ You are the same?
L282149 +++$+++ u1349 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ ROMIREZ +++$+++ When I was a boy a cart driven by a drunken fool crushed me.  All thought I would die or be maimed for life.  But I healed quickly. And like you I paid the price for being different.
L282147 +++$+++ u1349 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ ROMIREZ +++$+++ It was time for our paths to cross.
L282146 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ You know me home.  Me name.
L282145 +++$+++ u1349 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ ROMIREZ +++$+++ In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth.
L282144 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ You're a long way from Inverness.
L282143 +++$+++ u1349 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ ROMIREZ +++$+++ I was sent by his majesty of Spain to Inverness as a con- sultant on matters of metal.
L282142 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ Why are you here?
L282141 +++$+++ u1349 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ ROMIREZ +++$+++ You Scots have a way with game.  It still has life in it. Spirit.  Back home the food is so...domestic.
L282140 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ Pheasant.
L282139 +++$+++ u1349 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ ROMIREZ +++$+++ Hmm, que rico.  What is it you call this?
L282138 +++$+++ u1349 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ ROMIREZ +++$+++ First food, no?  A good meal makes conversation so much easier.
L282137 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ How can you know this?
L282136 +++$+++ u1349 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ ROMIREZ +++$+++ And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.
L282135 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ I was driven out.
L282134 +++$+++ u1349 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ ROMIREZ +++$+++ I should imagine that your recovery must have alarmed your fellow villagers, perhaps giving them reason to invent an explanation.  And a solution.
L282133 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ Aye.
L282132 +++$+++ u1349 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ ROMIREZ +++$+++ And but for a mark you are well as any man, no?
L282131 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ I did at that.
L282130 +++$+++ u1349 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ ROMIREZ +++$+++ But you lived.
L282129 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ I was nearly killed.
L282128 +++$+++ u1349 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ ROMIREZ +++$+++ Your marks would suggest great injury.
L282127 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ Five years past me clan fought another over some- thing I cannot even re- member.
L282126 +++$+++ u1349 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ ROMIREZ +++$+++ Your back, it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle?
L282125 +++$+++ u1349 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ ROMIREZ +++$+++ Please go to no trouble.
L282124 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ I haven't much to offer, Mr. Romirez from Spain, but you're welcome to what's here.
L282123 +++$+++ u1349 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ ROMIREZ +++$+++ I am from Spain.  And I would like a moment of your time.
L282122 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ You're not from these parts.
L282121 +++$+++ u1349 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ ROMIREZ +++$+++ Juan Cid Romirez.  Chief surveyor and alchemist.
L282120 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ Aye.
L282119 +++$+++ u1349 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ ROMIREZ +++$+++ Your name is Conor?
L282118 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ Afternoon.
L281943 +++$+++ u1344 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ Do what you must.
L281942 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ If you send me away now, Mara, I'll not come looking for you.
L281941 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ You're not talking sense, Mara!
L281940 +++$+++ u1344 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ Leave me alone, Conor.  Please.
L281939 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ I'll not take that kind of talk from you.  From those others below, maybe.  But not from you.
L281938 +++$+++ u1344 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ Please not be touching me, Conor.
L281936 +++$+++ u1344 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ Me father has taken back my hand.
L281935 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ You're sounding like that mad woman, Widow Baggins.
L281934 +++$+++ u1344 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ I don't know, Conor.  It's not natural.  Maybe something has touched you.
L281933 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ That's mad.  Surely you don't take their word?
L281932 +++$+++ u1344 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.
L281931 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ Who?
L281930 +++$+++ u1344 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ Some think not.
L281929 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ So why the crazy talk?  It's a miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has smiled on me.  On us.
L281928 +++$+++ u1344 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
L281927 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ But I did live.
L281926 +++$+++ u1344 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ You cannot be real, Conor.  You had the last rites.  No man has been cut half as bad and lived.
L281925 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ What are you saying?  I'm standing here as real as you.
L281924 +++$+++ u1344 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ My future husband died in battle against the Sutherlands.
L281923 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ I don't understand.  Not a week ago your father gave us his blessing.
L281922 +++$+++ u1344 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MARA +++$+++ I have no future husband.
L281921 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ I'm your future husband, remember?
L282549 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ Do you have cause to bothering us?
L282548 +++$+++ u1337 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KATHERINE +++$+++ David.
L282546 +++$+++ u1337 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KATHERINE +++$+++ Kiss me.
L282545 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ Far away.
L282544 +++$+++ u1337 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KATHERINE +++$+++ That's wonderful.  Where did you ever learn it?
L282543 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ Like you.
L282542 +++$+++ u1337 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KATHERINE +++$+++ Something pretty.
L282541 +++$+++ u1327 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ CONOR +++$+++ What would you like?
L282540 +++$+++ u1337 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KATHERINE +++$+++ Oh please.  Another one.
L282502 +++$+++ u1330 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ So sure?
L282501 +++$+++ u1339 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KNIGHT +++$+++ Our common heritage.  I am your only real friend, you know.  The only one who truly understands you.  I look forward to the day we meet again.  And I kill you.
L282500 +++$+++ u1330 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ Finish yours?
L282499 +++$+++ u1339 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KNIGHT +++$+++ Finish your prayers?
L282498 +++$+++ u1339 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KNIGHT +++$+++ Romirez is dust.
L282497 +++$+++ u1330 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ Romirez understood.  Not you.
L282496 +++$+++ u1339 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KNIGHT +++$+++ I know you very well, Conor MacLeod. And I can see the truth beginning to make itself clear to you.  Mulet, Romirez, they were fools without vision.  It was destined that the board would be cleared for the real players.
L282495 +++$+++ u1330 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ You're wrong.
L282494 +++$+++ u1339 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KNIGHT +++$+++ You surprise me.  Eliminating a rival like that.  Such are the actions of a man of conquest.  I was mistaken.  300 years have turned the boy's fear into ambit- ion.
L282493 +++$+++ u1330 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ No doubt.
L282492 +++$+++ u1339 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KNIGHT +++$+++ Perhaps not.  You seem to have misplaced a private.  No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck.
L282491 +++$+++ u1330 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ Not so scared.
L282489 +++$+++ u1339 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KNIGHT +++$+++ It's all we have.
L282488 +++$+++ u1330 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ Tradition.
L282487 +++$+++ u1339 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KNIGHT +++$+++ State of grace and all that.
L282485 +++$+++ u1339 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KNIGHT +++$+++ Certainly not me.
L282484 +++$+++ u1330 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ Who am I deceiving?
L282456 +++$+++ u1330 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ Not likely.
L282455 +++$+++ u1342 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MAJOR +++$+++ Eat up Dupont.  It will probably be your last.
L282454 +++$+++ u1342 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MAJOR +++$+++ Won't get it.  We are a sacrifice.  A diversion.
L282453 +++$+++ u1330 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ We need more time.
L282452 +++$+++ u1342 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MAJOR +++$+++ I doubt much can change that. The enemy has five brigades waiting for us.
L282451 +++$+++ u1330 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ They're nothing but boys.  It will be a slaughter tomorrow.
L282450 +++$+++ u1342 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MAJOR +++$+++ Complete your inspection?
L282483 +++$+++ u1330 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ I had no choice.
L282482 +++$+++ u1348 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MULET +++$+++ You see Major?  You are not so different...
L282479 +++$+++ u1330 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ Either you are with me or against me.
L282478 +++$+++ u1348 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MULET +++$+++ You are really going to force this, aren't you?
L282477 +++$+++ u1330 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ Do not turn your back on me.
L282476 +++$+++ u1348 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MULET +++$+++ Who do you think I am?  One of your freckle faced children waiting to die tomorrow?  "Threaten you"?  You and I just living will always be a threat.  Forever.  Look at your life, Major.  Look at mine.  Nothing there but threat.  Threats and nothingness. It's what we live for.
L282475 +++$+++ u1330 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ Don't threaten me, Private.
L282474 +++$+++ u1348 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MULET +++$+++ Stay out of it.
L282473 +++$+++ u1330 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ We must talk.
L282472 +++$+++ u1348 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MULET +++$+++ It never changes, Major.
L282471 +++$+++ u1330 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ It can be different.  It must be.
L282470 +++$+++ u1348 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MULET +++$+++ Help?  I've seen others "help". Somehow a head always ended up on the counter.
L282469 +++$+++ u1330 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ Then it is time two of us did. You are very young.  I was once young.  I can help.
L282468 +++$+++ u1348 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MULET +++$+++ We have no understanding.
L282467 +++$+++ u1330 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ Wait.  I think we understand each other.
L282466 +++$+++ u1348 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MULET +++$+++ If you wish to play games, Major.
L282465 +++$+++ u1330 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ Equals?
L282464 +++$+++ u1348 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MULET +++$+++ Excuse me, "sir".  I thought we spoke as equals.
L282463 +++$+++ u1330 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ I am a Major, Private.  You would do well remembering that when addressing me.
L282462 +++$+++ u1348 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MULET +++$+++ You seem to understand a great deal.
L282461 +++$+++ u1330 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ I understand you joined up in Bremen.
L282460 +++$+++ u1348 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MULET +++$+++ Second musketeer.
L282459 +++$+++ u1330 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ What is your position?
L282458 +++$+++ u1348 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MULET +++$+++ Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking.
L282457 +++$+++ u1330 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ I thought I gave orders the regiment was to drill.
L282448 +++$+++ u1348 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MULET +++$+++ Mulet.
L282447 +++$+++ u1330 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ DUPONT +++$+++ Your name?
L281835 +++$+++ u1332 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ He's a MacLeod.
L281834 +++$+++ u1346 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ But Ian, he's still but a boy.
L281833 +++$+++ u1332 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Aye.  It is his duty.  All of ours.
L281832 +++$+++ u1346 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Must he go?
L281831 +++$+++ u1332 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Your grandfather wore that in his service to the King, and I to fight for the Duke.
L281829 +++$+++ u1346 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Have you time for some- thing to eat?
L281828 +++$+++ u1332 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Ah, Conor, how you look a man.
L282518 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Yes, he was.
L282517 +++$+++ u1333 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ GRANDSON +++$+++ Your father must be smart.
L282516 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ My father taught me.
L282515 +++$+++ u1333 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ GRANDSON +++$+++ Where did you learn that?
L282514 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Fish are creatures of habit.  They like their food where they're used to it.  At the top, hiding in old leaves.
L282512 +++$+++ u1333 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ GRANDSON +++$+++ Thanks.
L282511 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Here.  The hook should go just below the head, where the meat is toughest.
L282665 +++$+++ u1345 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ No.  I want this to be all ours.
L282664 +++$+++ u1334 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
L282663 +++$+++ u1345 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Round up who you can and put them on standby.
L282662 +++$+++ u1334 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ Won't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon.  Looks good though. They found the receipt in his townhouse.  It was pretty smeared but had Taupin's father listed as a signatory.
L282661 +++$+++ u1345 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Are you sure?
L282428 +++$+++ u1334 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ You'd think he'd had practice.
L282427 +++$+++ u1345 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Should have seen him the first night.  Son of a bitch stood there with a quart of blood on his pant leg and didn't even blink.
L282426 +++$+++ u1334 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ Not yet.  Called FBI yesterday. Thompson's going to try CIA this afternoon.  Y'never know.
L282425 +++$+++ u1345 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Any other I.D.s come up?
L282424 +++$+++ u1334 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ We ran down that Church Hill info. She's right.  There is no Richard Taupin.
L282423 +++$+++ u1345 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ Yeah.
L282422 +++$+++ u1334 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ INSPECTOR +++$+++ Figure she's with him?
L282421 +++$+++ u1345 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ MORAN +++$+++ I want people in here to check over every piece of this stuff.
L282015 +++$+++ u1335 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ INTRUDER +++$+++ We learned he'd found the immigration notaries in Liverpool and traced them to New York.  Then he figured out the birth records in Church Hill...
L282014 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ _Answer_ me.
L282013 +++$+++ u1335 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ INTRUDER +++$+++ None of this would be happening if you hadn't run...
L282012 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ He knows I'm here.  How?
L282011 +++$+++ u1335 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ INTRUDER +++$+++ He got him.  He always does.  Eventually.
L282010 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ And the Bulgarian?
L282009 +++$+++ u1335 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ INTRUDER +++$+++ The last four.
L282008 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ How many came?
L282007 +++$+++ u1335 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ INTRUDER +++$+++ Smith.  Carl Smith.
L282006 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ What name is he using?
L282005 +++$+++ u1335 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ INTRUDER +++$+++ I don't know.
L282004 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Where!
L282258 +++$+++ u1336 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KAHN +++$+++ You don't run as hard, MacLeod. You just don't run as hard anymore.
L282257 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ You're wrong.
L282256 +++$+++ u1336 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KAHN +++$+++ The pressure only comes when you let the taste slip into your mouth.
L282255 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ I've had a few more concerns.
L282254 +++$+++ u1336 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KAHN +++$+++ Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just marking time.  You're marking time.
L282253 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ How do you do it, Kahn?  How do you live so full of life for so long?
L282252 +++$+++ u1336 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KAHN +++$+++ No, seriously.  We used to shoot pool together in Rangoon.
L282251 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ You're insane.
L282250 +++$+++ u1336 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KAHN +++$+++ I knew his great-grandfather.
L282249 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ You were never a kid.
L282248 +++$+++ u1336 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KAHN +++$+++ I love zoos.  Ever since I was a kid.
L282246 +++$+++ u1336 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KAHN +++$+++ -Since you last saw me.
L282245 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ I haven't drunk this much since-
L282244 +++$+++ u1336 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KAHN +++$+++ He always did.
L282243 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ He found us even there.
L282242 +++$+++ u1336 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KAHN +++$+++ Good times then.  A man could stretch his legs without bring- ing half the world down around his ears.  Not like now.
L282241 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Had a great swing with his blade. For a Pope.
L282240 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Offered the Pope one of his whores.
L282239 +++$+++ u1336 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KAHN +++$+++ But then rides up Pope Pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross, climbs off his papal horse, draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on.  And what did Neuvich, dear dear drunken Neuvich do?
L282238 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ Neuvich, the clown of the crusades.
L282237 +++$+++ u1336 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KAHN +++$+++ I'll never forget the look on that Papal commander's face when his "heretic stronghold" turned out to be a rock full of whores climbing all over Neuvich.
L282234 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ It's good to see you, Kahn.
L282233 +++$+++ u1336 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KAHN +++$+++ Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.
L282232 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ And have you something to settle with me?
L282231 +++$+++ u1336 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KAHN +++$+++ It is the gathering, my friend.  The settling of old scores.
L282230 +++$+++ u1351 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ TAUPIN +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L282229 +++$+++ u1336 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KAHN +++$+++ Old habits die hard.  Waitress!  A round of Nitzhic!  Peasant drool, I know.  But it's the closest thing they stock to my side of the fence.
L282228 +++$+++ u1336 +++$+++ m89 +++$+++ KAHN +++$+++ How many places this side of the Atlantic serve lager and lime?
