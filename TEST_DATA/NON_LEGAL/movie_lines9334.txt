L447634 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We just--we want to go home now.
L447631 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ My name's David.
L447630 +++$+++ u2503 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DICK VAN DYKE +++$+++ Oh sure you do ... "McIntire's Department store" ... "Their father dressed as Prince Charming." That was gorgeous Bud.
L447629 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Because we don't belong!
L447628 +++$+++ u2503 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DICK VAN DYKE +++$+++ Why would I do that?
L447619 +++$+++ u2503 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DICK VAN DYKE +++$+++ Shh! Can't talk like that now. You're in ...  You know ...
L447618 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What the hell's going on!
L447617 +++$+++ u2503 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DICK VAN DYKE +++$+++ ... See, every time I thought I'd found someone they'd turn out to disappoint me. They'd know the early episodes, but they wouldn't know the later ones ... They'd know all about Muffin but they wouldn't know about Bud ...
L447588 +++$+++ u2503 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DICK VAN DYKE +++$+++ Oh--couldn't charge you for something like that. It's free.
L447587 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ How much does it cost?
L447585 +++$+++ u2503 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DICK VAN DYKE +++$+++ Sure. Big beautiful set like this--you want something that'll put you right in the show.
L447584 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Ooomph?
L447583 +++$+++ u2503 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DICK VAN DYKE +++$+++ Say--why don't you take this remote instead. It's got a little more "Ooomph" in it.
L447582 +++$+++ u2503 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DICK VAN DYKE +++$+++ That's right.
L447581 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ No. McIntire's. Remember:  "For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's."
L447580 +++$+++ u2503 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DICK VAN DYKE +++$+++ McGinty's.
L447579 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ McIntire's.
L447578 +++$+++ u2503 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DICK VAN DYKE +++$+++ What department store did they go to?
L447577 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Yeah ...
L447574 +++$+++ u2503 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DICK VAN DYKE +++$+++ Nice ... Nice ...
L447573 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ ... Like Prince Charming.
L447572 +++$+++ u2503 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DICK VAN DYKE +++$+++ Right. And how did she dress him?
L447571 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ ... Her father.
L447563 +++$+++ u2503 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DICK VAN DYKE +++$+++ Well that makes it a lucky day for both of us, hunh?
L447562 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You know, we didn't call any TV repair.
L447561 +++$+++ u2503 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DICK VAN DYKE +++$+++ I know how I'd feel if mine went out. Almost like losing a friend.
L447560 +++$+++ u2503 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DICK VAN DYKE +++$+++ We'll get you fixed up in no time.
L447559 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Yeah ... Sort of ...
L447558 +++$+++ u2503 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DICK VAN DYKE +++$+++ Holy cow. Look at that. Had a little disaster didn't ya fella.
L448532 +++$+++ u2509 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ MR. JOHNSON +++$+++ Just a little--You know.
L448531 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ It's beautiful.
L448528 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You're gonna keep painting aren't you?
L448527 +++$+++ u2509 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ MR. JOHNSON +++$+++ Well how do you know it won't go back to the way it was?
L448413 +++$+++ u2509 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ MR. JOHNSON +++$+++ I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't paint anymore Bud. I just don't know what I'd do ...
L448412 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ It's okay. We'll get you a new one.
L448104 +++$+++ u2509 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ MR. JOHNSON +++$+++ No, that's not it.
L448103 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Oh, well--you're just starting out. I mean, you can't do it ...
L448102 +++$+++ u2509 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ MR. JOHNSON +++$+++ I'll never be able to do that.
L448101 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What's wrong?
L448097 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Open it.
L448096 +++$+++ u2509 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ MR. JOHNSON +++$+++ Oh my Gosh, Bud ...
L448095 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ It's an art book.
L448094 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I brought you something ... From the library.
L448093 +++$+++ u2509 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ MR. JOHNSON +++$+++ Aren't you a little early?
L448092 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Hi.
L448091 +++$+++ u2509 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ MR. JOHNSON +++$+++ Oh, hi.
L447929 +++$+++ u2509 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ MR. JOHNSON +++$+++ Oh. Okay. I'll try that then.
L447928 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Yeah.
L447927 +++$+++ u2509 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ MR. JOHNSON +++$+++ Really?
L447926 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I think you should try not to think about this anymore.
L447925 +++$+++ u2509 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ MR. JOHNSON +++$+++ Well don't you?
L447924 +++$+++ u2509 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ MR. JOHNSON +++$+++ Thanks.  But this morning I was thinking about it and I realized that I looked forward to it all year. And then I thought "Gee. That seems awfully silly. That seems like an awfully long time to be waiting for just one moment, don't you think?"
L447923 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Wow ... That's pretty good ...
L447921 +++$+++ u2509 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ MR. JOHNSON +++$+++ Christmastime.
L447920 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ ... What's that?
L447919 +++$+++ u2509 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ MR. JOHNSON +++$+++ You know what I really like?
L447918 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ So they can have their hamburgers!
L447917 +++$+++ u2509 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ MR. JOHNSON +++$+++ Why?
L447916 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Look, you can't always like what you do. Sometimes you just do it because it's your job. And even if you don't like it, you just gotta do it anyway.
L447915 +++$+++ u2509 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ MR. JOHNSON +++$+++ Oh ... Okay.  ... But I really liked it.
L447914 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Forget about that!
L447913 +++$+++ u2509 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ MR. JOHNSON +++$+++ ... Like the other night, when I closed up by myself. That was different ...
L447912 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Just listen to me ...
L447911 +++$+++ u2509 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ MR. JOHNSON +++$+++ No I know ... I know I do ...  But it's always the same, you know? Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... It never changes. It never gets any better or worse ...
L447910 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What are you talking about! You make hamburgers! That is the point!
L447909 +++$+++ u2509 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ MR. JOHNSON +++$+++ Well ... I'm not sure I see the point anymore.
L447906 +++$+++ u2509 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ MR. JOHNSON +++$+++ Oh--what's the point, Bud?
L447905 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ...
L447904 +++$+++ u2509 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ MR. JOHNSON +++$+++ There aren't any cheeseburgers.
L447903 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Two cheeseburgers, two cherry cokes.
L447857 +++$+++ u2509 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ MR. JOHNSON +++$+++ Well you weren't around this time so I did the whole thing myself.
L447856 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Yeah ...
L447855 +++$+++ u2509 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ MR. JOHNSON +++$+++ You know how when we close up, I close the register, then you lower the shades, then I turn out the lights, then we both lock the doors.
L447854 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Yeah ...
L447853 +++$+++ u2509 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ MR. JOHNSON +++$+++ Bud ...
L447852 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Oh, yeah. Sorry. I'm fine. I just ... Had to get home early.
L447851 +++$+++ u2509 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ MR. JOHNSON +++$+++ Hi there. You took off so quick. I wasn't sure if you were okay.
L447850 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Oh hi!
L447783 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Well you can just put on the lettuce, finish the burger and pretend it was me doing it all along.
L447782 +++$+++ u2509 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ MR. JOHNSON +++$+++ Yes.
L447781 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Have you cooked the burgers?
L447780 +++$+++ u2509 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ MR. JOHNSON +++$+++ ... Yeah.
L447779 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Do you have the lettuce?
L447778 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Listen to me!
L447777 +++$+++ u2509 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ MR. JOHNSON +++$+++ Well, usually I put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ...
L447776 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What?
L447775 +++$+++ u2509 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ MR. JOHNSON +++$+++ There aren't any cheeseburgers.
L447771 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I understand.
L447770 +++$+++ u2509 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ MR. JOHNSON +++$+++ I'm so glad you're here.
L447769 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ You know, if this ever happens again, you can make the fries even if I haven't put out the napkins yet.
L447767 +++$+++ u2509 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ MR. JOHNSON +++$+++ But you didn't come so I kept on wiping.
L447766 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Yeah ...
L447765 +++$+++ u2509 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ MR. JOHNSON +++$+++ Well--I always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then I make the french fries ...
L447764 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ What's wrong?
L447762 +++$+++ u2509 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ MR. JOHNSON +++$+++ Oh.
L447761 +++$+++ u2502 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Sorry ... I had to help my folks and then I couldn't find my hat ...
L447760 +++$+++ u2509 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ MR. JOHNSON +++$+++ Bud?
L447633 +++$+++ u2503 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DICK VAN DYKE +++$+++ You know--this is a pretty strange way of showing your appreciation.
L447632 +++$+++ u2506 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Oh GOD ...
L447624 +++$+++ u2503 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DICK VAN DYKE +++$+++ Well, you don't have to worry about that anymore.
L447623 +++$+++ u2506 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ This isn't funny! I happen to have a very important date in like five minutes!
L447622 +++$+++ u2503 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DICK VAN DYKE +++$+++ Dream come true, hunh?
L447616 +++$+++ u2503 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DICK VAN DYKE +++$+++ A miracle.
L447615 +++$+++ u2506 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ What happened?
L447614 +++$+++ u2503 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DICK VAN DYKE +++$+++ Told you it was your lucky day. Bet you thought I was just a fan or something.
L447590 +++$+++ u2503 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DICK VAN DYKE +++$+++ Oh sure. Big fan like yourself. It's the least I could do.
L447589 +++$+++ u2506 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Free?
L447576 +++$+++ u2503 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DICK VAN DYKE +++$+++ Remember the one where Bud lost his cousin when he was s'posed to be watching him?
L447575 +++$+++ u2506 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Um--hello? I've got like a social emergency here.
L447570 +++$+++ u2503 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DICK VAN DYKE +++$+++ Hey--who did Muff in take to the masquerade ball when her date came down with the measles?
L447569 +++$+++ u2506 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty.
L447568 +++$+++ u2503 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DICK VAN DYKE +++$+++ Gosh, I loved that show. Watched it for years.
L447565 +++$+++ u2503 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DICK VAN DYKE +++$+++ What's the rush?
L447564 +++$+++ u2506 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ You think you could do this like soon? It's almost six thirty.
L447557 +++$+++ u2503 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ DICK VAN DYKE +++$+++ Well here I am.
L447556 +++$+++ u2506 +++$+++ m162 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Yeah ...

L454746 +++$+++ u2517 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Well it's just not true. We wouldn't be looking at you -- why are you wearing this suit? Did you say hello to your brother in law's?
L454745 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ No, no, no.
L454744 +++$+++ u2517 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Did you think that we'd all be looking at you?
L454638 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Ok, bye-bye.
L454637 +++$+++ u2517 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Fine. You get back to chatting with your precious customers.
L454636 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Yes, I'll be there.
L454635 +++$+++ u2517 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You just fucking said "chat," that is so -- what are you now? "chat." I'm just calling to make sure you show up at this party tonight.
L454634 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Well, I can't talk though --
L454633 +++$+++ u2517 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ "chat?" Did you just say "chat?"
L454632 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ I have a few people here, I can't really chat right now.
L454631 +++$+++ u2517 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ So you can't talk to me?
L454630 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ I'm just working....I have some customers here.....
L454629 +++$+++ u2517 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Yeah but what are you doing?
L454628 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Hello, Karen. I'm just working.
L454627 +++$+++ u2517 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Hey it's me, what are you doing?
L454626 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ This is Barry.
L455475 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ D&D Mattress Man.
L455474 +++$+++ u2523 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ OPERATOR +++$+++ What's the listing?
L455473 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Somewhere in Utah.
L455472 +++$+++ u2523 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ OPERATOR +++$+++ What city?
L454561 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Ok. Thank you.
L454560 +++$+++ u2523 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ OPERATOR +++$+++ It's extension 215 if you want to try me back.
L454557 +++$+++ u2523 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ OPERATOR +++$+++ I don't know...I mean: I don't know.
L454556 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Do you realize that the monetary value of this promotion and the prize is potentially worth more than the purchases?
L454555 +++$+++ u2523 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ OPERATOR +++$+++ That's it.
L454554 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ So, just to clarify, I'm sorry: Ten purchases of any of your Healthy Choice products equals five hundred miles and then with the coupon the same purchases would value one thousand miles --
L454553 +++$+++ u2523 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ OPERATOR +++$+++ I think that's a type-o then, that would be a mistake.
L454552 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ It's hard to understand because it says in addition to but I can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too...
L454551 +++$+++ u2523 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ OPERATOR +++$+++ This is "Fly With Us?"
L454550 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ I'm looking at your advertisement for the airline promotion and giveaway?
L454549 +++$+++ u2523 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ OPERATOR +++$+++ And what was this?
L454548 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ ...yes I'm still on hold...
L455348 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ -- all I want is the number of where she's staying and that should be god damn good enough, now stop treating me this way, please -- Just Give Me The Number Elizabeth Please Now I think I will kill you if you don't.
L455347 +++$+++ u2516 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ -- what are you talking about, come on --
L455346 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ There is no reason for you to treat me like you do -- you're killing me, you are killing me with the way that you are towards me --
L455345 +++$+++ u2516 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Tell me why.
L455344 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ I just want to know where she's staying.
L455343 +++$+++ u2516 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ What? Tell me why you wanna know --
L455342 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ I....please don't do this.
L455341 +++$+++ u2516 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ No she didn't; that's a lie.
L455340 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ ......she forgot her purse at my work and I wanted to get it back to her.
L455339 +++$+++ u2516 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Oh My God, yeah, I know exactly where she is, why?
L455338 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Do you know where she's staying in Hawaii?
L455337 +++$+++ u2516 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ You're so scared.
L455336 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ ....she didn't, I didn't ask her out?
L455335 +++$+++ u2516 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ What about her? You didn't ask her out, you're such a pussy --
L455334 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Nothing. I'm just at work and I'm wondering, you know your friend Lena?
L455333 +++$+++ u2516 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Hey. What are you doing?
L455045 +++$+++ u2516 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Call me later.
L455044 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Goodbye.
L455040 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ I have no idea.
L455039 +++$+++ u2516 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ Why's it here?
L455038 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ It's not mine.
L455037 +++$+++ u2516 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ What's all this pudding?
L455034 +++$+++ u2516 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ ELIZABETH +++$+++ OH MY GOD. Look at that.
L455033 +++$+++ u2511 +++$+++ m163 +++$+++ BARRY +++$+++ Yeah I can't.
