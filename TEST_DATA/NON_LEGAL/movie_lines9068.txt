L228087 +++$+++ u997 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect, I'm already dead.
L228086 +++$+++ u998 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ You're gonna be okay, aren't you, daddy?
L228039 +++$+++ u998 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ So all we have to do is get by for a few more hours and then we can walk right out the front door.
L228038 +++$+++ u997 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ About two hours from now.
L227642 +++$+++ u998 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Other places have beds, they also have cable TV, a gym, room service...
L227641 +++$+++ u997 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ It has a bed. That's all I care about.
L227640 +++$+++ u998 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ If it doesn't have a pool, we're looking for a new place.
L227639 +++$+++ u997 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.
L227638 +++$+++ u998 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ It's a flop house.
L227637 +++$+++ u997 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ There's nothing wrong with this place.
L227521 +++$+++ u997 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.
L227520 +++$+++ u998 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ What do you think Mom would say?
L227519 +++$+++ u997 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Kate, give your old man a little credit. Every person who chooses the service of God as their life's work has something in common. I don't care if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many, many times during your life you'll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've all done it. I'm not going through a lapse. What I've experienced is closer to awakening. I'm not trying to shake your faith. I've just decided not to devote my life to God anymore.
L227518 +++$+++ u998 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ That happens, you'll get it back.
L227517 +++$+++ u997 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore.
L227516 +++$+++ u998 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?
L227515 +++$+++ u997 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I know this is hard on you kids. After Jenny's death, this is probably the last thing you need. But I can't do it any longer. My congregation needs spiritual leadership. Well, they can't get that from me anymore. My faith is gone. To answer your question, yes, I do believe in Jesus. But do I love them? No. After Jenny died, I just thought, what's the point?
L227514 +++$+++ u998 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ I didn't want to talk about this in front of Scott because he gets upset. But you don't believe in God anymore?
L227513 +++$+++ u997 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ That's very nice of Ted, but I'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting.
L227512 +++$+++ u998 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Dad, when I called the machine to check our messages there was one from Bethel Baptist. Mr. Franklin said he wouldn't permanently replace you until we came back. He said when we come home, if you still feel the same way --
L227510 +++$+++ u998 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Hey, if we go to a motel, we can swim.
L227509 +++$+++ u997 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ I just bet you would. Don't even think about it. Besides, I want to have one night's sleep in an honest- to-goodness bed. The beds in the home are okay, but they're not like a real bed.
L227505 +++$+++ u998 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Ain't it the truth.
L227504 +++$+++ u997 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ JACOB +++$+++ You two ought to start a stand-up act, because you're just wasting your humor on me.
L227503 +++$+++ u998 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ It's the bitterest of pills.
L227768 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ You asked me if I would --
L227767 +++$+++ u998 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ What did I say?
L227766 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ What you said to me in the room.
L227765 +++$+++ u998 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Do what?
L227764 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ In the room. Were you serious, or were you just foolin' around? I'm just bringing it up, 'cause if you really want me to do that for you, I will.
L227763 +++$+++ u998 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ What?
L227708 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Mexicans.
L227707 +++$+++ u998 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ What's in Mexico?
L227706 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Mexico.
L227705 +++$+++ u998 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Where are you taking us?
L227704 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ What?
L227680 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Sure.
L227679 +++$+++ u998 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Richie, will you do me a favor and eat my pussy?
L227673 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ We're having a wet bikini contest, and you just won.
L227672 +++$+++ u998 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ What's going on?
L228160 +++$+++ u998 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Later.
L228159 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ See ya.
L228158 +++$+++ u998 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Me too.
L228157 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L228131 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ You use 'em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you.
L228130 +++$+++ u998 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Should I use the last bullets on us?
L228129 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Well, when you run out of weapons, just start cold cocking 'em. Make 'em sing for their supper.
L228128 +++$+++ u998 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Not many.
L228127 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ How many bullets left, kid?
L228121 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Anytime.
L228120 +++$+++ u998 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Watch my back!
L228076 +++$+++ u998 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Noooo!
L228075 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Daddy's dead.
L228074 +++$+++ u998 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ We have to go back for Daddy!
L228000 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half a chance you'd feed us to them!
L227999 +++$+++ u998 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ I'm really sorry.
L227998 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory.
L227997 +++$+++ u998 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Are you okay?
L227930 +++$+++ u998 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Okay.
L227929 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ How about you, cutie pie? Ready for round two?
L227837 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ In the morning, darlin', in the morning, we are G-O-N-E and you are F-R-E-E. Now, I know I put you guys through hell, and I know I've been one rough pecker, but from here on end you guys are in my cool book. Scotty, help me pick Richie up, and lay him down. Jacob, keep going on this road till you get to a sign that says, "Digayo." When you get to Digayo, turn this big bastard left, go on down for a few miles, then you see a bar called "The Titty Twister." From what I hear, you can't miss it.
L227836 +++$+++ u998 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ You're gonna let us go?
L227756 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Get it and bring it up here, will ya, please?
L227755 +++$+++ u998 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Yeah, we got a bible.
L227754 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ You must have a bible in here, don't cha?
L227753 +++$+++ u998 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Yeah.
L227688 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ You damn well better. Go.
L227687 +++$+++ u998 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Yes.
L227686 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Do you believe me?
L227685 +++$+++ u998 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Yes.
L227684 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ You got three minutes. One second longer, I shoot your father in the face. Do you understand what I just said?
L227649 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ The Sword of Damocles is lifted from above Seth's head. He's just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed unsolvable. He knows exactly how he's going to cross the border. Whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back into room #9.
L227648 +++$+++ u998 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Creepy guy.
L227500 +++$+++ u998 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Feel this, real wood paneling. That's real wood, too, not that fake stuff.
L227499 +++$+++ u1004 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ -- see this, television!
L227498 +++$+++ u998 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ -- you got your shower --
L227497 +++$+++ u1004 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ -- you got your sink --
L227496 +++$+++ u998 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ -- you got your microwave --
L227495 +++$+++ u1004 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SCOTT +++$+++ Why, just look at all this. You got your kitchen --
L227596 +++$+++ u1006 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ STANLEY CHASE +++$+++ I would say that's a very safe assumption.
L227595 +++$+++ u999 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ KELLY HOUGE +++$+++ Is it safe to assume that because the death count involved and the loss of life of law enforcement officers, that the Bureau, the Rangers and the police force are taking this manhunt personally?
L227594 +++$+++ u1006 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ STANLEY CHASE +++$+++ This can't be confirmed at this time, but we do believe it to be true. We have reason to believe it was the youngest brother Richard, and he was shot in the vicinity of his neck and shoulders by the store's clerk.
L227593 +++$+++ u999 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ KELLY HOUGE +++$+++ What about the report from an eyewitness at the liquor store who said one of the brothers was shot?
L227592 +++$+++ u1006 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ STANLEY CHASE +++$+++ We've received no news one way or the other. We can only hope for the best.
L227591 +++$+++ u999 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ KELLY HOUGE +++$+++ Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene, Gloria Hill?
L227590 +++$+++ u1006 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ STANLEY CHASE +++$+++ Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already alerted the Mexican authorities. They intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice.
L227589 +++$+++ u999 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ KELLY HOUGE +++$+++ Agent Chase, does it appear that they are heading for Mexico.
L227588 +++$+++ u1006 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ STANLEY CHASE +++$+++ For the time being we are very confident we will apprehend the fugitives in the next forty-eight hours. The Bureau, local law enforcement and the Texas Rangers have all joined forces in forming a dragnet to snare Seth and Richard Gecko.
L227466 +++$+++ u1001 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Six-fifty.
L227465 +++$+++ u1000 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ MCGRAW +++$+++ Yeah, and I'm gonna be right back at it tomorrow. So tonight I'm gonna sit in front of the box and just drink booze. How much is the bottle?
L227449 +++$+++ u1001 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Knock yourself out.
L227448 +++$+++ u1000 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ MCGRAW +++$+++ They'll probably make a run for the border, which would bring 'em this way. And if we get our hands on those shit asses, we're talking payback time. We'll get 'em all right. I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your commode.
L227447 +++$+++ u1000 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ MCGRAW +++$+++ Four Rangers, three cops, and two civilians. And they took a lady bank teller as a hostage.
L227446 +++$+++ u1001 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?
L227445 +++$+++ u1000 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ MCGRAW +++$+++ What the hell would I do with that grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head. Then all this Abilene shit happened. You heard about that bank robbery in Abilene, didn't ya?
L227444 +++$+++ u1001 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ You could sue the shit out of her, ya know. That kid belongs under a circus tent, not flippin' burgers. You could own that fuckin' place.
L227443 +++$+++ u1000 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ MCGRAW +++$+++ Well, if there ain't there sure oughta be. Who knows what goes on inside Mongoloid's mind?
L227442 +++$+++ u1001 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Isn't there a law or something against retards serving food to the public?
L227441 +++$+++ u1000 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ MCGRAW +++$+++ Awww, it's just been a shitass day. Every inch of it hot and miserable. First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid boy of hers was workin' the grill. That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a blanket like a sick dog by ten thirty.
L227440 +++$+++ u1001 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Whatsamatter?
L227439 +++$+++ u1000 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ MCGRAW +++$+++ Jesus Christ man, that microwave food will kill ya as quick as a bullet. Those burritos are only fit for a hippie high on weed. Pull me down a bottle of Jack Daniels. I'm gettin' tanked tonight.
L227438 +++$+++ u1001 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ I'm by myself today, ate my lunch outta the microwave.
L227437 +++$+++ u1000 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ MCGRAW +++$+++ Not even for lunch?
L227436 +++$+++ u1001 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with the air conditioner blastin' all day long.
L227435 +++$+++ u1000 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ MCGRAW +++$+++ Hot goddamn day!
L227480 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Well that don't matter now, 'cause you got about two fuckin' seconds to live! Richie!
L227479 +++$+++ u1001 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ I never said help us!
L227459 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ You callin' him a liar?
L227458 +++$+++ u1001 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ I wasn't scratching!
L227457 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ He says you were scratching.
L227456 +++$+++ u1001 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ What? Are you kidding? I didn't do anything!
L227455 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Were you giving that pig signals?
L227454 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta here, in his car, and down the road or you can change the name of this place to "Benny's World of Blood."
L227453 +++$+++ u1001 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ He comes in here every day and we bullshit. He's used my toilet a thousand times. If I told him no, he'd know something was up.
L227452 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Letting him use your toilet? No store does that.
L227451 +++$+++ u1001 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ What do you want from me? I did what you said.
L227917 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a table, send over a waitress to take our order.
L227916 +++$+++ u1002 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RAZOR CHARLIE +++$+++ Best in Mexico.
L227900 +++$+++ u1002 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RAZOR CHARLIE +++$+++ This bar is for bikers and truckers only.  You, get out!
L227899 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?
L227898 +++$+++ u1002 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RAZOR CHARLIE +++$+++ This is a private club. You're not welcome.
L227897 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ What dya mean?
L227896 +++$+++ u1002 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RAZOR CHARLIE +++$+++ You can't come in here.
L227895 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Whiskey!
L227968 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Scarred for life, that's how I am!
L227967 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ How are you?
L227957 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Por favor, Senorita. Would you care to join us?
L227956 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Well, then ask her, dumb ass.
L227955 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Yeah.
L227954 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Earth to Richie. Don't you wanna ask your new friend to join us?
L227886 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Well, it is. Just because I'm happy doesn't mean I'm on vacation. You're just not used to seein' me happy, 'cause it's been about fifteen fuckin' years since I been happy. But my shit is forever together.
L227885 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ It don't look together.
L227884 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ My shit is together.
L227883 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ No, you're not. You're sippin' margaritas in El Ray. But we're not in El Ray. We're here -- getting ready to go in there. You're so pleased with yourself about getting into Mexico, you think the job's down. It ain't. Get back on the clock. That's a fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around there for a coupla hours, in all likelihood, we'll get fucked with. So get your shit together, brother.
L227882 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ I'm here with you.
L227881 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Where are you?
L227880 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ What do you mean?
L227879 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Where are you right now?
L227878 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ How?
L227877 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ You're lookin' green.
L227876 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ No, Richie, what do I look like?
L227875 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ You know what you look like?
L227874 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ That's what you look like.
L227873 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ I'm lookin' scared?
L227872 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ That's how you're lookin', Richie.
L227871 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ That's what you think?
L227861 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ It's not a big deal, unless you make it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy, Richie, stop bringing me down with bullshit.
L227860 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.
L227859 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ When we get to El Ray, I'll take care of it.
L227858 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ What dya mean, don't worry about it. Of course I'm gonna worry about it, I can't fuckin' see.
L227857 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses.
L227856 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
L227855 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ They broke when you fell.
L227854 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Far out.  Where are my glasses?
L227853 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Yep. We're heading for the rendezvous right now. We get there, we pound booze till Carlos shows up, he escorts us to El Ray. And then me and you, brother, kick fuckin' back. How ya like them apples?
L227852 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ We are?
L227851 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ We are...  "South of the border down Mexico way."
L227850 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ What?
L227849 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Well, let me tell ya something, gonna clear your head right up. We are officially Mexicans.
L227848 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up.
L227847 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure you're okay?
L227846 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Really?
L227845 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.
L227844 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ I did?
L227843 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ I don't know, you just passed out.
L227842 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Yeah, I think so. What happened?
L227841 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ You okay?
L227816 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Oh, I know, was it possibly when your ass was rotting in jail and I broke it out? Yeah, you're right, that was pretty fuckin' nutty. Not to mention stupid. But you know what? I can fix that right now.
L227815 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ This ain't the time.
L227814 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ I'm curious. What was the nuttiest thing I did?
L227798 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Or what?
L227797 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Keep your voice down.
L227796 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a fuckin' nut, and where I come from, that stops the train on its tracks.
L227795 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ This ain't the time, Richard.
L227794 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ You meant that, but you meant the other, too.
L227793 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay cool.
L227792 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Yes, you did. You said as long as I don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying that I've been acting like a fuckin' nut.
L227791 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ No, I didn't.
L227790 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ You just called me a fuckin' nut.
L227789 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ What?
L227788 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ What does that mean?
L227787 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.
L227786 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ They're gonna search the van.
L227785 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Duly noted. Now, shut up.
L227784 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ I just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea.
L227783 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,
L227782 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ This isn't gonna work.
L227770 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ What?
L227769 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Richard!
L227633 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Yes, Seth, I understand.
L227632 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Yes, Seth, I understand.
L227631 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Yes.
L227630 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Just say yes! Nothing else, just say yes.
L227629 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Seth, if you were me --
L227628 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ This is not me! I am a professional fucking thief. I steal money. You try to stop me, god help you. But I don't kill people I don't have to, and I don't rape women. What you doin' ain't how it's done. Do you understand?
L227627 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ What?
L227626 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Is this my fault? Do you think this is what I am?
L227625 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ It's not your fault, it's her fault!
L227624 +++$+++ u1005 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ SETH +++$+++ Is it me? Is it my fault?
L227623 +++$+++ u1003 +++$+++ m65 +++$+++ RICHARD +++$+++ Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Once you left, she became a whole different person.
