L236192 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ I don't know what else you'd call her. One second she was there, the next she was gone.
L236191 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ What, like some kind of ghost?
L236189 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ No. Someone else. A girl.  I'm not sure she was... real.
L236188 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Not our mystery guest again.
L236187 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ When you found me yesterday, at the pool. I'd seen... something.  Someone.
L236186 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ I don't know, are we?
L236185 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Are we smart enough to avoid that?
L236184 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time.
L236183 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ The what?
L236182 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?
L236181 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ What do you think happened on this boat?
L236180 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Wish I could say the same.
L236179 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Couldn't sleep.
L236178 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Hey.
L236177 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Hey.
L236174 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Doesn't matter.
L236173 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ It's not gonna hold us.
L236127 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Let 'em ask. This ship's legally ours now.
L236126 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ It's a good bet they'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too.
L236113 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ If it was a ship she hit.
L236112 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
L236111 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ But where's the damage?
L236110 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ The page's missing. Then their SOS was real.
L236109 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Collision? With what?
L236108 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ "Their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision. Distress calls have been made."
L236107 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Must not've been the captain's entry. He was probably out of the picture by then.
L236106 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ The same day she supposedly went down.
L236105 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ February first.
L236104 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ "The crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill."
L236097 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ But, who -- ?
L236096 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Smashed it up pretty bad.
L236095 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Somebody took it out of commission last night.
L236094 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ What?
L236093 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ The ah... the radio's out.
L236038 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Only something must've gone wrong.
L236037 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ If they were close enough to shore, they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats.
L236036 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ You're saying they mutinied for the gold?
L236033 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Possibly false. Hence the IMA record of being lost at sea. I don't think mutiny's out of the question here.
L236032 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ They're dead in the water that morning. Four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. And that evening they issue a general SOS.
L236031 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ No. I'll try again later.
L236030 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Same. Any luck?
L236029 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ How's he doing?
L236025 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ I'll call us in. Dodge, see how many signal flares you can scrounge up.  Keep an eye on him.
L236024 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ He needs a doctor.
L236021 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ I don't know. No. Not Greer. Somebody.
L236020 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Greer?
L236019 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Just before I heard him yell there was somebody on the radio.
L235966 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid bird.
L235965 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ You just shoot at something?
L235964 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Epps.
L235963 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Murphy to Epps.
L235958 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Yup.
L235957 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Got your light?
L235954 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ No cowboy shit. Right.
L235953 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ No cowboy shit up there, understand?
L235945 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Dodge, get on that turbine. I don't care if you don't sleep for a week. The sooner you're done, the sooner we can get out of here. How's the food situation?
L235944 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Guess that'd be me. Again.
L235928 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ We don't exactly have the best bargaining position.
L235927 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ So, we find this guy and make a deal with him.
L235915 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ It wasn't you. It was somebody else. There's somebody else aboard.
L235914 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ You sure it wasn't me?
L235913 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Of course I'm sure. I saw him.
L235912 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Are you sure?
L235911 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
L235910 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ What? What the hell're you talking about.
L235909 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ There's somebody else on this boat.
L235908 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ What guy?
L235907 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ The guy. He just came this way.
L235906 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Who?
L235905 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Did you see him?
L235904 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Take it easy, you'll live longer.
L235849 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ For now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this.
L235848 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Why not call for help?
L235825 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Maybe. But there's always somebody whose interest's at stake.
L235824 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Maybe they didn't want it back. Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.
L235762 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Only way to be.
L235761 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ You're more practical than superstitious.
L235760 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ I think we'd be surprised where a drifting ship might wind up with a little wind and the right current.
L235759 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ You think she's sailing without a crew?
L235758 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Nobody knows. There've been a lot of theories, of course. But we'll never really know for sure.
L235757 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ So what did happen?
L235756 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of New York in 1872.  One day she was sighted off the coast of Portugal by a merchant vessel, the Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei Gratia got closer, they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found her completely deserted. The captain, his wife, their daughter, and the entire crew, all gone. The last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble. The table was even set for dinner. And in the nine days after the last entry, she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard.
L235755 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Nope.
L235754 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?
L235752 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Well, suppose she got a little further north than she should have.  Got stuck in the ice. The passengers and crew evacuated. She froze into the ice pack, which moved further north, where it froze in solid. They write it off. Fifty years later, the whole global warming thing happens. The ice melts, she gets loose and floats around til somebody runs into her.
L235751 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Her destination was Halifax, yeah.
L235750 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ She was sailing up north, right?
L235749 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Some charts. A crew manifest.  Looks like her last voyage was January 1953. The question is where the hell's she been since.
L235748 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ What'd you find up there?
L235747 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Yeah. Thanks.
L235746 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Coffee?
L235716 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ They must've scuttled it. Nobody just lets a ship float away.
L235715 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ The law's on our side. If they want to challenge it, let them try.
L235680 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks. At least. Who knows, could be more. Could be a lot more.  What I'm proposing is... we split it four ways.
L235679 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Go on.
L235605 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ It's my pen name.
L235604 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Candy?
L236265 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Fine with me.
L236264 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Nobody's going anywhere with that gold now. Anybody tries to board, we'll know about it.  You can do what you want, Greer. But neither of us is gonna risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that.
L236261 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ All I'm saying is that gold's worth a lot more to us now than it ever was.
L236260 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ You think whoever did this is reasonable?
L236259 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Now hold up just a minute. Let's be reasonable here.
L236258 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Leave it.
L236257 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ What about the gold?
L236254 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Doesn't look like it much matters.
L236253 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ So whoever did this now has our shotgun.
L236252 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Can't find the shotgun.
L236238 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Must've heard something below deck and went down to check it out.
L236237 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ He took the shotgun and a light.
L236172 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ The mooring hasn't come taught.
L236171 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ We're still drifting.
L236168 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Government weather. It's got a transmitter aboard.
L236167 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ A what?
L236166 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ It's a Noaa buoy.
L236135 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Must be a little too the truth, eh Dodge?
L236134 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Shut up.
L236133 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Gettin' a little hot under the collar, I'd say.
L236125 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ The coast guard has our last position. They'll send somebody out soon enough. A ship this size you can't exactly miss.
L236124 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ We ain't exactly in what you'd call your high traffic neighborhood either.
L236120 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Alright. Everybody grab your gear! This' is where we get off!
L236119 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ We're not gonna be able to pump it!
L236092 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ I wish I could tell you. I'd be real interested to know myself.
L236091 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ We heard you scream. Any idea what you might've seen?
L236090 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Oh, man.
L236089 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins.
L236088 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Say what?
L236087 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ You've been out for about a day.
L236086 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging around.
L236085 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ You don't remember?
L236084 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ What happened?
L236072 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Lost my sea legs.
L236071 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ How're you feeling?
L236070 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Drink up then.
L236069 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Never been more thirsty in my life.
L235980 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Maybe.
L235979 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Maybe Epps's mystery man had something to do with it.
L235972 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ And look what happened.
L235971 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Greek citizen. Merchant navy.  Obviously we aren't the first to come across this ship. They probably stumbled across it just like we did.
L235968 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Couldn't have happened much more than a month ago.
L235967 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Ho-ly shit.
L235947 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ We'll have to take it easy then. I don't think we'll find much aboard the ship, but it's probably worth looking around.
L235946 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Pretty low all around.
L235941 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Would you hold on just a minute here, please? Look, there's no reason to panic now. Epps saw somebody. Fine. It's a big boat.  Chances're real good he doesn't even know about the gold. If we stay cool, nobody'll be the wiser.  The gold stays where it is til we're ready to go. Like I said, it'll be a hell of a lot safer there than here.
L235940 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ I say we off-load some of that gold now.
L235937 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Supposing he wants to get bad with us?
L235936 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
L235935 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ I don't know.
L235887 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Moving to Sweden.
L235886 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Greer?
L235880 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Not much at all, I guess. Retire. Live out my golden years and all that.
L235879 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Fifty million four ways. That's twelve million and change a piece.  What you gonna do with your share, skipper?
L235873 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ And get a bunch of fools sniffin' around here?
L235872 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ We could call for help.
L235871 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ What now?
L235853 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Dodge, you gotta get on those repairs.
L235852 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ I heard that.
L235847 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ It's worth the effort. Believe me. Besides we're gonna need her to prove the salvage.
L235846 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Yeah, but we still gotta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to Sitka.
L235843 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ We leave it where it is. Stick to the plan.
L235842 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ So what? We gonna unload the gold and get a move on?
L235823 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Not for fifty million. An ocean liner maybe. But fifty million in gold, they come looking for.
L235822 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ If they thought it was lost at sea, they probably just wrote it off.
L235816 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Ho, baby!
L235815 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million.
L235814 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ How much you figure that's worth, skipper?
L235808 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Guess I must've fallen back to sleep. Where's Epps?
L235807 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ You're up late.
L235806 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Morning.
L235732 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Yeah.
L235731 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Some classy tub in it's day, huh?
L235675 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before.
L235674 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it.
L235669 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ We've done it before.
L235668 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ You mean tow her back? That's a thirty thousand ton ship you're talking about.
L235667 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Whatever the reason, she's adrift and abandoned. We've got every right to salvage her.
L235660 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Sorry.
L235659 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Murphy, goddamit.
L235655 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Besides a little rust, everything's pretty well-preserved.
L235654 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ How's that?
L235653 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ It's funny.
L235641 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Steer to one eight five. Let's check her out.
L235640 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Call the Coastguard?
L235633 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Looks like it's adrift.
L235632 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Too deep to anchor out there.
