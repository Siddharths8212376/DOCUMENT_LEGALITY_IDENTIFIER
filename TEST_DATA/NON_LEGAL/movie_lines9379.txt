L506086 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ He acted bravely out there, Hannah. Just bad luck his getting hit. Could have been any one of us.
L506148 +++$+++ u2757 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ I'm worried what he's going to do when he finds out you boys are back.
L506147 +++$+++ u2755 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ J.T. +++$+++ His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.
L506146 +++$+++ u2757 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ It was not -- it was Murdo's. Those McKendricks don't know how to act like human beings.
L506143 +++$+++ u2757 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Why, J.T., watch what you're saying around Augie. Emmett didn't kill anybody.
L506142 +++$+++ u2755 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ J.T. +++$+++ The problem is, Emmett, you killed the wrong McKendrick.
L506141 +++$+++ u2757 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ Augie's going to grow up here. There's nothing wrong with the land, it's just some of the people.
L506135 +++$+++ u2755 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ J.T. +++$+++ Half the gunslingers that drift into town turn up on our police force.
L506134 +++$+++ u2757 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ KATE +++$+++ J.T.'s done everything he can. I married a brave man. Augie, take that delightful gift your uncle gave you out of here while we're talking.  McKendrick picked the new sheriff himself, so J.T. can't even get the law enforced.
L506538 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ Let's get out of here.
L506537 +++$+++ u2756 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ New record.
L506272 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ I don't want you getting anyone in my place.
L506271 +++$+++ u2756 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ What's the matter, Paden? You afraid I couldn't get those two behind me?
L506270 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ That's what you said in Turley. You remember how that ended.
L506269 +++$+++ u2756 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ All I did was kiss the girl.
L506268 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ Get out of here, Jake.
L506032 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ Oh, a guy who got run out of town...
L506031 +++$+++ u2756 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Who is he?
L506030 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ He is now.
L506029 +++$+++ u2756 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ This a friend of yours?
L506016 +++$+++ u2756 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ He'll be here.
L506015 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ Where's your brother?
L506014 +++$+++ u2756 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ We wait.
L506013 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ What now?
L506012 +++$+++ u2756 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ That's the longest I ever did it. 'Bout bust a gut.
L505999 +++$+++ u2756 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Blind Pete taught me a great trick.
L505998 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ We didn't get that far.
L505997 +++$+++ u2756 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Didn't he tell you about Blind Pete?
L505994 +++$+++ u2756 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Right!
L505993 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ The other guy drew first.
L505992 +++$+++ u2756 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Yeah, that's what happened with me too.
L505991 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ I've got no reason to run. It was a fair fight and there were plenty of witnesses.
L505990 +++$+++ u2756 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.
L505989 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.
L505988 +++$+++ u2756 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You mean you ain't coming with Emmett and me?
L506231 +++$+++ u2765 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ SHERIFF COBB +++$+++ Really?
L506230 +++$+++ u2758 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ You can't do this.
L506229 +++$+++ u2765 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ SHERIFF COBB +++$+++ I'm done talking. Get out.
L506228 +++$+++ u2758 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L506227 +++$+++ u2765 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ SHERIFF COBB +++$+++ We're going to make some adjustments. I wanted you to be here when I offered Paden your job. I think he could do it without getting greedy. Stella and I are tired of you skimming our profits.
L506226 +++$+++ u2758 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ You wanted to see me?
L506198 +++$+++ u2765 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ SHERIFF COBB +++$+++ Give the man a line of credit. He already owes the house thirteen bucks.
L506197 +++$+++ u2758 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ KELLY +++$+++ Howdy.
L506196 +++$+++ u2765 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ SHERIFF COBB +++$+++ Kelly, get over here.  You didn't come all this way just to pay me back that money, did you?  Kelly, meet my friend Paden.
L505926 +++$+++ u2759 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ LANGSTON +++$+++ I decide what's right in this jurisdiction. Now move.
L505925 +++$+++ u2760 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ MAL +++$+++ That ain't right.
L505924 +++$+++ u2759 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ LANGSTON +++$+++ You misunderstand. I want you out of town. In fact, I want you all the way out of my jurisdiction.
L505923 +++$+++ u2760 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ MAL +++$+++ Is there a place in town that takes... my kind?
L505922 +++$+++ u2759 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ LANGSTON +++$+++ Came to the wrong town. I don't tolerate this kind of thing. It's hard on the peace, and it's hard on the furniture. Now, knowing a bit about Carter here, I'm going to let you go without paying for the damages. But go you will, and I mean now.
L505921 +++$+++ u2760 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ MAL +++$+++ I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess I came to the wrong place.
L505920 +++$+++ u2759 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ LANGSTON +++$+++ There are three strangers in this room, traveller, and these gents you are accusing aren't them.  Are these your friends?
L505928 +++$+++ u2759 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ LANGSTON +++$+++ Don't press your luck, Carter.
L505927 +++$+++ u2763 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PROPRIETOR +++$+++ Who's going to pay for all this, Sheriff?
L505918 +++$+++ u2759 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ LANGSTON +++$+++ Is that a fact?
L505917 +++$+++ u2763 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PROPRIETOR +++$+++ We don't serve them here and you know it. I asked him to leave and he went crazy on us. He owes me money for this damage.
L505916 +++$+++ u2759 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ LANGSTON +++$+++ I don't like that word much, Carter.
L505915 +++$+++ u2763 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PROPRIETOR +++$+++ This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.
L505914 +++$+++ u2759 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ LANGSTON +++$+++ What's all this then?
L505958 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ I was afraid of that.
L505957 +++$+++ u2759 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ LANGSTON +++$+++ Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock.
L505956 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ So this is the guy you're going to hang?
L505955 +++$+++ u2759 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ LANGSTON +++$+++ The jury saw it differently.
L505933 +++$+++ u2759 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ LANGSTON +++$+++ But the good citizens of Turley have taken me in their embrace, and for one simple reason. I maintain the peace. So when strangers come to town, I always ask them their business. Have you come for the hanging?
L505932 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ You're kidding.
L505931 +++$+++ u2759 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ LANGSTON +++$+++ We'll see about that. I'm Sheriff John Langston. As you may have guessed, I am not from these parts.
L505930 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ We'd rather stay.
L505929 +++$+++ u2759 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ LANGSTON +++$+++ Now let's talk about you chaps.
L506421 +++$+++ u2764 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Shut up. You need help, don't you?
L506420 +++$+++ u2760 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ MAL +++$+++ Why him?
L506418 +++$+++ u2764 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Because I'm your sister.
L506417 +++$+++ u2760 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ MAL +++$+++ Why would they stop you?
L506416 +++$+++ u2764 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ What makes you think I could?
L506415 +++$+++ u2760 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ MAL +++$+++ They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through.
L506414 +++$+++ u2764 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ What's stopping you?
L506413 +++$+++ u2760 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ MAL +++$+++ Because you're my sister. There's nobody else.  The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I gotta talk to him.
L506412 +++$+++ u2764 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Why come to me?
L506411 +++$+++ u2760 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ MAL +++$+++ Rae, I need help.
L506410 +++$+++ u2764 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Get out. We have nothing to talk about.
L506295 +++$+++ u2764 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ I don't have any family any more.
L506294 +++$+++ u2760 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ MAL +++$+++ Rae, all we got is each other.
L506293 +++$+++ u2764 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ It's none of your business.
L506292 +++$+++ u2760 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ MAL +++$+++ What are you doing here, Rae? This ain't for you.
L506285 +++$+++ u2764 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Oh that's just fine. Where were you when Ma and Daddy needed you? It's too late, Mal. Now you finally show up and all you can think of is to get yourself killed.
L506284 +++$+++ u2760 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ MAL +++$+++ I'm not sure, but I got an idea. And when I am sure, they're going to pay.
L506283 +++$+++ u2764 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Who did it?
L506282 +++$+++ u2760 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ MAL +++$+++ He was murdered.
L506281 +++$+++ u2760 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ MAL +++$+++ Daddy's dead.
L506280 +++$+++ u2764 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family.
L506279 +++$+++ u2760 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ MAL +++$+++ Hello, Rae.
L506443 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ Where's Emmett now?
L506442 +++$+++ u2760 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ MAL +++$+++ Yeah, it's working out real good.
L506441 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ Lucky.
L506440 +++$+++ u2760 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ MAL +++$+++ I got there just short of too late.
L506438 +++$+++ u2760 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ MAL +++$+++ You don't know?
L506437 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ I heard from Stella you were trying to find Jake. What happened to Emmett?
L506436 +++$+++ u2760 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ MAL +++$+++ Because they enjoy it.
L506435 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ Why are they doing this, Mal?
L506096 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ Good luck, Mal.
L506095 +++$+++ u2760 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ MAL +++$+++ This is it, gents. My ma told me to head south past that rock.
L506353 +++$+++ u2765 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ SHERIFF COBB +++$+++ Did you hear his son is still around?
L506352 +++$+++ u2761 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ MCKENDRICK +++$+++ I heard that too.
L506351 +++$+++ u2765 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ SHERIFF COBB +++$+++ Things are getting messy around here.  I hear Ezra Johnson got himself killed.
L506350 +++$+++ u2761 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ MCKENDRICK +++$+++ We'll handle that. He's careless.
L506349 +++$+++ u2765 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ SHERIFF COBB +++$+++ What about his brother?
L506348 +++$+++ u2761 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ MCKENDRICK +++$+++ He's good, all right. Too good for my men. That's why you've got to take care of it.
L506347 +++$+++ u2765 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ SHERIFF COBB +++$+++ He must be pretty good.
L506565 +++$+++ u2765 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ SHERIFF COBB +++$+++ Good-bye, Paden.
L506564 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ Yeah. Bad luck.  Good-bye, Cobb.
L506563 +++$+++ u2765 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ SHERIFF COBB +++$+++ What a waste. This could have been such a sweet deal for us.
L506483 +++$+++ u2765 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ SHERIFF COBB +++$+++ Not a thing. She's just a mutual friend.  But if you wind up on the wrong side of this, she's going to get hurt.
L506482 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ What's she got to do with it?
L506481 +++$+++ u2765 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ SHERIFF COBB +++$+++ I'm not thinking about your future, Paden. I'm worried about Stella.
L506480 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ Cobb, you've got nothing I need.
L506479 +++$+++ u2765 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ SHERIFF COBB +++$+++ I never could count on you to be reasonable.  Don't force me to make an adjustment around here.
L506478 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ I saw how you're putting Mal Johnson straight.
L506477 +++$+++ u2765 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ SHERIFF COBB +++$+++ You gotta calm down, Paden. Everything will be put straight in a few days.
L506475 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ We didn't talk about this.  They took the little boy, Cobb.
L506474 +++$+++ u2765 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ SHERIFF COBB +++$+++ I thought we talked about that.
L506473 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ Yeah, maybe I will too.
L506472 +++$+++ u2765 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ SHERIFF COBB +++$+++ I'm going to have to look into this.
L506382 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ Don't worry about me. If you're taking on Emmett, the last place I want to be is between you.
L506381 +++$+++ u2765 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ SHERIFF COBB +++$+++ So we understand each other?
L506380 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
L506379 +++$+++ u2765 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ SHERIFF COBB +++$+++ Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
L506378 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ What is it you want from me?
L506377 +++$+++ u2765 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ SHERIFF COBB +++$+++ You know, Paden, what makes all this work is me doing my job. The fellows you came to town with are causing some trouble. It's going to take a little straightening out. I have my responsibilities. I want you to understand. It has nothing to do with us.
L506376 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ Well, thanks, but forget it.
L506375 +++$+++ u2765 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ SHERIFF COBB +++$+++ Easy, boy. Just an idea.
L506373 +++$+++ u2765 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ SHERIFF COBB +++$+++ Maybe you could run it without Stella.
L506372 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ It is that.
L506371 +++$+++ u2765 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ SHERIFF COBB +++$+++ I told you this was a sweet set-up.
L506370 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ This is a lot of money.
L506369 +++$+++ u2765 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ SHERIFF COBB +++$+++ I took out thirteen dollars.
L506235 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ Maybe we ought to ask Stella.
L506234 +++$+++ u2765 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ SHERIFF COBB +++$+++ Nothing like that will happen between us.
L506206 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ You didn't tell me you owned a saloon.
L506205 +++$+++ u2765 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ SHERIFF COBB +++$+++ Good old Paden. I was hoping you'd changed your mind about the job.
L506204 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ Luck, I guess.
L506203 +++$+++ u2765 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ SHERIFF COBB +++$+++ What brings you into my saloon?
L506201 +++$+++ u2765 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ SHERIFF COBB +++$+++ Stella, we still got an extra room out back, don't we?
L506200 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ I just got to town.
L506199 +++$+++ u2765 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ SHERIFF COBB +++$+++ You got a place to stay?
L505861 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ Well I'm real happy for you, Cobb. But I think I'll keep looking for mine.
L505860 +++$+++ u2765 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ SHERIFF COBB +++$+++ This is mighty sweet, Paden. I think I finally found my place in the world.
L505859 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ You're right.
L505858 +++$+++ u2765 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ SHERIFF COBB +++$+++ Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it.
L505857 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ You've got a legitimate job.
L505856 +++$+++ u2765 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ SHERIFF COBB +++$+++ So have I. I've got a legitimate job now. I can use a guy like you.
L505855 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ I've given that up.
L505854 +++$+++ u2765 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ SHERIFF COBB +++$+++ Let's talk about that.  I'm looking for some men.
L505853 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ Appreciate the loan. I'm good for it.
L505852 +++$+++ u2765 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ SHERIFF COBB +++$+++ Where's the dog?
L505851 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ It's been a while.
L505850 +++$+++ u2765 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ SHERIFF COBB +++$+++ I see you're prospering without me.
L505845 +++$+++ u2765 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ SHERIFF COBB +++$+++ Hello, Paden. How ya doing?
L505844 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ Hello, Cobb.
L506513 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ You better get in there with her until this thing is over.
L506512 +++$+++ u2766 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ I've got a place I can hide her.
L506506 +++$+++ u2766 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ He can't hurt me if he's dead.
L506505 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ I don't want you to get hurt.
L506504 +++$+++ u2766 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ How about you?
L506503 +++$+++ u2766 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ I'm ready for that.
L506502 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ I like your attitude. But it can be risky.
L506501 +++$+++ u2766 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Some people think because they're stronger -- or meaner -- they can push you around. I've seen a lot of that. But it's only true if you let it be. The world is what you make of it.
L506494 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ Is that what he said? Well, he figured it okay this time.
L506493 +++$+++ u2766 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Nah!  What's he got? This is a nice saloon, but there are other nice saloons. It's not the money. Not for you. Why can't I get ahold of it?  Cobb says there's no telling what you're going to care about.
L506492 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ You sure? Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.
L506491 +++$+++ u2766 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.
L506490 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ What makes you say that?
L506489 +++$+++ u2766 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Cobb's got something on you, and it must be pretty good.
L506488 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ What do you mean?
L506487 +++$+++ u2766 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ What is it that I can't figure?
L506367 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ He left me.
L506366 +++$+++ u2766 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Where's the dog now?
L506278 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ Give me some of the good stuff.
L506277 +++$+++ u2766 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ You really are a gambler.
L506256 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ Oh, yeah? How good?
L506255 +++$+++ u2766 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ That's the good stuff.
L506254 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ What's this?
L506253 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ I meant, seemed like a lot of whiskey.
L506252 +++$+++ u2766 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ I'm saving lives here. The straight stuff would raise a blood blister on boot leather.
L506251 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ Is this a fair mix?
L506191 +++$+++ u2766 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Here he comes right now.
L506190 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ Who's the owner?
L506189 +++$+++ u2766 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ I don't own this place. The man who does stuck me with Kelly.
L506188 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ Why'd you go into business with him?
L506187 +++$+++ u2766 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Yeah, aside from being a loud-mouthed, lying cheat, he's just the man I would have picked.
L506186 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ So-called?
L506185 +++$+++ u2766 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ That's Kelly, my so-called partner. He runs that side.
L506184 +++$+++ u2766 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ You see that fellow over there in the gray coat?
L506183 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ You wouldn't be needing any help around here, would you? Maybe with the gambling?
L506182 +++$+++ u2766 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Me too. What's wrong with us?
L506181 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ It's the only place I'm happy.
L506180 +++$+++ u2766 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ You like a good saloon?
L506179 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ And I know what I'm talking about.
L506178 +++$+++ u2766 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ Thanks. That's what I call it too.
L506177 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ My compliments to you, Miss Stella. This is what I call a saloon.
L506176 +++$+++ u2766 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ STELLA +++$+++ I am. I'm always there, but I only shine at night.
L506175 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ Stella... Are you the midnight star herself?
L506174 +++$+++ u2762 +++$+++ m180 +++$+++ PADEN +++$+++ Paden.
