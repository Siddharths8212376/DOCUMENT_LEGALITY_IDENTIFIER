L368848 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ Hi, Linda. ..
L368847 +++$+++ u6483 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRADUATE STUDENT +++$+++ Linda King's desk.
L368919 +++$+++ u6498 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Goodbye.
L368918 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I don't want to do that,
L368917 +++$+++ u6498 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Describe exactly what you think he did to Mrs. Leeds and I'll tell you if you're right or not.
L368916 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ He's white and six feet tall. You haven't told me anything yet.
L368915 +++$+++ u6498 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ That's true.
L368914 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ He's very strong physically.
L368913 +++$+++ u6498 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Cut the general crap.
L368912 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ He's misunderstood.
L368911 +++$+++ u6498 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Most people are.
L368910 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ He's right-handed.
L368909 +++$+++ u6498 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ I don't think I'll tell you.
L368908 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Let's get straight who we've talking about.  Are you the man I'm interested in?
L368907 +++$+++ u6498 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ You tell me what you know about him. I'll tell you whether you're right or not.
L368906 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Talk to them a few minutes and you can tell they don't have the capacity to even understand what's going on. Do you?
L368905 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I get a lot of calls. Most of them are from people who say they know things.
L368904 +++$+++ u6498 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Why do you think I called?
L368903 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Do you know something about that?
L368902 +++$+++ u6498 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Atlanta and Birmingham.
L368901 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I don't understand.
L368900 +++$+++ u6498 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ No. I can help you.
L368899 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ This is Will Graham. Can I help you?
L368693 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Did the Jacobis in Birmingham have a dog?
L368692 +++$+++ u6496 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ SPRINGFIELD +++$+++ No.
L368691 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it?
L368690 +++$+++ u6496 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ SPRINGFIELD +++$+++ It's at the vet's. The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen. icepick or an awl.
L368689 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ What about the dog?
L368688 +++$+++ u6496 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ SPRINGFIELD +++$+++ I understand he cut you pretty good...
L368687 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I call him a monster.
L368686 +++$+++ u6496 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ SPRINGFIELD +++$+++ To yourself...
L368685 +++$+++ u6496 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ SPRINGFIELD +++$+++ What would you call him?
L368684 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.
L368683 +++$+++ u6496 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ SPRINGFIELD +++$+++ What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
L368682 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver.
L368681 +++$+++ u6496 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ SPRINGFIELD +++$+++ What happened to them?
L368680 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.
L368679 +++$+++ u6496 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ SPRINGFIELD +++$+++ The Commissioner was saying you were the one that caught Dr. Lecktor three years ago.  He killed nine people, didn't he?
L368675 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Sex murder: three. He likes to bite. Six bad ones in Mrs. Leeds.  Eight in Mrs. Jacobi...  ...that's all I have.
L368674 +++$+++ u6496 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ SPRINGFIELD +++$+++ What's average?
L368673 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ That's all we know about.  Most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center. A suck mark. These don't. So, for him, biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior.  You could try emergency room personnel, treatment for bite wounds. I know that's pretty thin...  He bites a lot.
L368672 +++$+++ u6496 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ SPRINGFIELD +++$+++ He only bit women so far, right?
L368671 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ He may have a history of biting -- barroom fights or child abuse.
L368666 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy.  Everybody else was dead.
L368665 +++$+++ u6496 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ SPRINGFIELD +++$+++ 'Intimate? !"
L368664 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman. I'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you?
L368663 +++$+++ u6496 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ SPRINGFIELD +++$+++ Why do you think he took his gloves off?
L368662 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ The report didn't mention nails and eyes.
L368661 +++$+++ u6496 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ SPRINGFIELD +++$+++ Our people swear he wore surgeons' gloves the whole time. They dusted everything.
L369533 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ You got a deal...
L369532 +++$+++ u6490 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Let's forget who said what to whom...
L369516 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Yeah. That's great. A little time.  I tell you what, buckaroo...  See you around.
L369515 +++$+++ u6490 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Maybe we should give it some time...
L369514 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Okay. They're full of shit and they make me sick...
L369513 +++$+++ u6490 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ That's not true.
L369512 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ They don't want me up there. Every time they look at me I remind them... If they thought about it, they'd want you. Bur all they really want's the boy. And they'll take you.  But they don't want to see me...
L369511 +++$+++ u6490 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Will?  You could come up here.
L369510 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Small difference: I'm not dead, yet.
L369509 +++$+++ u6490 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ I came up here after Kevin's father died.  They were very supportive and helped me adjust. I got myself together. I've gotten myself together now, too.
L369508 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ What's the problem, Molly?
L369507 +++$+++ u6490 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ It's what Kevin called her when he was little...
L369506 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ What's this Mama shit?
L369505 +++$+++ u6490 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Will, they never get to see Kevin and a few more days...
L369504 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Come home with me.
L369503 +++$+++ u6490 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Mama has all Kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and...
L369502 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to...
L369501 +++$+++ u6490 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ I want to see you, too.
L369500 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Not too bad. I'll be here a few days longer.  I want to see you.
L369499 +++$+++ u6490 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Will? Are you okay?
L369498 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Mama was probably asleep.
L369497 +++$+++ u6490 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ I was out in the garden. Mama came out and told me when she saw it on TV. Why didn't you call me?
L369496 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Hello.
L369252 +++$+++ u6490 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Will...
L369251 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ You should go to Montana. Stay with Kevin's grandparents. They haven't seen him for a while.  I'll come and get you afterwards...
L369249 +++$+++ u6490 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ William: you are going to make yourself sick or get yourself killed.
L369248 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ No. I have to be in there...  alone. Maybe there's something for me if I know how he feels and thinks.
L369247 +++$+++ u6490 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Is Crawford going with you?
L369246 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I have to go back to Birmingham.
L369245 +++$+++ u6490 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ What will you do?
L369244 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Where we're at is nowhere. We have nothing. We're running out of time.
L369243 +++$+++ u6490 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ And... where are things?
L369242 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ No.
L369241 +++$+++ u6490 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Can you quit?
L369240 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I wanted it over fast.  It felt dirty to not tell you.
L369239 +++$+++ u6490 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Then why?
L369238 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ No.
L369237 +++$+++ u6490 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Have you ever omitted telling me. things before?
L369236 +++$+++ u6490 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ I'd like one of your cigarettes, please.
L369235 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ You haven't smoked in two years.
L369234 +++$+++ u6490 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Can I have one of your cigarettes?
L369097 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Yes. I said this is too good to live...
L369096 +++$+++ u6490 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Do you remember what you said?
L369095 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I remember.
L369094 +++$+++ u6490 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ You remember when we first met?  And were together alone in that room. And the exhilaration was too much to hold on to. And then something flickered across your face like a shadow and I asked you what was wrong?
L369061 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Good for him.  Thanks a lot, Freddie!  Kevin. We're going grocery shopping.
L369060 +++$+++ u6490 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ He didn't know you had been in a mental institution. Be asked me if I knew. I said yes. I wanted to talk to him. He said he wanted to bring it up to you. Face to face.
L369056 +++$+++ u6490 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ You didn't do it to me, Will; it's happened to us.  And if I survive the wallpaper we'll be okay...  He's after you now, isn't he?
L369055 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ ...sorry, Molly. I'm sorry this happened to you.
L368751 +++$+++ u6490 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ I love you...
L368750 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Molly, dear Molly. Go to bed now, baby...
L368748 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit-brown for all I care...  Look, I'm sorry. When I come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and...
L368747 +++$+++ u6490 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Blue is cold.
L368746 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Blue, then.
L368745 +++$+++ u6490 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Yellow's a bad color for me.  I'll look green at breakfast.
L368744 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow.
L368743 +++$+++ u6490 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ I'm thinking about painting the kitchen. What color do you like, Will? Are you there?
L368742 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I have to see somebody.
L368741 +++$+++ u6490 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ To do what?
L368740 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I don't know. I'm goin' up to Baltimore this afternoon.
L368739 +++$+++ u6490 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Will you be in Atlanta for a while? I'm not buggin' you about coming home, I just wondered.
L368738 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Eating junk food.  They don't have a lock on anything, Molly. There's not enough information. Or I haven't done enough with it...
L368737 +++$+++ u6490 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Kevin's fine. He had to recover the turtle eggs you two fenced in. The dogs dug them up. Tell me what you're doing.
L368736 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Let's keep it the day-to-day stuff.  How's Kevin?
L368735 +++$+++ u6490 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Which part? That or the day-to-day.
L368734 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Tell me about yourself.
L368733 +++$+++ u6490 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Me, too. And very erotic...
L368732 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ None you'd notice. I'm lonely...
L368731 +++$+++ u6490 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ At the store. You doin' some good?
L368730 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Hey, baby! Where are you?
L368729 +++$+++ u6490 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Hello, hotshot!
L368651 +++$+++ u6490 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Mmmmh... I love you, too, Will. Good night.
L368650 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ It's me. I'll call you tomorrow, sweetheart. Go back to sleep.  I love you...
L368649 +++$+++ u6490 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Huh?  Will? Is that you?
L368648 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Molly?
L368619 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I don't care.  He'll never see me or know my name. If we find him, the police will have to take him down. Not me, I'm just looking at evidence.
L368618 +++$+++ u6490 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me.  And Kevin.  That's selfish, huh?
L368617 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ If I were?
L368616 +++$+++ u6490 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ What you've already decided. You're not really asking.
L368615 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ What the hell can I do?
L368614 +++$+++ u6490 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ All the things that happened to you before make you know that...
L368613 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ We have it good, don't we?
L368612 +++$+++ u6490 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ You mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma.  You are open and easy now... It took you a lot of work to get to that...
L368611 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I'm a forensic specialist, Molly. You've seen my diploma?  I got a diploma and everything.
L368610 +++$+++ u6490 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ I said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone.
L368609 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ And you said?
L368608 +++$+++ u6490 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ He asked how you are.
L368607 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ What did he want?
L368606 +++$+++ u6490 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ MOLLY +++$+++ He stopped by to see me at the shop before he came out here.
L369346 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Tell her I called.
L369345 +++$+++ u6485 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAMPA +++$+++ What's that?
L369344 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I know... 'Out in the good air...'
L369343 +++$+++ u6485 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAMPA +++$+++ My grandboy's been eatin' a ton of breakfast every day. Been out riding. Must be the good air. You oughta see that little booger eat.  I'll bet he's gained ten pounds.  Molly's out in the motor home...
L369342 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Yes. Is Molly there?
L369341 +++$+++ u6485 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAMPA +++$+++ You going back down to Florida after?
L369340 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Sure he is. Blond.  Probably Scandinavian, too...
L369339 +++$+++ u6485 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAMPA +++$+++ Well, how you doin', Mr. Graham?! You sure are in the center of a storm. Burning up lots of taxpayer's dollars, too, I bet.  On the news they said he was a white man. He isn't really, is he?
L369338 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ It's Will Graham. Is Molly there, Mr. Swenson?
L369479 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Go on to the house...
L369478 +++$+++ u6491 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ Lt. Fisk said...
L369477 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Go on to the house.
L369476 +++$+++ u6491 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ Meet point's up ahead!
L368640 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Thanks.
L368639 +++$+++ u6491 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ There's a VTR setup waiting in your hotel room, that you asked for. They transferred the home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS.
L368638 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ That's right.
L368637 +++$+++ u6491 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ I'll come inside with you, if you like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd probably want to be alone.
L368636 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Thanks for the lift.
L369530 +++$+++ u6495 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ SHERMAN +++$+++ I can't thank you enough, I...
L369529 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ No, I'm okay. I just wanted to...  ...stop by and...
L369528 +++$+++ u6495 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ SHERMAN +++$+++ We're fine. Fine. We're all well. We're okay!  That man, Crawford, called and... told me...  ...how 'bout a drink? Coffee or something?
L369526 +++$+++ u6495 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ SHERMAN +++$+++ Oh, Jesus... Come in.  Honey...!
L369525 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ My name's Will Graham. I...
L369524 +++$+++ u6495 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ SHERMAN +++$+++ Yes. Who are you?
L369523 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Are you George Sherman?
L369522 +++$+++ u6495 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ SHERMAN +++$+++ What do you want?
L369089 +++$+++ u6487 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ You like that Colombian stuff, don't you?
L369088 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Huh?
L369087 +++$+++ u6487 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ What kind of coffee do you like?
L369084 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ ...yes.
L369083 +++$+++ u6487 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ And Hobbs died?
L369082 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ ...after a while.
L369081 +++$+++ u6487 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ She got all right?
L369080 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ No.
L369079 +++$+++ u6487 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Did the girl die?
L369077 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Yes. Hobbs had one of his daughters from behind. He was cutting her. I shot him.
L369076 +++$+++ u6487 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ You went in the apartment?
L369075 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ With a knife.  I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was..., peculiar.  I was going up these stairs to Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was dying.  I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn't wait.
L369074 +++$+++ u6487 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ How?
L369073 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them.
L369072 +++$+++ u6487 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ How did it happen?
L369071 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ No. It's just my job to find him.  I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs.
L369070 +++$+++ u6487 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Are you gonna kill him?
L369069 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ We don't know that.
L369068 +++$+++ u6487 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ I told my dad before he died, I'd take care of Mom. And I'll do it.  This guy wants to kill you?
L369067 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ I was in the psychiatric wing. It bothers you, finding out I was in there... doesn't it?
L369066 +++$+++ u6487 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ I figured I'd ask you...
L369065 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Yes.
L369064 +++$+++ u6487 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it true?
L369063 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ No. You're very well-protected.  No one can find our where you are.
L369062 +++$+++ u6487 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Is there anything I need to know to see about Mom?
L369059 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ What is he? Afraid to leave you alone with me now?'  He read the Tattler piece, didn't he?
L369058 +++$+++ u6487 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ I'll hang around in here. I'll just be in the kitchen, Mom...
L369057 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ It's a precaution...  Why don't you run down to the bay. They got a swimming float.
L368625 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Yeah, but not now... These will all make it... guaranteed.
L368624 +++$+++ u6487 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea, huh?
L368623 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.
L368622 +++$+++ u6487 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
L368621 +++$+++ u6484 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ GRAHAM +++$+++ Yeah...
L368620 +++$+++ u6487 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ KEVIN +++$+++ Will it keep them out?
L369360 +++$+++ u6488 +++$+++ m431 +++$+++ LECKTOR +++$+++ It feels good because: if you do as God does, enough times, you become as God is: powerful...
