L462275 +++$+++ u2592 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ PLATO +++$+++ Are you really going to meet them?
L462209 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No.  In the morning.
L462208 +++$+++ u2592 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ PLATO +++$+++ Jim--Do you think when the end of the world comes it'll be at night?
L462207 +++$+++ u2592 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ PLATO +++$+++ They're still there!
L462206 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I'm here.
L462204 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Oh, I bet some little guy comes in here at night and pushes it.  Go- go-go!
L462203 +++$+++ u2592 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ PLATO +++$+++ No.  It's perpetual motion.
L462202 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I saw it.  Gee, look at that thing swing, will you?  Do you think it never stops?
L462201 +++$+++ u2592 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ PLATO +++$+++ He has a knife.
L462200 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I just don't want trouble.
L462199 +++$+++ u2592 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ PLATO +++$+++ You scared?
L462198 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I know.  That's why I came back.
L462197 +++$+++ u2592 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ PLATO +++$+++ Listen, I told you not to fool with them.  Now they're waiting for you.
L462196 +++$+++ u2592 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ PLATO +++$+++ Plato.  It's a nickname.
L462195 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Jim.  What's yours?
L462194 +++$+++ u2592 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ PLATO +++$+++ What's your name!
L462179 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I don't want to make friends.
L462178 +++$+++ u2592 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ PLATO +++$+++ He's a wheel.  So's she.  It's hard to make friends with them.
L462177 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ What?
L462176 +++$+++ u2592 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ PLATO +++$+++ You shouldn't monkey with him.
L462164 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Once you been up there, you know you been some place!
L462163 +++$+++ u2592 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ PLATO +++$+++ What?
L462162 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Boy!
L462156 +++$+++ u2592 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ PLATO +++$+++ I'm sorry--I made a mistake.
L462155 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No.  I don't think so--
L462154 +++$+++ u2592 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ PLATO +++$+++ You remember me?
L462153 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Hi there.
L462152 +++$+++ u2592 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ PLATO +++$+++ Hi.
L462480 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Dad--answer her--aren't you going to stand up for me?
L462479 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Jimmy, you're very young--and a foolish decision now could wreck your whole life.
L462476 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You're not going to use me as an excuse again, Mom.  Every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse.  Now I want to do one thing right and I'm not letting you run away.  Dad?
L462475 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Do I have to spell it out?
L462474 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No!  You're not tearing me loose any more.
L462473 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Well, it doesn't matter anyhow-- because we're moving.
L462470 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Just tell a little white lie?
L462469 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ He's not saying that!  He's saying don't volunteer!
L462466 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ But I am involved!  We're all involved, Mom!  A boy was killed! I don't see how we can get out of that by pretending it didn't happen!
L462465 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ No!  I don't want you to go to the police!  There were other people and why should you be the only one involved!
L462457 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Why should you be the only one.
L462456 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ What's that got to do with it?
L462455 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ What about the other boys--Do you think they'll go to the police?
L462445 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I can't keep it to myself anymore--
L462444 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Good Lord!
L462443 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I told you Dad, it was a question of honor.  They called me chicken-- you know, chicken!  I had to go or I would never have been able to face any of those kids again.  So I got in one of these cars and a boy called Buzz got in the other.  We had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff.  I got out okay but Buzz didn't.  He was killed.
L462438 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ And you wanted him to make a list!
L462437 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Mom--I'm not--
L462436 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
L462435 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ It doesn't matter how.  I was driving a stolen car--
L462434 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ How!
L462429 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I have to talk to someone, Mom.  I have to talk to you both.  And Dad this time you got to give me an answer.
L462428 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ What happened, darling.  We were so worried.  I was going to take a sleeping pill, but I wouldn't till I knew you were home.
L462101 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Goodbye, dear.
L462100 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ 'Bye, Mom.
L462089 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ It'd stick in my throat, Mom.  I'm nervous or something--
L462088 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Sit down and eat--you'll be late.
L462075 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ All right, darling.
L462074 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L462024 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ That's a fine way to behave!
L462023 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Stop tearing me apart!  You say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
L462022 +++$+++ u2589 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ What?
L462073 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You serious?
L462072 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Any time--day or night.  You calmed down enough to go back now?
L462071 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Okay--
L462070 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Here.  Look, will you do something for me?  If the pot starts boiling again, will you come and see me before you get yourself in a jam? Even if you just want to talk--come in and shoot the breeze.  It's easier sometimes than talking to your folks.
L462069 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Boy--if I had one day when I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed of everything--or I felt I belonged some place.
L462068 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You got me, Jim--but they do.  Want some water?
L462067 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ How can anyone grow up in this circus?
L462066 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I bet you see right through me, don't you?
L462065 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Chicken?
L462064 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy and I bet she'd stop picking.  They make mush out of him.  Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like him.
L462063 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ "If he could" what?  You mean your father?
L462062 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ If he could--
L462061 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Pretty mixed up?
L462060 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ A zoo.  He always wants to be my pal, you know?  But how can I give him anything when he's--I mean I love him and I don't want to hurt him--but I don't know what to do anymore except maybe die.
L462059 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What?
L462058 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ What a zoo!
L462057 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ She eats him alive and he takes it.
L462056 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Things pretty tough for you at home?
L462055 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ But you don't think that's a solution.
L462054 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ They think I'll make friends if we move.  Just move and everything'll be roses and sunshine.
L462053 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ So then you moved?
L462052 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ They never do.
L462051 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ And your folks didn't understand?
L462050 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ He called me chicken.
L462049 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Mess that kid up?
L462048 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You were getting a good start in the wrong direction back there. Why did you do it?
L462047 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ And they think they are protecting my by moving.
L462046 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ That why you moved from the last town? 'Cause you were in trouble? You can talk about it if you want to--I know about it anyway. Routine check.
L462045 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Try the desk.
L462044 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ All the time!  I don't know what gets into me--but I keep looking for trouble and I always--I swear you better lock me up.  I'm going to smash somebody--I know it.
L462043 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You feel like you want to blow your wheels right now?
L462042 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I just get so--  Boy, sometimes the temperature goes way up. RAY  Okay.  Okay.  Let it out.
L462041 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Go on--don't give me that.  Someone giving you hard looks?
L462040 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I don't know why--!
L462039 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ No.
L462038 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Leave me alone.
L462037 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Sure it is.  You want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  Why?
L462036 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No.
L462035 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Too bad you didn't connect.  You could have gone to Juvenile Hall. That's what you want, isn't it?
L462034 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Big tough character.  You don't kid me, pal.  How come you're not wearing your boots?
L462033 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Wash up and go home.
L462032 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Hang loose, boy.  I'm warning you.
L462031 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Get lost.
L462030 +++$+++ u2593 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Grandma?
L462029 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Someone should put poison in her epsom salts.
L462733 +++$+++ u2591 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ Just walk over here quietly now-- and there won't be any trouble.
L462732 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Plato!
L462509 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Listen--
L462508 +++$+++ u2591 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ Assault with a deadly weapon.
L461954 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Yes, ma'am.
L461953 +++$+++ u2591 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ Cut it out now.  I'm warning you.
L461952 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Want me to imitate a stupid cop?
L461951 +++$+++ u2591 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ Hey!  That's enough static out of you.
L462752 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ They're killing him!
L462751 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Sure.  He was trying to make us his family.
L462750 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ You should have heard him talk about you tonight.  Like you were the hero in the China Seas.
L462748 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ He needed you, maybe.  So do I.
L462747 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ He didn't mean it--we shouldn't have left him.  He needed us.
L462746 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ After he tried to shoot you?
L462745 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No!  I got to find him.
L462744 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ We have to go back!
L462743 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No!
L462706 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I love you, Jim.  I really mean it.
L462705 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ It is for me too.
L462704 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I love somebody.  All the time I've been looking for someone to love me and now--I love somebody.  And it's so easy.  Why is it easy now?
L462703 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ It's not going to be lonely, Judy. Not for you and not for me.
L462702 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I never felt so clean before.
L462701 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ So do you.
L462700 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ You smell like baby powder.
L462699 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ What?
L462698 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Funny Jimmy.  You're so clean and you--this is silly.
L462697 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You disappointed?
L462696 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Is this what it's like to love somebody?
L462695 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ What a relief!
L462694 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I know already.  We don't have to pretend now.
L462693 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ There's something I should tell you, Judy.
L462692 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ You don't need to do that.
L462691 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Here we are-- out of cigarettes-- Junior's in the nurs'ry-- See how late it gets--
L462690 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Are you?
L462689 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Maybe he's scared of the dark.
L462688 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato.  That was nice.
L462687 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Why?
L462686 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Your hand's all wet and it's shaky.  You're so funny.
L462685 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ What?
L462684 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Hi.
L462683 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Hi.
L462682 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Want to read any books?  Take your pick!  Isn't this the craziest?
L462680 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Should we explore?
L462679 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I don't know.
L462678 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ How many rooms do you think there are?
L462677 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.
L462676 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Ever been in a place like this before?
L462654 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I bet you hear everything I say!
L462653 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ You can't talk underwater!
L462633 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ See, we're very modern.
L462632 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Of course.  Drown them like puppies.
L462629 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ There's just one thing.  What about--
L462628 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Well--we're newlyweds.
L462627 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ You see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling.  I'm so embarrassed I could die!
L462626 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Why don't we just rent it for the season?
L462623 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ You decide, darling.  Remember our budget.
L462622 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No--come on.  Should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear?
L462621 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Oh, Jim!
L462571 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I feel as if I'm walking under water.
L462570 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You can trust me, Judy.
L462569 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Listen!  I know a place!  PLATO showed me before.  An old deserted mansion near the planetarium  Would you go with me?
L462568 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I'm never going back.
L462567 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Where can we go?  I can't go back into that zoo.
L462566 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I don't know, but we can't stay here.
L462565 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Where you going?
L462564 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Your lips are soft when you kiss.
L462563 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I felt like it.
L462562 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Why did you do that?
L462561 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Awful?  No.  It's just lonely. It's the loneliest time.
L462560 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ So have I.  But I've never been in love.  Isn't that awful?
L462559 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Sure.  Lots of times.
L462558 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Have you ever gone with anyone who--
L462557 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I'm getting that way, too.
L462556 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Why?
L462555 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I don't think you trust anybody, do you?
L462554 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ If you knew me you wouldn't say that.
L462553 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Why'd you get mixed up with them? You don't have to prove anything.
L462552 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I'm sorry I treated you mean today. You shouldn't believe what I say when I'm with the kids.  Nobody acts sincere.
L462551 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Like even today.  I woke up this morning, you know?  And the sun was shining and everything was nice. Then the first thing that happens is I see you and I thought this is going to be one terrific day so you better live it up, boy, 'cause tomorrow maybe you'll be nothing.
L462549 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Every day I look in the mirror and say, "What?  You still here?" Man!
L462548 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ No.
L462547 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No?  Why not?  You know something?  Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday.  Isn't that dumb?
L462546 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Neither can I.
L462545 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I swear, sometimes, you just want to hold onto somebody!  Judy, what am I going to do?  I can't go home again.
L462544 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Even if I'm near a fire, I'm cold. I guess just about everybody's cold.
L462543 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You cold?
L462542 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I'm numb.
L462541 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You still pretty upset?
L462538 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I tried to call you before. JUDY I thought so.
L462537 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ No--I was just--maybe--
L462536 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You were looking for me, weren't you?
L462535 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ It doesn't matter to them.
L462534 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ They saw where I jumped!  I didn't chicken!  What do I have to do-- kill myself?
L462533 +++$+++ u2586 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ They'll be looking for you.
L462134 +++$+++ u2585 +++$+++ m168 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I'm not so bad.
