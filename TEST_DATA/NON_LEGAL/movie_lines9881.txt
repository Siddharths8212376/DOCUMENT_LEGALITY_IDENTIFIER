L258330 +++$+++ u5676 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Mrs. MacLean -- why don't you and daughter stay for dinner?
L258326 +++$+++ u5676 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Pasture? Oh, that stretch of field near the hill? Yeah.
L258325 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Uh, no, we're going to dinner... Is this the way to the pasture?
L258324 +++$+++ u5676 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Sure.  Does your daughter want to come inside?
L258323 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Would you mind if I did? I'd like to talk to him.
L258322 +++$+++ u5676 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ There's coffee inside... I was just bringing this to Tom.
L258158 +++$+++ u5681 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Probably best. You may want to shoot yourself half way to Ohio.
L258157 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Of course not.
L258156 +++$+++ u5681 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Problem is, there aren't many volunteers. He's already had enough to sink a battleship. You have a pin, just in case?
L258155 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Maybe we should give him another sedative.
L257951 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ And I can say the same thing about my daughter! But she is suffering! Can you solve that problem!  I can't deal with this now, Liz! If you need a yes or no right now, then no -- don't do it! Not until I know Grace is all right. Now, please! Just do what you can. Okay?  Please.
L257950 +++$+++ u5681 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ It isn't right to make him suffer...
L257949 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ ... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is --
L257948 +++$+++ u5681 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same.
L257947 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ - See, what you can do for him --...
L257946 +++$+++ u5681 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ I understand, but Annie, please...
L257945 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Liz, listen, the Doctor's here and I just can't, uh... talk now... so --
L257938 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, of course, right...
L257937 +++$+++ u5681 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...
L257936 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Wait, uh, I, I don't understand. Start again -- He's alive...
L257934 +++$+++ u5681 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Oh God, Annie, I'm so sorry. I... I know you're being hit with a low now, I don't want to take too much of your time but I have to talk to you about Pilgrim.
L257933 +++$+++ u5674 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Her leg was shattered so they had to, uh... remove it. She had some bleeding but it's under control.
L257932 +++$+++ u5681 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Annie, it's Liz. How's Grace?
L258856 +++$+++ u5676 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Frank's touchy about his cousins.  Well, it was nice to meet you, Mr. MacLean.
L258855 +++$+++ u5677 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Diane!
L258854 +++$+++ u5676 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Oh Frank, don't forget the wedding present -- it's behind the door in the laundry room.  I got her a pasta maker from the catalogue... Not that they'll know what to do with it in Branton, Missouri... Probably use it as a planter.
L258743 +++$+++ u5676 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ You!
L258742 +++$+++ u5677 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Play that sweet one you know. The one makes my wife here so friendly.
L258352 +++$+++ u5677 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It's got doors, Diane. Private as can be. Tom?
L258351 +++$+++ u5676 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ They're already all settled in, Frank. Anyway, I'm sure Annie wants her privacy.
L258285 +++$+++ u5677 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I believe women from New York eat mixed salads. Ain't that right, Tom?
L258284 +++$+++ u5676 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ What?
L258283 +++$+++ u5677 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Mixed salad.
L258280 +++$+++ u5676 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ I guess they'll want feeding and all, out here all day long.
L258279 +++$+++ u5677 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Oh hell, I don't know... According to Tom, she's a pretty determined woman. Must've thought it was worth it.
L258278 +++$+++ u5676 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ ... well, I just think she's got a lot of nerve showing up here. Draggin' that child and that poor animal all the way...  You eat with those fingers again and you know what'll happen!  Frank, don't you think she's got a nerve?
L258816 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ No thanks.
L258815 +++$+++ u5676 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ I have some brownies left over. Want one?
L258626 +++$+++ u5676 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Ain't brain surgery.
L258625 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Diane takes care of the books. I don't know how, but at the end of every month, everything adds up to the penny.
L258624 +++$+++ u5676 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Ha...
L258287 +++$+++ u5676 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Well, that's just what we need on a cattle ranch -- a vegetarian from New York.
L258286 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I believe so. Saw it on a television show, once.
L258282 +++$+++ u5676 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ What, they ain't going forty miles into Choteau everytime they want a hamburger.
L258281 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I don't believe they'll expect that.
L258434 +++$+++ u5679 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Be honest, I can't say I did it all myself. My grandma helped me get the words right.
L258433 +++$+++ u5677 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Now son, you tell 'em when it came from.
L258340 +++$+++ u5677 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Tell her they suit the weather better. Their udders are black, 'stead of pink.
L258339 +++$+++ u5679 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Teacher asked me why we raise Black Angus-Herefords 'stead of Pure Herefords.
L258289 +++$+++ u5677 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Weekend after next...
L258288 +++$+++ u5679 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ When you figure on branding?
L258227 +++$+++ u5679 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ There was this thing on the TV about a guy who does it with geese. He has this airplane and these baby geese all grow up thinking it's their mom, and he flies it and they just follow.  You hear 'bout that, Uncle T?
L258226 +++$+++ u5677 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ That's what some folks say.
L258225 +++$+++ u5679 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ He says if you do it soon as they're born, it makes them real easy to handle later on.
L258224 +++$+++ u5679 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ There's a kid at school says we should've imprint-trained him.
L258223 +++$+++ u5677 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Sure. As long as she don't mind.
L258222 +++$+++ u5679 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Can we take a look at Bronty's foal when we're done here, Dad?
L258787 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ He thought it was a ghost.
L258786 +++$+++ u5677 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ We thought we lost him in the snow storm... Told the kids. Had a funeral for the damn thing. Finally, snow stops. Staring to warm up. I go out and start cleaning the truck... Goddamn if that dog doesn't jump out from the back seat covered in snow... I nearly stained myself.
L258620 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I don't think Warren would go for that.
L258619 +++$+++ u5677 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It'd be a whole lot easier to pay the feed end of the month...
L258436 +++$+++ u5677 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ And next time, Miss Annie, you can run down the calves...
L258435 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Well, I'd like to welcome Annie and Grace to their first branding...
L258342 +++$+++ u5677 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Our daddy raised Pure Herefords.
L258341 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ They don't get burned by the sun bouncing off the snow. And they're good mother.
L258338 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ We should be fine, then.
L258337 +++$+++ u5677 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Bank out us a couple more men to run the cattle.
L258295 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Yeah.
L258294 +++$+++ u5677 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Tom?
L258233 +++$+++ u5677 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You know her?
L258232 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I don't believe it.
L258747 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You know, you're a good kid.
L258746 +++$+++ u5679 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I wouldn't let happen.
L258745 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I don't thinks you'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody.
L258744 +++$+++ u5679 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You wouldn't want to dance with me, would you?
L258593 +++$+++ u5679 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I don't know... You sure Tom said it's all right?
L258592 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Of course I have.
L258591 +++$+++ u5679 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Have you talked to Tom about it?
L258590 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Would you let me ride your horse?
L258448 +++$+++ u5679 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Because it fits my head. You want to try it on?
L258447 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Why do you always wear that hat?
L258314 +++$+++ u5679 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Twice a month they give you a day off to work on the ranch.
L258313 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Don't you go to school?
L258842 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Grace, Listen... you've got to do this. Just trust me one more time.
L258841 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ No!
L258840 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.
L258839 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ No, you're only going to hurt him some more.
L258838 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Grace, I need you to come with me.
L258826 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I want to watch.
L258825 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ It's more or less how it sounds. Sometimes it's not pretty to watch. Some horses fight it real hard. Your fella's already shown us he likes a good fight. So if you don't want to watch, I'll call you when it's done.
L258824 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ What does that mean?
L258823 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ There's still something going on inside of him I can't reach. So me and Smokey here, we're going to try laying him down. Okay?
L258820 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Sure.
L258819 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Sure?
L258740 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ There's no hurry. Take you time.
L258739 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I can't... not yet...
L258737 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I know you do. Don't you disappear.  You do whatever you have to, to hold on...  I'll tell you one more thing... When Pilgrim reared up to face that truck... you know what I think?... I think that damn horse loved you so much, he was trying to protect you... That's what I think.
L258736 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I know where he goes.
L258735 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I won't tell you it'll stop feeling this bad... But I can tell you, you didn't do anything wrong... The same thing would have happened to me... or Frank... or Joe... And there's no sense in looking for a reason why things happen...  I used to try and... always came up short. I don't think the why so's important as... what we do with what we get. I remember this boy I'd see up on the Blackfeet Reservation. He was sixteen. Great kid. Strong. He'd gone swimming and dived headfirst into a rock. Snapped his neck, paralyzed him... After the accident, I'd look in on him from time to time... and he wasn't there anymore. His mind, his spirit, whatever you want to call it, it just disappeared. And what was left was nothing but anger... It's like the boy I knew just went away somewhere...
L258546 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Getting old. Not being of much use, I guess.  What went on out there, Grace? With Pilgrim?
L258545 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Are you afraid of anything?
L258544 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ That must have been pretty special.
L258543 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.
L258542 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Where did you get Pilgrim from?
L258541 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Not a question of if you can -- you are. Just keep your eyes on the road and your foot on the pedal and the rest will take care of yourself.
L258540 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I don't know if I can.
L258539 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Just follow this. Nothing to it. I'm going to shut my eyes here for a little while. Just keep going till you run out of road.
L258536 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Well, there's only one way to find out.  Give it a little gas.
L258535 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I don't know if I can with my leg.
L258534 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Put the key in and turn it.  The right pedal is gas, the other one's the brake.
L258533 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I don't have all day.
L258532 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I can't...
L258531 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ It's never too soon to start.
L258530 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Drive? I'm not old enough yet.
L258529 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Can you drive?
L258409 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ You're catching on.
L258408 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ That's not a question, is it?
L258271 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Not to me. Either you want to or you don't.
L258270 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Isn't it like, obvious?
L258256 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Not like books or literature or anything. Just a magazine... Just in case she hasn't told you -- which I'm sure she hasn't -- I don't want to be a part of this, OK?
L258255 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Mmm. An editor.
L258254 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ She's an editor.
L258253 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ What does she do?
L258252 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.
L258251 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ She gonna be long?
L258248 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Uh, I'm Tom Booker. Your mother around?
L258247 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Yeah?
L257901 +++$+++ u5680 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ JUDITH +++$+++ I'm okay... I'm okay.
L257900 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Jude, you okay?
L257894 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ No, wait, it just goes... "he said he liked to do-"...
L257893 +++$+++ u5680 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ JUDITH +++$+++ "... and I said that"...
L257875 +++$+++ u5680 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ JUDITH +++$+++ We already did the river. Let's go down and across the old bridge. We can circle back.
L257874 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You want to go down or stay along the river?
L257873 +++$+++ u5680 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ JUDITH +++$+++ Why don't we just cut through the woods?
L257872 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Do you want to go around by the old road?
L257871 +++$+++ u5680 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ JUDITH +++$+++ I just could never say it!
L257870 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ ...Oh, come on! You think the same thing!
L257851 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Can I come? I'll start a fire...
L257850 +++$+++ u5680 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ JUDITH +++$+++ My parents are having friends from college over. They're really nice... They have this gorgeous son who wants to be a forest ranger.
L257849 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ So?
L257848 +++$+++ u5680 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ JUDITH +++$+++ I thought your mom's coming up?
L257847 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ You want to go to a movie tonight?
L257846 +++$+++ u5680 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ JUDITH +++$+++ It's warmer than I thought.
L258869 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I did. He said he had work to do until late.
L258868 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Shouldn't we have invited Tom over?
L258773 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Can we show him Pilgrim, Tom?
L258772 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ I know. Amazing.
L258771 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Did you notice -- no cane?
L258019 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ I want to see Pilgrim.
L258018 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ What, sweetheart?
L258000 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ NO!
L257999 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Honey, you all right? Did something fall?
L257993 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Maybe... look -- just...
L257992 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ You want to watch some television?
L257989 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ No, I'm just not that hungry.
L257988 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Do you want something else, honey? We order something else?
L257986 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ OK, OK.
L257985 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Dad! I can do it, OK?!
L257980 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ How's Pilgrim doing?
L257979 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ No, not yet.
L257978 +++$+++ u5678 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ GRACE +++$+++ Have you heard from Judith's parents?
L258660 +++$+++ u5685 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TWIN +++$+++ You're the one who's stupid -- letting her go and fall off your horse!!
L258659 +++$+++ u5679 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You shut up, stupid!
L258658 +++$+++ u5685 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TWIN +++$+++ You just showing off for her!
L258657 +++$+++ u5679 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Don't be such a baby!
L258654 +++$+++ u5685 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TWIN +++$+++ WAS SO!
L258653 +++$+++ u5679 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ YA JUST HAD A TURN. IT WAS NOT.
L258652 +++$+++ u5685 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TWIN +++$+++ IT WAS MY TURN!
L258790 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ I haven't been back in over twenty years, but I wouldn't be surprised. The population's larger.
L258789 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Is the poverty worse, now, you think?
L258785 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ I understand...
L258784 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Well, like I told your wife, it's really up to Pilgrim.
L258783 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ How much longer do you think?
L258782 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ We still have a way to go.
L258781 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ I can't believe it's the same horse.
L258769 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Oh yeah...
L258768 +++$+++ u5682 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Hi. It's a pleasure. I'm very grateful for the way you took in my girls here. I bet you were surprised when they just showed up out of nowhere.
L258077 +++$+++ u5683 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ RONA +++$+++ Honey... I was always good.
L258076 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ You know, Rona, we weren't all that good together even when we were good together.
L258074 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Sometimes.
L258073 +++$+++ u5683 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ RONA +++$+++ Does a horse miss a saddle?
L258072 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ You ever miss it?
L258071 +++$+++ u5683 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ RONA +++$+++ Long enough.
L258070 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ How long were you married?
L258069 +++$+++ u5683 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ RONA +++$+++ What are you looking at, young man?
L258068 +++$+++ u5683 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ RONA +++$+++ The number's by the phone.
L258067 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ I don't any woman in New York. But from what I hear, most of them are wound up.
L258066 +++$+++ u5683 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ RONA +++$+++ Oh I clear forget. You had a call from some woman in New York. She sounded pretty wound up.
L258042 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Oh-oh... Maybe I better get back in the truck.
L258041 +++$+++ u5683 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ RONA +++$+++ Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
L258040 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might.
L258039 +++$+++ u5683 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ RONA +++$+++ Fit? You want to check my teeth.  Good crowd today. I think you'll have some fun. You going to stay for dinner?
L258038 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ You're looking fit.
L258037 +++$+++ u5683 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ RONA +++$+++ I wouldn't know what to do if you were on time.
L258036 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late.
L258035 +++$+++ u5683 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ RONA +++$+++ Hey, darlin'.
L258065 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Well, if the rider's nuts, the horse bolts.  That's the whole lesson right there. You have a good day now... Just... keep on freeing yourself up.
L258064 +++$+++ u5686 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ What do you mean?
L258063 +++$+++ u5684 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ TOM +++$+++ Well... Dale... you know, a lot of this stuff... it just... nuts and bolts.
L258062 +++$+++ u5686 +++$+++ m376 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ About horses? I'd love to learn more about it myself. Do you offer any private lessons for riders?
