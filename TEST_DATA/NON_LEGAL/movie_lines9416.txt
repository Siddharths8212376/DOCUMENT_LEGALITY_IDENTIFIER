L538054 +++$+++ u3012 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ What is it?
L538048 +++$+++ u3012 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I'm going to sleep it off. Let me know if there's some other way we can screw up tonight.
L538047 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I don't believe our own conduct will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy...
L538013 +++$+++ u3012 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Far be it for me to dispute my first officer. Starfleet has always -
L538012 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I believe the Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace -
L537956 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
L537955 +++$+++ u3012 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Never been this close.
L537903 +++$+++ u3012 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Congratulations, Lieutenant. That must make you very proud...
L537902 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Lieutenant, I am pleased to see you.  The Lieutenant is the first Vulcan to be graduated at the top of her class as the Academy.
L537892 +++$+++ u3012 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ LET THEM DIE.
L537891 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ They're dying.
L537890 +++$+++ u3012 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
L537889 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Jim, there is an historic opportunity here -
L537888 +++$+++ u3012 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I know your father's the Vulcan Ambassador for heaven's sake, but you know how I feel about this: they're animals.
L537887 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I was asked by my father to open neg-
L537886 +++$+++ u3012 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ How could you vouch for me? That's...  ... arrogant presumption -
L537885 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ There's an old Vulcan proverb: only Nixon could go to China.
L537884 +++$+++ u3012 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ WE volunteered?
L537881 +++$+++ u3012 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ You have personally -
L537880 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I have personally vouched for you in this matter, Captain.
L537878 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We have volunteered to rendezvous with the Klingon ship that's bringing Chancellor Gorkon here, and escort him safely through Federation space.
L537877 +++$+++ u3012 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Me?
L538720 +++$+++ u3012 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Not from a distance. She won't show up on ANY type of scan.
L538719 +++$+++ u3022 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ Captain, we can't see her, but she gives off heat...
L538694 +++$+++ u3022 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ Nothing, Captain. If they're here, they're rigger for silent running.
L538693 +++$+++ u3012 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Uhura?
L538608 +++$+++ u3012 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Who else?
L538607 +++$+++ u3022 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ Gorkon's own man??
L538099 +++$+++ u3012 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ I'm going aboard. Spock, you have the conn.
L538098 +++$+++ u3022 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ It's pretty chaotic over there. There's been some weapons fire and a lot of shouting...
L538088 +++$+++ u3022 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ This is Enterprise. We surrender. Repeat  Enterprise surrenders --
L538087 +++$+++ u3012 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ WE SURRENDER.
L538086 +++$+++ u3022 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ Captain --
L537960 +++$+++ u3012 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ This is the Starship Enterprise, Captain James Kirk commanding.
L537959 +++$+++ u3022 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ Channel open, Captain.
L537912 +++$+++ u3012 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ KIRK +++$+++ Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
L537911 +++$+++ u3022 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ Control tower, reading, Sir.
L538595 +++$+++ u3013 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ LT. SAAVIK +++$+++ You've betrayed the Federation - all of you.
L538594 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Perhaps neither of us was hearing very well that night, Lieutenant. There were things I tried to tell you too - about having faith.
L538588 +++$+++ u3013 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ LT. SAAVIK +++$+++ You can't prove any of this...
L538587 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ But it was when you tried to persuade me the Captain was guilty that I should have understood.
L538579 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I believe you. Please...
L538578 +++$+++ u3013 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ LT. SAAVIK +++$+++ I don't want to.
L538577 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ If you are logical.
L538421 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ An error.
L538420 +++$+++ u3013 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ LT. SAAVIK +++$+++ A lie?
L538413 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I'm having the garbage searched. If my surmise is correct these boots will cling to the killers' necks like Tiberian bats. They couldn't make their escape without them; nor can they simply throw them out a window for all to see; no - they're here. Somewhere.
L538412 +++$+++ u3013 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ LT. SAAVIK +++$+++ Suppose when they returned they threw the boots into the garbage?
L538408 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Even logic must give way to physics. Gravity hadn't been restored by the time they escaped. Without their boots they would not have stayed on the Klingon transporter pads.
L538407 +++$+++ u3013 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ LT. SAAVIK +++$+++ We've got a crew of three hundred turning their own quarters inside out,  but the killers may be among them. Surely they've disposed of these boots by now. Wouldn't it have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?
L538406 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Any progress?
L538233 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ An omission. After that -
L538232 +++$+++ u3013 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ LT. SAAVIK +++$+++ A lie?
L538231 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Very well. For twenty-four hours we'll agree that this conversation did not take place.
L538230 +++$+++ u3013 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ LT. SAAVIK +++$+++ Commander Uhura has been experiencing technical difficulties sir.
L538229 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Curious. You haven't been assisting Commander Uhura with her radio transmissions, have you, Lt?
L538228 +++$+++ u3013 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ LT. SAAVIK +++$+++ Not as yet, sir.
L538227 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Any reply from Starfleet to our dispatch, Lieutenant.
L538224 +++$+++ u3013 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ LT. SAAVIK +++$+++ Such things have happened before, sir.
L538223 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Her own father...?
L538146 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ In the meantime we must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight. According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
L538145 +++$+++ u3013 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ LT. SAAVIK +++$+++ How did you - ?
L538142 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ What do you suggest, Lieutenant? Opening fire won't retrieve the Captain; and an armed engagement was precisely what he wished to avoid.
L538141 +++$+++ u3013 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ LT. SAAVIK +++$+++ But we can't allow them to be taken back to Kronos as prisoners.
L537951 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That the universe will unfold as it should.
L537950 +++$+++ u3013 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ LT. SAAVIK +++$+++ Faith...?
L537949 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You must have faith.
L537946 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I am not certain such speculations are included among your duties, Lieutenant.
L537945 +++$+++ u3013 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ LT. SAAVIK +++$+++ Sir, I speak to you as a kindred intellect. Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
L537944 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ You have done well, Saavik. As your sponsor at the Academy I have followed your career with... satisfaction. And as a Vulcan.
L538622 +++$+++ u3013 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ LT. SAAVIK +++$+++ I do not think so. Enterprise has disobeyed orders and harbors two escaped convicts. Admiral Donald will make certain all your ship-to- shore transmissions are jammed.
L538621 +++$+++ u3022 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ We can send a message to Starfleet Command -
L538186 +++$+++ u3022 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ We are experiencing a technical malfunction. All backup systems inoperative.
L538185 +++$+++ u3013 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ LT. SAAVIK +++$+++ In nineteenth century France, workers who felt their livelihood threatened by machines, flung their wooden shoes - called SABOTS - into the gears to stop them. Hence the word SABOTAGE.
L538184 +++$+++ u3022 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ We've been ordered to -
L538183 +++$+++ u3013 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ LT. SAAVIK +++$+++ Trouble?
L538071 +++$+++ u3022 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ Confirmed, Captain!
L538070 +++$+++ u3013 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ LT. SAAVIK +++$+++ Direct hit -
L538442 +++$+++ u3016 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ No, sir.
L538441 +++$+++ u3021 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ You having hearing problems, mister?
L538440 +++$+++ u3016 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ Sir?
L538439 +++$+++ u3021 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.
L538438 +++$+++ u3016 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
L538437 +++$+++ u3021 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ What?
L538436 +++$+++ u3016 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ Sorry to wake you, sir, but Starfleet urgently requests any data we may have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
L537850 +++$+++ u3018 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SCIENCE OFFICER +++$+++ What's left of it.
L537849 +++$+++ u3021 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ Praxis?
L537848 +++$+++ u3018 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SCIENCE OFFICER +++$+++ ... I cannot confirm the existence of Praxis.
L537847 +++$+++ u3021 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ What is it?
L537846 +++$+++ u3018 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SCIENCE OFFICER +++$+++ I have confirmed the location, sir, but...
L537843 +++$+++ u3021 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ Essential as a resource. Praxis is their key energy production facility.  Send to Klingon High Command: "This is Excelsior, a Federation Starship traveling through Beta Quadrant. We have monitored a large explosion in your sector. Do <u>you require assistance</u>?"
L537842 +++$+++ u3018 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SCIENCE OFFICER +++$+++ Negative. The subspace shockwave originated at bearing three-two- three, mark seven-five, the location is...  Praxis. A Klingon moon. Barren of indigenous life forms but -
L537841 +++$+++ u3021 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ Don't tell me that was any meteor shower.
L537829 +++$+++ u3021 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ Visual!
L537828 +++$+++ u3018 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SCIENCE OFFICER +++$+++ I have an energy wave from 240 degrees mark six port --
L537827 +++$+++ u3021 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ Then it's time we were heading home. Three years is...
L537826 +++$+++ u3018 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SCIENCE OFFICER +++$+++ Fifty-four planets - and their gaseous atmospheric anomalies. Our sensing and analytic equipment worked well.
L537825 +++$+++ u3021 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SULU +++$+++ According to this we've completed our exploration of the entire sector.
L538497 +++$+++ u3019 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SCOTTY +++$+++ Aye, aye, sir.
L538496 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ They're outside the beaming shield. Mr. Scott, start your engines.
L538419 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Scott. We were to return to spacedock, the killers would surely manage to dispose of their incriminating footwear.
L538418 +++$+++ u3019 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SCOTTY +++$+++ - could take weeks, sir.
L538359 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I believe I am.
L538358 +++$+++ u3019 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SCOTTY +++$+++ They you're talking about a dreadful new engine of destruction, Mr. Spock.
L538357 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ This one can.
L538356 +++$+++ u3019 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SCOTTY +++$+++ A Bird of Prey canna fire when she's cloaked!
L538353 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Would they?
L538352 +++$+++ u3019 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SCOTTY +++$+++ If another ship had been beneath us the Klingons would've seen her!
L538351 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Too far off. Very near us. Perhaps... underneath us...
L538348 +++$+++ u3019 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SCOTTY +++$+++ Not from us!
L538347 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
L538346 +++$+++ u3019 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SCOTTY +++$+++ They dinna fire on themselves. And there were no other ships present.
L538235 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I know precisely where he'll be.
L538234 +++$+++ u3019 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SCOTTY +++$+++ Twenty-four hours from now we won't have a clue where the Captain is.
L538226 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ That's hardly conclusive, Mr. Scott, as Klingons have no tear ducts.
L538225 +++$+++ u3019 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SCOTTY +++$+++ They don't place the same value on life that we do, Spock - you know that... take my word: she didn't shed one bloody tear...
L538220 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Then someone forged a data bank entry.
L538219 +++$+++ u3019 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SCOTTY +++$+++ And if they're still in place?
L538218 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Nevertheless.
L538217 +++$+++ u3019 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SCOTTY +++$+++ That could take hours!
L538216 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
L538215 +++$+++ u3019 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SCOTTY +++$+++ You can check the torpedoes visually, if you like -
L538214 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I think  not.
L538213 +++$+++ u3019 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SCOTTY +++$+++ A computer canna lie, sir.
L538212 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Yet the data banks insist we fired: twice. One computer is lying.
L538211 +++$+++ u3019 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SCOTTY +++$+++ It's as I said, Mr. Spock: Inventory still registers every torpedo.
L538148 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Mr. Scott, you forget yourself. Please accompany me.
L538147 +++$+++ u3019 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SCOTTY +++$+++ NO WAY!
L538144 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I've already addressed that question, Mr. Scott. We'll e able to follow the Captain's movements.
L538143 +++$+++ u3019 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SCOTTY +++$+++ At least we must keep track of where they are taken, sir. I -
L538775 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ But you didn't join a conspiracy.
L538774 +++$+++ u3022 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ They might as well arrest me, too; I felt like Lieutenant Saavik.
L538728 +++$+++ u3022 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ Well, what about all that atmospheric equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
L538727 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Under impulse power she expends fuel like any other ship. We call it "Plasma" - I do not know the Klingon name for it, but by any name it is merely ionized gas.
L538725 +++$+++ u3022 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ Maybe we should write them a letter?
L538724 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I don't think Starfleet could have envisioned our current predicament.
L538425 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ At present, he's surrounded by a magnetic shield. If my calculations are correct, he should be deep into his escape planning by this time.
L538424 +++$+++ u3022 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ You understand that we have lost all contact with Captain Kirk...?
L538416 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ Mr. Scott, any progress on repairing our warp drive?
L538415 +++$+++ u3022 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ I've pulled out my - uh wooden shoe and Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
L538364 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I want this ship searched from bow to stern. Lieutenant Saavik, you are in charge. Start with the transporter room and work your way outwards...
L538363 +++$+++ u3022 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ Even assuming you're correct, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own President?
L538362 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ And they'd be right. We have no evidence - just a theory that happens to fit the facts...
L538345 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ It means that if we cannot have fired those torpedoes then someone else did.
L538344 +++$+++ u3022 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ What exactly does that mean?
L538343 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible whatever remains - however improbable - must be the truth.
L538301 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ He's placing himself in a most awkward position...
L538300 +++$+++ u3022 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ Sulu's giving us his position and telling us he's standing by...
L538140 +++$+++ u3022 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L538139 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ I assume command of this ship as of  0130 hours. Uhura, send to Starfleet HQ. Explain precisely what has taken place, and request instructions.
L538008 +++$+++ u3022 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ UHURA +++$+++ How do both sides overcome ingrained prejudice?
L538007 +++$+++ u3020 +++$+++ m197 +++$+++ SPOCK +++$+++ They're naturally wary, ma'am. We've been at war a long time.
L540855 +++$+++ u3023 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ B-9 +++$+++ How long is that?
L540854 +++$+++ u3025 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ Indefinitely.
L540853 +++$+++ u3023 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ B-9 +++$+++ For how long?
L540852 +++$+++ u3025 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ No. I must deactivate you.
L540851 +++$+++ u3023 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ B-9 +++$+++ No. Can I move now?
L540850 +++$+++ u3025 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
L540849 +++$+++ u3023 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ B-9 +++$+++ No.
L540848 +++$+++ u3025 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ Do you know anything about Shinzon's plans against the Federation?
L540847 +++$+++ u3025 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ I know.
L540846 +++$+++ u3023 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ B-9 +++$+++ I do not understand.
L540845 +++$+++ u3025 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
L540844 +++$+++ u3023 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ B-9 +++$+++ Why?
L540843 +++$+++ u3025 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ Because you are dangerous.
L540842 +++$+++ u3023 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ B-9 +++$+++ Why?
L540841 +++$+++ u3025 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ No, I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines.
L540840 +++$+++ u3023 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ B-9 +++$+++ Brother. I cannot move.
L540519 +++$+++ u3025 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ Is that your final answer?
L540518 +++$+++ u3023 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ B-9 +++$+++ No.
L540517 +++$+++ u3025 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ Do you know the name of the Captain of this vessel?
L540516 +++$+++ u3023 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ B-9 +++$+++ No.
L540515 +++$+++ u3025 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ Can you remember our father?
L540514 +++$+++ u3023 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ B-9 +++$+++ I am in a room with lights.
L540513 +++$+++ u3025 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ Do you know where you are?
L540449 +++$+++ u3025 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ No. My name is Data... I am your brother.
L540448 +++$+++ u3023 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ B-9 +++$+++ You are me.
L540447 +++$+++ u3025 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ Do you know who I am?
L540445 +++$+++ u3023 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ B-9 +++$+++ I was in space for a long time. Then a ship belonging to the “Talosians" picked me up. They asked me where I came from. I told them people called the “Pakleds" took me from my homeworld. They are fat…

L540443 +++$+++ u3023 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ B-9 +++$+++ Fuzzy face is gone.
L540436 +++$+++ u3023 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ B-9 +++$+++ I was taken from my homeworld by people called the "PakJeds." They are fat. They traded me to a ship belonging to the "Bolians." The "Bolians" are blue. They put me in a seat and asked me questions. Then they were attacked by another ship...
L540435 +++$+++ u3025 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ DATA +++$+++ Can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you?
L541108 +++$+++ u3024 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ Soon then.  I’ll save the last dance for you.
L541107 +++$+++ u3031 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Not tonight, I have work here.
L541106 +++$+++ u3024 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ They're running me ragged. Nothing but question day and night... I love it! Come to dinner and 1'1 tell you all about it. There's a Bajoran band at the officer's mess.
L541105 +++$+++ u3031 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Reminds me of a young doctor I used to know...
L541104 +++$+++ u3024 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ You can' t imagine them, Jean Luc. They're kids! All with advance degrees in xenobiology and out to conquer every disease in the quadrant.
L540878 +++$+++ u3031 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ How far we've come. Let me know if you need anything.
L540877 +++$+++ u3024 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ That was another time.
L540876 +++$+++ u3031 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ To seek out new life and new civilizations. Zephyr. Cochran’s own words. When Charles Darwin set out on the H.M.S. Beagle, on his journey into the unknown... he sailed without a single musket.
L540869 +++$+++ u3031 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ I'm counting on it... We've been ordered to head to sector 3274. Starfleet is diverting the fleet to meet us there.
L540868 +++$+++ u3024 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ But we do have one advantage.  He needs your blood to live. He might come after you first.
L540838 +++$+++ u3024 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ I can't be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating.
L540837 +++$+++ u3031 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ How long does he have?
L540832 +++$+++ u3031 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Dying?
L540831 +++$+++ u3024 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. Remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. He was engineered to skip thirty years of life. But since the RNA sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down. He's dying.
L540830 +++$+++ u3031 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ But the Romulans abandoned the plan.
L540829 +++$+++ u3024 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ The more I studied his DNA the more confusing it got. Finally I could only come to one conclusion... Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing. He was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly, so he could replace you.
L540729 +++$+++ u3031 +++$+++ m198 +++$+++ PICARD +++$+++ Can you describe it, Deanna?
