L184076 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Excuse me?
L184075 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Why did you follow me yesterday?
L184056 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Excuse me.
L184055 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ I should be very happy to obtain the correct price for this.  I apologize if I appear abrupt.  I am rusty at social graces.  How do you find Cairo?  Did you visit the Pyramids?
L184054 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ I don't believe that.  I think you are insulted by me, somehow. You're a foreigner too, aren't you, here, in this market?
L184053 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ That insults them.
L184052 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ I don't care to bargain.
L184051 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.
L184050 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ I don't want to go back.
L184049 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
L184048 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Excuse me?
L184047 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Which stall?
L184046 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?
L184045 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ They don't see foreign women in this market.  How much did you pay?
L184044 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Hello!  Good morning.
L184043 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ How much did you pay?
L183961 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Yes, thank you, Gyges, son of Daskylus - Candaules said to him I don't think you believe me when I tell you how beautiful my wife is. And although Gyges replied he did find the Queen magnificent the King insisted he would find some way to prove beyond dispute that she was fairest of all women.  Do you all know this story?
L183960 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Daskylus…
L183957 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ I'm sorry - what have you noticed?
L183956 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ I can't sing.  but I can tell a story.  I might need a prompt.  Do you have your Herodotus?  I've noticed you carry it…
L183950 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ What kind of fossils?
L183949 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Isn't Zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms?
L183918 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ A thing is still a thing no matter what you place in front of it.  Big car, slow car, chauffeur-driven car, still a car.
L183917 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ I wanted to meet a man who could write such a long paper with so few adjectives.
L183916 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Thank you.
L184575 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ And the people here don't want us. Are you kidding?  The Egyptians are desperate to get rid of the Colonials…  - isn't that right? Their best people get down on hands and knees begging to be spared a knighthood.  Isn't that right?
L184574 +++$+++ u5049 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CLIFTON +++$+++ Sorry, what's your point?
L184573 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Oops!  Mustn't say International. Dirty word.  Filthy word.  His Majesty! Die Führer!  Il Duce.
L184332 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ I haven't, no.  Sorry.
L184331 +++$+++ u5049 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CLIFTON +++$+++ It's Geoffrey under this.
L184330 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ What?
L184329 +++$+++ u5049 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CLIFTON +++$+++ Have you seen Katharine?
L184182 +++$+++ u5049 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CLIFTON +++$+++ Why are you people so threatened by a woman?!
L184181 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Very well.
L184180 +++$+++ u5049 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CLIFTON +++$+++ I've known Katharine since she was three, my aunt is her aunt, we were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife.  I think I'd know what is and what isn't too much for her.  I think she's know herself.
L184179 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ All the same, I, were I you I would be concerned -
L184178 +++$+++ u5049 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CLIFTON +++$+++ Are you mad?  Katharine loves it here. She told me yesterday.
L184177 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ I think the desert is, it's - for a woman - it's very tough, I wonder if it's not too much for her.
L184176 +++$+++ u5049 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CLIFTON +++$+++ Appropriate?
L184175 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Clifton - your wife - do you think it's appropriate to leave her?
L184174 +++$+++ u5049 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CLIFTON +++$+++ You too.  Good luck!
L184173 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Safe journey.
L184168 +++$+++ u5049 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CLIFTON +++$+++ Portraits.  The Brigadier, the Brigadier's wife, the Brigadier's dogs, the Brigadier at the Pyramids, the Brigadier breathing.
L184167 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ What kind of photographs?
L183924 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ There you have me.
L183923 +++$+++ u5049 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CLIFTON +++$+++ Uxoriousness - that's my favorite kind of love.  Excessive love of one's wife.
L183920 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Still a car.
L183919 +++$+++ u5049 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CLIFTON +++$+++ A broken car?
L184734 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ No!  NO!  Don't radio anybody, just give me the fucking jeep!
L184733 +++$+++ u5059 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ I understand you are agitated - perhaps you would like to sit down while I radio back to HQ -
L184732 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Look, listen to me.  A woman is dying - my wife! - is dying seventy miles from here.  I have been walking for three days!  I don't want to spell my name, I want you to give me this jeep!
L184731 +++$+++ u5059 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ Almásy - would you mind just spelling that for me?  What nationality would that be?
L184730 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Count Laszlo de Almásy. The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.
L184729 +++$+++ u5059 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ Right.  And what's your name, sir?
L184728 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Am I not talking sense? -  forgive me, I'm, I've been walking, I've - there's a woman badly injured at Gilf Kebir, in the Cave of Swimmers.  I am a member of the Royal Geographical Society.
L184727 +++$+++ u5059 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ If I could just see some identification.
L184726 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ What?
L184725 +++$+++ u5059 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ Do you have your papers, sir?
L184724 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ No, I'm not thinking clearly - I need a doctor too, to come with me, can I take this vehicle?  I'll pay, of course - and some morphine and…  Seventy miles - I can be back here by dusk.
L184723 +++$+++ u5059 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ I see.
L184722 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ I desperately need a jeep.  There's been an accident.
L184721 +++$+++ u5059 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ Yes, of course.  So, golly, where have you come from?
L184720 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Could I trouble you for some water?
L184719 +++$+++ u5059 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ Good morning!
L184663 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ There is no God.  But I hope someone looks after you.
L184662 +++$+++ u5057 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MADOX +++$+++ May God make safety your companion.
L184661 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Goodbye, my friend. They shake hands.
L184660 +++$+++ u5057 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MADOX +++$+++ I have to teach myself not to read too much into everything.  Comes of too long having to read so much into hardly anything at all.
L184659 +++$+++ u5057 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MADOX +++$+++ I'll leave the plane in the hangar at Kufra Oasis.  So if you need it…hard to know how long one's talking about.  We might all be back in a month or two.
L184658 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Tomorrow afternoon.  Don't worry. I'll be ready.
L184657 +++$+++ u5057 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MADOX +++$+++ When's Clifton picking you up?
L184656 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Yes.  It was.  Thanks for the compass. I'll look after it for you.
L184655 +++$+++ u5057 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MADOX +++$+++ We didn't care about countries. Did we?  Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans.  None of that mattered, did it?  It was something finer than that.
L184654 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ I told you so.
L184653 +++$+++ u5057 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MADOX +++$+++ Bermann thinks he'll be interned, poor fellow.  I'm going to do what I can, but…  And D'Ag turns out to be a great admirer of Mussolini. So now you can say I told you so.
L184652 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Right.
L184651 +++$+++ u5057 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MADOX +++$+++ Had a letter from my wife.  The wisteria is still out, which I'm looking forward to.  She says Dorset is gripped with Invasion Fever.  Wrong coast I should have thought, still…
L184580 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Absolutely right, shut up. Lashings of apologies all round.
L184579 +++$+++ u5057 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MADOX +++$+++ Look, either shut up, or go home.
L184570 +++$+++ u5057 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MADOX +++$+++ Good, we're all here?  A toast, to the International Sand club - may it soon resurface.
L184569 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ I believe I'm rather late.
L184471 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Own the desert.
L184470 +++$+++ u5057 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MADOX +++$+++ What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears.  In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa.
L184469 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Why do they care about our maps?
L184468 +++$+++ u5057 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MADOX +++$+++ Don't be so bloody naïve.  You know there's a war breaking out.  This arrived this morning.  By order of the British Government - all International Expeditions to be aborted by May 1939.
L184467 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ What's the matter with you?
L184466 +++$+++ u5057 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MADOX +++$+++ Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government.  They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of.
L184465 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ In my room.
L184464 +++$+++ u5057 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MADOX +++$+++ And where are the Expedition Maps?
L184462 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Which we couldn't explore because of rocks, because of cross-winds, it's sloppy.  And here - and here - we could be staring at Zerzura.
L184461 +++$+++ u5057 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MADOX +++$+++ Which we've overflown twice.
L184460 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ No, because you can't see from the air! If you could explore from the air life would be very simple!  Look!  What is that?  Is that a wadi? That whole spur is a real possibility…
L184459 +++$+++ u5057 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MADOX +++$+++ And I'm telling you there's nothing there to explore.
L184201 +++$+++ u5057 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MADOX +++$+++ Bermann!
L184200 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned badly.
L184199 +++$+++ u5057 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MADOX +++$+++ I'll be back as quick as I can. Thirty-six hours at the outside.
L183982 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Cut the ropes.  I left a note, on his blanket.  At the next Geographical Society I shall await with great interest the announcement of the Fenelon-Barnes Slave Knot.  The Girl wouldn't leave, of course.  Her father had sold her for a camel. He turns over the propeller, the engine cranks up.
L183981 +++$+++ u5057 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MADOX +++$+++ I was talking about the girl.
L183980 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ I looked at them.  They're shrubs, small trees.  Exquisite.  And fossilized, rock hard. He walks away to the nose of the plane.
L183979 +++$+++ u5057 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MADOX +++$+++ What did you do?
L183978 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Her hands and feet were tied.
L183977 +++$+++ u5057 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MADOX +++$+++ You shouldn't go into another man's tent. It's inexcusable.
L183976 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Looking for the fossils.  Why should we wait until we're in London?  This girl was probably twelve years old.
L183975 +++$+++ u5057 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MADOX +++$+++ What did you think you were doing in his tent?
L184740 +++$+++ u5050 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CORPORAL +++$+++ That's your name innit?  Count Fucking Arsehole Von Bismarck? What's that supposed to be then, Irish?
L184739 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Fritz?  What are you talking about? Who's Fritz?
L184738 +++$+++ u5050 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CORPORAL +++$+++ Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen to another word from you I'll give you a fucking good hiding.
L184737 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Please - I beg you, I beg you, I beg you, please listen to me, this is a terrible mistake. Just stop, please, and listen to me.  My wife is dying.
L184736 +++$+++ u5050 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CORPORAL +++$+++ Shut-up!
L184735 +++$+++ u5046 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ ALMÁSY +++$+++ Hey!  Hey!  Stop this jeep!  Let me out of here - there's a woman dying, there's a woman dying while I'm - Hey!
L184006 +++$+++ u5047 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Thank you.
L184005 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Would it? She kisses him, very softly, on the lips.
L184004 +++$+++ u5047 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Just kiss me.  It would mean such a lot to me.
L184003 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ No, I'll get you some tea. Wait till you're in Naples.  You'll find a girl there.
L184000 +++$+++ u5047 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ You're the prettiest girl I ever saw.
L183999 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Your leg will be fine.  A lot of shrapnel came out - I saved you the pieces.
L183998 +++$+++ u5047 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Okay.
L183997 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ How are you?
L184563 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ Oh Jesus.  Oh Jesus Christ.
L184562 +++$+++ u5058 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MÜLLER +++$+++ Go!  Hey!  Go! Caravaggio is in terror.
L184555 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ Don't cut me.  Come on.
L184554 +++$+++ u5058 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MÜLLER +++$+++ Or was it Toronto?
L184553 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ Don't cut me.
L184552 +++$+++ u5058 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MÜLLER +++$+++ Well, you must know.  You were brought up Libya, yes?
L184550 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ I slept with the girl.  I've got a wife in Tripoli.  A girl comes up and points at you, you only see trouble.
L184549 +++$+++ u5058 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MÜLLER +++$+++ Why is there so much nose?  I can't hear myself think!  Look - give me something.  So we can all get out of this room.  A name.  A code.  It's too hot.
L184547 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ A nurse?  Well, sure, a nurse is great. A nurse?  Great.
L184546 +++$+++ u5058 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MÜLLER +++$+++ We don't have a doctor, but we do have a nurse.
L184545 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ Yes, I've been asking for weeks, a month, I don't know, also my leg was -
L184541 +++$+++ u5058 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MÜLLER +++$+++ You are a Canadian spy working for the Allies.  Code-name Moose.
L184540 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ It's impossible.  I was buying or selling something.  I've been to Cairo many times.
L184539 +++$+++ u5058 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MÜLLER +++$+++ It is you.  This was taken in Cairo at British Headquarters - July 41. And so was this - August 41.  And this -February 42.
L184538 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ I don't know.
L184537 +++$+++ u5058 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MÜLLER +++$+++ Is this you?
L184536 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ I keep explaining.  You've got the wrong man.  My name is Bellini - Antonio Bellini.  Bellini, Caravaggio, both painters, I think that is confusing you.
L184535 +++$+++ u5058 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MÜLLER +++$+++ Petty thief, six months imprisonment Kingston Penitentiary, 1937.
L184534 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ No.
L184533 +++$+++ u5058 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MÜLLER +++$+++ David Caravaggio.
L184808 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ I can get in the back.
L184807 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ She can take you as far as Florence.
L184806 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Buon' giorno.
L184774 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ What's happened?  Kip!  What's happening? Don't shoot, please, don't shoot anybody.
L184773 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ Well, then ask him his name!
L184412 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ No-one should own music.  The real question is who wrote the song?
L184411 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ I think that's called looting.
L184410 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ I liberated it.
L184409 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Where did you find that?
L184308 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Please don't creep around this house.
L184307 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ Ask him.  Ask your saint who he is. Ask him who he's killed.
L184306 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ I don't know what that means.
L184305 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ I'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't even know.  It's like he slammed a door in Cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in Tobruk.
L184304 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ What?  How could he have?  When?
L184303 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ What if I told you he did this to me?
L184302 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Ask him.
L184301 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ Who are his ghosts?
L184300 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ I'm not in love with him.  I'm in love with ghosts.  And so is he. He's in love with ghosts.
L184299 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ You have to protect yourself from sadness.  This is the thing I've learned.  You're in love with him, aren't you? Your patient.  Do you think he's a saint or something?  Because of the way he looks?  I don't think he is.
L184298 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ I'll have some of your water.  It's hot.
L184297 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Don't touch me if you're going to try and fuck me.
L184296 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ Hana?  Hana?  Are you alright?
L184141 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ Some gave me a dress.  You know what's great?  What I'm learning? You win a war and you not only gain the miles you get the moral ground. Everywhere I go, we're in the right. I like that.
L184140 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ What do you do?  What are you doing here?
L184139 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ You should be happy.  What were you going to do for him when it ran out? He pulls out more phials from his jacket.
L184138 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ It's a week.  We didn't know where you were - or if you coming back, or -
L184137 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ Can you cook the rabbit or will you try and bring that back to life?
L184136 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ I could help you.  I could get you off that.
L184135 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ Rabbit hunting.
L184134 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Where've you been?
L184133 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ Supper. Hana calls after him.
L184035 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ Fine.  I'm not looking.
L184034 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Because we're fine here.  I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company, I don't need to be looked at.
L184033 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ I'm okay.  Look, it's a big house. We needn't disturb each other.  I can shoot a pistol!  I'll sleep in the stables.  I don't care where I sleep.  I don't sleep.
L184032 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ If you said yes I would have had a reason.  You should let me redress those bandages.  Before you go.
L184031 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ No.
L184030 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ So you can shoot a pistol?
L184029 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ I'd like to stay.  That's the long and short of it.  I mean, you know blah-blah if it's convenient, if there's room blah-blah-blah.  I have to do some work here -I speak the language. There are Partisans to be -  -we embrace them and see if we can relieve them of their weapons, you know - while we hug.  I was a thief, so they think I'd be good at that.
L184028 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ So was my Patient.
L184027 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ Yeah, for a while.
L184026 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ You were in Africa?
L184025 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ They're fresh.  I haven't eaten an egg in…have you noticed there are chickens? You get chickens in Italy but no eggs. In Africa there were always eggs, but never chickens. Who separates them?
L184023 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Bonjour.
L184022 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ I met your friend Mary.  She said I should stop and see if you were okay. Apparently we're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in Montreal. Cabot, north of Laurier.  Bonjour.
L184021 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ What do you want?
L184020 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ Are you Hana?
L184019 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ Buon' Giorno! Hana turns, startled and suspicious.
L184761 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ No, now I can't kill you.
L184760 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ You can't kill me.  I died years ago.
L184759 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ You get to the morning and the poison leaks away, doesn't it? Black nights, fucking black nights, when you want to howl like a dog. I thought I would kill you.  You killed my friends, you ruined my hands.  But the girl was always here, like some Guardian Angel.
L184758 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ Yes, I got back there finally to keep my promise.  To come back for her. And then of course I couldn't… I couldn't even do that properly.
L184757 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ And did you never see Katharine? You never got back to the Cave?
L184683 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ Is that what you thought?  That I betrayed the British?  The British betrayed me.  The British betrayed me.
L184682 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ But you were among the British, they were your friends - why betray them?
L184681 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ Thousands of people did die, just different people.
L184680 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ There was a result to what you did. It wasn't just another expedition.  It did this.  If the British hadn't unearthed your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could have died.
L184679 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ The rest meant nothing to me.
L184678 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ What did you say?
L184677 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ I had to get back to the desert. I made a promise.  The rest meant nothing to me.
L184676 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ You were the only man who knew the desert well enough, the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing.
L184675 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ And you thought you'd come and settle the score?
L184674 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ Before you went over to the Germans, before you got Rommel's spy across the desert and inside British headquarters. He took some pretty good photographs - I saw mine in that torture room in Tobruk, so they made an impression.
