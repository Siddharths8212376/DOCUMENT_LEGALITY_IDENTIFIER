L131339 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
L131338 +++$+++ u705 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I was gonna show it to Homer...  They made him a captain already-- *Captain* Worthington!
L131337 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ It's time somebody ate *them*.
L131746 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ No. You warned me. I didn't listen, but you warned me.
L131745 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry.
L131744 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ I'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you. It was... unnecessary.
L131743 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ I know you don't think much of being needed, or of me for that matter...
L131742 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Sure. Thanks.
L131741 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ This came for you a couple of days ago. Olive asked me to bring it. With everything happening, I guess she forgot.
L131740 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ She knows how to take care of herself.
L131739 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ Do you think she'll be all right?
L131719 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ You say that as though it's some awful thing!  I never stopped loving Wally!
L131718 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...
L131717 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ Please don't...
L131716 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ "...did." Well, okay.
L131715 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did.
L131714 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ I *helped* you not to think about Wally. You were so upset--you couldn't stand worrying about him, about his being killed and not coming back-- but when you were with me, you could stop worrying... well, for a while, anyway. This is how I helped you, right?
L131713 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ No, that's not it--I just want to be sure I understand you.
L131712 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ Please don't make me say it again.
L131663 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ What do you want me to *do*?
L131662 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ He's *alive*. He still loves you.  So do I.
L131661 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ He's *paralyzed*!
L131660 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ I know, I'm sorry.
L131659 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ For God's sake, Homer, Wally's been shot down!
L131658 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ You got up! You *did* something! If you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a *decision*!
L131657 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ Stop it! Just cut it out!
L131656 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ I'm not trying to be anything--I'm just doing nothing! If I wait and see long enough, then--with any luck-- I won't *ever* have to make up my mind! Decisions can be painful, after all...
L131655 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ If you're trying to be funny, Homer...
L131654 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ *Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something. Let's just sit here all night!
L131653 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ Please don't move, don't go anywhere.
L131650 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ No, don't--that's something. Nothing is nothing.  Don't even look at me. I want...
L131649 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ I know.  Is *that* nothing.
L131648 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come home. I'm afraid to see him, too.
L131647 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Isn't that like waiting and seeing?
L131646 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ Nothing.
L131645 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Just tell me. I'll do whatever you want to do.
L131604 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ We've got to keep her away from that bastard!
L131603 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Wait... *wait*! Are you sure?
L131602 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ He's the *father*! He's her baby's father!
L131601 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Mr. Rose *knows*?
L131600 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ You don't understand! It's her father...
L131599 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
L131598 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ She won't go to St. Cloud's!
L131579 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ Well, we have to help her!
L131578 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere...
L131577 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ We should take her to St. Cloud's. That much is obvious, isn't it? Let her make up her mind when she gets there...
L131557 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ It's a good thing I didn't have that baby, isn't it?
L131556 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Okay, okay--I know you do, too.
L131555 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do.
L131554 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Fine. That's all there is to it then.
L131553 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.
L131552 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ So we should "wait and see." For how long?
L131551 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ Do you think I'm having a good time? Do you think I'm just *teasing* you? Do you think I *know* whether I want you or Wally?
L131517 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ I'm just waiting and seeing. Like you said.
L131516 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ Olive told me.  You might have told me yourself.
L131489 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ We have to wait and see. I think that, for *everything* in life, you have to wait and see.
L131488 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ *What* will be okay?
L131487 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ It will be okay.
L131486 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Just tell me. Do you want me to go? Do you want me to stay?
L131481 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Right.
L131480 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ I *know* this was right.
L131475 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ Nobody will swim here until next summer. By then, the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sand--there won't be any sharp edges.
L131474 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Aren't you worried that people will cut their feet?
L131457 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ Not with the right girl you wouldn't.
L131456 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie.
L131455 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't *come* here to watch the movie.
L131454 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ How could you not *care* about the movie?
L131452 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ The *speaker*. For the movie sound.
L131451 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?
L131450 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.
L131449 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Did you come here with Wally--to *not* watch movies?
L131448 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies.
L131447 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ Just a little privacy.
L131446 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ I never *asked* for any responsibility.
L131445 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ But you had so much *responsibility*.
L131444 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.
L131443 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ You don't miss it?
L131441 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ I didn't say that. Growing up in an orphanage, you're always lonely. You're just never alone.
L131440 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ At least you were never lonely.
L131439 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ It was my favorite night at the orphanage--movie night. We'd race into the dining hall. Of course everyone wanted to sit in front, so we'd be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing.
L131438 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ What are you so crazy about the movies for?
L131436 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ Yes... and no. When you come here, you don't really care about the movie.
L131435 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ The screen is enormous! Imagine King Kong up *there*! Have you seen a lot of movies here?
L131434 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ You think? Maybe I was.  I love this place!
L131433 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ You're a natural. You were born to drive a car like this.
L131370 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ Well, she was in a weakened condition...  I don't know! What about "King Kong"?! Is that medically possible?
L131369 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ What's the *medical* explanation?
L131368 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Oh, sure!
L131367 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.
L131366 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ And what did she die of, exactly?
L131365 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ She *did* love him!  How many women have you known?
L131364 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ First she loved him, then she didn't, then no one else could have him...
L131363 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ I *did* like it. All I said was, "It's not 'King Kong'."
L131362 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ But you looked as if you liked it.
L131350 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ "King Kong". It's really good.
L131349 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ You've seen only one movie? Which one?
L131348 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Yes! I've only seen one, though.
L131347 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ When they watched at all. Do you like movies?
L131346 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ People watched the movies in their cars?
L131345 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout.
L131344 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ A movie *outside*?
L131326 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ I don't think Mr. Rose would leave without you.
L131325 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ I better go.
L131324 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Okay...
L131323 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ You have to come to my dad's lobster pound and see one, then.
L131322 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ When I'm not thinking about Wally. I'm not good at being alone.  Oh, goodness. You meant... yes, I'm fine. I...  ...I don't suppose you've seen a lobster yet.
L131321 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Uh... have you been *feeling* okay?
L131320 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ I'm *never* bored! It's all very... different for me... here.
L131319 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ So. Not bored yet?
L131171 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Sure... I'll see you around.
L131170 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ I guess I'll see you around the orchards. Thanks for everything.
L131155 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ It should taper off tomorrow, but it can come back again. You have cramps?  They'll ease up, almost entirely. As long as the bleeding isn't heavy, it's normal.
L131154 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ I'm a little worried about the...  ...about how much bleeding is okay.
L131146 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ I understand.
L131145 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
L131144 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Oh...
L131143 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ Burma!
L131142 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Where's Mandalay?
L131141 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him!
L131140 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ I know.
L131136 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ I've never seen the ocean, either.
L131135 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ Really?
L131134 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ I've never seen a lobster.
L131133 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.
L131132 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Is your family in the apple business, too?
L131048 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ Two.
L131047 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ How many months are you?
L131045 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ Candy. Candy Kendall.
L131044 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ So, Mrs...
L131595 +++$+++ u706 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ ROSE ROSE +++$+++ No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just...
L131594 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's not Jack, is it? It's *Muddy*! Is it Muddy?
L131592 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ Why?
L131591 +++$+++ u706 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ ROSE ROSE +++$+++ I can't go nowhere.
L131590 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ I know where you can go. Homer and I can take you...
L131587 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ Yes, I *have*!
L131586 +++$+++ u706 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ ROSE ROSE +++$+++ You ain't been through what I been through, Candy.
L131585 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ Rose, I know what's going on. Homer told me. I got pregnant, too--about a year ago.  I've been through this.
L131584 +++$+++ u706 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ ROSE ROSE +++$+++ I don't need no more clothes, thank you.
L131583 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ I've got some more clothes for you-- I just keep forgetting to bring them with me.
L131582 +++$+++ u706 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ ROSE ROSE +++$+++ Hi...
L131581 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ Hi...
L131543 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ Oh, he's fine! I just heard from him. He's bombing all these places...
L131542 +++$+++ u706 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ ROSE ROSE +++$+++ How is that Wally doing?
L131245 +++$+++ u707 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ *Homer* liked it!  Didn't you?
L131244 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ He thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches.
L131242 +++$+++ u707 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ He *loved* it!  Didn't you?
L131241 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ You've been giving him a *flying* lesson!
L131240 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ I know what you've been doing.
L131239 +++$+++ u707 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ I was just showing Homer the orchards... kind of a geography lesson.
L131173 +++$+++ u707 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ I love you, too. See you tomorrow.
L131172 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ I love you, Wally.
L131131 +++$+++ u707 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ Well, *picking* them is! It's about as exciting as... walking!
L131130 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ There! You said it was boring.
L131125 +++$+++ u707 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ Well, they aren't.
L131124 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."
L131123 +++$+++ u707 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ I never said they were boring.
L131122 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ Wally thinks apples are boring.
L131114 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ No--keep it down. I want to feel the air.
L131113 +++$+++ u707 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ I don't want you to walk--I want to carry you. Should I put the top up? It might get cold.
L131112 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ I'm okay--I can walk.
L131026 +++$+++ u707 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ WALLY +++$+++ Well, this *is* an orphanage.
L131025 +++$+++ u691 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ So many children. Are they all orphans?
L130919 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Only the right people can have you, Curly.
L130918 +++$+++ u692 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CURLY +++$+++ You mean somebody asked?
L130917 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ Nobody special enough, Curly.
L130916 +++$+++ u692 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CURLY +++$+++ Nobody's asked for me, have they?
L130915 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ That's true.
L130914 +++$+++ u692 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CURLY +++$+++ Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone take *any* of us!
L130913 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ You're one of the best, Curly--we couldn't let just anyone take you.
L130912 +++$+++ u692 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CURLY +++$+++ Nobody ever wants me!
L130911 +++$+++ u695 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ HOMER +++$+++ They wanted a girl.
L130910 +++$+++ u692 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ CURLY +++$+++ I thought they might take me.
L131408 +++$+++ u693 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ EDNA +++$+++ Does he *know* he's supposed to be in India? Does he even *want* to come back?
L131407 +++$+++ u697 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ LARCH +++$+++ Edna! Come dance with me! Let's be foolish tonight.
L131406 +++$+++ u693 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ EDNA +++$+++ I just wanted to ask you...
L131359 +++$+++ u697 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ LARCH +++$+++ I wouldn't worry, Edna, that he doesn't have money. If he gets hungry, he can pick his dinner!
L131358 +++$+++ u693 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ EDNA +++$+++ He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too.
L131357 +++$+++ u697 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ LARCH +++$+++ Or that he can't be bothered to write us a proper letter? A dissertation on apples, we don't need!
L131289 +++$+++ u693 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ EDNA +++$+++ But what about school records? Homer doesn't have any *diplomas*...
L131288 +++$+++ u697 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ LARCH +++$+++ So here is my candidate. What do you think?
L131285 +++$+++ u697 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ LARCH +++$+++ Well, we can only guess about that, Edna. They *are* against the law.
L131284 +++$+++ u693 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ EDNA +++$+++ You mean they'll replace you with someone who won't perform abortions.
L131279 +++$+++ u697 +++$+++ m44 +++$+++ LARCH +++$+++ "...graduated Bowdoin College, 1935, and Harvard School of Medicine, 1939."
