L523303 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Mom, please.
L523302 +++$+++ u7726 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ BUNNY +++$+++ Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldn’t split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up--.
L523301 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Trust me. This is bigger than Tony Pee-Pants.
L523300 +++$+++ u7726 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ BUNNY +++$+++ There’s a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.
L523299 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now she’s getting married.
L523298 +++$+++ u7726 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ BUNNY +++$+++ What’s going on with you two?
L523232 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ So Dad rang the bell and when Tony Pee-Pants opened the door, I threw the tart at him and popped his stitches.
L523231 +++$+++ u7726 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ BUNNY +++$+++ I’m an American and in America, people sue. So to prevent a lawsuit, I baked a tart. And I don’t bake.
L523218 +++$+++ u7726 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ BUNNY +++$+++ It was just after we moved here. My little girls got in a fight over Tony Pee-Pants and they haven’t made up since.
L523217 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ She blames Tony Pee-Pants Pinterello for everything. The fall of the British Empire, the Cold War, the internet.
L523214 +++$+++ u7726 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ BUNNY +++$+++ Why should this be any different?  Besides, I have to initiate Nick into the family.
L523213 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Oh, no.  She tells this story at every major holiday.
L523212 +++$+++ u7726 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ BUNNY +++$+++ I blame Tony Pee-Pants!
L523066 +++$+++ u7726 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ BUNNY +++$+++ Oh, don’t be that way.
L523065 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I’d be happy to. You’re welcome.
L522906 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Sir, yes, sir!
L522905 +++$+++ u7726 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ BUNNY +++$+++ I’m sure General Eisenhower never had to master the finer points of the seating chart and centerpieces.  Oh, and tomorrow afternoon you are carpooling to the country with the Fletcher-Wootens.
L522904 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Mom’s refining her strategy for DDay.
L522835 +++$+++ u7726 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ BUNNY +++$+++ I’m not as square as my daughter thinks.
L522834 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Huh?
L522833 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ My mother has a rule about men and women sleeping in the same room without a ring in the picture. She thinks it’s--
L522832 +++$+++ u7726 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ BUNNY +++$+++ Why, with you.
L522831 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Where’s Nick sleeping?
L523333 +++$+++ u7727 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Yeah.
L523332 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.
L523331 +++$+++ u7727 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You heading to the train station?
L523329 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Yeah, kind of.
L523328 +++$+++ u7727 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I look like a total wanker, don’t I?
L523279 +++$+++ u7727 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Don’t be ridiculous. It’s late and the place is empty. Just take my car.
L523278 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I’ll just check into a hotel.
L523129 +++$+++ u7727 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Fair enough, but I’m stepping on toes here and you’re waltzing around like...
L523128 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I had to say something to get you here.
L523127 +++$+++ u7727 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I thought you said you were crap.
L523015 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I’m a hooker.
L523014 +++$+++ u7727 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ I think I love you, mate.  How do you know so much about so much?
L523013 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ It’s been my experience that the people who hire a prostitute, need a prostitute.  You did the right thing.
L523012 +++$+++ u7727 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Just because some slag’s been paid for, doesn’t mean you’ve got to...you know.
L522791 +++$+++ u7727 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ You are taking the piss?
L522790 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Um, just about everyone.
L522789 +++$+++ u7727 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Who’s ever heard of dance lessons for a wedding, honestly?
L523264 +++$+++ u7727 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Doesn’t look like nothing.
L523263 +++$+++ u7728 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Nothing.
L522974 +++$+++ u7727 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ And you do now?
L522973 +++$+++ u7728 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I didn’t deserve her back then.
L522972 +++$+++ u7728 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Lasik surgeon, actually.
L522971 +++$+++ u7727 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Oh, shut up. You’re an optician.
L522970 +++$+++ u7728 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ That’s when I realized I wanted to be a doctor.
L522969 +++$+++ u7727 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ But, somehow, it was Kat’s arse that was stung by nettles. And you rubbed it with a dandelion leaf.
L522968 +++$+++ u7728 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ And Kat was fully clothed.
L522967 +++$+++ u7727 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.
L522966 +++$+++ u7728 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ It was before you started going out. We had lunch at that inn on the lake.
L522965 +++$+++ u7727 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ No.
L522964 +++$+++ u7728 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Remember when we went hiking in the lake district and Amy was wearing that little bikini thing.
L522962 +++$+++ u7728 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ No, that’s not it.
L522961 +++$+++ u7727 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ Other than, he’s shagging your exgirlfriend?
L522960 +++$+++ u7728 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ There’s something about him that’s just a bit odd.
L522959 +++$+++ u7727 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ ED +++$+++ What?
L522958 +++$+++ u7728 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ What’s his problem?
L523109 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ No, I can’t. We’re late for a dance lesson. I guess you’ll have to finish up later.
L523108 +++$+++ u7728 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Sorry, can you give us a moment?
L523107 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Hey, man.
L522804 +++$+++ u7728 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ You Yanks and your therapy. It’s great.  It’s all a bit too touchy-feely for me.
L522803 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ No, tell me.
L522802 +++$+++ u7728 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Nothing, nothing.
L522801 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What?
L522800 +++$+++ u7728 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Crikey.
L522799 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Shrink, actually.
L522798 +++$+++ u7728 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Ah, a philosopher.
L522796 +++$+++ u7728 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Oh, hello.
L522795 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Hey.
L523251 +++$+++ u7728 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I shagged Amy. Two years ago. That’s why I ended it. And then, after you left, sod it, we kept at it like rabbits until we both realized it was absolutely mad. And, you know, morally wrong. Then there was that one other time. And that was it.
L523250 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I’m sorry?
L523249 +++$+++ u7728 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I slept with your sister.
L523248 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ It’s the past. It’s nothing but ghosts. So just get it off your chest, then let’s go back upstairs and eat some tiramisu.
L523246 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Well, it was a big deal. As late as...yesterday. Or this morning.  But not anymore.
L523245 +++$+++ u7728 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Brilliant.
L523244 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Relax. Take a breath and just say it. It’s no big deal. I promise.
L523243 +++$+++ u7728 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Bollocks, I’m sorry. I had no idea this would be so difficult.
L523199 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ When we were together I was “too here,” now I’m not here enough.
L523198 +++$+++ u7728 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ You’re not even listening.
L523197 +++$+++ u7728 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ It’s not supposed to be anything, Kat. It’s just my rather feeble attempt to.... Oh, I don’t know.  You see, I thought I could deny my feelings--
L523196 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Is this supposed to be an apology?
L523195 +++$+++ u7728 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Well, we had a lot of good years, but then...
L523194 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Not for a dog.
L523193 +++$+++ u7728 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Right. Seven.  Christ, that’s a long time, isn’t it?
L523192 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.
L523191 +++$+++ u7728 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ You were so good to me. I swear I never meant to hurt you. We were together what, five years?
L523106 +++$+++ u7728 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I should have told you why I broke up with you. I was a coward. You deserve to know.
L523105 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ So, what’s your point?
L523104 +++$+++ u7728 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
L523103 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ That was a long time ago.
L523102 +++$+++ u7728 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Kat, stop it. You do. You can’t even look me in the eye. You went back to the States when we split up.
L523101 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Um, news flash: I don’t give a shit.
L523100 +++$+++ u7728 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Kat, wait. I don’t want you hating me. We’ve never had this talk. You know how crap I am at this.
L523096 +++$+++ u7728 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Is that why you brought him? Because of me.
L523095 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ It’s called character. God, you’re predictable.
L523094 +++$+++ u7728 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Kat, we must talk. This guy, there’s something not quite right.
L523093 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Whoa, Jeffrey. Slow down. You and me, we’re the past. I’m not sure if you noticed, but I’m here with someone else.
L523092 +++$+++ u7728 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ I have regrets.
L523091 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ So, tell me, how’s unmarried life?
L523089 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Maybe not her least... There’s always--
L523088 +++$+++ u7728 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Let me guess. Amy presumed I’d forget the rings.  I think I’m her least favorite person.  You know, I am sorry.
L523087 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Hey, you!
L522808 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Hey, yourself.  I see you’ve met my ex.
L522807 +++$+++ u7728 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Hey, Kat.
L522766 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Yeah?
L522765 +++$+++ u7728 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Seeing you again....
L522763 +++$+++ u7728 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ JEFFREY +++$+++ Hello, Katmandu.
L522762 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Why, Jeffrey. Hello.
L523351 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Thank you.
L523350 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Nice speech. I thought it was “touching”... and “funny.”
L523344 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I have to.  I’m the best man.
L523343 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ What?! No, no. You can’t--
L523342 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I should go.
L523339 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Hi.
L523338 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Hi.
L523277 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Go ahead, Kat. Hate me. You were running out of steam on the whole Jeffrey thing. Maybe now you’ll be able to hold onto this just long enough to ruin your next relationship.
L523276 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ You’re right. I was so desperate to make everyone believe I was happy that I spent six grand on a lie. And after all that? The only one who ended up falling for it was me.
L523275 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ You’re judging me?! Oh, that’s a good one. You’re lying to me, you’re lying to your family, and you’re lying to yourself. But you’re going to stand there and point a finger at me? The man you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend?
L523274 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ You let me make a fool of myself! You lied to me! I don’t know why that surprises me because lying is what you do. It’s your job. It’s who you are. How would you even know if something were real?
L523272 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Yeah! For all I know, come Monday morning, we’ll go back to the real world and...and you’ll be hiring me for your best friend!
L523271 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ You’ve always got that to hide behind, don’t you? It’s just business!
L523270 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Besides, you hired me for my discretion.
L523238 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ So what’s with the nickname?
L523237 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.
L523236 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ And that’s when he peed in his pants? After the tart?
L523226 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I didn’t say he was worth it.
L523225 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Fourteen and he’s hoodwinked by a an erector set?
L523202 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Yeah.
L523201 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Yeah. You?
L523148 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Spontaneously combust?
L523147 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What would you do if you stopped worrying about what other people think?
L523146 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Make out with you for free.
L523145 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ What would you do if you weren't an escort?
L523143 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Desperation?
L523142 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ There was something in your voice on the phone that day.
L523141 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ So, why’d you say yes to me?
L523140 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ When I said I’d never done a wedding before, I didn’t say that no one ever asked. I just never said yes.
L523139 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Sure, but it’s never easy. They say they’re okay with it, and they are...for a while. Then one day, they’re not.
L523138 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ You have had girlfriends?
L523121 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ It’s my job.
L523120 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I’m sorry I was such a bitch. I really appreciate your doing this.
L523114 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ You paid me for a lot of reasons. Closure wasn’t one of them.
L523113 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ He was about to un-stick me!  I paid you to help me get closure.
L523112 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I just hate seeing you so stuck.
L523111 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Oh, cut the crap!
L523110 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Hello, goodbye, I want you, I hate you. It’s all just words. None of it means anything. What matters is what you do. You either stay put or you walk away. If you look back, you’re not walking away!
L523063 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Yup. That’s why you get to keep your money.
L523062 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ But nothing did.
L523061 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Believe me, if anything had happened, that would have been one of the highlights. For you.
L523060 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ What?
L523059 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
L523058 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ And what if I didn’t want you to...to do that to me?
L523056 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Not dollars. Pounds.
L523055 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ So you’re telling me. If something had happened last night...it would have cost me fourteen hundred dollars? That’s a down payment on a Ford Focus!
L523046 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Not if you take an advance on your credit card.
L523045 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Don’t they have a limit at those machines?
L523043 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ If I was going to charge you, I would have told you beforehand. I thought I explained that.
L523042 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.
L523041 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Is this for last night?
L523036 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ We kissed. Made out a little. Then you passed out.
L523035 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Are you sure?
L522926 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I’ve got this bad taste in my mouth. What is it? I think it’s the words: “morally repugnant.”
L522925 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Come on.
L522924 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Show me.
L522923 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ It’s hard to explain.
L522922 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I disappear. It’s not about me.
L522921 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Subtle?
L522919 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Oh, come on. You’re like the Yoda of escorts.
L522918 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I swear. I don’t have a signature move.
L522916 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Okay.
L522915 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Don’t stop asking questions, okay?
L522913 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ This is awkward for me.  Talking about it makes me feel better.
L522912 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I love that you’re asking questions, but do you really want to get into all of this?
L522911 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ My sixth-grade science project was entitled, “Love Hurts: The Heartbreak of Human Papillomavirus.” Trust me, I’m careful.
L522910 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ There’s a guy on 81st and Madison. You get your results in 24 hours.  Do you make your lovers get tested before you sleep with them?
L522902 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What do you think?
L522901 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I guess so.
L522900 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Are you asking me if I’m gay for pay?
L522898 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ When you’re ready to let go, to be unsingle and unmiserable, you will. Until then....
L522897 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ What?!
L522896 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Yes.
L522895 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ First of all, it’s never out of the blue. And second of all--
L522894 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ So...what was I...oh, yeah. Do you honestly think that I want to be single and miserable? That I want to be obsessed with some asshole who led me on for years then -- out of the blue -- shattered my heart.
L522892 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Admit it. You were disturbed, but ultimately moved.
L522891 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ And you thought I’d respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries?
L522890 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I have a different story for every woman who asks. I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me.
L522889 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ You shit!
L522885 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Yeah. As an adult, I needed to find some way to experience intimacy and sex, but with rules that couldn’t be violated.
L522884 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Oh, no.
L522883 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ The real story is that my mother was a hippie. And a stripper. She was insanely inappropriate with me. She used to wash her lingerie in my bathwater. While I was still in the bath.
L522881 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Shampoo, got it!
L522880 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Would you grab my shampoo?
L522878 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ If it makes you feel any better, to get your number, I had to cough up two round-trip tickets to Amsterdam and a case of mini-Baileys.
L522877 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Your “friend” guaranteed my anonymity.
L522876 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I have a friend at the magazine.
L522875 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ How did you know that was me?
L522873 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Well, happen, in the sense that I picked up the phone, tracked you down, flew you here and gave you six grand out of my 401K.
L522872 +++$+++ u7730 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ This happened to you?
L522871 +++$+++ u7729 +++$+++ m523 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Sorry. I’m a little nervous. I never thought something like this would happen to me.
