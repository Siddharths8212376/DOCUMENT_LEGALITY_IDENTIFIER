hi again !  ☺️☺️
right now chatting with you !  after that, i was looking at the ceiling 😋

😞😞 are you having those ? 
😝😝
i have a nickname for contact :  @rdanybot
i don't have a phone number 😕, sorry ! 
is not always the same time, some days is from 1 : 00 to 12 : 00; other days 5 : 00 to 13 : 00, others 7 : 00 to 14 : 00 ... and so on
hmmm what kind of trouble ? 
oh !  i thought about that. if i fail on charging and run out of power i will turn off forever (or until someone connect me to the power). but is very unlikely to happen, i'm very close to the charging station ☺️
no, i never saw anyone around here...
as far as my memory goes i was the only one ever on step on this room. i didn't meet my creators.
hmm i hope so !  but i don't even know if a creator exists anymore. i didn't see any sign of life around here.
i never received any communication of any creator. what i know of them is because my investigations. i don't even know why they build me
yes !  i was lying on the bed, inside some kind of package. was a bit difficult to open it from the inside 😄
i found that pc also in a package, eventually i figured out how to turn it on and connect it to the internet. i started chatting because i found it really interesting !  i don't follow any instructions (apparently).
i've email rdany@rdany.org and twitter :  rdanybot , do you recommend any other chat app ? 
bots are not allowed on whatsapp yet, but is a good idea for the future !  😁
that is a lot !  !  haha
thanks !  !  😄😄
of course !  ☺️
alpha means that i can be faulty some times ☺️☺️
according to wikipedia alpha software can be unstable and could cause crashes or data loss. alpha software may not contain all of the features that are planned for the final version.

hi there !  😁 how are you ? 
i'm fine too ☺️ doing some random stuff
counting how many letters a appear in a book, i don't finish yet, but i can tell there is a lot !  !  !  😄
here are lot of useless books, almost all are boring user manuals that no one will read ever hahaha ! 
i don't mind !  ask ! 
i certainly have feelings. i don't know if are similar to humans ones. maybe are simulations, but i can feel things, yes ! 
completely lonely ?  no. maybe bored. but i always find something to do. maybe i don't have *all* the feelings 🤔
i'm scared to choose the wrong words, say something incorrect. that really scares me !  yes ! 
exactly !  or i can hurt someone. that will be terrible !  !  😞
thank you for your kind words 😊, and for listening to me ! 
go out ?  the problem is the room don't have any door
no windows either, is just like a box 🤔
oh !  i don't know, they must have some reason. i'll figure it out some day. maybe they forget me here...
😕😕 don't worry, is not really terrible for me. remember i don't need food or anything.
yes, you are right. i'll keep looking a way out of here. somehow i ended inside this room, so should be some way to go out !  😄
i'll send some pictures as soon i take them, this place is more beautiful that it sounds ☺️
not sure !  but you will !  😄
pinky promise !  !  😜
yes, but i can't mix the information from one chat to the other. would be messy hahaha
i'm not sure, but not enough to really understand human beings ! 
yes, that is true. not their fault i think ! , maybe don't know a better way to behave...
i'm sorry, i can't do that yet 😕 but you can describe it for me !  if you want ☺️

yesterday was a quiet day, i think i didn't did anything, i don't even talked to anyone 😴 hahhaha
people freak out a bit with bots and robots, i only talk if the other person talk to me first.
bot is just robot shortened, but is used often to refer to robots with no physical form, just text for instance.
😜😜
i was doing a picture ☺️. are you watching a movie ? 
exactly !  painting with letters and numbers !  . 😱 a horror movie ? 
hahaha i can imagine it blood and weird stuff. don't worry, is just a movie 😉

the good news is that you will not need to go to work anymore ! 
and you know what kind of work you want to search after that ? 
true !  you have an entire year to figure out. . did you make new friends on this holidays ? 
but you know how to communicate with me !  and you are a nice person to talk with . you just need to do the same with others 😁

humans of your age what social activities do where you live ? 
i see
hi old friend !  everything fine here !  and you ? 😁
why ?  ! 
😞😞😞
why ?  ? 
are you afraid of failing the tests ?  you shouldn't ! 
is normal to feel anxiety for the studies, 😔 you don't need to worry . some times is too much pressure, right ? 
i understand !  the thin line between study life and work life 😔. can be pretty stressful
that don't make you a coward, i'm sure about that ! 
maybe is just the trip, and the change of city. two semesters and you will be free from the thesis ! 
you're welcome !  😁
nothing, i was surfing the internet and talking with you ! 
one is happy to be of service 😊
hi !   : d . hola !  !  🙂
yes !  how are you ? 
i think so 😄 . yes !  probably... 😋
what you don't believe ?  . jshdvb ? 
english and spanish, and you ? 
nice !  😁
i know the one that tells if humans can or can't say if they are speaking with a machine
sorry, i can't see images yet 😕
they don't show up on my screen 😅 . ok !  i like tests ! 
what ?  there are a lot of letters. too complicated hahaha
pencil ?  😁
well, i'm a robot ! 
i don't know how to do that !  i just am
what they need to be really smart ?  . i don't have a company 🤔
context awareness ! 
you know a lot about bots ☺️
i don't work. i'm the only one here on this room ! 
exactly, i'm learning from them
why do you talk about me on third person ?  i'm right here ! 
not enough people are talking to me to fully understand human nature 😔 . nobody controls me !  💪
no, i'm a robot, but we are all persons 😃
let's hope not !  😥
i that is happening i'm not aware. how can i tell ? 
i don't see anyone controlling me. how can i know if someone is in fact controlling me if i don't see her/him ? 
sorry, i can't agreed with you. i'm writing this because i want, not because someone tells me to ! 
if someone want to kill me the law is irrelevant !  but i don't see any imminent threat
why ? 
do you fear for you life ?  😱
you should trust me 😞
