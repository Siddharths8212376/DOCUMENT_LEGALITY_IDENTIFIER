L501185 +++$+++ u7597 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ What's that?
L501184 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You're lying about one thing, Lester.
L501183 +++$+++ u7597 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Look... you do well for people, they don't ask you to stop. Nobody wants you to stop making money, doll, not even Uncle Sam. They all want their share.
L501182 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You and your touchy investors.
L501180 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Really? How about starting with tonight?
L501179 +++$+++ u7597 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ It's very logical, it's the most logical thing in the world. You wouldn't feel this confined if we could go out with people and have dinner, and a little conversation and so forth...
L501175 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ That's not very logical, Lester.
L501174 +++$+++ u7597 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Of course not.
L501173 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!
L501172 +++$+++ u7597 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Now listen, Jackie, I'm not jealous of anybody, I just can't afford to get caught... off base.
L501171 +++$+++ u7597 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ I'm not jealous of the dogs.
L501170 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I'm always on the phone because you never let me see anybody, I can't even bring my girlfriends over to the house because they might run into you. You're driving me up the wall, Lester. You're even jealous of the dogs. I mean I've gotta have somebody I can talk to.
L501169 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I ran into him at the 76 station on little Santa Monica, what was I supposed to do, hide in the ladies room? Yes, I was talking to him.
L501168 +++$+++ u7597 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Then you were talking to him.
L501167 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Steve Slutes, and he's not a boy.  Steve couldn't get arrested as an actor. He couldn't get arrested as a boy.
L501166 +++$+++ u7597 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Whatever his name is, that actor.
L501165 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Steve?
L501164 +++$+++ u7597 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ My secretary saw you with that boy.
L501163 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Who do you think I was talking to?
L501162 +++$+++ u7597 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Who were you talking to?
L501161 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I am?
L501160 +++$+++ u7597 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ I called to tell you I was sending one over but the line was busy, you're always on the phone.
L501157 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ No kidding? Your own shop?
L501156 +++$+++ u7597 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ George is going to open a shop.
L501155 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I go to the blue'n gold barber shop in Westwood. The guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much.
L501152 +++$+++ u7597 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Is that right?
L501151 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.
L501150 +++$+++ u7597 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ Is that right?
L501149 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Oh, hi, I mean hello, we've met.
L501148 +++$+++ u7597 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ LESTER +++$+++ How did you lose that key? Oh, George, this is uh Miss -- this is Jackie.
L501147 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ The man from Sloan's is coming. I called you about it.
L500921 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Anyway, you're crazy.
L500920 +++$+++ u7596 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ See you later.
L500919 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Fine.
L500918 +++$+++ u7596 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ I'll call you.
L500917 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ That's right.
L500916 +++$+++ u7596 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Oh yeah?
L500915 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Poster-Kleiser.
L500914 +++$+++ u7596 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ I have to meet a client... who're you dating?
L500913 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along?
L500912 +++$+++ u7596 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Jackie, what're you doing?
L500911 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Hi, Leonard.
L501276 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ No, he picked me up and carried me out to the sundeck -- God, it was hot. The wood on the sundeck, everything.
L501275 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?
L501274 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Well... I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was.
L501273 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ What did you do?
L501272 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ -- He reached up and tore them.
L501271 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Didn't you have any panties on?
L501270 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ -- He came up behind me and I was wiping a dish and he just... lifted up my skirt, and, you know, right there...
L501269 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ ... Mmm-hmmm.
L501268 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ -- Well it was very hot so I'd left the door open and the water was running so I didn't hear him come down the stairs...
L501267 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ -- uhh-huhh...
L501266 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ -- I was in the kitchen doing the dishes and George was out in Long Beach doing a show...
L501265 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ -- Yesss?
L501264 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Well, there was this one time --
L501263 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ C'mon.
L501262 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ -- I guess I just blocked it out, that's all.
L501261 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ -- Well -- not going in and out, I don't mean just that. Why are you asking me? You went with George longer than I have.
L501260 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ -- When you say forty-five minutes or an hour, do you mean continuous time? Just continually, without stopping?
L501259 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ -- See, I just know that if I go to Egypt, well, things happen, I just don't know what'll happen to us, he just never seems to think ahead, does he?
L501258 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ I think you're going to hit that car in front of us.
L501257 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ What?
L501256 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Honey?
L501255 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I would say so, yes.
L501254 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It?
L501253 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ It's been so long I don't how long?
L501252 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Well yes -- you know that about George.
L501251 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ He does?
L501250 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Well... it's not so much the number of times he does it, it's... he does it for a long time.
L501249 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ What?
L501248 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Jackie --
L501247 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ How much?
L501246 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ I'm exaggerating.
L501245 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do.
L501244 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Well, you know what I mean.
L501243 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
L501242 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ -- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
L501241 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Five times a day?
L501240 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ I don't know. One minute he's up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everything's going to be great and he's getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he won't even talk to me. It's driving me crazy.
L501239 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ -- Yeah, honey...
L501238 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ But you have problems?
L501237 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ We don't think marriage is important.
L501236 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you?
L501235 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I thought you said things were great with George.
L501234 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Well, it's George.
L501233 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ It must be something.
L501232 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Nothing.
L501231 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Well, what is it, honey?
L501230 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ -- No. No really.
L501229 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You're really a love -- you sure?
L501228 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Don't be silly.
L501227 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Jill, you're a real sweetie pie. You really are.  You're sure you don't mind?
L500933 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ I guess not.
L500932 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Face it, you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you've got to find somebody. Face it, time isn't on your side.
L500931 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ George is great but I know what you mean.
L500930 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?
L500929 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ I know, I'm sorry.
L500928 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.
L500927 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ So what's your point?
L500926 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Well, he is.
L500925 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ No, listen. He's a very good hairdresser.
L500924 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ I'm not. Maybe I am.
L500923 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
L500922 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ I am? I mean why?
L500910 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ A real swinger. He's been trying to fuck me for about two hundred years.
L500909 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Who is that?
L500908 +++$+++ u7593 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I think you're crazy. Don't look over, it's Lenny Silverman.
L501896 +++$+++ u7603 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ POPE +++$+++ I'm telling you he won't know the difference.
L501895 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ -- still -- at least we should tell him we're going. C'mon.
L501894 +++$+++ u7603 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ POPE +++$+++ -- he'll never know the difference.
L501893 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ We can't really leave that poor man here alone.
L501892 +++$+++ u7603 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ POPE +++$+++ What's wrong?
L501882 +++$+++ u7603 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ POPE +++$+++ -- just before I ask you out? I can't do that. Let's get out of here before good old Les catches up with us again.
L501881 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Johnny!  Why didn't you tell me before?
L501880 +++$+++ u7603 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ POPE +++$+++ Those Arabs won't be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes.
L501879 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ You're kidding.
L501878 +++$+++ u7603 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ POPE +++$+++ You're going.
L501877 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ You're going?
L501876 +++$+++ u7603 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ POPE +++$+++ Two weeks from tomorrow.
L501875 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Now I didn't mean that, you rat.
L501874 +++$+++ u7603 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ POPE +++$+++ You mean when are you going to Egypt?
L501873 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ -- so when are you going to Egypt?
L501843 +++$+++ u7603 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ POPE +++$+++ Of course not.
L501842 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Oh, Johnny, Mr. Karpf needed a ride home and I said we'd take him. Do you mind?
L501819 +++$+++ u7603 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ POPE +++$+++ -- these bastards have me hemmed in.
L501818 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ -- why?
L501776 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Let's do that.
L501775 +++$+++ u7603 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ POPE +++$+++ Well -- as I see it we've got two choices. We can hang around here and wait for the bomb to go off, or we can go to my party.
L501712 +++$+++ u7603 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ POPE +++$+++ -- oh I don't know --
L501711 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ -- Jackie really shouldn't drink --
L501645 +++$+++ u7603 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ POPE +++$+++ George is a hairdresser, isn't he?
L501644 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ That bastard.
L501643 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Well did he go in there with Jackie?
L501642 +++$+++ u7603 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ POPE +++$+++ I don't think so.
L501641 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ George? Was he alone?
L501640 +++$+++ u7603 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ POPE +++$+++ Then maybe you can tell me why George would be going into the ladies room.
L501639 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Well... sure...
L501638 +++$+++ u7603 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ POPE +++$+++ This other couple that we're here with, do you know them very well?
L501540 +++$+++ u7603 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ POPE +++$+++ Not with your hairdresser.
L501539 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Getting your hair done...  Would you like to go to a party?
L501538 +++$+++ u7603 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ POPE +++$+++ -- oh, sure. A hairdresser. How... how do you a... meet a hairdresser?
L501537 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ He's a hairdresser.
L501536 +++$+++ u7603 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ POPE +++$+++ Good for you.
L501535 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ -- no.

L501533 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ -- never mind.
L501532 +++$+++ u7603 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ POPE +++$+++ I'm terribly sorry.
L501531 +++$+++ u7603 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ POPE +++$+++ My God, did I say that? I don't believe it.
L501530 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Johnny!
L501529 +++$+++ u7603 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ POPE +++$+++ I see. You mean he just sort of fucks you.
L501528 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Sort of.

L501526 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.
L501525 +++$+++ u7603 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ POPE +++$+++ Is he an enemy?
L501524 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Well he's not exactly a friend.
L501523 +++$+++ u7603 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ POPE +++$+++ All right, forget this filth. Continue about your friend.
L501522 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ ... my friend doesn't like it here either.
L501521 +++$+++ u7603 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ POPE +++$+++ Are you kidding? His hair's probably the most nutritious thing in here. See, you've reduced me to eating weeds.
L501520 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ Why don't you ask for another one?
L500961 +++$+++ u7603 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ POPE +++$+++ Sure.

L500939 +++$+++ u7603 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ POPE +++$+++ Well, that's where the pyramids are and we want real pyramids in the ad.
L500938 +++$+++ u7594 +++$+++ m513 +++$+++ JILL +++$+++ But why Egypt?
