L487809 +++$+++ u7471 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GIRL ON PHONE +++$+++ It's hell week. Chill. The movie murders have brought out the crazies. It's nothing.
L487808 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ No, some creep asshole trying to scare me.
L487787 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ Alright, alright...I'll call you back.
L487786 +++$+++ u7471 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GIRL ON PHONE +++$+++ Don't. Think Bailey.
L487785 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ I won't.
L487784 +++$+++ u7471 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GIRL ON PHONE +++$+++ That shit. He only calls you when he's drunk. Don't go over there.
L487777 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ No, he quit - the whole God thing--he has issues. The previews for next week...
L487776 +++$+++ u7471 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GIRL ON PHONE +++$+++ thought he was doing AA.
L487775 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ No, they broke up again. Bailey won't stop drinking and Sarah can't take it anymore.
L487862 +++$+++ u7476 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ Don't forget to set the alarm.
L487861 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ WHAAAATT?
L487860 +++$+++ u7476 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ No, it's me.
L487859 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ Hello? Ted?
L487803 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ I'm impatient. Look, do you wanna leave a message for someone?
L487802 +++$+++ u7476 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ I'm inquisitive.
L487801 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ Why do you always answer a question with a question?
L487800 +++$+++ u7476 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ Why would you wanna do that?
L487799 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ What if I said goodbye?
L487798 +++$+++ u7476 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ What if I said you?
L487797 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ "Drink with your brain." That's our motto. Who are you calling for?
L487796 +++$+++ u7476 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ That's too bad.
L487795 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ I'm designated driver. I have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride.
L487794 +++$+++ u7476 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ Why aren't you there?
L487793 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.
L487792 +++$+++ u7476 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ Where is everybody?
L487791 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here.
L487790 +++$+++ u7476 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ That's okay.
L487789 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ Oh, I'm sorry. My bad.  I thought you were someone else.
L487783 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ Ted? Where are you? Are you drinking? Hold on.
L487782 +++$+++ u7476 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ Someone who wants to talk to you.
L487781 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ Cici. Who's this?
L487780 +++$+++ u7476 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MAN'S VOICE +++$+++ Who is this?
L487779 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ Yes.
L487854 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ I'll go. I don't mind. Really.
L487853 +++$+++ u7466 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DAWNIE +++$+++ Tina, it's Dawnie. I'm  on my way. Cici follows her back into the living room.
L487847 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ Just some asshole trying to scare me.
L487846 +++$+++ u7466 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DAWNIE +++$+++ I had to change. Did anyone call?
L487845 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ I thought you were going to the mixer?
L487844 +++$+++ u7466 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DAWNIE +++$+++ I live here.
L487843 +++$+++ u7464 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ CICI +++$+++ Jesus, you scared me. What are you doing here?
L488489 +++$+++ u7465 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ COTTON +++$+++ Not until you’re dead.
L488488 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ It’s over, Cotton.
L488487 +++$+++ u7465 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ COTTON +++$+++ I get my revenge and make some fast cash.
L488486 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Please, Cotton, don’t do this.
L488485 +++$+++ u7465 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ COTTON +++$+++ It’s perfect, Sidney. No one will ever suspect me. I have proof. I’m the victim.
L488108 +++$+++ u7465 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ COTTON +++$+++ You're a self-obsessed little cunt like your mother.
L488107 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ What?
L488106 +++$+++ u7465 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ COTTON +++$+++ It helped me realize one thing.
L488105 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Did it?
L488104 +++$+++ u7465 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ COTTON +++$+++ I just thought if I saw you face to face, maybe it would help.
L488103 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Cotton, there isn't one day, one hour, one minute when I'm not reminded of what I've done. I have not had one second of reprieve and no therapy or religion or spiritual plane can ever erase what I feel in every vein of my being. And I wish I had in me what you need to hear but I don't think the words exist.
L488102 +++$+++ u7465 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ COTTON +++$+++ I wish it was just a year. I lost everything because of you. I have nothing now. Look at me, this is what I've become. A long silence. Sidney is hanging on by threads.
L488101 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your life--how do I apologize for that?
L488100 +++$+++ u7465 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ COTTON +++$+++ You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.
L488099 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I did that.
L488098 +++$+++ u7465 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ COTTON +++$+++ You could start with an apology.
L488097 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ What do you want from me, Cotton?
L488096 +++$+++ u7465 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ COTTON +++$+++ Look, yesterday wasn't my idea. That was all Gale and dollar signs and ratings.
L488095 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I don't think that's a good idea.
L488094 +++$+++ u7465 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ COTTON +++$+++ Can we talk?
L488093 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Cotton.
L488208 +++$+++ u7465 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ COTTON +++$+++ Gale, I don't know what I'm doing from one moment to the next. I'm just taking it as it comes.
L488207 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Don't do anything stupid, Cotton. You've come to far.
L488206 +++$+++ u7465 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ COTTON +++$+++ You've done nothing but get rich off of me. How many books have you sold, Gale? You think I don't understand points and royalties and ancilliary rights?
L488205 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Cotton, I've done nothing but help you.
L488204 +++$+++ u7465 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ COTTON +++$+++ No, Gale, I don't have any rights. You made sure of that.
L488203 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ You have a right to be angry.
L488202 +++$+++ u7465 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ COTTON +++$+++ Now, Gale, you were so instrumental in my freedom. You're not having character doubts now, are you?
L488201 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Did you do it?
L488200 +++$+++ u7465 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ COTTON +++$+++ You know the story, Gale. Man falsely accused, sent to prison, proved innocent, released back into the real world and never trusted again. Want the exclusive?
L488476 +++$+++ u7467 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEBBIE SALT +++$+++ Enter Cotton Weary.
L488475 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ But you’ll never get away with it.
L488474 +++$+++ u7467 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEBBIE SALT +++$+++ Finish what my son started.
L488473 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ What are you going to do?
L488466 +++$+++ u7467 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEBBIE SALT +++$+++ Where do you think he got it? Mental illness is heriditary. Who do you think incouraged him to kill your mother? He was a smart kid but children need parental guidance.
L488465 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Jesus, you’re just as whacked as your son.
L488460 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ You’re all in this together?
L488459 +++$+++ u7467 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEBBIE SALT +++$+++ I couldn’t believe you didn’t recognize me. You even interviewed me for your book.
L487977 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Look, I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the scoop anymore. Excuse me.
L487976 +++$+++ u7467 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEBBIE SALT +++$+++ Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.
L487975 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ No, I don't.
L487974 +++$+++ u7467 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEBBIE SALT +++$+++ Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
L487973 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Why don't you ask them?
L487972 +++$+++ u7467 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEBBIE SALT +++$+++ And are the police sure about that?
L487971 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Home--where he lives.
L487970 +++$+++ u7467 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEBBIE SALT +++$+++ Where is Sidney's father?
L487969 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Tons and tons.
L487968 +++$+++ u7467 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEBBIE SALT +++$+++ Hi, Gale, any leads?
L487703 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Good for you.
L487702 +++$+++ u7467 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEBBIE SALT +++$+++ I took your vulture seminar seminar at Berkeley last year.
L487701 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Do I know you? You look familiar.
L487700 +++$+++ u7467 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEBBIE SALT +++$+++ And much richer as a result.
L487699 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Well, you know I'm dear to the subject matter.
L487698 +++$+++ u7467 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEBBIE SALT +++$+++ What are you doing here? I thought you had retired from field reporting?
L487697 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Fair enough.
L487696 +++$+++ u7467 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEBBIE SALT +++$+++ Job hazard. Debbie Salt, stringer-- NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions?
L487695 +++$+++ u7470 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Look, I'm sorry about the face.
L488230 +++$+++ u7478 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ You freakin?
L488229 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Yeah.
L488228 +++$+++ u7478 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ No way.
L488227 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ She dumped me.
L488226 +++$+++ u7478 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Where's Sid?
L488225 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Not one bit.
L488224 +++$+++ u7478 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Are they aware of your not so positive portrayal of Greek life?
L488075 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Definitely Whitney.
L488074 +++$+++ u7478 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ "And I hope life treats you kind and I hope you have all you dreamed of offffff. I wish you JOYYY."
L488073 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ I think he's doing Dolly.
L488061 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Should we be worried about this guy? Isn't it kinda weird he just showed up and now people are dying?
L488060 +++$+++ u7478 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ I could use some therapy.
L488039 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ I WAS A SORORITY SLUT.
L488038 +++$+++ u7478 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ What's your subject?
L488037 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ My documentary is due on Tuesday.
L487732 +++$+++ u7478 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ MICKEY +++$+++ Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it, I'm into Hallie...
L487731 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ How do you put up with this Greek shit?
L488447 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ But nobody wants to see that. It’ll never go. They’ll rewrite you. You don’t want that.
L488446 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Yeah, we’re trying to send a message to Hollywood. I’m really getting tired of all the happy endings. It’s just not reality. In the real world the good guys die, the innocent are punished, and the murderers inherit the earth.
L488413 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ You’re not going to get away with this.
L488412 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Poor Cotton, could life be a little more cruel?
L488393 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Good question. You took the bait.
L488392 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Why?
L488381 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ That’s quick.
L488380 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ No. This is a set up.
L488379 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Go on, untie him.
L488124 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Then I'll make this easy for you. I like you. I'm crazy about you, Sid. But I'm gonna stay away. Until you say otherwise.
L488123 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ It's not you, Derek. I don't trust myself. I tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men.
L488122 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ I don't really know what happened in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you don't trust me.
L488121 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ No, it's not.
L488120 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ I had the four o'clock shift. You weren't there. You had us worried. Is everything okay?
L487966 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ It's under control.
L487965 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it?
L487964 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Let us decide that.
L487963 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ My screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends.
L487960 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ I think it's out of your control.
L487959 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ This is exactly what I don't want.
L487892 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I'll get my jacket.
L487891 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Lemme take you home.
L487877 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ The forbidden subject.
L487876 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ About what?
L487871 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ I'm sorry honey. I got behind.
L487870 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Where have you been'? You missed my shining moment. I won the macaroni sundae binge.
L487729 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Sid, you don't have to.
L487728 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper.
L487688 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Don't ask what you can do. No coddling. Life rolls on status quo.
L487687 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?
L487686 +++$+++ u7484 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I skipped. Too many "That's her" looks.
L487685 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ How are you? You weren't in class. I called as soon as I heard...
L488462 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ Tuition’s expensive.
L488461 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ We had to have financing.
L488430 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ Tails.
L488429 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Oh yeah.  We figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press. It’s been an ongoing discussion.  Heads or tails?
L488428 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ Wait a sec, Derek. We forgot to flip.
L488427 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Just for you, Sid.
L488426 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings.
L488425 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Or it found us.
L488424 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ So we found a compromise.
L488423 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ And we didn’t want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your money’s worth.
L488422 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ ..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...
L488421 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of the sequel. The Billy/Stu thing’s been done.
L488420 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ A twist ending if you will.
L488419 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Hope you’re ready, Sid. We got one last surprise for you.
L488418 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ And now, drum roll please...
L488417 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ We’re hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.
L488416 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.
L488415 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ The way I see it. We’ll be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II.
L488414 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ Of course not. Who wants to? What’s the point if we don’t get caught? Where’s the glamour in that?
L488409 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Until now.
L488408 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ You’re the one who got away.
L488407 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ You’d me amazed at how many of us there are out there. It’s a whole world, Sid. You’re really popular amongst the demented.
L488406 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
L488405 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
L488404 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ He sent me the cutest e-mail.
L488397 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ I find his work overwrought.
L488396 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ He hates Oliver Stone.
L488395 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ I really don’t like that comparison, honey.
L488394 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ Ever see NATURAL BORN KILLERS? Well, Derek and I have this whole Mickey/Mallory-Woody Harrelson/Juliette Lewis thing going on.
L488391 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Yeah, how can we help? Do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life?
L488390 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ Yeah, you look quizzical yet pensive.
L488388 +++$+++ u7472 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ HALLIE +++$+++ I got it..
L488387 +++$+++ u7468 +++$+++ m505 +++$+++ DEREK +++$+++ Need some help, honey.
