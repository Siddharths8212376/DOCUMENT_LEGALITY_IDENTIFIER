L246641 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Not at all.  I was in the foxholes myself.
L246640 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ You're talking through your hat now.
L246639 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers.
L246638 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ You must think the whole world is queer.  Well it's not.  War sure isn't.
L246637 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ No teammates in football?  No comrades in Korea?
L246636 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ There's no people like you in my crowd.
L246635 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us.  Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion?
L246634 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Not fear.  More like disgust.
L246633 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ And the fear you showed at our last session?  How did you overcome that?
L246632 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I told you.  I don't like to talk about that.
L246631 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ What about your stint in Korea? I'm sure it was full of dramatic episodes.
L246630 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Not me.
L246629 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Everybody has stories to tell.
L246628 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I don't know.  I guess I like your stories.
L246627 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ I'm curious, Mr. Boone.  What convinced you to come back?
L246625 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I'd like to sit for you again.  But only if you ease up on the locker room talk.  Okay?
L246624 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Mr. Boone.  You're not due to cut the lawn until Wednesday.
L246607 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Oh no.  I never swim.
L246606 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ You first.
L246605 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ The extras are in their places. Now we need the star.  Wouldn't you like to get in the pool?
L246600 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ From now on, Mr. Whale, I cut your grass and that's it.  Understand?
L246599 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ I assure you, Mr. Boone, I meant no --
L246598 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Isn't it enough you told me you're a fairy?  Do you have to rub my nose in it?
L246596 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Cut it out!
L246595 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Of course, they weren't nearly as bashful.  No, this room was once filled with bare buttocks.  And pricks.  Hard, arrogant pricks --
L246593 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Twenty years.  Too long.  We were like a play whose run outlasted the cast's ability to keep it fresh. So I finally decided to close down the show.
L246592 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ How long were you...?
L246591 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ But I chose freedom.  David was still in the thick of it, his life full of anxiety and studio intrigue.  I didn't fancy spending my golden years as merely "the friend."  The dirty little secret of a nervous producer.
L246590 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Better work.
L246589 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ You've done a helluva lot more than most people.
L246588 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ I think we all want to feel we've left our mark on the world.  Yes. I wish I had done more work.
L246586 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ It's so far in the past now.  Over fifteen years --
L246585 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Do you miss it?
L246584 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ After that, I went out of fashion. I was no longer able to command the best projects, so I walked away.  Why should I spend my time working in such a dreadful business?
L246583 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ The fucking studio butchered it. It was 1937, Hitler's armies were already massing -- and still the New York bankers stood in line to curry his favor.  Anything to avoid losing the German market.  They cut away the guts and brought in another director to add slapstick. The picture laid an egg, a great expensive bomb.  For which I was blamed.
L246582 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ What happened?
L246581 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ You might not think it to look at me now, but there was a time when I was at the very pinnacle of my profession.  The horror movies were behind me.  I'd done "Show Boat." Major success.  Great box office. Now I was to do something important.  "The Road Back."  An indictment of the Great War and what it did to Germany.  It was to be my masterpiece.
L246580 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ In a way, yes.  I suppose so.  I know it's why I stopped making pictures.
L246579 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Is that why you and your friend split up?  Because you wanted to be free?
L246578 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ I like that.  But take care, Mr. Boone.  Freedom is a drug, much like any other.  Too much can be a very bad thing.
L246577 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Thoreau with a lawnmower.
L246576 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Ah.  A philosopher.
L246575 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ The world is just one kiss-ass game after another.  A man has to make up his own life, alone.
L246574 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Very well put.
L246573 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ You know how it is.  You have to kiss ass just to get a piece of it.
L246572 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Why not?
L246571 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Not at the moment.
L246570 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Tell me more about yourself, Mr. Boone.  You have a steady companion?
L246569 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Of course.  I don't want to scare you off.  Not before I'm finished with you.
L246568 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I don't mean to be a prick, but that's how I feel.
L246566 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Suppose we unbutton the top and pull it down around your shoulders? Two buttons.  Is that so much to ask?  Just two little buttons.
L246565 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I'm fine.  I'd just rather keep it on.
L246564 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Oh dear.  I <u>have</u> made you nervous.
L246562 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I just feel more comfortable keeping it on.  You just said you didn't want me self-conscious.
L246561 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ But we have to match the other sketch.
L246560 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Sorry.  Not today.
L246559 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ It will only make you self-conscious.  You'll have to remove your shirt.
L246558 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Can I see what you did so far?
L246556 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ No.  I --
L246555 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ I hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today?
L246554 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ What you do is no business of mine. Live and let live, I say.
L246553 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ So we understand each other?
L246552 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Don't be ridiculous.  I know a real man like you would break my neck if I so much as laid a hand on him. Besides, you're not my type.
L246551 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ You know.  Look at me like -- like I look at women.
L246550 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ What way might that be?
L246549 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ You don't think of me that way, do you?
L246548 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ I never thought you were.
L246547 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I'm not, you know.
L246546 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Oh dear.  If one must have a clinical name.
L246545 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ No, I -- you're a homosexual.
L246544 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Does that surprise you?
L246543 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Or a husband.  Depending on which of us you asked.  My friend David. He lived here for many years.
L246542 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ So you had a wife?
L246541 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ No.  At least not in the legal sense.
L246540 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ You ever been married, Mr. Whale?
L246539 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Just a trim.  And mine while you're at it.  Fingers are a bit stiff today.
L246537 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ All righty.  I understand.
L246536 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Sorry.  I don't feel like sitting still today.
L246535 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ I'll pay our going rate.  Plus what you'd get if you did the hedges.
L246534 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Can't today.
L246533 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ What is we say phooey to the hedges?  Could you spare an hour after lunch?  To sit for me?
L246532 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Full up.  I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.
L246531 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Yes, I believe you could.  How free is your schedule this afternoon?
L246530 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ No.  I could have, though.
L246529 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Quite true.  Hand-to-hand combat is the true test.  Did you ever slay anyone hand-to-hand?
L246528 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Proud?  Any jerk with a gun can kill someone.
L246527 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ It's nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country. That's something to be proud of.
L246526 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I don't like to talk about that.
L246525 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Did you kill anyone?
L246523 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Of course.  I had to make it interesting for myself, you see.  A comedy about death.  The trick is not to ruin it for anyone who isn't in on the joke.  But the Monster never receives any of my gibes.  He is noble.  Noble and misunderstood.
L246522 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Why?  Was it supposed to be funny?
L246521 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Pity.  People are so earnest nowadays.
L246520 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ No.
L246519 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Did anyone laugh?
L246518 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I liked it.  We all did.
L246517 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Did you now?
L246516 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Saw your movie the other night. Watched it with some friends.
L246513 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Yes.  An old, useless friend.  You must excuse me, Mr. Boone.  This is a world I finished with long ago. I pay them no mind and expect them to return the compliment.  Lunch should be ready.  Shall we?
L246512 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ This David's a friend?
L246511 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Is this David's doing?
L246507 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Go ahead.
L246506 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Do you mind?
L246504 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ I assume you worked up an appetite with your labor.
L246503 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ All right, I guess.
L246502 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ How are you, Mr. Boone?  So glad you are free for lunch.
L246306 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I don't mind.  I'm not crazy about my old man either.
L246305 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ You have to excuse me, Mr. Boone. Since my stroke, I am often overcome with nostalgia.
L246301 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ In Dudley there were more sides of the tracks than any American can imagine.  Every Englishman knows his place.  And if you forget, there's always someone to remind you.  My family had no doubts about who they were.  But I was an aberration in that household a freak of nature.  I had imagination, cleverness, joy.  Where did I get that?  Certainly not from them.
L246300 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I guess you'd say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks.
L246299 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ No, you were middle class, like all Americans.
L246298 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ We weren't rich.  But we weren't poor either.
L246297 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ There's something about the openness of your face that makes me want to speak the truth.  Yes, my family ate dripping.  Beef dripping and four to a bed, and a privy out back in the alley.  Are you also from the slums, Mr. Boone?
L246296 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ I've spent most of my life outrunning my past.  Now it's flooding all over me.
L246295 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ What?
L246294 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ I'm sorry.  I've just realized how terribly ironic it all is.
L246293 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Of course not.  As I said, only poor people --
L246292 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Your family ate dripping?
L246291 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ It is.  Only the poorest families ever ate it.  We kept ours in a crockery jar.
L246290 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Sounds like something you feed the dog.
L246289 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Dripping?  Do you ever eat dripping in this country?  The fat from roasts and such, congealed in jars.  Used like butter on bread.
L246288 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ It's a bit like being at the doctor, isn't it?  You have to remain perfectly still while I examine and scrutinize you.
L246287 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ No.  I'm fine.
L246286 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Would you be more comfortable barefoot?  Feel free to remove your boots and socks.
L246284 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ That's exactly what I intend to do.
L246283 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Take a picture, it lasts longer.
L246280 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ All right already.  I'll take it off.  Kind of warm in here anyway.
L246279 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ We could wrap this like a toga around your shoulders.  Would that help you overcome your schoolgirl shyness?
L246278 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Oh if it's going to make you uncomfortable...  Perhaps we can find something else for you to wear.
L246277 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ But it's just my face you want to draw.
L246276 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Pish posh, Mr. Boone.  I'm not your Aunt Tilly.
L246275 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I'm not wearing an undershirt.
L246274 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ I'm sorry.  It's too white, too distracting.  Would it be asking too much for you to take it off?
L246273 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ It's new.
L246272 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ That shirt, Mr. Boone.
L246270 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Hmmm.  I much prefer "Show Boat" or "The Invisible Man."  Shall we begin?
L246269 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ "Bride of Frankenstein."
L246268 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ You don't say?  Which picture?
L246267 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Did you see this?  They're showing one of your movies tomorrow night.
L246239 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Excellent.  We'll have a most interesting time.
L246238 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ All right then.  Sure.  I could use the extra dough.
L246237 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ I have no interest in your body, Mr. Boone.  I can assure you of that.
L246236 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?
L246235 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ What are you suggesting?  You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder.
L246234 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ And it's just my head you want? Nothing else?
L246233 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him.
L246232 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ But why?
L246231 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.
L246230 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ You mean -- you really want to draw me?
L246229 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ I apologize for going on like this. It's the Sunday painter in me.  Of course I can understand your refusal.  It's a great deal to ask of someone.
L246228 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Yes.  You were a Marine.
L246227 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Just a year.  I dropped out to join the Marines.
L246226 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ You went to university?
L246225 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Football in college.
L246224 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ But expressively broken.  How did it happen?
L246223 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Broke is more like it.
L246222 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ You have the most architectural skull.  And your nose.  Very expressive.
L246221 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ What's to sketch?
L246220 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Sat for an artist.  Been sketched.
L246219 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ You mean, like posed for pictures?
L246218 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ To an artistic eye, you understand. Have you ever modeled?
L246217 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Huh?
L246216 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ You must excuse me for staring, Mr. Boone.  But you have a marvelous head.
L246215 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Nothing serious.  A touch of stroke.
L246214 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ What was wrong?
L246213 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ I returned recently from a stay in hospital.
L246212 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ What did she mean by going flooey?
L246211 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ When they stay in your employ too long, servants begin to think they're married to you.  Please, Mr. Boone.  Help yourself.
L246202 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ Merely comfortable.  Here's Hanna with our refreshments.  Can you get the door?
L246201 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Still.  You must be rich.  Making a couple of famous movies like those.
L246200 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ I made only the first two.  The others were done by hacks.
L246199 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ "Frankenstein" and "Bride of" and "Son of" and all the rest?

L246195 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ In my youth, yes, but never in Hollywood.  No, I was merely a director here.
L246194 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Sure, everybody does.  When I was a kid I'd go with my sister twice a week.  Why?  Were you an actor or something?

L246191 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ They were familiar when I painted them.  That one's copied from a Dutch still life done almost three hundred years ago.  And that's a Rembrandt.
L246190 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I'm just a hick who cuts lawns. But some of these look familiar.
L246189 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ You know what they say.  If you have to ask --
L246188 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Excuse me, but -- are you famous?

L246180 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ The honest sweat of one's brow.  I assure you I won't be offended. Let me tell Hanna to bring tea for two.
L246179 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ I stink to high heaven right now.
L246178 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ I was just about to ask Hanna to bring down iced tea.  I'd like it very much if you'd join me.

L246051 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ The Marines.  Good for you.  You must have served in Korea.
L246050 +++$+++ u5562 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ CLAY +++$+++ Just that I was in the Marines.
L246049 +++$+++ u5572 +++$+++ m370 +++$+++ WHALE +++$+++ I couldn't help but notice your tattoo.  That phrase?  Death Before Dishonor.  What does it mean?
