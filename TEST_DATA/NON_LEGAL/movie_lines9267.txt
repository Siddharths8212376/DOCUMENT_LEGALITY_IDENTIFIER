L390231 +++$+++ u2121 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ KIMMY +++$+++ An hour ago. <i></i> I tried to prepare myself, but I didn't know he would be like, like <u>this</u>. I can't even bear to look at him... How about you? You're okay?
L390230 +++$+++ u2120 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ When'd you get in?
L390229 +++$+++ u2121 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ KIMMY +++$+++ Oh, Julie...my poor Stu...my poor baby brother...
L390638 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Thanks, Kitty, I'll never forget you for th--
L390637 +++$+++ u2122 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ KITTY +++$+++ Go. Just <u>go</u>.
L390636 +++$+++ u2122 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ KITTY +++$+++ <u>I'll</u> worry about the guards. <i></i> OKAY, STU. SEE YOU IN A DAY OR TWO.
L390635 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ How am I gonna get past the guards?
L390634 +++$+++ u2122 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ KITTY +++$+++ You're the only true-hearted man I ever met. You find a way back to that girl of yours and make her happy.
L390633 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ You can't do this! You'll get in trouble!
L390632 +++$+++ u2122 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ KITTY +++$+++ Don't ask where I got it.
L390563 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Listen to me! Is there any way I can <u>warn</u> her what Monkeybone is up to??
L390562 +++$+++ u2122 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ KITTY +++$+++ You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her.
L390561 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
L390560 +++$+++ u2122 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ KITTY +++$+++ I'm so sorry, Stu. I <u>wanted</u> to tell you what was going on. I really, really liked you.
L390276 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think I'll never see her again.
L390275 +++$+++ u2122 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ KITTY +++$+++ Hypnos?
L390272 +++$+++ u2122 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ KITTY +++$+++ Is something wrong, Stu? You seem so tense.
L390271 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Nothing for him! He's being repressed.
L390481 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Don't joke around, little buddy. I mean it. I really do love y--
L390480 +++$+++ u2123 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ MONKEYBONE +++$+++ Awwww. Worried about my feelings, are you? Well, there's a new twist.
L390479 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ You've been a hell of a figment, pal. I sure wish I could take you home with me.
L390478 +++$+++ u2123 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ MONKEYBONE +++$+++ Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine.
L390477 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ It's just...now that I'm leaving, I feel like there's lots of things I haven't said. Who's gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay when I'm gone?
L390476 +++$+++ u2123 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ MONKEYBONE +++$+++ Move it. We got exactly five minutes left.
L390475 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ You saved my life, Monkeybone. I never would've made it without you.
L390467 +++$+++ u2123 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ MONKEYBONE +++$+++ Isn't that Lulu?
L390466 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ What?

L390325 +++$+++ u2124 +++$+++ m137 +++$+++ STU +++$+++ Like you'd know. You started out on the back of a napkin, you little...<u>doodle</u>.

L391789 +++$+++ u2126 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ DISCIPLE PROSPECT +++$+++ That poor boy's a crack dealer from Alphabet City.  We do not allow his kind on this block.
L391788 +++$+++ u2127 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIAN +++$+++ What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?
L391787 +++$+++ u2126 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ DISCIPLE PROSPECT +++$+++ You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you.

L391784 +++$+++ u2127 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIAN +++$+++ And you don't deal drugs?
L391783 +++$+++ u2126 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ DISCIPLE PROSPECT +++$+++ We like to think so, yeah.
L391782 +++$+++ u2127 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIAN +++$+++ My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe.  Is that true?

L391860 +++$+++ u2127 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIAN +++$+++ Mm hmm.
L391859 +++$+++ u2130 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ I love you, Mom.  I have to run.  You remembered to call the limousine service, right?
L391858 +++$+++ u2127 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIAN +++$+++ I can make my own decisions.
L391857 +++$+++ u2130 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Mother!
L391856 +++$+++ u2127 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIAN +++$+++ At my age, I'm going to take any pill that makes me feel better.
L391855 +++$+++ u2130 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Here you go.  I think you should talk to Dr. Byrne when you get back about how much Valium he's prescribing.  Okay?
L391854 +++$+++ u2130 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ I'd love to.
L391853 +++$+++ u2127 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIAN +++$+++ Dear, I was thinking.  Why don't we go to Paris next year?  I've never been.  Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling.
L391852 +++$+++ u2130 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ You wouldn't be in the way.  I like having you around.
L391851 +++$+++ u2127 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIAN +++$+++ Oh, I don't want to be in the way. You've got your career and everything.
L391850 +++$+++ u2130 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ I think you should consider coming out and staying with me longer.
L391849 +++$+++ u2127 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIAN +++$+++ Mm hmm.
L391848 +++$+++ u2130 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ It's unusually quiet tonight, isn't it?
L391847 +++$+++ u2127 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIAN +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L391846 +++$+++ u2130 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.
L391845 +++$+++ u2127 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIAN +++$+++ Aaron?
L391844 +++$+++ u2130 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ You know that guy in the pictures you saw?
L391843 +++$+++ u2127 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIAN +++$+++ Oh, I hope so, dear.
L391842 +++$+++ u2130 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ No, I had a dream about daddy.  Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?
L391841 +++$+++ u2127 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIAN +++$+++ If it's about the bikers, dear, I don't want to talk about it.
L391840 +++$+++ u2130 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Mom, I need to talk to you.
L391834 +++$+++ u2130 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ No, no, it's my fault.  I've been pushing you too hard to do things on your own.
L391833 +++$+++ u2127 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIAN +++$+++ Oh, that has nothing to do with it.
L391832 +++$+++ u2130 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Mom ... I mean, it's amusing to imagine such a thing, but ... how many of those pills have you been taking?
L391831 +++$+++ u2127 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIAN +++$+++ What's wrong?
L391826 +++$+++ u2127 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIAN +++$+++ My daughter lives right across the street from the Satan's Disciples' clubhouse, and I was so worried about her ... so, I went over and introduced myself. And they were the nicest people.
L391825 +++$+++ u2130 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Mother, I ...
L391821 +++$+++ u2127 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIAN +++$+++ Oh, it's so nice to meet you.
L391820 +++$+++ u2130 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Don, this is my mother.  Mom, this is my boss, Don Palmer.
L391737 +++$+++ u2130 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ That's not true.  Besides, I don't want you dusting.  I want you to see New York.
L391736 +++$+++ u2127 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIAN +++$+++ You know, you never tell me anything.
L391735 +++$+++ u2130 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ I don't want to talk about it.
L391734 +++$+++ u2127 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIAN +++$+++ He seemed quite taken with you.
L391733 +++$+++ u2130 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ I was seeing Aaron and there were some ... complications.
L391732 +++$+++ u2127 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIAN +++$+++ But I was dusting.
L391731 +++$+++ u2130 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Behind the books.
L391730 +++$+++ u2127 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIAN +++$+++ Well, they were right out in plain view.
L391729 +++$+++ u2130 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Mother!
L391728 +++$+++ u2127 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIAN +++$+++ You know ...  ... whoops!
L391727 +++$+++ u2130 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ What pictures?
L391726 +++$+++ u2127 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIAN +++$+++ What about the fellow in those pictures?
L391725 +++$+++ u2130 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ No, I'm working too much, I don't have time.
L391724 +++$+++ u2127 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIAN +++$+++ Dating anyone?
L391723 +++$+++ u2130 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ I'm good.
L391722 +++$+++ u2127 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIAN +++$+++ How are you doing sweetheart?
L391721 +++$+++ u2130 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ That's why it's good you came to visit me.
L391720 +++$+++ u2127 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIAN +++$+++ I just can't seem to focus on anything these days.
L391714 +++$+++ u2130 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ I've never had any problem with them. People say it's the safest block in the East Village.  I just hope their motorcycles don't keep you up at night.
L391713 +++$+++ u2127 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIAN +++$+++ The motorcycle gang?  Don't they deal drugs and rape young girls?
L391712 +++$+++ u2130 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ That's the Satan's Disciples' New York headquarters.
L391711 +++$+++ u2127 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIAN +++$+++ ... What are they all doing there?
L391710 +++$+++ u2130 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ Uh-huh?
L391709 +++$+++ u2127 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIAN +++$+++ I wanted to ask you something.  Those motorcycles across the street ...?
L391707 +++$+++ u2130 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ That's New York.  It looks rundown, but it's safe during the day.  You'll get used to it.
L391706 +++$+++ u2127 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIAN +++$+++ Well, when I walked up the block, I ... well, my word!
L391705 +++$+++ u2130 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ You don't like where I live?
L391704 +++$+++ u2127 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIAN +++$+++ Well, once you're inside, it's nice.
L391703 +++$+++ u2130 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ PAULA +++$+++ So, what do you think?
L391778 +++$+++ u2128 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIKA +++$+++ ... Manly?
L391777 +++$+++ u2127 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIAN +++$+++ I wonder what they do in there?  Don't they frighten you?  They all look so ...
L391775 +++$+++ u2128 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIKA +++$+++ Oh.  Well, that would be a ... change.  Thank you, Mrs. Peterson.  You have a very reassuring voice.
L391774 +++$+++ u2127 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIAN +++$+++ He's an organic farmer.
L391773 +++$+++ u2128 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIKA +++$+++ What does he do?
L391772 +++$+++ u2127 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIAN +++$+++ You know, you ought to come out to South Dakota some time and meet my son, Steve. He's single.
L391771 +++$+++ u2127 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIAN +++$+++ Poor man had to leave town.  And I hear that other women came forward.
L391770 +++$+++ u2128 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIKA +++$+++ What happened?
L391769 +++$+++ u2127 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIAN +++$+++ Oh, it was such a big scandal.

L391767 +++$+++ u2127 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIAN +++$+++ Men ... they're all the same.  Our pastor in Sioux Falls was caught with his wife's sister.
L391766 +++$+++ u2128 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIKA +++$+++ And there was this number on my phone bill that I didn't recognize.  Calls made at three and four in the morning.  So, I called the number ... and a woman answered.  And I ... I hung up.  So, then I followed him.  Just like in the movies.  And I found out that he has a wife and a little girl living in Brooklyn.  We had been going together for almost a year.
L391765 +++$+++ u2127 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIAN +++$+++ Oh.  You need a cappuccino.
L391764 +++$+++ u2128 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIKA +++$+++ I'm sorry.  I had a wretched night.

L391692 +++$+++ u2127 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIAN +++$+++ Forty-five?  I thought it was only supposed to be thirty?
L391691 +++$+++ u2129 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MISCHA +++$+++ Forty-five all total.
L391690 +++$+++ u2127 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIAN +++$+++ I see.  How much?

L391687 +++$+++ u2129 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MISCHA +++$+++ This is one-way street.  You go down the block to the middle.
L391684 +++$+++ u2129 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MISCHA +++$+++ Nah, not dangerous.  Not that dangerous.  Not during the day.
L391683 +++$+++ u2127 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIAN +++$+++ You mean it's dangerous?
L391682 +++$+++ u2129 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MISCHA +++$+++ Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.

L391677 +++$+++ u2127 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIAN +++$+++ ... And the children thought I should take a trip.
L391676 +++$+++ u2129 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MISCHA +++$+++ ... Oh ...
L391675 +++$+++ u2127 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIAN +++$+++ Uh, yes.  My husband passed away recently ...
L391674 +++$+++ u2129 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MISCHA +++$+++ So, you come here all by yourself?
L391673 +++$+++ u2127 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIAN +++$+++ She would have come to the airport to meet me - she wanted to - but ... but, she just started a new job and, well, I guess no one drives here.
L391672 +++$+++ u2129 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MISCHA +++$+++ And where is she?
L391671 +++$+++ u2127 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MARIAN +++$+++ I came to New York to visit my youngest daughter.

L391668 +++$+++ u2129 +++$+++ m138 +++$+++ MISCHA +++$+++ What do you think?  I left it on the curb?
