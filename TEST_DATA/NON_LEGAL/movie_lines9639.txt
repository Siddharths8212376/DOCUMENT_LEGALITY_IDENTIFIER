L112602 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ That's too many.
L112601 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Three legs.
L112600 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ What's that, Frank?
L112599 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It's coming.  Hold her down.
L112582 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What's wrong.
L112581 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Look at that. A fat junkie. That's a first.
L112574 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I need a drink, that's all.
L112573 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ No, you didn't, Frank, thank you. But there's still a couple hours left on the shift.
L112570 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ She wasn't looking at you, man, she was looking at me.
L112569 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ We're all whores, Frank. You know what I'm talking about, the way she looked at me.
L112568 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ She's no whore, Marcus.
L112567 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Nice though, pulling back her hood as we drive by. There's a mystery to it, then she shows you.
L112562 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ You don't know the first thing about rule number three, cannot begin to understand the complexities of that rule. Come on, let's go look at some hookers. The Kit Kat will be letting out.  Don't ever call a junkie whore a crackhead. They get real mad.
L112561 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What about rule number three: Don't get involved with dispatchers named Love.
L112560 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Rule number one: Don't get involved with patients. Rule number two: Don't get involved with patient's daughters. You understand?
L112532 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Thanks.
L112531 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Went over to Sal's got this. There must be some place in Hell for a guy who sells a dollar-fifty a slice. I call you if anything comes up.
L112517 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ God help us, he's hungry too.
L112516 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I'm hungry too. We gotta get some food after this.
L112515 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Oh, Frank, you've got it bad, so much worse than I thought.
L112514 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest I brought in last night. I told her we'd give her a ride back to Misery. Her father's showing signs of improving.
L112513 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Who's that?
L112495 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Make a left here. I want to stop.
L112494 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.
L112493 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Where the guy jumped and you almost fell. No, you never told me that story.
L112492 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ I ever tell you about the time years ago I was on this ledge uptown, trying to talk this psycho inside?
L112464 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ He's dead unless you folks want to stop bullshitting me and tell it straight. Then, Lord willing, we'll try to bring him back.
L112463 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ He's not dead. It's a heroin overdose. Break out the Narcon.
L112452 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ She loves me the way no woman ever has.
L112451 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Is it true that you and Love went on a blind date?  She hit you with a bottle?
L112450 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ She only works when I'm on. I make her wait and it drives her crazy.
L112447 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ It can always get worse. You can't change what's out there, only where you're coming from. You got to let the Lord take over, in here. 
L112446 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I think the worst is over.
L112445 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ You ever notice people who see shit always, are crazy?
L112444 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ The ghosts--
L112443 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only thing they might do is transfer you to the Bronx. You look like you aged ten years since I rode with you last.
L112442 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now.
L112441 +++$+++ u4262 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ MARCUS +++$+++ My Lord mother man, you look like hell. What were you drinking?
L112932 +++$+++ u4259 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ HAZMAT +++$+++ Upstairs. 212. Had to shock him twice more.
L112931 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Where's Burke?
L112930 +++$+++ u4259 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ HAZMAT +++$+++ Crazy fucker.
L112929 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ No.
L112928 +++$+++ u4259 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ HAZMAT +++$+++ Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp!  Anybody else hurt?
L112927 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Last show of the night.
L112853 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ A medical miracle.
L112852 +++$+++ u4259 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ HAZMAT +++$+++ That's good, Frank. No, but they might surgically implant one, about the size of my thumb. It goes near the shoulder here, with two electrodes connected to the heart. It sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. Amazing, isn't it?
L112851 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator?
L112850 +++$+++ u4259 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ HAZMAT +++$+++ Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours.
L112849 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ How many times have you shocked him tonight?
L112848 +++$+++ u4259 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ HAZMAT +++$+++ You can't believe how much he's improved.
L112614 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Can't tell. It was a breech, twins. The other one seems okay, though. Marcus is taking him and the mother to Maternity.
L112613 +++$+++ u4259 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ HAZMAT +++$+++ Oh Jesus, put her on the monitor. Where's the pediatric code cart?  Odette give me that tube. All right, flatline--let's do CPR. step back, Frank. How many months?
L112490 +++$+++ u4259 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ HAZMAT +++$+++ I wanted to bring them in, to see if he'd respond to voices, but they weren't in the waiting room. The guy's daughter was in my face all last night and when I finally have something positive to tell her, she's gone.
L112489 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ The family know?
L112488 +++$+++ u4259 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ HAZMAT +++$+++ Who knows? It's all lower-brain-stem- activity. The heart refuses to stabilize--he's coded eleven times since he got here. This guy's a fighter. Every time the Valium wears off he starts yanking those restraints.
L112487 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What do you think?
L112486 +++$+++ u4259 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ HAZMAT +++$+++ Burke. You won't believe it. He's showing cognitive signs. He started with spontaneous respiration, now he's fighting to pull out the tube. Had to sedate him. He's in a CAT scan. I'm giving him every test I can: thromboytics, steroids, nitrodrips, heparin.
L112485 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ That guy I brought in yesterday, post-cardiac arrest. He's gone.
L112240 +++$+++ u4259 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ HAZMAT +++$+++ No, that's Noel. Used to be a regular off and on, hasn't been in in a while. He seized and almost coded--I gave him a hypertonic solution. He drank so much the kidneys were taking out salt. One for the textbooks.
L112239 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ He one of them?
L112232 +++$+++ u4259 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ HAZMAT +++$+++ I hate pronouncing people dead over the phone.  Better, huh? They're fixed and dilated. He's plant food.
L112231 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ He got better.
L112952 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Yes.
L112951 +++$+++ u4266 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ ROSE/MARY +++$+++ Would you like to come in?
L112950 +++$+++ u4266 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ ROSE/MARY +++$+++ You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
L112949 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L112948 +++$+++ u4266 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ ROSE/MARY +++$+++ He was tough. You did all you could.
L112947 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ He coded. They shocked him one too many times. I'm sorry.
L112946 +++$+++ u4266 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ ROSE/MARY +++$+++ How can that be? He was getting better.
L112945 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ He's dead, Rose. Your father passed.
L112923 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ You're crazy.
L112922 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ We're gonna save you, Noel. You're gonna be all right.  Do it, Tom! I'll call for fucking backup, I swear!
L112921 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Frank!
L112920 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Do it!
L112919 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Frank!
L112918 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Get the kit! We're gonna tube him!
L112898 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You learn that in the army?
L112897 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the better.
L112896 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ That's ridiculous.
L112895 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll get out here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get him.
L112894 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Okay, whatta I do?
L112893 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Look at that. Tell me that's a crazy person. Every move is calculated. He knows exactly what he's doing. This is the guy. I've been after him for weeks. He's quick, runs like a rat, tough for one person, but with two of us--
L112892 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Well, why don't they put him away? Prisons don't want him. I took him to the hospital yesterday and here he is again.
L112891 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ He's crazy. He can't help it.
L112890 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ This guy's been terrorizing the neighborhood for weeks, ever since he got outta jail, wreaking general havoc, contributing to the bad name of the place. The term "menace to society" was made up for him.
L112887 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Let me think.
L112886 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom.
L112885 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ You need a reason, Frank. You don't just go around breaking people's windows. That's anarchy.
L112884 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Destruction, distraction. I feel the need.
L112883 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Why?
L112882 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I don't know--let's break some windows.
L112881 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ What do you want to break?
L112880 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Let's break something, Tom. Let's bust something, bomb something.
L112879 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ That's your job. Just keep driving, keep moving. No stopping. We're sharks. We stop too long, we die.
L112878 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Who with?
L112877 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Let's get in a fight, then.
L112876 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ You want some bum in the bus terminal? We'll wait for a real call.
L112875 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ C'mon, Tom, pick up a job.
L112873 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ C'mon, look at your screen. Give up some blood!
L112872 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ As long as we keep moving. No standing still.
L112871 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Get ready, Frank. Missed a drug shooting while you were dicking around in there. There's gonna be trauma tonight!
L112823 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ I haven't had a chance to see him yet. I'm going to take care of sleeping beauty.
L112822 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ How's he doing?
L112821 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ I don't think the fire people can touch him out there.
L112820 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Well, he's the steakhead of the night, then.
L112819 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Get this, Frank--we got two patients. Number one, the scarecrow outside. Number two misses the railing but breaks both legs on the balcony, then throws himself through a glass window, heads to the bedroom, where he's now passed out.
L112809 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Better bring it all.
L112808 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Whadda we bring?
L112803 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ That's all right, we're not meant to do Oh tonight. Something is going to happen. I can feel it.
L112802 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It's early for him.
L112801 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Mr. Oh.
L112796 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I never felt better in my life.
L112795 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ You okay?
L112794 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I've taken that into consideration.
L112793 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ The brakes are shot.
L112792 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself.
L112791 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Whatja doing?
L112790 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ C'mon, Tom. The city's burning.
L112789 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Where you going?
L112773 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Look out!
L112772 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Tom, where are the Band-aids? This is an ambulance, isn't it?
L112768 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Don't worry, kid. Tom'll take care of you. Put your head out the window, get some of that summer air. Listen to the music. El Toro de Oro. Andale. Pronto.
L112767 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ The cure's not working, Tom. Maybe we should go back to the hospital.
L112766 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Ten-four. El Toro de Oro. Blast off.
L112765 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Our mission is coffee, Tom. A shot of the bull, Puerto Rican espresso.
L112764 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Look up, Frank. Full moon. The blood's gonna run tonight. I can feel it. Our mission: to save lives.
L112763 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Great to be drunk. Sobriety's killing me.
L112762 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Yeah. Great, isn't it?
L112761 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ These are hard times, Tom.
L112760 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ Come on, Frank. There's blood spilling in the streets.
L112759 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I'm sick, Tom. I need a cure.  Vitamin B cocktail, followed by an amp of glucose and a drop of adrenaline. Not as good as beer, but all I got.
L112372 +++$+++ u4267 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ WALLS +++$+++ No prisoners. Don't worry, Frank, just a little psychological first aid.
L112371 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It's not worth it, Tom. He's surrendering.
L112713 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ No way!
L112712 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Stomach again.
L112711 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ One more time!
L112710 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ You're in the stomach! Let me try.
L112705 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You sure?
L112704 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ You're in the stomach!
L112367 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Used to be my partner.
L112366 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Jesus, Tom Walls, that crazy motherfucker.
L112356 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You really think so?
L112355 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ He's crazy.
L112346 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Sure, I'm taking the captain's exam next year. After the kids are in school, Louise can go back to the post office and, I thought, what the hell, I'll start my own medic service. Out on the Island the volunteers are becoming salaried municipal. It's just a matter of time and who you know. Someday it's going to be Chief Larry calling the shots.
L112345 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Tell me, you ever think of doing anything else?
L112344 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Yeah, you're right.
L112343 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ You take things too seriously. Look at us, we're cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. We've got a good job here.
L112342 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Take me back, put me to bed; I surrender. We've done enough damage tonight.
L112341 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ You have no sick time, Frank. No time of any kind. Everyone knows that.
L112340 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I'm not feeling very well, Larry. I say we go back to the hospital and call it a night.
L112337 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Relax, will you.
L112336 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Larry, swing over on Eighth. We're gonna hafta run one of these calls.
L112315 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Faster!
L112314 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Faster! God!
L112306 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ He's drunk.
L112305 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Well why didn't you say so?
L112301 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Someone's gonna die someday causa that bum, going to have a cardiac and the only medics will be taking care of Mr. Oh.
L112300 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ They'll just keep calling.
L112299 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ It's not our job to taxi drunks around.
L112298 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Relax, it's a street job, easy except for the smell. We'll just throw him in back and zip over to Mercy--no blood, no dying, that's how I look at it. He's just a drunk.
L112291 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ It's Mr. Oh. I'm not answering it.
L112290 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Mr. Oh.
L112285 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ You're burned out.
L112284 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Don't push it, Larry.
L112283 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ That's what we're here for. Come on, Frank.
L112282 +++$+++ u4258 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You wanted it turned off. There's no such thing as a good fire. People get burned up. They can't breathe.
L112279 +++$+++ u4261 +++$+++ m284 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ You know what. The radio.
