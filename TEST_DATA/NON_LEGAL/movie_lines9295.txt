L419951 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ You can have it for good. It is my wedding present.
L419950 +++$+++ u2304 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Just for the honeymoon.
L419949 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ You want this?
L419948 +++$+++ u2304 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. Would it be asking too much...
L419947 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ What is it, Anna?
L419946 +++$+++ u2304 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Ninotchka, I wouldn't bring this up if we weren't such good friends.
L419945 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ You feel it, though.
L419944 +++$+++ u2304 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ They must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this so soft... something you don't even see.
L419943 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze.
L419942 +++$+++ u2304 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ And there?
L419941 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ No, my dear, it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....
L419940 +++$+++ u2304 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Now, Ninotchka, you're exaggerating.
L419939 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Yes.
L419938 +++$+++ u2304 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
L419937 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.
L419936 +++$+++ u2304 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ What do you wear in the morning?
L419935 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ A dress you wear in the evening.
L419934 +++$+++ u2304 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Evening gown?
L419933 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ An evening gown.
L419932 +++$+++ u2304 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me.
L419931 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.
L419930 +++$+++ u2304 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ What was it like?
L419929 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Well, a hat...
L419928 +++$+++ u2304 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Tell me... what else did you have?
L419927 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ No, I left everything in Paris. I just happened to be wearing this.
L419926 +++$+++ u2304 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Ninotchka, you know I am your friend, you can trust me.... Did you bring back anything else?
L419925 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here when I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.
L419924 +++$+++ u2304 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ You know how it is today... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution.
L419923 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ I see.
L419922 +++$+++ u2304 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ When I passed through the laundry yard today I saw all the women huddled around this so I brought it up here. Things like this create a bad feeling. First they didn't know whose it was. Then they saw the Paris label and did it start a commotion! Some said it's what we all ought to wear and others said it's like hanging foreign ideas on our clothesline. It undermines our whole cause.
L419921 +++$+++ u2304 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ You should. I'll show you.
L419920 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ I have nothing to hide.
L419919 +++$+++ u2304 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ That's just it. It makes people feel queer. I dont' want you to get in any trouble.
L419918 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ I haven't talked to anyone about Paris. I haven't said a word.
L419917 +++$+++ u2304 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Ever since you have been back from Paris...
L419916 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ About what?
L419915 +++$+++ u2304 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ And you too, Ninotchka.
L419914 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ You should be more careful, Anna.
L419913 +++$+++ u2304 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I'll tell you later.  That Gurganov, you never know whether he's on his way to the washroom or the Secret Police.
L419912 +++$+++ u2304 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ It just goes to prove the theory of our State. If you stand alone it means a boiled egg but if you're true to the collective spirit and stick together you've got an omelet.  That reminds me... have you heard the latest they're telling about the Kremlin?
L419911 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.
L419910 +++$+++ u2304 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ An omelet! Aren't you living a little above your ration?
L419909 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ An omelet.
L419908 +++$+++ u2304 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ What are you serving?
L419907 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ A few friends... just a little dinner party.
L419906 +++$+++ u2304 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I know... my heart is sad... but my feet are happy. When all the tanks and guns were roaring over the Red Square I sat here all by myself and played a Beethoven sonata. Not bad at all.  Are you expecting someone?
L419905 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Too bad... you missed an inspiring day, Anna.
L419904 +++$+++ u2304 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ They didn't let me. I am in disgrace. Last week at the performance of Carmen I played a sour note. The conductor got so excited he yelled, "There's sabotage in the string section!"
L419902 +++$+++ u2304 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ No, the opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade.
L419901 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Aren't you late?
L419900 +++$+++ u2304 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Good evening, Ninotchka.
L419899 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Good evening, Anna.
L420099 +++$+++ u2310 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ KOPALSKI +++$+++ Right now it's on the balcony.
L420098 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ ...it may step out of a bazaar... it may wait for you in a corridor... it may hide in the shadow of a minaret....
L420070 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ Imagine, we don't have to whisper any longer.
L420069 +++$+++ u2310 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ KOPALSKI +++$+++ We are not comrades any more... we are friends, Ninotchka.
L420010 +++$+++ u2310 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ KOPALSKI +++$+++ I know, but if we can't put in all these wonderful things at least let's put in some imagination.  In that one omelet we'll taste the whole of Paris!
L420009 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ And the surprise is there's nothing in it.
L420006 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ ...des raisins de Madère, des framboises... 
L420005 +++$+++ u2310 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ KOPALSKI +++$+++ Let's fill it with confitures, des prunes...
L419994 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ I should be a swallow! Right now I would be sitting in front of the Café de Paris picking up flakes of French pastry that would melt in my bill.
L419993 +++$+++ u2310 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ KOPALSKI +++$+++ If you asked him why he left France I bet he couldn't name one good reason.
L419992 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ It is, Ninotchka! It is! He must have been in Paris! You can see it in his whole attitude! He just picked up a crumb of our black bread, shook his head, and dropped it.
L419987 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ That's another thing... it's spring.
L419986 +++$+++ u2310 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ KOPALSKI +++$+++ Can you blame them?... at least the May Day parade is over.
L419975 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ How nicely you've fixed the table, Ninotchka.
L419974 +++$+++ u2310 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ KOPALSKI +++$+++ A little more tact... look how nicely she's fixed the table -- all for us.
L419966 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ I can tell you exactly.
L419965 +++$+++ u2310 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ KOPALSKI +++$+++ If you hadn't given Commissar Razinin such a wonderful report about us, who knows what would have happened?
L419840 +++$+++ u2310 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ KOPALSKI +++$+++ That's right.
L419839 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ Imagine, for once in our lives we were in Paris and we never went to the Eiffel Tower.
L419397 +++$+++ u2310 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ KOPALSKI +++$+++ Or we can't go back to Russia!
L419396 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ Or it might be the firing squad!
L419395 +++$+++ u2310 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ KOPALSKI +++$+++ You must help us, Leon... if you don't win her over we're on our way to Siberia!
L419372 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ Once in Petersburg I was driving down the Nevsky Prospect in my cart and Her Highness in her troika swept down from the opposite direction, and when I couldn't make way quick enough she spat in my face.
L419371 +++$+++ u2310 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ KOPALSKI +++$+++ Imagine! The niece of the Czar opening the door for us.
L419370 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ That's her.
L419096 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ Positively not!
L419095 +++$+++ u2310 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ KOPALSKI +++$+++ No, that's not him...
L419068 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ Possibly.
L419067 +++$+++ u2310 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ KOPALSKI +++$+++ Are we free, Buljanoff?
L419061 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ ...and little Lady Beatrice?
L419060 +++$+++ u2310 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ KOPALSKI +++$+++ And how is Lord Lavenham?
L419045 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ He's a bad man. Sends people to Siberia!
L419044 +++$+++ u2310 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ KOPALSKI +++$+++ You wouldn't like Razinin.
L418989 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ All right, let's uphold it for another ten minutes.
L418988 +++$+++ u2310 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ KOPALSKI +++$+++ Comrades! Comrades! Don't let's give in so quickly. After all we have to uphold the prestige of Russia.
L418877 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ I don't want to go to Siberia.
L418876 +++$+++ u2310 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ KOPALSKI +++$+++ Are you the Buljanoff who fought on the barricades? And now you are afraid to take a room with a bath?
L420072 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ No, that's bad management.
L420071 +++$+++ u2309 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ IRANOFF +++$+++ We can say whatever we want. We can shout... we can complain... Look...  The service in this hotel is terrible!  See? Nobody comes... nobody pays any attention. That's freedom.
L419999 +++$+++ u2309 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ IRANOFF +++$+++ Let's forget the future... let's stop being sentimental... let's start that omelet.
L419998 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ And if it is too late for you your children will eat it.
L419985 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ Just see how happy the people look... from here....
L419984 +++$+++ u2309 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ IRANOFF +++$+++ She's right...  anyhow let's talk ourselves into it.
L419977 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ How many families live here with you?
L419976 +++$+++ u2309 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ IRANOFF +++$+++ What a lovely room you have here.
L419964 +++$+++ u2309 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ IRANOFF +++$+++ And that's something we owe to Ninotchka.
L419963 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ Let's be happy that we're all alive.
L419960 +++$+++ u2309 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ IRANOFF +++$+++ That's right... and we might as well face it.
L419959 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ You know what they say -- there's nothing like home.
L419400 +++$+++ u2309 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ IRANOFF +++$+++ Leon, how would you like to have three lifelong friends?
L419399 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ Yes! We could stay with Leon!
L419384 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ What do you mean they might -- they will!
L419383 +++$+++ u2309 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ IRANOFF +++$+++ And they might believe her in Moscow.
L419382 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ And Leonitchka! What she said about us...!
L419135 +++$+++ u2309 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ IRANOFF +++$+++ For ourselves... we are much happier now since we moved to a little room next to the servants' quarters.
L419134 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ We had to take it on account of the safe.
L419093 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ Yes, he looks like a comrade!
L419092 +++$+++ u2309 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ IRANOFF +++$+++ That must be the one!
L419080 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ A telegram from Moscow! It must have been here all day!
L419079 +++$+++ u2309 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ IRANOFF +++$+++ What is it?
L419078 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ Misha! Misha!
L419047 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ We like you, Leon -- don't we like Leon?
L419046 +++$+++ u2309 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ IRANOFF +++$+++ We don't like Razinin.
L418987 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ But what can we do?... We have to accept.
L418986 +++$+++ u2309 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ IRANOFF +++$+++ He's cutting our throat...
L418979 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ They accumulate millions by taking loss after loss.
L418978 +++$+++ u2309 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ IRANOFF +++$+++ Capitalistic methods...
L418902 +++$+++ u2309 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ IRANOFF +++$+++ We'll just say we had to take it on account of the safe. That's a perfect excuse. There was no other safe big enough.
L418901 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ Now Comrades, I warn you... if it gets out in Moscow that we stay in the Royal Suite we will get into terrible trouble.
L418875 +++$+++ u2309 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ IRANOFF +++$+++ Where is your courage, Comrade Buljanoff?
L418874 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ Just a minute -- just a minute -- I have nothing against the idea but I still say let's go back to the Hotel Terminus. Moscow made our reservations there, we are on an official mission, and we have no right to change the orders of our superior.
L418892 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ Why should you be afraid?
L418891 +++$+++ u2313 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates are rather high.
L418890 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ May I ask how much your rooms are?
L418889 +++$+++ u2313 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ Monsieur.
L418888 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ I am Comrade Buljanoff.
L418865 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ No, no.
L418864 +++$+++ u2313 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ Is there anything I can do for you, monsieur?
L420095 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Who gave you this idea? What is responsible for all this?
L420094 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ We are not only serving good food, we are serving our country... we are making friends.
L420089 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ We have opened a restaurant...
L420088 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Guest?
L420085 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ Shall we tell her?
L420084 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ I don't know how I can get you out of it this time. How will it end? What will happen to you?
L420083 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ All you have to do is say "open sesame."
L420077 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Friends... friends, Buljanoff, Iranoff...
L420076 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ With our cream situation what it is, it is Russia which should apologize to the cats.
L420075 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ And there is a Russian saying: "The cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses."
L420074 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
L420073 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment? I must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account.
L420068 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ But, Comrades...
L420067 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ Good old Razinin! Is he still alive? How does he manage?
L420066 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Don't forget, the day will come when you will have to face Razinin.
L420063 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ I must be stern with you.
L420062 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ It is high time you got out of Russia.
L420003 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Don't worry... there will be enough.
L420002 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ Comrades... I'm out of the omelet.
L419973 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ I think I need my glasses.
L419972 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Let's not close our eyes. There are many good things to see here too.
L419968 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ That's right.
L419967 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Now let's forget everything except that we're together.
L419509 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Huh?... Why don't you get a haircut, Buljanoff? You all look so wintry, Comrades. And why do we always keep the windows closed?  Isn't it amazing, at home there's still snow and ice and here... Look at the birds. I always felt a little hurt that our swallows deserted us in the winter for capitalistic countries. Now I know why. We have the high ideal but they have the climate... well, Comrades, I don't think I need you any more.
L419508 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ There's something else which I know will appeal to you. A visit to the Paris sewers. They tell me it is extremely instructive.
L419155 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ Yes, Comrade.
L419154 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ You might get me an accurate map of Paris. I want to use my spare time to inspect the public utilities and make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city.
L419153 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ Is there anything I can do, Comrade?
L419147 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ With two f's, if you please.
L419146 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Do you spell Buljanoff with one or two f's?
L419145 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ Yes, Comrade?
L419144 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Comrade Buljanoff...
L419141 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ We didn't want to get mixed up with lawyers. They are very expensive here. If you just say hello to a lawyer... well, there goes another cow.
L419140 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ You didn't get legal advice?
L419139 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ Which lawyer?
L419125 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Which part of the room is mine?
L419124 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ This is the apartment we have reserved for you, Comrade Yakushova. I hope you like it.
L419120 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Very good. The last mass trials were a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians.
L419119 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ How are things in Moscow?
L419402 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ Well, if your mother turns against you, you have to look for someone to adopt you.
L419401 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Boys, boys... don't forget Russia is your mother country. Three sons walking out all at once... that's too much for any mother.
L419394 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Oh, yes, yes.
L419393 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ Didn't we put up a strong resistance?
L419038 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ Leon... Leonitchka...  Why are you so good to us? 
L419037 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ About this telegram to Moscow. Why should you bother? I'll write it for you.
L419031 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Well, gentlemen, how about my proposition?
L419030 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ Not that we are giving in one inch, but tell us... what is in your mind?
L419025 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ In any case, gentlemen, a charming, beautiful, exquisite woman. I warn you, if this case comes to trial it will be before a French court, and when the Duchess takes the stand...
L419024 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ The former Duchess!
L419023 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ The Duchess...
L419022 +++$+++ u2305 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ BULJANOFF +++$+++ You think because you represent the former Duchess...
L419347 +++$+++ u2306 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ Very well, Your Highness.
L419346 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie.
L419345 +++$+++ u2306 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ A blue shirt, perhaps?
L419342 +++$+++ u2306 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ Shall I draw your bath, sir?
L419341 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Nonsense. How can you fight the Reds and make yourself agreeable to the Whites if you don't keep up your strength.
L419330 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ That's all right.
L419329 +++$+++ u2306 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ Count d'Algout is still asleep.
L419328 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Good morning, Gaston.
L419327 +++$+++ u2306 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ Good morning, Your Highness.
L419535 +++$+++ u2306 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ Emphatically not, sir. The prospect terrifies me. Now, don't misunderstand me, sir, I don't resent your not paying me for the past two months, but the thought that I should split my bank account with you... that you should take half of my life's savings... that is really too much for me.
L419534 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Oh, you're a reactionary! Don't you look forward to the day when you can come in here and stand square on your two feet and say, "Hey, you, d'Algout! from now on it's going to be share and share alike"?
L419533 +++$+++ u2306 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ No, sir.
L419532 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Isn't there any revolt in you? Sometimes when I order you around don't you feel like kicking me in the pants?
L419531 +++$+++ u2306 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ No, sir.
L419530 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I can't follow you, Gaston, isn't it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position? You being my servant? Wouldn't you like to stand on an equal footing with me?
L419529 +++$+++ u2306 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ May I add, sir, that it was with great amazement that I found a copy of Karl Marx's Capital on your night table. That is a socialistic volume which I refuse to so much as dust, sir. I view with alarm, sir, the influence over you of this Bolshevik lady.
L419528 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Ah, there's something poetic about the simple processes of labor. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet... it should be set to music!
L419527 +++$+++ u2306 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ Well, sir, if you should do it again, which I hope you won't, please remember the order. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet.
L419526 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ And Gaston, I was happier all day long. I felt I'd contributed something.
