L267574 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Excellent!
L267573 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ He insults him all the time.
L267572 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What a pity!  Educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine Swiss watch.  Everything stops.  And the doctor?  He worships your father, too?
L267571 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ She has a master's degree in English literature.
L267570 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ College?
L267569 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ They were in the same creative writing class.
L267568 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ College!
L267567 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ She met him at college.
L267566 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I see.  And he came into the apartment one day, to demonstrate his wares, and your mother, as it happened, was charmingly en deshabille--
L267565 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ He's a vacuum cleaner salesman.
L267564 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Ah!  And what sort of man is this worshiper?
L267563 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ He worships Father.
L267562 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Even this--"Herb Shuttle", you said?
L267561 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Everybody says he was so brave.
L267560 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Man and boy.
L267559 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I was going to a funny movie, but I changed my mind.  If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much.  When did you know my father?
L267558 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ And you've been roaming the streets while your mother is God-knows-where?
L267557 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ I'll see.
L267556 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You think you could find me a pencil and paper?
L267555 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ She went to the fight with Herb Shuttle, I guess.
L267554 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You don't know where your mother is? Does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night?
L267553 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Where's Mom?
L267552 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ The doctor was called away on an emergency.  I think it was birth.
L267551 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Is anybody besides you here now?
L267550 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Dr. Woodly.  I should make a little list.
L267549 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Dr. Woodly.
L267548 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Mind?  God, yes, I mind.  I'm your father's friend.  A man claiming to be the family physician let me in a while ago.
L267547 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Do you mind if I ask who you are?
L267546 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Life has denied me that thrill.
L267545 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Do you know who Wanda June is?
L267544 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Ask it!
L267543 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Are you--do you--
L267542 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You were about to ask a question?
L267541 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Are you--
L267540 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Hello.
L267539 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Hello.
L267538 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ As a matter of fact--I am home.
L267537 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Sir?
L267536 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ As a matter of fact--
L267535 +++$+++ u1243 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PAUL +++$+++ Anybody home?
L268318 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Do it, Norbert.
L268317 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Of course he can go--if he'll just go down on his hands and knees for a moment--and promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree.
L268316 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Norbert--you come, too.  Let him go, Harold.  Let him go.
L268315 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Seventeen of them--eleven by accident.  March!  Move!  You, too!
L268314 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ You've killed women?
L268313 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Give me that Goddamn thing!  Now get out of here, or I might kill you.  Who knows?
L268309 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Out!
L268308 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ She's right, Norbert--go home. WOODLY I haven't said all I have to say.
L268305 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Then listen to me.  You're both disgusting--with your pride, your pride.  I hate you for coming here--like a federal marshal in a western film. I loved you when you stayed away. But here you are now--high noon in the Superbowl!  You fool, you fool.
L268304 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ The National Safety Council would be appalled.
L268303 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ All right!  Am I exceedingly dangerous now?
L268300 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Load it for her.
L268299 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ How do I load?
L268298 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ There it is.  Give it to me.
L268297 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Help your mother find the bullet.
L268296 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Where's the bullet?
L268295 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun.
L268294 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I mean it!
L268293 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  It's the American way.
L268292 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I want you to get out of here, Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone.
L268291 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Ah!  The lady is armed.
L268290 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I'm turning off the alarm.  I'm turning off everything.
L268281 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ There has to be a threat of some sort, nobility of some sort, glamour of some sort, sport of some sort.  These elements are lacking.
L268280 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ No, we won't.  No matter how it begins, it will end in death. Because it always does.  Isn't that always how it ends, Harold--in death?
L268271 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Stop!
L268270 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ This is suicide.  Go get the police.
L268263 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Don't!
L268262 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I'm going to call the police.
L268248 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You hope this, too?
L268247 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I don't know.  I hope he never hunts.  I hope he never kills another human being.
L268246 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ And my son, the only son of Harold Ryan--he's going to grow up to be a vanisher, too?
L268245 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ No.
L268244 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ No.
L268243 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I feel mocked, insulted, with no sort of satisfaction in prospect. We don't have to fight with steel. I can fight with words.  I'm not an inarticulate ape, you know, who grabs a rock for want of a vocabulary.  Call him up in East St. Louis, Penelope.  Tell him to come here.
L268242 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ The old heroes are going to have to get used to this, Harold--the new heroes who refuse to fight. They're trying to save the planet. There's no time for battle, no point to battle anymore.
L268235 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ May I continue with the rearing of my son?  Load that gun!
L268234 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all.  It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness.  To you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all.
L268233 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ If you've lived a good life, fought well--
L268232 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ But it's all balled up in your head with death.  The highest honor is death.  When you talk of these animals, one by one, you don't just talk of killing them.  You honored them with death.  Harold--it is not honor to be killed.
L268231 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What a handsome word.
L268230 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Honor, I suppose.
L268229 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?
L268228 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ No you don't.
L268227 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I plan to live one hundred years!
L268226 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ So he can kill you.  You hate your own life that much.  You beg for a hero to kill you.
L268225 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I'm teaching my son to be a man.
L268224 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ That's really what you want.  You become furious when people won't make you dead.
L268223 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ If he thinks he's man enough.
L268222 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ You're begging him to kill you?
L268221 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ With an iron penis three feet long. Load it, boy.
L268220 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ He's a child!
L268204 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Action!  Interaction!  Give and take!  Challenge and response!
L268203 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Like what?
L268202 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Beautiful, you say?  It wasn't life, it wasn't death--it wasn't anything!  Beautiful?  Seven years gone--  like that, like that!  Seven years of silliness and random dreams! Seven years of nothingness, when there could have been so much!
L268201 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Sounds quite beautiful.
L268200 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang "Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
L268199 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Blue soup?
L268198 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What kind of a country has this become?  The men wear beads and refuse to fight--and the woman adore them.  America's days of greatness are over.  It has drunk the blue soup.
L268197 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ It seems highly intelligent to me.
L268196 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ And you, a supposedly healthy woman, do not detest him for his cowardice?
L268195 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ He's afraid of you, Harold.  He knew you'd want to fight him.  He doesn't know anything about fighting.  He hates pain.
L268194 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Last I heard, his mother was going alone.
L268193 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt.
L268192 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I bought him a twenty-two yesterday--on the way home from Hamburger Heaven.  And where is the good doctor?  Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere?
L268191 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Rifle?
L268190 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ He'll play with his rifle, I expect. That will cheer him up.
L268189 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
L268188 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ See how you've upset him.  He was so merry and hale before you came home.
L268186 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I see.
L268185 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Testimonials of that sort are--are beyond my range.  I don't do them well.  That's a failing, I know.
L268183 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I want you to tell me that you loved me once.
L268182 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team.
L268181 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Just one favor.
L268180 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
L268179 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Almost a Christmas scene.
L268178 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Well--what have we here?  A family.
L268122 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ You feel I've done a dreadful thing--leaving him?
L268121 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Things.
L268112 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Hope.
L268111 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ He had hoped that someone would be playing it still--two hundred years from now.
L268110 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ He feels awful loss--which was precisely my intention.
L268109 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Two hundred years old.
L268108 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ About a broomstick and a cigar box--and the attenuated intestines of an alley cat.
L268107 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ He cried.
L268106 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I'm dying to hear of his reaction. The thrill of smashing something isn't in the smashing, but in the owner's reactions.
L268105 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ He knows you shattered his violin.
L268104 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ More nerve than the doctor, I must admit.  He hasn't been home for two days.  Has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television--and the violin?
L268103 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Unless she has nerve.
L268102 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ It isn't a matter of liking.  It's a matter of getting used to death-- as a perfectly natural thing. Would you mind leaving?  No woman ever walks out on Harold Ryan, and then comes back--for anything.
L268101 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Did you like it, dear?
L268100 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ It's a big and busy funeral home.
L268099 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ A dozen?
L268098 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ He'd never seen a corpse.  He's seen a dozen now.
L268097 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ You took him to the funeral, I hear.
L268096 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ If he wants to go.
L268095 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I came for Paul as well.
L268094 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Your clothes are at the city dump by now.  Perhaps you can get a map from the Department of Sanitation.
L268093 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I rang.  It seemed like the proper door for a servile, worthless organism to use.
L268092 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Sneaking in the back door.
L268091 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I came for my clothes.
L267984 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Because if you do--I'll leave you. HAROLD  Goodbye.
L267983 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Why not?
L267982 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ No you're not!
L267981 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me.  I'm now going to even that score.  I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin.
L267980 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ What are you going to do?
L267979 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ That's too bad.  I would rather have him at home--to see what I'm going to do.
L267978 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I don't think so.
L267977 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ And no one's there now?
L267976 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Yes.
L267975 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ And he keeps it in his apartment?
L267974 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ His most cherished possession?  His violin, I guess.
L267973 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ And what is his most cherished possession?
L267972 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Yes.
L267971 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ The doctor.
L267970 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I learned a lot of things in college.  Actually--it was Norbert who told me that.
L267969 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You learned this in some college course?
L267968 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ And they have very mixed feelings about women.  They hate them in a way.  One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently.  They can scrog them, as you say--  for revenge.
L267967 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Go on.
L267966 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there.
L267965 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.
L267964 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth.
L267963 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Tell me about its sexual roots.
L267962 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots.
L267961 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Such as?...
L267960 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Well, I can.  Some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me.  I'm not a silly carhop any more.  Maybe you're right about fish. When I was a carhop, I didn't feel much more than a fish would.  But I've been sensitized.  I have ideas now--and solid information.  I know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you.
L267959 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Fish can't feel.
L267958 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.
L267957 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ It couldn't!
L267956 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I will not be scrogged.  I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel.
L267955 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You don't know you want.  That's the way God built you!
L267954 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want tenderness.
L267953 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ That's what you're supposed to say.
L267952 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I do not wish to be scrogged--ever. I never heard that word, but when I heard it, I knew it was one thing I never wanted to have happen to me.
L267951 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ What then?
L267950 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ No.
L267949 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Let me guess--breakfast is served?
L267933 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I could eat a raw baby crocodile.  The way to get your wife back is in bed.  Do such a job on her that she'll be lucky if she can crawl around on all fours.  We're starving.  Do you mind?
L267932 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ I--I was wondering--is there anything you shouldn't eat--because of jungle fever?
L267931 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ I should have torn that door off its hinges.  Should have scrogged her ears off.  Should have broken the bed.  What do you want?  Well?
L267924 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Then go now--and fry with dignity-- sunnyside up.
L267923 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ They don't have to feel like slaves.
L267922 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ People now have dignity when frying eggs?
L267921 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ You leave me so--so without-- without dignity.
L267920 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Don't lecture me on race relations. I don't have a molecule of prejudice.  I've been in battle with every kind of man there is. I've been in bed with every kind of woman there is--from a Laplander to a Tierra del Fuegian. If I'd ever been to the South Pole, there'd be a hell of a lot of penguins who looked like me.  Cook!
L267919 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ People don't use that word any more.
L267918 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Cook, by God!  Cook!  You're the nigger now.
L267916 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ You're a woman, aren't you?
L267915 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ We're all going to have to go out for breakfast.  The cook quit yesterday.
L267914 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Chow, chow, chow!  God damn it-- nutriment!
L267911 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Then let me see him go out and get some exercise.  Right now!
L267910 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ You're wrong.
L267909 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Honeymoon temporarily canceled.  The boy should still go out and exercise.  I have the impression he never gets any exercise.  He simply bloats himself with Fig Newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators.
L267908 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ What a honeymoon.
L267907 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ She's up in Heaven now.  She didn't hear.  She is experiencing nothing but pure happiness.  There's nothing nicer than that.  Chow!  Harold Ryan wants chow!
L267906 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ "Bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler."
L267905 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ Which one?
L267904 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ That is the most heartless statement I ever heard pass between human lips.
L267903 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ All right--bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler.  Oh, hell--sit down, Colonel. Penelope will bring you some chow.
L267902 +++$+++ u1244 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ PENELOPE +++$+++ Mrs. Wheeler is dead.
L267901 +++$+++ u1240 +++$+++ m82 +++$+++ HAROLD +++$+++ And lots of orange juice--oceans of orange juice.
