L210974 +++$+++ u935 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ HEROINE +++$+++ Done. But you're locked in.  Will you hold the keys?
L210973 +++$+++ u931 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ BOZO +++$+++ Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
L210972 +++$+++ u935 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ HEROINE +++$+++ You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
L210967 +++$+++ u935 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ HEROINE +++$+++ We'll be on the other side waiting for you. If you become food I don't want the only set of keys in the belly of one of those things. It's your funeral.

L210965 +++$+++ u935 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ HEROINE +++$+++ NO, but I will lock you in.

L210963 +++$+++ u935 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ HEROINE +++$+++ Fine, Chief.
L210836 +++$+++ u931 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ BOZO +++$+++ Duh hickey.

L211304 +++$+++ u936 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ PARA +++$+++ Am I too heavy for you?
L211303 +++$+++ u931 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ BOZO +++$+++ Nothin' will happen to you. You get on my back, hold on tight and we truck out of here together.
L211254 +++$+++ u931 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ BOZO +++$+++ Amazing you made it this far.
L211253 +++$+++ u936 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ PARA +++$+++ I'm in a wheelchair, the truck sounds pretty good.
L211221 +++$+++ u931 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ BOZO +++$+++ BONSAI!
L211220 +++$+++ u936 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ PARA +++$+++ HELP MEEE!
L210861 +++$+++ u931 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ BOZO +++$+++ I'm sure.
L210860 +++$+++ u936 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ PARA +++$+++ You sure? I thought the rag had to touch?
L210859 +++$+++ u931 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ BOZO +++$+++ You don't want the rag to touch the booze, that way you can hold it awhile and ensure it explodes when you throw it.
L211137 +++$+++ u932 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ GOLDIE +++$+++ I'm done drinking. That's it. Just Church and grocery stores. Nothin' else.
L211136 +++$+++ u935 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ HEROINE +++$+++ Let's move.
L211072 +++$+++ u935 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ HEROINE +++$+++ Ok. Let's see what happens.
L211071 +++$+++ u932 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ GOLDIE +++$+++ Yeah, I'll go.
L211020 +++$+++ u935 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ HEROINE +++$+++ Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?
L211019 +++$+++ u932 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ GOLDIE +++$+++ Okay, well... anybody else have an idea?
L210844 +++$+++ u935 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ HEROINE +++$+++ Everyone take a role. Let's prepare the guns, ammo and whatever else we can scare up. We also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here.  So, who's going into the basement with me?
L210843 +++$+++ u932 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ GOLDIE +++$+++ Hey!
L210821 +++$+++ u935 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ HEROINE +++$+++ As long as it's dark, they're around. They hide, wait for you to drop your guard, and then attack.
L210820 +++$+++ u932 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ GOLDIE +++$+++ Well, maybe they migrate?
L211228 +++$+++ u935 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ HEROINE +++$+++ They'll tear this place down within the hour.
L211227 +++$+++ u933 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ GOOD GUY +++$+++ Let's wait it out.
L211149 +++$+++ u935 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ HEROINE +++$+++ YOU'LL HIT US!
L211148 +++$+++ u933 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ GOOD GUY +++$+++ DON'T!
L211102 +++$+++ u933 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ GOOD GUY +++$+++ She's not very nice, is she?
L211101 +++$+++ u935 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ HEROINE +++$+++ Let's go.
L211088 +++$+++ u935 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ HEROINE +++$+++ Nothing, just lookin'.
L211087 +++$+++ u933 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ GOOD GUY +++$+++ What's wrong?
L210803 +++$+++ u935 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ HEROINE +++$+++ Right. Were going to need some fire power.  Do you have any sort of guns or ammunition here? Anything at all?
L210802 +++$+++ u933 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ GOOD GUY +++$+++ Do we have anything else to defend ourselves with? Anything?
L211340 +++$+++ u937 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ ROADIE +++$+++ GO-GO-GO!!
L211339 +++$+++ u935 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ HEROINE +++$+++ Get to your cars!
L211324 +++$+++ u935 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ HEROINE +++$+++ Go!!!
L211323 +++$+++ u937 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ ROADIE +++$+++ Not without you!!!
L211322 +++$+++ u935 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ HEROINE +++$+++ Go! Go!
L211237 +++$+++ u935 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ HEROINE +++$+++ Make a distraction out front and go for it out the back. There's cars back there, right?
L211236 +++$+++ u937 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ ROADIE +++$+++ If there is only one way out for us, there is only one way in for them.
L211154 +++$+++ u935 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ HEROINE +++$+++ Wait God-dammit!
L211153 +++$+++ u937 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ ROADIE +++$+++ Let's go!
L211118 +++$+++ u937 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ ROADIE +++$+++ Whoa!
L211117 +++$+++ u935 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ HEROINE +++$+++ Hold it!
L210869 +++$+++ u935 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ HEROINE +++$+++ That's fine.
L210868 +++$+++ u937 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ ROADIE +++$+++ There's a rifle and a shotgun here.
L210807 +++$+++ u937 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ ROADIE +++$+++ So we've got guns, kitchen knives, pipes, fire and sticks.
L210806 +++$+++ u935 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ HEROINE +++$+++ Okay, well that's something.
L210672 +++$+++ u935 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ HEROINE +++$+++ Father. The biggest, the strongest...
L210671 +++$+++ u937 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ ROADIE +++$+++ And the last one is the...
L210670 +++$+++ u935 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ HEROINE +++$+++ If you are face to face with her, dive left.
L211374 +++$+++ u935 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ HEROINE +++$+++ I think --
L211373 +++$+++ u941 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ TUFFY +++$+++ Did we make it?
L211307 +++$+++ u941 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ TUFFY +++$+++ I'd love to.
L211306 +++$+++ u935 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ HEROINE +++$+++ We should stick together out there.
L210925 +++$+++ u941 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ TUFFY +++$+++ Deal.
L210924 +++$+++ u935 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ HEROINE +++$+++ I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side.
L210923 +++$+++ u941 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ TUFFY +++$+++ I'll do anything to help.
L210922 +++$+++ u935 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ HEROINE +++$+++ She's still alive, I hope. I wouldn't have made it this far if it weren't for the chance of seeing my little girl again. I need to get to her.
L210921 +++$+++ u941 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ TUFFY +++$+++ Oh...
L210920 +++$+++ u935 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ HEROINE +++$+++ Her name is Charlie.
L210919 +++$+++ u935 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ HEROINE +++$+++ Right.
L210918 +++$+++ u941 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ TUFFY +++$+++ We all have to be strong, right?
L210917 +++$+++ u935 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ HEROINE +++$+++ I admire your strength.
L210916 +++$+++ u941 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ TUFFY +++$+++ I'm fine, I really am.
L210915 +++$+++ u935 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ HEROINE +++$+++ You know you don't have to do this.
L210849 +++$+++ u935 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ HEROINE +++$+++ All right.
L210848 +++$+++ u941 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ TUFFY +++$+++ Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have no idea what is running through me right now. No idea.  I'm ready.
L210684 +++$+++ u935 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ HEROINE +++$+++ Let's lock off this room.
L210683 +++$+++ u941 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ TUFFY +++$+++ Oh sweetheart! What was I thinking? Mommy is never gonna let you go. Oh Jesus... Never, ever, never let you go.
L210679 +++$+++ u935 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ HEROINE +++$+++ Stop her!
L210678 +++$+++ u941 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ TUFFY +++$+++ Cody! Cody are you all right? Mommy's coming! Mommy's coming, baby! Don't move! Mommy's coming!
L210661 +++$+++ u935 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ HEROINE +++$+++ That's one piece of four problems.
L210660 +++$+++ u941 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ TUFFY +++$+++ Oh my God... What is that?
L210530 +++$+++ u938 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ SICKLY BROWNIE +++$+++ I just hit it like you said.
L210529 +++$+++ u940 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ TROOP LEADER +++$+++ What have you done now, broke the darn thing?
L210524 +++$+++ u938 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ SICKLY BROWNIE +++$+++ I said I'm not lying.
L210523 +++$+++ u940 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ TROOP LEADER +++$+++ You know that no one likes a liar, right?
L210522 +++$+++ u938 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ SICKLY BROWNIE +++$+++ I'm not lying.
L210521 +++$+++ u940 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ TROOP LEADER +++$+++ What did we say about lying?
L210520 +++$+++ u938 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ SICKLY BROWNIE +++$+++ Well...
L210519 +++$+++ u940 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ TROOP LEADER +++$+++ Are you lying to me?
L210518 +++$+++ u938 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ SICKLY BROWNIE +++$+++ Um, well...
L210517 +++$+++ u940 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ TROOP LEADER +++$+++ Do you have a note to corroborate these claims?
L210516 +++$+++ u938 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ SICKLY BROWNIE +++$+++ Um, my allergist told me not to engage in physically demanding activities where ragweed or spores might be present, sir.
L210515 +++$+++ u940 +++$+++ m61 +++$+++ TROOP LEADER +++$+++ Hey little bear, aren't you going to join the others?
L221504 +++$+++ u942 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ BARNES +++$+++ I'm sorry... that was an unfortunate choice of words.
L221503 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ 'Forgive'...? For What?
L221502 +++$+++ u942 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ BARNES +++$+++ Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you.
L221501 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?
L221500 +++$+++ u942 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ BARNES +++$+++ Come on, Frances. Louella Parsons is here. She wants to talk to you, help you out.
L221499 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Putting on my armor.
L221498 +++$+++ u942 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ BARNES +++$+++ What're you doing?
L221497 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Refill my drink, will you, Bob?
L221496 +++$+++ u942 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ BARNES +++$+++ Frances?  Oh no.
L221479 +++$+++ u942 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ BARNES +++$+++ Come on. They make you feel nice and peppy.
L221478 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too?
L221477 +++$+++ u942 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ BARNES +++$+++ Here, take a few of these. Studio makes 'em in the basement. They keep the fat off.
L221476 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ You're right. I'm sorry.  Okay, let's go get 'em.
L221475 +++$+++ u942 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ BARNES +++$+++ Look, Frances, I didn't want this job. Think I'm crazy? But you begged me: improve your image. So please... lemme try, huh?
L221474 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ But we've been at it since six this morning. At least you could've let me go home and change.
L221473 +++$+++ u942 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ BARNES +++$+++ Come on, it's just what you need! Let everyone see you. Talk to them, live it up!
L221472 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ This is a mistake. No. This is a disaster.
L221471 +++$+++ u942 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ BARNES +++$+++ Well... come on.
L221389 +++$+++ u943 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ BEBE +++$+++ I think it's time to take the gloves off.  Get me some reporters.  Particularly Louella Parsons!
L221388 +++$+++ u961 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ LAWYER +++$+++ Oh. I mean, good.
L221387 +++$+++ u943 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ BEBE +++$+++ That's not the point. Frances Farmer has the world by the tit because of this studio, and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you. No. No, that young lady has a contract, and she's going to honor it.
L221386 +++$+++ u961 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ LAWYER +++$+++ Well... you could always dump her, Mr. Bebe. Teach her a lesson. There are a million beautiful girls out there who don't give a damn about politics.
L221385 +++$+++ u943 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ BEBE +++$+++ I don't know who she fucked to get where she is, but I don't think it was me.
L221384 +++$+++ u961 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ LAWYER +++$+++ Excuse me, sir?
L221383 +++$+++ u943 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ BEBE +++$+++ I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me...
L221382 +++$+++ u961 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ LAWYER +++$+++ And on top of her political activities, now she's got a lawyer. She wants out of her contract, Mr. Bebe. She says she's through with motion pictures.
L221161 +++$+++ u943 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ BEBE +++$+++ Very fine bone structure.
L221160 +++$+++ u944 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I guess so, sir.
L221159 +++$+++ u943 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ BEBE +++$+++ Okay. Good tits. Can't we show them off a little more?
L221158 +++$+++ u944 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Frances Farmer, contract player, six- month option.
L221157 +++$+++ u943 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ BEBE +++$+++ Who's this?
L221156 +++$+++ u944 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Good morning, Mr. Bebe!
L221470 +++$+++ u943 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ BEBE +++$+++ I'd like nothing better.
L221469 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Look, Mr. Bebe, you can hold me to my contract, but you can't break me. I'm back, and I'm gonna make the best of it.
L221230 +++$+++ u943 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ BEBE +++$+++ That's right. You're an actress, Miss Farmer and your job is to act.
L221229 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ But I'm the one up there on the screen.
L221228 +++$+++ u943 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ BEBE +++$+++ No, I'm concerned with everything.
L221227 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ But I'm concerned with everything, Mr. Bebe.
L221226 +++$+++ u943 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ BEBE +++$+++ Society is falling apart, Miss Farmer, and people have to buckle down, do their jobs. You see, I view myself as the Henry Ford of motion picture industry, and I can't have the fellow who puts on the wheels arguing with the man who installs head-lights, now can I?
L221225 +++$+++ u943 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ BEBE +++$+++ Never mind that. I'm concerned about you. Your attitude.
L221224 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Really? That's a very good book. It'd make a terrific --
L221223 +++$+++ u943 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ BEBE +++$+++ Since we have you on a seven year contract, I'm planning long-range. I'm going to loan you out to Sam Goldwyn to make a picture called "Come and Get It."
L221222 +++$+++ u943 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ BEBE +++$+++ I intend to make a great deal of money off you.
L221221 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Thank you --
L221220 +++$+++ u943 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ BEBE +++$+++ I like your looks. You have the classical bone structure of the very great beauties... Garbo, Dietrich --
L221219 +++$+++ u943 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ BEBE +++$+++ You see: We've got to change that name.
L221218 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ That's Frances. I'm not the cookbook.
L221310 +++$+++ u944 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ ...acts. I'll relay your message.
L221309 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'
L221308 +++$+++ u944 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?
L221307 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies.
L221306 +++$+++ u944 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ That's not all, Frances. Mr. Bebe is very concerned about your politics. He hears you've been donating money, speaking at rallies.
L221304 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Uh-huh. You mean what if the public finds out I perspire? And wear slacks. And drive an old jalopy? What if they find out I'm a real person. Oh no! Say it ain't so! Not a real person!
L221303 +++$+++ u944 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ You know what I mean.
L221302 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ I don't care if my clothes are taken seriously. Or my car.
L221301 +++$+++ u944 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Yes, but... Really, I hate to sound... it's just that the public expects something different from its stars. People won't take you seriously.
L221300 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ It's a perfectly good car. It runs.
L221299 +++$+++ u944 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car --
L221298 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ My clothes?
L221297 +++$+++ u944 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Well, I suppose I should just say it. It's your clothes.
L221296 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.
L221295 +++$+++ u944 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ CLAIRE +++$+++ Hi Frances, got a minute?
L221381 +++$+++ u945 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ CLIFFORD +++$+++ Come here. I want to show you something.
L221380 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Huh.
L221379 +++$+++ u945 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ CLIFFORD +++$+++ Okay, but come here first.
L221378 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Oh well. I guess I better leave then.
L221377 +++$+++ u945 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ CLIFFORD +++$+++ Oh my God! Frances, I'm such a cad. I can't go through with this. My wife is in Europe, but this is her house...  her bedroom. I can't ask you to...
L221376 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ Thank you.
L221375 +++$+++ u945 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ CLIFFORD +++$+++ Madam...?
L221374 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ What?
L221373 +++$+++ u945 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ CLIFFORD +++$+++ Good, good. Give them that.
L221372 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ God damn it, Clifford, will you shut up! I tell you, I want to give these things! I want to give them to the audience, and I can give them, I will give them, so shut up!
L221371 +++$+++ u945 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ CLIFFORD +++$+++ You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it --
L221370 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ I'm not!
L221369 +++$+++ u945 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ CLIFFORD +++$+++ You're afraid!
L221368 +++$+++ u955 +++$+++ m62 +++$+++ FRANCES +++$+++ I'm not!
