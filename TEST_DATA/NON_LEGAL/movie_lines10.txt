L5255 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Yeah, but we didn't get 'em.
L5254 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
L5253 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.
L5252 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I don't know about you, but I could use a drink... I'll buy you one.  It'll be my good-bye present.
L5251 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
L5250 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
L5249 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Hey, how'd my car get here?
L5237 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
L5236 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Notice something funny about that bus?
L5227 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Luther's on the move...
L5226 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Why?
L5225 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
L5224 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ That was quick.
L5213 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.
L5212 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah, I see her.
L5210 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah. Guess not.
L5209 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...
L5208 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Thanks for callin' in... and I guess Maybe... Look, I'm sorry I called you Watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. I was just leanin' on ya, doin' my job.
L5207 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You sure that's the reason?
L5206 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...
L5205 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...
L5204 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Tell me something.  Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?
L5202 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ So you took the rest of the night off...
L5201 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the "Don't Disturb" sign.  He's trading his girl for the money.  All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind.
L5200 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.
L5199 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
L5198 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
L5197 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ We missed.
L5196 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ What about Ganz?
L5195 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ What about Luther?
L5192 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Hello. And goodbye.
L5191 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
L5190 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Where's luther?
L5172 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I'll be there in a minute. You don't move your ass, right?
L5171 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Hey, Jack, how ya doin'? What took you so long to call, man? I been waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman's... 'Course you don't hang out here; it's for the brothers.
L5085 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ No way...
L5084 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ You stay with me...
L5083 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
L5077 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set.
L5076 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ That was in style a couple years back, man.
L5074 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?
L5073 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?
L5072 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.
L5071 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ No class...
L5070 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
L5069 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.
L5068 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah, it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy...
L5067 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row...
L5066 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin', cause I already think he's real dumb.
L5065 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money...
L5064 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You got a very depressing view of life, man... you gotta smile once in awhile...
L5063 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
L5062 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Doesn't it get... Tiring?
L5061 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ If they don't tell me what I need to know...
L5060 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?
L5059 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ That ain't philosophy.  That's common sense.
L5058 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
L5057 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...
L5056 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make you stupid?
L5055 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
L5054 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.
L5053 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
L5052 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.
L5051 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I had no choice. Some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue Cadillac.
L5050 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
L5049 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash?
L5038 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Jesus Christ.  That's a disgrace The guy pulls a gun on a cop and he's out in 24 hours.  I tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door.
L5037 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Musta got some primo bondsman.
L5036 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ What?
L5035 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Guess what?  Luther just got in line.
L5034 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.
L5033 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time.
L5030 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Shit.
L5029 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
L5028 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.
L5025 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You just drove by it.
L5024 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ ...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
L5023 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.
L5022 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
L5021 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Where's the goddamn car?
L5020 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah.  Right.
L5019 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
L5018 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Right, partner.
L5017 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ In the trunk of a car.  A lot better than under a mattress, right?
L5016 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Where's the money?
L5014 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.
L5013 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You gonna let me keep any of it?
L5012 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Not likely, convict.
L5011 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ We split 50-50?
L5010 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You catch on real fast...Okay, Jack, let's talk deal. How much of my money you gonna let me keep?
L5009 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ He's after your money.
L5008 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
L5007 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Just tell me about the money.
L5005 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Jesus.
L5004 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Half a million.
L5003 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ How much?
L5002 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I been waiting a long time for some money.
L4997 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.
L4996 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ They saved your ass, convict.
L4995 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
L4994 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah, right.  You want to try again?
L4975 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...
L4974 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Maybe I don't like the way you ask.
L4973 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Luther knew more than he told me and so do you...Now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about.  I gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the clock's runnin' ...
L4972 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
L4971 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
L4970 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
L4969 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ This sucks.  A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it. So, instead of me being where I oughta be, which is in bed giving my girl the high, hard one, I'm out here doing this shit, roaming around with some overdressed, charcoal-colored loser like you.
L4965 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us.  How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and...
L4964 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Let's go.
L4939 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Come on.
L4938 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Must be billy's girl.
L4937 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ There.
L4930 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too.
L4929 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You made that move, huh?
L4912 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
L4911 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.
L4896 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
L4895 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
L4894 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
L4893 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.
L4891 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ The bet's off.
L4890 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
L4889 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.
L4888 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ What are you talkin' about?
L4887 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.
L4886 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ That's never been one of my problems.
L4885 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
L4884 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
L4883 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
L4882 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Hey, you wanna bet?
L4881 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ You need five years training to handle a joint like...
L4880 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...
L4879 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Bullshit.  Attitude and experience get you through...
L4878 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
L4877 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
L4876 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
L4875 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
L4874 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
L4873 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Well?
L4871 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her.  She got great tits?
L4870 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Sure.  Then we had a fight this morning.
L4869 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You have a good time?
L4868 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Last night.
L4867 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Last night, two nights ago, three?
L4866 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I don't give out the details.
L4864 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian.
L4863 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Now, where we goin', convict?
L4861 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?
L4860 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?
L4858 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
L4857 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
L4855 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor.
L4854 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
L4853 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
L4852 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ We eat when I say we eat.
L4851 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
L4850 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.
L4849 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
L4848 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.
L4828 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker?
L4827 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
L4826 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I think you better put him on ice, man.
L4825 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ What do you think?
L4816 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Want to try it again?
L4815 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Thank you.
L4814 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Hey, this works pretty good.
L4803 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Just throw me the Goddamn gun.
L4802 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
L4801 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
L4800 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man.
L4792 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I'm helpin' you, huh?
L4791 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
L4790 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
L4789 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Just up the street, the other side, over there ... Now, don't bother knockin' on the door. Luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company.
L4788 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I may call you worse than that.
L4787 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
L4786 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.
L4785 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.
L4784 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
L4783 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
L4782 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Luther was part of the gang?
L4781 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.
L4780 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Okay, let's get down to it.  I did my part and got you out.  So now you tell me where we're goin'?
L4779 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
L4778 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Yeah.

L4774 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
L4773 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ No way to start a partnership.

L4765 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ We're supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers...
L4764 +++$+++ u71 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ HAMMOND +++$+++ What are you talkin' about?  This suit's mine.  It cost $900.
L4763 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ This prison gives out $400 suits?
L4751 +++$+++ u67 +++$+++ m4 +++$+++ CATES +++$+++ I'll think about it.
