L380219 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Good.  So let's go...
L380218 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ No.
L380217 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ No.  You gonna give me phony reassurances?
L380216 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Gina in the Miami pad.  You gonna give me phony denials?
L380215 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Like...?
L380214 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ You worried about the tree line, US Customs AWACS, or something else on your mind?
L380213 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ To the limit.
L380172 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Who knows...
L380171 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ They watching us watching them watching us waiting for them?  Or what?
L380167 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Five minutes...
L380166 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ What do we got?
L380165 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Port-Au-Prince.
L380164 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Where we meeting 'em...?
L380153 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Nothing.
L380152 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Anything?
L380140 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ What happened to the last transporter you <u>had</u>?
L380139 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Then it don't work.
L380134 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Money thing is done in advance in places where there are no guns. Because when money and guns get together, there is violence...
L380133 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ What <u>you</u> get <u>from</u> us is a date.  A place.  "In the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami."  At such-and-such time, an eighteen- wheeler will be there.  Keys in the ignition.  Ready to roll.  You pick it up.  And you drive it...  ...away.
L380132 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ The people on shore who handle a load we run are our people, not your people.  No tweakers, dopers, first- timers we don't know.  They didn't do time with us, they ain't doing crime with us.
L380130 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ What kind of weight?
L380129 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ And specialize in very fast go-fast boats for coastal runs.
L380126 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ So we can close each other's eyes right now.  Real easy.  Real fast.  But, then, nobody makes any money...
L380125 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ "No, viejo.  That was José Yero, splattered all over his motherfucking wall."
L380124 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ People gonna walk into this place and say, "Ola, hijo!  That some crazy wallpaper.  Whew...it wild! Is that a Jackson Pollack?"
L380121 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ That way we do not waste AvGas or our motherfucking time.
L380120 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ And we didn't come down here to audition.  Business auditions for us...  ...and know who we are and know they want their load run by us <u>before</u> Nicholas calls.
L380077 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ We could try to run loads into these guys.  Run a few loads for Montoya into South Florida.  Into this group.
L380076 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ So?
L380075 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ It says, "We do not fear you."  It says, "Fuck off and die."  It says, "We get down for recreation..."
L380074 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Track with me, here...  They knew the "Russians" were undercover Feeb?  They should have no-showed.  But, no, these guys show anyway, and commit murder upon federal officers.  And steal all your money...  What does that say to you?
L380072 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Transpo?  How they bringing the loads in...?
L380071 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Aryan brothers are not going to change-up suppliers.  So...
L380049 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ White gangs is tweakers and a crystal meth lab in a trailer park. Bounce around the old lady Saturday night and get your recidivist ass busted back...
L380048 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ White gangs...?  It doesn't track.
L379981 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Something's wrong.
L379980 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Stevens?
L379979 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Alonzo...
L379978 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ What is it?
L379951 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Hello, Miss Ukraine...
L379950 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ The honey trap.  And there's the honey.
L379949 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ And there's Dmitri...
L379918 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Skin has to touch skin.  That's the requirement for the warrant.  Then he makes a credible excuse and he stops....  Her crew blackmailed and asset- stripped the last mark down to his social security...
L379917 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ How lucky's Miss Universe gotta be?
L379916 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Backup in case the Russians get physical.
L379915 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ What's our deal?
L380489 +++$+++ u6580 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TRUDY +++$+++ If you're down, we're down for the play.
L380488 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Then you should.
L380487 +++$+++ u6580 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TRUDY +++$+++ If we were for real, and knew our shit, we'd fade this one...
L380482 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Switek?
L380481 +++$+++ u6580 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TRUDY +++$+++ Too fast.  Too many moving parts.
L380480 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Go ahead.
L379954 +++$+++ u6580 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TRUDY +++$+++ You're giving away your money, fool...
L379953 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Twenty on my man...
L379952 +++$+++ u6580 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TRUDY +++$+++ Eleven to seven he blows it.
L380384 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ I'm my <u>own</u> man.  And anytime you want to see how much man I am?
L380383 +++$+++ u6574 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ FUJIMA +++$+++ Control your men.
L380372 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Haiti and Puerto Rico.  Money through Dubai and Geneva maybe.
L380371 +++$+++ u6574 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ FUJIMA +++$+++ Out of...?
L380366 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Montoya.  We went to meet the village priest.  It turns into Alice in the fucking Vatican and here's the Pope...of the North Valle Colombia dope trade.
L380365 +++$+++ u6574 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ FUJIMA +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L380364 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Who's the "we"?  There's you and there's us.  And all we got from you was bad intel.  "Low-level producer."  Yeah, right...
L380363 +++$+++ u6574 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ FUJIMA +++$+++ Who said, "go exploring"?  We want this staying on track.
L380070 +++$+++ u6574 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ FUJIMA +++$+++ From the North Valle area.  New. Low-level, we think.
L380069 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Never heard of him.
L380068 +++$+++ u6574 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ FUJIMA +++$+++ A Colombian producer.  Named Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono.
L380067 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ From whom...?
L380064 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ How do we do that?  Make a buy?  That went well...
L380063 +++$+++ u6574 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ FUJIMA +++$+++ Get into business with this crew, identify them.  Illuminate their network.  If you're lucky, discover their source, how they penetrated us.  We'll indict and take it from there...
L380060 +++$+++ u6574 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ FUJIMA +++$+++ To recruit you.
L380059 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ So what do you want?
L380054 +++$+++ u6574 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ FUJIMA +++$+++ We don't know.
L380053 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ How?
L380012 +++$+++ u6574 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ FUJIMA +++$+++ NLR, we think.  I wanna know...
L380011 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ OMGs, Mongols, Nazi Low-Riders, prison gangs?
L380007 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ ...so there's <u>no</u> industrial- strength HRT weapons team out there tonight?
L380006 +++$+++ u6574 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ FUJIMA +++$+++ That's right.
L380005 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ And the deal goes down at another place at another time.
L380004 +++$+++ u6574 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ FUJIMA +++$+++ Meet and greet.  "I flash you some of mine, you flash me some of yours?"
L380003 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ "Buy and walk"?  "Buy and bust"? "Reverse undercover"?  What?
L380002 +++$+++ u6574 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ FUJIMA +++$+++ Guy's involved in a "meet"...
L380001 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ How do I know?  I got the call from Alonzo on an open line.  That is the hand we have been dealt at this moment, at eleven-forty-seven o'clock Friday night.  Okay?  I am trying to alert you, here.  <u>You</u> know whether or not...you have a thing goin' down.  I do not.  But we know this guy.  I think you know this guy.  Normally, he is cool.  Tonight he is distraught. That is atypical.  That engenders foreboding.  Do you understand the meaning of the word "foreboding"? As in badness is happening to <u>your</u> deal right fucking now?
L380000 +++$+++ u6574 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ FUJIMA +++$+++ How do I discuss operations over an open line?
L379999 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force.  Name of Alonzo Stevens.  Now, he's YOUR informant.  Stevens, called us.  I haven't spoken to him for six months. I do not know what case you have him on.  I do not know what he is talking about.  But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad.  Right now...
L379998 +++$+++ u6574 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ FUJIMA +++$+++ Okay.  What's up?
L379997 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ 4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.
L379996 +++$+++ u6574 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ FUJIMA +++$+++ What's your Miami PD badge number?
L379995 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Detective Crockett.
L379994 +++$+++ u6574 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ FUJIMA +++$+++ This is Agent James Fujima.
L379993 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Hello?
L380160 +++$+++ u6575 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ GINA +++$+++ If they ran the rental car or lease on this place...even if it's EPIC database in El Paso...they'd have to work through the layers of bullshit three weeks deep.  Then they'd find your deeper, hidden criminal selves...
L380159 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ How will it stand up?
L380158 +++$+++ u6575 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ GINA +++$+++ You're so <u>not</u> the PD, if you got busted on a DUI, you're in serious trouble...you're bad men back to grammar school.  San Quentin.  Pelican Bay.  Marine Corps.  Statesville. Pelican Bay, where you guys hooked up.  Now you're too smart and too fast to get jacked again...
L380155 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Hi, Gina.  This is from Frick and Frack. Trudy?
L380154 +++$+++ u6575 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ GINA +++$+++ "Hi, Gina.  Hi, Sonny."
L379921 +++$+++ u6575 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ GINA +++$+++ I have faith.  In horoscopes and fortune cookies...
L379920 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Have faith.
L379919 +++$+++ u6575 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ GINA +++$+++ This I gotta see...  ...the "make up an excuse and stop" part.
L380028 +++$+++ u6579 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ STEVENS +++$+++ How do I know?  But it was from the get-go.  Knew the FBI had run me into them.  Sonny, I gotta go...!
L380027 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ How'd they get onto you?
L379977 +++$+++ u6579 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ STEVENS +++$+++ Goodbye.
L379976 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Alonzo...!
L379975 +++$+++ u6579 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ STEVENS +++$+++ ...look after her.  Ask Rico to. Okay?  Do that for me.  I had to do it.  They had me from the gate. Do that.  Whatever you can do for them.  Okay?  Look what I did to them, Sonny...!
L379974 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Where are you?
L379973 +++$+++ u6579 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ STEVENS +++$+++ After I check on Francine and the boys, then I'm gone.  Sonny, tell Rico I'm so sorry.  I wanted you to know...
L379972 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Alonzo, what's goin' on?!
L379971 +++$+++ u6579 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ STEVENS +++$+++ I gave up nothing on you guys. Don't worry.  I kept you and Rico out of it.  Only the Feds.  They're on their own...it's all their deal, anyway, so fuck 'em.
L379970 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ I don't understand...
L379969 +++$+++ u6579 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ STEVENS +++$+++ They had me from the gate.
L379968 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Alonzo?  What are you talking about?  Where are you...?
L379967 +++$+++ u6579 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ STEVENS +++$+++ It's fucked up.  I'm sorry...
L379964 +++$+++ u6579 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ STEVENS +++$+++ I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Sonny...
L379963 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ On the phone.
L379962 +++$+++ u6579 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ STEVENS +++$+++ Where's Riccardo?
L379961 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Yeah.
L379960 +++$+++ u6579 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ STEVENS +++$+++ Sonny...?
L379959 +++$+++ u6572 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ CROCKETT +++$+++ Yeah...?
L380379 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ He's talking to you, bro.  What he means to say is he is reluctant to abandon the penetration of a major narcotrafficking organization...
L380378 +++$+++ u6574 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ FUJIMA +++$+++ Who are you talking to?
L380066 +++$+++ u6574 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ FUJIMA +++$+++ They got a steady stream of supply. So, no...
L380065 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Reverse undercover?  WE supply to them?
L380058 +++$+++ u6574 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ FUJIMA +++$+++ But Miami PD wasn't part of the J.I.T.  And from what Alonzo said, he didn't give you up.
L380057 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ As in, your ass is dead in the water.
L380056 +++$+++ u6574 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ FUJIMA +++$+++ We don't know.  And that's the point.  Maybe there's a mole. Whatever, it's a disaster.  And it's a Joint Interagency Task Force.  I have DEA, ATF, U.S. Customs components in on it.  So the penetration could be from any one agency.  What we do know is I have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions 'cause I have to assume our Operational Security is blown.
L380055 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Break your encryption?  Hack your e- mail?  Employee databases? Somebody on the inside?
L380047 +++$+++ u6574 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ FUJIMA +++$+++ We think NLR.  We don't know! Alonzo only fronted as a broker for our guys to make the meet.  He wasn't deep into the crew.
L380046 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ C'mon, man!
L380014 +++$+++ u6574 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ FUJIMA +++$+++ ...what else, what else did he indicate to you?  I need to know everything he said.
L380013 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Oh, good...
L380010 +++$+++ u6574 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ FUJIMA +++$+++ White supremacist types.
L380009 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
L380008 +++$+++ u6574 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ FUJIMA +++$+++ Correct.  Flash samples.  Flash cash.
L380211 +++$+++ u6575 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ GINA +++$+++ ...you are trying to reassure me because you know when people get anxious, they make mistakes. You're worried about me.  Do not be.  I am careful.  I am cool.  I got Trudy, backup, whatever.  You worry about you.  Because you are the ones who are in denied territory, not me.  If your focus is on me, you'll miss something coming at you.  That's how people slip up. Get hurt.  And I'd die if anything happened.  You worry about <u>you</u>. You and Sonny...are in the dangerous place.  I'm fine...
L380210 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ ...even if they could run the identities you built to EPIC, all they'll find is more cover... Trust what you built.  It's quality, girl.  We're cool...
L380209 +++$+++ u6575 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ GINA +++$+++ ...the lease, the phones, the cars...layers of false ident. Would take the FBI weeks.  How long did it take them?  Three hours? Four?  This means, "We can reach out and touch somebody."  Like Bad Teleflora.
L380208 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Good idea.  We'll grab a bite.
L380207 +++$+++ u6575 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ GINA +++$+++ Okay.
L380204 +++$+++ u6575 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ GINA +++$+++ "Salutations from the south..."
L380203 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ What's it say?
L380202 +++$+++ u6575 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ GINA +++$+++ You mean with the flowers...?
L380200 +++$+++ u6575 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ GINA +++$+++ The bouquet, here.  Five-hundred dollars worth of roses...yellow.
L380199 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ What flowers?
L380198 +++$+++ u6575 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ GINA +++$+++ ...and thanks for the flowers.
L380197 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Okay...see you soon.
L380196 +++$+++ u6575 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ GINA +++$+++ Bored.
L380195 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Nothing.  Calling to say hi... What's up with you?
L380194 +++$+++ u6575 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ GINA +++$+++ Yes.  What's up?
L380193 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ You sure?
L380192 +++$+++ u6575 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ GINA +++$+++ Yeah.
L380191 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ You okay?
L380162 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Reality TV and stay by the phone. That's what all wives-in-crime do...
L380161 +++$+++ u6575 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ GINA +++$+++ What am I supposed to do after I get my nails and hair done...?
L379943 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ He did volunteer one time...
L379942 +++$+++ u6575 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ GINA +++$+++ Only African he ever "relocated" was a $2,000-an-hour Nigerian model for Gucci, and he got wounded when she took an NBA draft choice to the Super Bowl instead of him...
L379923 +++$+++ u6575 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ GINA +++$+++ Switek pulling this off...?  That's not faith; that's delusional...
L379922 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ So?
L380421 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ I like the diminished risk.  It frees up capital reserves.  I like working with self-interested businessmen who are competent.  You can predict their behavior....
L380420 +++$+++ u6578 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ MONTOYA +++$+++ What would you do...?
L380419 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ I think José suspects anybody he doesn't intimidate.  And people, who are good at what they do?  They have egos, too...
L380417 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ A good deal, like this with us, for Burnett will be good only temporarily.  He'll get restless because he believes nothing is forever.  Life is dust, make it while you can.  He's ambitious.
L380416 +++$+++ u6578 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ MONTOYA +++$+++ Why?
L380415 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ They're serious.  They're cautious. They'll forgo a deal over a technicality of how a delivery's handled...they'd walk away, rather than compromise operational security...that's good.
L380414 +++$+++ u6578 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ MONTOYA +++$+++ And...?
L380412 +++$+++ u6578 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ MONTOYA +++$+++ But what does your intuition tell you...?
L380411 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ Burnett?  They want 22% of the value on loads they run into South Florida.  It's the Juarez cartel model. They guarantee the loads.  The upside is our risk goes to zero. That frees-up capital.
L380410 +++$+++ u6578 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ MONTOYA +++$+++ José doesn't like the deal in South Florida...
L380409 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ They've been targeted.  And Pakistani registry is too vulnerable to search and seizure right now.
L380408 +++$+++ u6578 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ MONTOYA +++$+++ Not French registry?
L380407 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.
L380406 +++$+++ u6578 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ MONTOYA +++$+++ Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
L380405 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ ...and we're looking at Nigerian crude...
L380523 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ They will kill you.  And then they will kill your wife, too.
L380522 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Meaning...?
L380521 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ It's all bullshit.  Jesus is out of communication in Fals de Iguazu. José knows that...  Whatever he's going to do, he has to do it fast because he's acting on his own. And he will need a story.
L380517 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ Of course!  That is why I placed myself here, with you, knowing Yero would pull this crap.
L380516 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ You set this up!
L380515 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ That sonofabitch!
L380270 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ Maritime.  Jose will fill you in.
L380269 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Conveyance?
L380265 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ "Future" of...?
L380264 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ And as an investment in the future...
L380181 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ Two, three thousand a ki. Two thousand ki's, your end is $6,000,000.  Complex transshipments or dealing with containers, these have front- loaded costs we pickup.  For this kind of weight, the balance of 80% is when our buyer picks up the load.  Transactions are offshore.  Dollars or euros.  Secure internet transfers.  We have lists of Cayman and Isle of Man banks infiltrated by IRS, to be avoided...  No transactions of cash or other banking instruments take place on U.S. soil...  That's the deal.
L380180 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Define small.
L380179 +++$+++ u6576 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ ISABELLA +++$+++ I run down the numbers.  Nothing is very negotiable.  Small loads?  We pay three thousand a ki. We pay your fuel costs up front plus ten percent.  The next ten percent on U.S. landfall.
L380442 +++$+++ u6577 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ JOSÉ YERO +++$+++ You work that out with La Senora.  You will get sixteen fuel bladders of crystal meth precursors from the Malaysian ship.  For collection in North Miami.  You warehouse it. Release it when we say.  I'm sure you have friends with fast boats...
L380441 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Importation value?  At twenty-two thousand a ki...
L380435 +++$+++ u6577 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ JOSÉ YERO +++$+++ <u>You</u> give <u>yours</u> to me.  <u>We</u> position all the assets hauling our loads...
L380434 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Uh-uh.  No predetermined places and times to meet.  Give me their heading and radio codes and I will talk to them directly with the longs and lats and time which will be a last minute deal...
L380433 +++$+++ u6577 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ JOSÉ YERO +++$+++ Transshipment point is here at 17:00 hours on the 23rd.
L380252 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ You don't like us finding your load?  We can go and lose it all over again...
L380251 +++$+++ u6577 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ JOSÉ YERO +++$+++ I walk into Neptune's house...very nice.  But I also see you... and our drugs that got ripped from Maguda.
L380247 +++$+++ u6577 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ JOSÉ YERO +++$+++ It is.  He try to take tonight's load?
L380246 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ This the load you lost a while back?
L380150 +++$+++ u6577 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ JOSÉ YERO +++$+++ Wait by the phone.  You get a call.  Or maybe you don't.  Until then, piss off back to where you come from...
L380149 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ What do I care what you think about how he looks?  You wanna fuck my partner or do business?
L380146 +++$+++ u6577 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ JOSÉ YERO +++$+++ I had to lay eyes on you.
L380145 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Then what were we talking to you for?
L380142 +++$+++ u6581 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ TUBBS +++$+++ Do we need this...?
L380141 +++$+++ u6577 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ JOSÉ YERO +++$+++ What do you care?
L380138 +++$+++ u6577 +++$+++ m437 +++$+++ JOSÉ YERO +++$+++ Nothing.  'Cause how you do delivery on the beach, I don't like.  Maybe this does not work.
