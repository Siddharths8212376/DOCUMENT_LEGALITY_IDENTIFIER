L10326 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ He's got the shakes?
L10320 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Chill out, Lindsey!!
L10319 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ You dumb jarhead motherf--
L10311 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Lindsey!  Wait a second--
L10310 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Look, goddamnit, if you won't do something about it, I will.
L10292 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ We all see what we want to see... Coffey looks and he sees Russians, he sees hate and fear. Bud, you have to look with better eyes than that.
L10291 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ How can I go on a feeling?  You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?
L10290 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ It was a machine, but it seems almost alive. Like a... dance of light.  Bud, you have to trust me... please.  I don't think they mean us harm.  I don't know how I know that, it's just a feeling.
L10289 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Bud, this is me, Lindsey.  Okay?  You know me better than anybody in the world.  Now watch my lips... I saw these things.  I touched one of them.  And it wasn't some clunky steel can like we would build... it glided.  It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
L10288 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ No.
L10287 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
L10286 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew.
L10285 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ I saw something!  I'm not going to go back there and say I didn't see it when I did.  I'm sorry.
L10284 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ All I'm saying is when you're hanging on by your fingernails, you don't go waving you arms around.
L10283 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Who's hysterical?  Nobody's hysterical!
L10282 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Look.  I'm just trying to hold this situation together.  I can't allow you to cause this kind of hysteria--
L10281 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Bud, something really important is happening here.
L10280 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Jesus, Lindsey--
L10270 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ I'm telling you what is there.  You're just not hearing.  The impulses somehow aren't getting from you ears to your brainpan.  There's something down there.  Something not... us.
L10269 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ If you say so.  It could be anything.
L10268 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Come on, you guys... look, this is the little one right here.  You can see how it's kind of zigging around.
L10240 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Yeah?  Well I'm not.
L10239 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Hey, Lins...  I'm glad your here.
L10238 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ I can extend that.  There's some storage tanks outboard on the wrecked module.  I'll have to go outside to tie onto them.
L10237 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ The storm's gonna last longer than 12 hours.
L10236 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Brace yourself.  We've got about 12 hours worth if we close off the sections we're not using.
L10235 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What about O-2?
L10234 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Thanks.  No, I can handle it.  Bud... there won't be enough to run the heaters.  In a couple hours this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker.
L10233 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Need some help?
L10232 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ I can get power to this module and sub-bay if I remote these busses.  I've gotta get past the mains, which are a total melt-down.
L10231 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What's the scoop, ace?
L10185 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Cute, Virgil.
L10184 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Hippy, just relax.  You're making the women nervous.
L10166 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ I don't know.  I DON'T KNOW!
L10165 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What do you think he saw?
L10164 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ But what did he see that made him panic?
L10163 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and pranged his regulator.
L10162 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Jammer saw something in there, something that scared the hell out him--
L10161 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Whose then?  Lindsey?  Talk to me...
L10160 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ No.
L10159 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ But you think it's something else.  What?  One of ours?
L10158 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ I don't know what I saw.  Okay?  Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, fine.  It's a Russian submersible.  No problem.
L10157 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Fine.  Be that way.
L10156 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ No.  Look, forget it.  I don't want to talk about it.
L10155 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Did you get anything on the cameras.  Video or anything?
L10043 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ You're right, Bud.  It was just that simple. Aren't you clever?  You should get your own show... Ask Dr. Bud, advice to the lovelorn from three hundred fathoms.
L10042 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I'll tell you what happened... you woke up one day and realized the guy never made you laugh.
L10041 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Bud, why are you doing this?  It's not part of you life any more.
L10040 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What happened?
L10039 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.
L10038 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ So what about "Michael" then... Mr. Brooks Brothers... Mr. BMW.  You still seeing him?
L10037 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Do you always have to call him that?  The Suit? It makes you sound like such a hick.  His name is Michael.
L10036 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The Suit.
L10035 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ I haven't worn mine in months.
L10034 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I don't know.  Divorce ain't final.  Forgot to take it off.
L10033 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ What are you still wearing that for?
L10030 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Oh, yeah, right... and you only had three years with me.
L10029 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ I was worried about the rig.  I've got over four years invested in this project.
L10028 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ No, I think you were.  Come on, admit it.
L10027 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ That must be it.
L10026 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I think you were worried about me.
L10025 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Not particularly.  Jeez, look where this is set! Morons.
L10024 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You wanna know what I think?
L10023 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Wow, you're right!  Us poor dumb ol' boys might've had to think for ourselves.  Coulda been a disaster.
L10022 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ You need me.  Nobody knows the systems on this rig better than I do.  What is something was to go wrong after the Explorer clears off?  What would have you done?
L10020 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Look, I didn't come down here to fight.
L10019 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I can't believe you were dumb enough to come down.  Now you're stuck here for the storm... dumb, hot-rod... dumb.
L10016 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Who else?
L10015 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Not even when it meant something.  Is that One Night up in Flatbed?
L10014 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ You never did like being called that, did you?
L10013 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Not for long.
L10012 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Well, well.  Mrs. Brigman.
L9970 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Virgil, you wiener!  You never could stand up to fight.  You--
L9969 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ I'm switching off now.
L9968 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ You wimp.  I had a lot riding on this.  They bought you... more like least rented you cheap--
L9967 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it.  So as long as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they tell me.
L9966 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ My rig.  I designed the damn thing.
L9965 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Your rig?
L9964 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work.  We had over seven thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake.  I can't believe you let them grab my rig!
L9963 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Wasn't up to me.
L9962 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ I was, but I managed to bum a ride on the last flight out here.  Only here isn't where I left it, is it, Bud?
L9961 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Hi, Lins.  I thought you were in Houston.
L9960 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ I can't believe you let them do this!
L10229 +++$+++ u3522 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ COFFEY +++$+++ No.
L10228 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Did you find Wilhite?
L10210 +++$+++ u3522 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ COFFEY +++$+++ Monk, Schoenick... secure the package.
L10209 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Coffey, we're a little pressed for time.
L10116 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Let's go, guys.
L10115 +++$+++ u3522 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ COFFEY +++$+++ We'll go in through that large breach.
L10059 +++$+++ u3522 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ COFFEY +++$+++ I'm not interested in your way of doing things. Just get your team ready to dive.
L10058 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around.  It won't work.  You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.
L10057 +++$+++ u3522 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ COFFEY +++$+++ I can't afford slack, Brigman.
L10056 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Look, it's three AM.  These guys are running on bad coffee and four hours sleep.  You better start cutting them some slack.
L10053 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Okay... Hippy's not going... McWhirter, you can run Little Geek.
L10052 +++$+++ u3522 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ COFFEY +++$+++ We'll take reading as we go.  If the reactor's breached or the warheads have released radioactive debris, we'll back away.  Simple.
L10474 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ All right.  Do it!
L10473 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.
L10472 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Is that it?  Is this right?
L10466 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Meet me in the moonpool.  Move fast.
L10465 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ Got it. Over.
L10464 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Go to the infirmary... get the cart .. oxygen... de-fib kit... adrenaline in a... ten cc syringe... and some... heating blankets. You got all that?
L10325 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ Yeah.  The dude's in bad shape... you see his hands?
L10324 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Lins, stay away from that guy.  I mean it.
L10309 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ It's gotta be, like, an emergency plan to keep it away from the Russians... Hotwire one of the nukes with some kinda detonator, put it back in the sub, and fry the whole thing, slicker'n snot. Oh, uh... hi, Lins.
L10308 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Why bring it here?
L10307 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ Come on, man.  What else could it be?
L10247 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Yeah, for now.  Our first priority's to get something to breathe.
L10246 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ Do we just leave him there?
L10245 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ That's it then.  Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and Perry.  Jesus.
L10244 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ That's Perry.
L10188 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ Everything is.
L10187 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.
L10186 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ No, I mean it.  Those SEALs aren't telling us diddly.  Something's going on.
L10181 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ Now we're right in the middle of this big-time international incident.  Like the Cuban Missile Crisis or something.
L10180 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ What's the matter with you?
L10098 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ Check.  Then I just hang with these guys, right?
L10097 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Just get around so your lights are on the hatch.
L9974 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ Yeah, well you never should have married her then.
L9973 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ God, I hate that bitch.
L9972 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ Virgil?
L10389 +++$+++ u3521 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ CATFISH +++$+++ I can't... make it... podner.
L10388 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Hafta... go on to... the moonpool.  Only way.
L10302 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Take the first watch in sonar.  Hippy, you handle the exterior surveillance.  One Night, see if you can get that transmitter working for me, okay?
L10301 +++$+++ u3521 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ CATFISH +++$+++ Yuh?
L10300 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ 'Fish'?
L10141 +++$+++ u3521 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ CATFISH +++$+++ It's his mixture!  Too much oxygen!
L10140 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ He's convulsing!
L10123 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ We're here now.  Let's get her done.
L10122 +++$+++ u3521 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ CATFISH +++$+++ Triple time sounds like a lotta money, Bud.  It ain't.  I'm sorry...
L9918 +++$+++ u3521 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ CATFISH +++$+++ That's cause we love freezin' our butts off out here sooo much, boss.
L9917 +++$+++ u3520 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ BUD +++$+++ Hey, you guys are milking that job.
L10583 +++$+++ u3521 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ CATFISH +++$+++ Out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook- up Coke.
L10582 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ We should be dead.  We didn't decompress.
L10358 +++$+++ u3521 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ CATFISH +++$+++ Happy as hogs in a waller down there, prob'ly.
L10357 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ I think they're from 'you know'.  Some place that has similar conditions... cold, intense pressure.  No light.
L10272 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Not us.  Not human.  Get it?  Something non- human, but intelligent...
L10271 +++$+++ u3521 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ CATFISH +++$+++ Y'all could be more specific.
L10265 +++$+++ u3521 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ CATFISH +++$+++ Missed what?
L10264 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ You better not say you missed that.
L10249 +++$+++ u3521 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ CATFISH +++$+++ You watch yourself.
L10248 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Cat, you tie onto this manifold.  There's some tanks on the other side; I'm gonna go check them out.
L9993 +++$+++ u3521 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ CATFISH +++$+++ Okay, here we go.  Start equalizing, y'all.
L9992 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Couldn't stay away.  You running mixture for us? Good.  Couldn't ask for better.
L9991 +++$+++ u3521 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ CATFISH +++$+++ Howdy, y'all.  Hey, Lindsey!  I'll be damned! You shouldn't be down here sweet thing, ya'll might run ya stockings.
L10401 +++$+++ u3521 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ CATFISH +++$+++ Give me that!!
L10400 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ SHIT!
L10348 +++$+++ u3521 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ CATFISH +++$+++ Just checking is out, huh?  How come?
L10347 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ That thing was probably their version of Big Geek... like an ROV.
L10277 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ Right on!  Hot rods of the Gods.  Right, Lins? Hey, no really!  It could be NTIs.  The CIA has known about them for years.  They abduct people all the time.  There was this woman I knew in Albuquerque who--
L10276 +++$+++ u3521 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ CATFISH +++$+++ Are we talkin' little space friend here?
L10169 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ Turn it up, bozo.
L10168 +++$+++ u3521 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ CATFISH +++$+++ Quiet!  Quiet!
L10051 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ What good's the money if your dick drops off in six months?
L10050 +++$+++ u3521 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ CATFISH +++$+++ Hippy, you pussy.
L10002 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ Now we get to hear about how he used to be a contender.
L10001 +++$+++ u3521 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ CATFISH +++$+++ Those guys ain't so tough.  I fought plenty of guys tougher'n them.
L10315 +++$+++ u3522 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ COFFEY +++$+++ Mrs. Brigman, you're becoming a serious impediment to this mission.  I believe the stress is affecting you.  Escort her to quarters and have Monk prepare a tranquilizer.
L10314 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ You're right... I don't.  I just need to know that this thing is out of here!  You hear me, Roger Ramjet?
L10313 +++$+++ u3522 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ COFFEY +++$+++ You don't need to know the details of this mission... you're better off if you don't.
L10312 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ You've got some huevos bringing this... thing... into my rig!  With everything that's been going on up in the world, you bring a nuclear weapon in here?  Does this strike anyone as particularly psychotic, or is it just me?
L10295 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Gimme a break!  Coffey, these things live three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench!  Trust me... they're not speaking Russian.
L10294 +++$+++ u3522 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ COFFEY +++$+++ I want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras.  We need early warning if the Soviet craft try another incursion.
L10108 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are they?
L10107 +++$+++ u3522 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ COFFEY +++$+++ 24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.
L10106 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ How many are there?
L10105 +++$+++ u3522 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ COFFEY +++$+++ Radiation is nominal.  The warheads must still be intact.
L10094 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Copy that.
L10093 +++$+++ u3522 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ COFFEY +++$+++ Roger, document as much as you can, but keep moving.  We're on a tight timeline.
L10092 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Copy that, continuing forward.  You just want me to get shots of everything, right?
L10089 +++$+++ u3522 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ COFFEY +++$+++ Wilhite, anything?
L10088 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Neutron counter's not showing very much.
L10087 +++$+++ u3522 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ COFFEY +++$+++ Cab One, radiation readings?
L10085 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ The magnetometer is pegged.  Side-scan is showing a big return, but I don't see anything yet.  Are you sure you got the depth right on this?
L10084 +++$+++ u3522 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ COFFEY +++$+++ Cab One, do you see it yet?
L10000 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Oh... chamber runs.  Uh huh, that's good.  Well, hey... you guys know any songs?
L9999 +++$+++ u3522 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ COFFEY +++$+++ Look, we've all made chamber runs to this depth. We're checked out.
L9996 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Don't call me that, okay... I hate that.  Alright, from now on we watch each other closely for signs of HPNS...
L9995 +++$+++ u3522 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ COFFEY +++$+++ We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.
L9994 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Get comfortable.  The bad news is we got six hours in this can, blowing down.  The worse news is it's gonna take us three weeks to decompress back to the surface later.
L9980 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Just hold your water, okay?  So Kirkhill, we gonna do this or we gonna talk about it?
L9979 +++$+++ u3522 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ COFFEY +++$+++ Lady, we better fish or cut bait.
L10517 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ What kind of luminous things, Bud?
L10516 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ Uh, oh...
L10515 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Shut up, Hippy.  Bud, how you doing?
L10514 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ 12000 feet.  Jesus, I don't believe he's doing this.
L10392 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ He couldn't be that dumb.  The guy's a trained killer.  Bud's idea of a fight is arm-wrestling One Night over laundry duty.
L10391 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ He can't get to the door... I think he's going to try and take him himself.
L10374 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ That guy's crazier'n a shithouse rat!
L10373 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Schoenick... your Lieutenant is about to make a real bad career move...
L10334 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ I gotta tell you, that guy scares me a lot more than whatever's down there.  A.J. Squared Away goddamn jarhead robot.  Okay, gimme a couple hours on this.
L10333 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ No.  Just you and me.  We get some proof, then tell them.  Hippy, look... if was can prove to Coffey it's not Russians, maybe he'll ease off the button a little.
L10331 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Let's go for it.  We could get lucky.
L10330 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ Well, yeah, but the tether off it ain't gonna be fancy.  When he gets down there he'll just sit, like a dumb-shit.  Unless something wanders through view of the camera, you'll get nada.
L10329 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Look, you can just punch into his little chip where you want him to go, and he goes, right?
L10275 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ Non-Terrestrial Intelligence.  NTIs.  Yeah, I like that better then UFOs.  Although that works too... Underwater Flying Objects.
L10274 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ A non-terrestrial intelligence.
L10183 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ We got Russian subs creeping around.  Shit! Something goes wrong they could say anything happened down here, man.  Give our folks medals, know what I mean?
L10182 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Figured that out for yourself, did you?
L10078 +++$+++ u3525 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ LINDSEY +++$+++ Going over the wall.  Coming to bearing 065. Everybody stay tight and in sight.
L10077 +++$+++ u3523 +++$+++ m232 +++$+++ HIPPY +++$+++ 1840... 50... 60... 70...
