L649951 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I'm sure he's alright, Bea. They'll find him somewhere.
L649787 +++$+++ u8871 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ BEATRICE +++$+++ C'mon now - give a little nod to Mayfair tradition.
L649786 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Then you wear it.
L649785 +++$+++ u8871 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ BEATRICE +++$+++ 'The heir to the fortune must wear the Mayfair pendant an her wedding day.'  We should all have to suffer such burdens.
L649784 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I don't want it.
L649783 +++$+++ u8871 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ BEATRICE +++$+++ Always give the crovd a taste, darling.  Now - Ryan said I'm supposed to make sure -
L649719 +++$+++ u8871 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ BEATRICE +++$+++ In the bayou, they have a saying... 'You choose the music for the dance - but fortune picks your partner.'   Darling, I'd say you're on a roll.
L649718 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Mm-hmm.    Seems & lot longer.
L649717 +++$+++ u8871 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ BEATRICE +++$+++ You two sees like a perfect fit.   Only two mounths...?
L649705 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Nothing worse than a common tool.
L649704 +++$+++ u8871 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ BEATRICE +++$+++ Aren't they gauche...?   Those steel things are so - common.
L649703 +++$+++ u8871 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ BEATRICE +++$+++ Gifford - that box glued to your hands...?
L649702 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ He made that quite clear, yes.
L649701 +++$+++ u8871 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ BEATRICE +++$+++ I hope Ryan explained that if you stay in this town, you're shackled with pushy relations for the rest of your life.
L649480 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I want to see my mother.
L649479 +++$+++ u8871 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ BEATRICE +++$+++ Rowan - I'm Beatrice Maytair.  Your cousin.  Deedee...you'r mother and I - we - we grew up together.
L649802 +++$+++ u8875 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ GIFFORD +++$+++ Hell - Julien believed it... Carlotta too... and god knows, more than a few of us called her a witch!
L649801 +++$+++ u8871 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ BEATRICE +++$+++ Gifford Mayfair - I'll cook your tongue on a spit!    witches!
L649800 +++$+++ u8875 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ GIFFORD +++$+++ I'm not saying I believe it...but I heard it 'nough times to know somebody did.   They made a deal with the devil.  Y'know - "make us rich" - worship the number thirteen - the whole bit.  And some stuff about 'bringing them all back through a door...'
L649799 +++$+++ u8871 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ BEATRICE +++$+++ You babbling that nonsense - now...? This is a wedding.
L649497 +++$+++ u8871 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ BEATRICE +++$+++ Giff - shuttup.    you're mother was a sweet child, Rowan... A lost little girl in a world too full at things
L649496 +++$+++ u8875 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ GIFFORD +++$+++ In certain cases, hell is the operative word.
L649495 +++$+++ u8871 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ BEATRICE +++$+++ Down here. darling, we figure: If you're taking a trip to God knows where - might as well have one hell of a going-away party.
L649609 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I'm NOT like you!  I'm NOT! You're cruel -
L649608 +++$+++ u8872 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ CARLOTTA +++$+++ Did you like it...? Looking down at Graham and knowing what you could do...?
L649606 +++$+++ u8872 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ CARLOTTA +++$+++ But I had to use my hands.  None before you could kill with their mind.  Graham, my dear.  Your uncle...?
L649605 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ You - are - a - murderer.
L649604 +++$+++ u8872 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ CARLOTTA +++$+++ ...and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster. To kill the legacy!    you are the sum of his desires -
L649603 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ You're mad!  Your mind is sick!
L649602 +++$+++ u8872 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ CARLOTTA +++$+++ And that is why I pushed your grandmother onto the stones - even as she had him inside her...
L649599 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ ENOUGH!!!
L649598 +++$+++ u8872 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ CARLOTTA +++$+++ Witches. Rowan.  that is what we are.
L649597 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Stop it!
L649596 +++$+++ u8872 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ CARLOTTA +++$+++ Just like your mother - and all the others that felt him - and used his power - and went to hell with a smile!
L649595 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ It wes a dream...!
L649594 +++$+++ u8872 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ CARLOTTA +++$+++ Lasher touched you and you loved it.
L649591 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ 'He'...?
L649590 +++$+++ u8872 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ CARLOTTA +++$+++ He's shown himself to you... on the deck.  In the storm.
L649589 +++$+++ u8872 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ CARLOTTA +++$+++ You have the Mayfair eyes.   Tell me, Rowan --- what have those eyes seen that the mind can't fathom...?
L649588 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Why are you doing this...?  Handing out these horrors! Why...?!!
L649587 +++$+++ u8872 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ CARLOTTA +++$+++ Antha...your grandmother...her life ended there, on the stones. Head split open like a melon.
L649586 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ You're a monster.
L649585 +++$+++ u8872 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ CARLOTTA +++$+++ She didn't feel them
L649584 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ You kept her in this filth in restraints...?.
L649573 +++$+++ u8872 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ CARLOTTA +++$+++ Put your hatred for me aside, so you can clearly see what is ahead-
L649572 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Better than most, I suppose.
L649571 +++$+++ u8872 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ CARLOTTA +++$+++ You can see well in the dark, Rowan.
L649570 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ The lamplight.  That's all.
L649569 +++$+++ u8872 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ CARLOTTA +++$+++ What is it...?
L649546 +++$+++ u8872 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ CARLOTTA +++$+++ And this - if you decide to take the rest.

L649544 +++$+++ u8872 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ CARLOTTA +++$+++ Other properties as well - here and in Europe.  And vest holdings - in sugar, oil, gold, electronics.  Liquid funds over eighty million.  tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. All yours now.
L649543 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I don't want the -
L649526 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ There are things I have to know!
L649525 +++$+++ u8872 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ CARLOTTA +++$+++ I'm tired.  I need to rest.
L649524 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I might as well be Rowan Smith - or Jones!   you cut me off from every -

L649522 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ She was alive all these years... You NEVER let me know her. Who gave you that right...?!

L649450 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ What's the matter with you...?! What kind of person are you...?!
L649449 +++$+++ u8872 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ CARLOTTA +++$+++ It was quite warranted by the - situation.    I realize this is a shock, but really, Rowan - you never even knew her. It's not as if you've suffered some great -

L650191 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ Ju1ien was your father   Your great-grandfather - your grandfather - and your father. All one in the same...  That is why he fought carlotta for your life.

L650189 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ They want to come back.    We have a pact - of mutual desire and  consent.  The Mayfairs ar. a beautiful tapestry.  I have weaved you all together - from the start.   I brought Petyr Van Abel to Suzanne.  He had genius in him.  Scientific, precise.  It was a perfect start. And on  it has gone - father to mother... sister to brother... father to daughter...
L650188 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ The portraits, Lasher.  Why are the witches always before a door...? Tell me, Lasher.  Now!
L650187 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ It was an accident.   Gifford, too.
L650186 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Aaron was in the dream.  A dream tilled with spirits.   you killed him, didn't you...?
L650111 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ Tell me what I am, Rowan.
L650110 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ No!
L650105 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ That is what you must discover.   see what I am, my love. With all your power - see me, and know what I am.
L650104 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I don't know what you are!!!
L650103 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ There was no thought.  There was no act.    That is not what I am.
L650102 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ You went into the cells --- and you changed them.  How...?!
L650101 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ I do not understand...

L650076 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ Focus all your powers on me, Rowan until it is done. Only me...
L650075 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ You mustn't hurt him. Mustn't - mustn't hurt..
L650074 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ Then help me--- for his sake...
L650073 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I love Michael...
L650072 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ --- and I have heard you from the beginning... from it's very first beat.

L650069 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ I've waited for you - the one whose science could match her powers...  Do you know what it's like - to sense the majesty of something so sublime just beyond your reach...?  to float in a dream that keeps a .promise half-hidden in its shadows.-.?  I did not choose to be such as this!  Suzanne brought me here.  She called to me!
L650066 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ No, my love.  I want nothing more of the dead.  I want you to --- chang me.
L650065 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ And now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you...?!
L650064 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ I only wanted to see as others do... feel as others do...  ...but Marguerite could not help me.  Nor Julien...
L650063 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I know that you're evil.
L649989 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I LOVE MICHAEL.  MICHAEL!!
L649988 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ Do not tell me that!

L649986 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ But I could understand. I want to understand!
L649985 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ What Michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand.

L649982 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ It's too soon to know.
L649981 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ A girl...?
L649980 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ From the night on the moor, when I was swept into the world and first knew this exquisite pain - it is a Mayfair who has wanted me!  suzann. and Deborah.  Stella - Marguerite - Antha  - Diedre -  All of them.  And you will have a child...
L649979 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ It's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants.
L649978 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ If that were true, I would not be here.
L649977 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Go away!  I don't want you here.
L649976 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ There is no one here but the dead.
L649975 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ I bring her flowers too.
L649974 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ I'm going to have a baby.   Michael wants to name it after you - if it's a girl.  Diedre Mayfair Curry. Pretty, huh...?  Funny --- I never really thought I'd ever ---
L649940 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ I am only what you are --- what all of you have been.   what do you think of yourself now, my love...?
L649939 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ You're very clever, aren't you...?

L649937 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ It you harm Michael, I will let my anger loose.  And you will feel that. Do you understand...?
L649936 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ If I could feel like you feel...but I have only others' feelings - . . like breeres that blow through me.  Things to be felt, yes --- but not nine to feel...
L649935 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ If you knew how I yearn for that...
L649934 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ To love, you must be able to feel.
L649933 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ It is from love.
L649932 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ Made it...?

L649926 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ The wasps were meant for Michael - but there's only so much you can control, isn't there?  The great and powerful lasher - undone by a faulty ladder-..  Why would you hurt him...?!  Answer me.
L649833 +++$+++ u8876 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ LASHER +++$+++ Always loved you..
L649832 +++$+++ u8880 +++$+++ m603 +++$+++ ROWAN +++$+++ STOP!
