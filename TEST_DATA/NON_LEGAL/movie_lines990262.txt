L483085 +++$+++ u7429 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ We all have, he's got nine lives, or he's bulletproof, or some damn thing.
L483084 +++$+++ u7424 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ REIBEN +++$+++ Wade's right, it's some kind of scientific, magnetic thing, I can't explain it, but I've seen it.
L483025 +++$+++ u7429 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Look at Upham, you don't hear him complaining.
L483024 +++$+++ u7424 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ REIBEN +++$+++ You want unpleasant?  Just wait, I can do much better than this.
L483023 +++$+++ u7429 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.
L483022 +++$+++ u7424 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ REIBEN +++$+++ Fine, you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned Private James Ryan can carry my fucking gear.
L483019 +++$+++ u7429 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ As I was saying, before I was so rudely interrupted, my grandfather got old, as grandfathers tend to do. He needed someone to take care of him.  We move around all the time, going from one mine to another, so we had to put him in a home.  Nice enough place but kind of depressing. But not for Granddad.  He just convinced himself he was on a cruise ship, going to Tahiti, he had his own cabin, first class, with room service.  It just so happened that the weather was always lousy, so he never bothered to go up on deck. Happiest guy you ever saw until the day he died.
L483018 +++$+++ u7424 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ REIBEN +++$+++ Oh, Christ, now we gotta listen to that grandfather thing again.
L483015 +++$+++ u7429 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ No, I just happen to take the Captain's advice and look at the bright side of things.
L483014 +++$+++ u7424 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ REIBEN +++$+++ That's because, as I have pointed out on numerous occasions, you are a happy idiot.
L483013 +++$+++ u7429 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ So what?  I've got three satchel charges, six gammon grenades, a dozen- and-a-half pineapples, and all my regular gear.  You don't hear me complaining.
L483097 +++$+++ u7424 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ REIBEN +++$+++ Hey, I got a mother.  Jackson, you got a mother?
L483096 +++$+++ u7426 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ SARGE +++$+++ Jesus, Reiben, think of the poor bastard's mother.
L483042 +++$+++ u7424 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ REIBEN +++$+++ Captain, he's fast!
L483041 +++$+++ u7426 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ SARGE +++$+++ Damn fool.  Sir.
L482897 +++$+++ u7426 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ SARGE +++$+++ What are we likely to run into?
L482896 +++$+++ u7424 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ REIBEN +++$+++ I usually like surprises.
L482787 +++$+++ u7426 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ SARGE +++$+++ Yeah?  So?
L482786 +++$+++ u7424 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ REIBEN +++$+++ Lingerie.
L482785 +++$+++ u7426 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ SARGE +++$+++ Frogs?
L482784 +++$+++ u7424 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ REIBEN +++$+++ I care.  Don't you know what Caen's famous for, Sarge?
L482783 +++$+++ u7426 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ SARGE +++$+++ Who cares?
L482778 +++$+++ u7424 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ REIBEN +++$+++ Out of the frying pan, into the fucking latrine.
L482777 +++$+++ u7426 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ SARGE +++$+++ Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog.
L482776 +++$+++ u7424 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ REIBEN +++$+++ Shit, sir.
L483543 +++$+++ u7424 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ REIBEN +++$+++ What about you, Captain?
L483542 +++$+++ u7428 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ UPHAM +++$+++ I don't know, I kind of like Wade's idea about the cruise ship.  I've never been to Tahiti.
L483250 +++$+++ u7428 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ UPHAM +++$+++ Freaked out.  Trying to keep his eyes on the perimeter.  Can't.
L483249 +++$+++ u7424 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ REIBEN +++$+++ Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
L483248 +++$+++ u7424 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ REIBEN +++$+++ On guard, glancing back.  Pissed off.
L483193 +++$+++ u7424 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ REIBEN +++$+++ He's fast, Captain, I saw him.
L483192 +++$+++ u7428 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ UPHAM +++$+++ Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.
L482998 +++$+++ u7428 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ UPHAM +++$+++ Somebody must know where he's from, what he did for a living.
L482997 +++$+++ u7424 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ REIBEN +++$+++ We know.
L482996 +++$+++ u7428 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ UPHAM +++$+++ But everybody's heard of him, he won the Congressional Medal of Honor, he saved a dozen men.
L482977 +++$+++ u7424 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ REIBEN +++$+++ Get lost.
L482976 +++$+++ u7428 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ UPHAM +++$+++ So, where are you from?
L483196 +++$+++ u7429 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Shit, that's nothing, I ran twenty- two flat.
L483195 +++$+++ u7428 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ UPHAM +++$+++ Twenty-four-five.
L483194 +++$+++ u7429 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ How fast?
L483021 +++$+++ u7429 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Who knows?  It worked.
L483020 +++$+++ u7428 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ UPHAM +++$+++ You think he really believed it?
L483017 +++$+++ u7429 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ It's easy, it runs in my family, take my grandfather, for example...
L483016 +++$+++ u7428 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ UPHAM +++$+++ How do you do it?
L482984 +++$+++ u7429 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ WADE +++$+++ Since I was nine years old.  They got a lot of explosives around mines. Me and my little brother could get into any warehouse you ever saw. Damn, we had fun!
L482983 +++$+++ u7428 +++$+++ m502 +++$+++ UPHAM +++$+++ Demolition, right?
L484348 +++$+++ u7430 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ AGENT +++$+++ We have records.  We have proof.  I'm sorry to be the one to have to tell you this, but it's going to get worse.  Now, if I were you, I would take that fellowship.
L484347 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ No, no he's not.
L484346 +++$+++ u7430 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ AGENT +++$+++ Because he's guilty.
L484345 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ How can you, how can you say that?
L484344 +++$+++ u7430 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ AGENT +++$+++ Don't let your father's business infect your life.
L484343 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this.
L484342 +++$+++ u7430 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ AGENT +++$+++ Well, take a look around the house.  Is everything nice, but not too nice?  Are there lots of, uh, rugs, pieces of art, stereo equipment, uh, furniture, a lot of things bought with cash?  Does he give a lot of gifts?  Do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand-dollar range?
L484341 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ What's the profile?
L484340 +++$+++ u7430 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ AGENT +++$+++ Look, why don't you check it out for yourself?  See if your father fits the profile.
L484339 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Pardon me?
L484338 +++$+++ u7430 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ AGENT +++$+++ We believe that your father operates in a large pool of cash that comes from phoney billings, phoney patients.  We've been investigating him for five years.  We believe that when they die, he takes their money.
L484337 +++$+++ u7437 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ I'm supposed to be leaving on a fellowship that I worked for my entire life.  I don't even care.  I met this boy over the summer, and I, I can't see him because of this, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to my father about... I wore these clothes, I thought, I thought that if I looked right and if I acted right then someone would talk to me.  But I look awful and I feel awful, could you, could you please talk to me?  Be a little decent.
L484183 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Taking care of people isn't a growth enterprise, Mr Sims.  I hope you write that down in your report, I'd like your bosses to read it.
L484182 +++$+++ u7431 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ AGENT SIMS +++$+++ Why would you stay so long with an operation that is so clearly not a growth enterprise?
L484181 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ That's right.
L484180 +++$+++ u7431 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ AGENT SIMS +++$+++ Hmmm.  Your income, Mr Court, hasn't changed substantially in seventeen years.
L484179 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ What family?  We never heard from them.  I sold her house for them, made them money.
L484178 +++$+++ u7431 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ AGENT SIMS +++$+++ The, uh, Cynthia Branson estate was worth how much?  Because her family...
L484054 +++$+++ u7431 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ AGENT SIMS +++$+++ And your former wife.
L484053 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ This evening is over.
L484052 +++$+++ u7431 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ AGENT SIMS +++$+++ Mr Court, be aware that we will be contacting a number of your business associates...
L484051 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Just come down to my place of business, for god's sake.  I have people here.
L484050 +++$+++ u7431 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ AGENT SIMS +++$+++ So you refuse to answer my questions?
L484049 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Speak with my lawyer.
L484048 +++$+++ u7431 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ AGENT SIMS +++$+++ Understanding the following rights...
L484047 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Jesus.  What, I live in a palace, right?  I have guests here.
L484333 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Yeah, I don't want it.  Um, thank you very much.  You're very kind.
L484332 +++$+++ u7432 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ ASSISTANT +++$+++ You're sure?
L484331 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Keep it.
L484330 +++$+++ u7432 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ ASSISTANT +++$+++ Okay, thanks.
L484329 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
L484328 +++$+++ u7432 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ ASSISTANT +++$+++ I'm sorry, but they turned down your card.
L484327 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Listen, I don't know your name, but what are you doing for lunch?
L484326 +++$+++ u7432 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ ASSISTANT +++$+++ Thanks, I like yours too.
L484324 +++$+++ u7432 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ ASSISTANT +++$+++ Excellent.
L484323 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I'll take the whole set.
L484322 +++$+++ u7432 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ ASSISTANT +++$+++ Good for her.
L484321 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Yeah, she won a fellowship.
L484320 +++$+++ u7432 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ ASSISTANT +++$+++ For going to school?
L484319 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No, I'm not married.  It's for my daughter.
L484318 +++$+++ u7432 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ ASSISTANT +++$+++ Is it a gift for your wife?  Are you getting a set together? 
L484317 +++$+++ u7440 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Hi.
L484266 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I'll be home soon.
L484265 +++$+++ u7433 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ CONSTANCE +++$+++ Lloyd, honey, just come home, okay?
L484264 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Hello Constance.  It's me, Lloyd... nothing, I'm just driving around... she broke up with me... what do I do?  Can't she come back?  How can I get her back?... I can't think, talk to me... I fucked up... I feel like crying... she gave me a pen.  I gave her my heart and she gave me a pen.
L483748 +++$+++ u7433 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ CONSTANCE +++$+++ Forget it, forget it, it's mine, it's mine!
L483747 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ No, no, don't go in there.
L483710 +++$+++ u7433 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ CONSTANCE +++$+++ I just washed this shirt, didn't I?
L483709 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I'll be in my office.
L483708 +++$+++ u7433 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ CONSTANCE +++$+++ He's a mess!
L483707 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ You're tough, J-man.
L483688 +++$+++ u7433 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ CONSTANCE +++$+++ I still am.
L483687 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Yeah.
L483686 +++$+++ u7433 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ CONSTANCE +++$+++ I was hilarious once, wasn't I?
L483685 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Look, I'm really sorry that Mom and Dad made you take me in. Really.  If it's such a big deal, I'll go.  But remember this, it used to be fun.  It used to be warped, twisted and hilarious, and I mean that in the best possible way, I mean it as a compliment. I mean, I'm sorry T-I-M left you.  But I am not T-I-M.
L483684 +++$+++ u7433 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ CONSTANCE +++$+++ Gee, it's easy.
L483683 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Jesus Christ.  I get in a good mood.  How hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood, and then be in a good mood?
L483682 +++$+++ u7433 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ CONSTANCE +++$+++ Why can't you be his uncle and not his playmate?
L483677 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Good thing there's not a red line on you, J-man. YEAH!
L483676 +++$+++ u7433 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ CONSTANCE +++$+++ Because it's loud enough so the neighbors don't complain, that's how come I know.
L483675 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ How do you know how to draw the red line anyway?
L483674 +++$+++ u7433 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ CONSTANCE +++$+++ Why do you eat that stuff?  There's no food in your food.  Not too loud, the red line's there for a reason.
L483671 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Hey, bad throat, huh J-man?
L483670 +++$+++ u7433 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ CONSTANCE +++$+++ I hope you understand.
L483669 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ It's no problem.  I called Mom and Dad in Germany; it's like they were there.
L483668 +++$+++ u7433 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ CONSTANCE +++$+++ I'm sorry. Sam had to do a new crown, we had [?], and Jason had a sore throat.  Your big graduation, and no one was there.
L483667 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Hey, sis.
L483666 +++$+++ u7433 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ CONSTANCE +++$+++ Lloyd?
L484309 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ If she wants me, she can come to me.
L484308 +++$+++ u7434 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ COREY +++$+++ The world is full of guys.  Be a man.  Don't be a guy.
L484307 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I am.
L484306 +++$+++ u7434 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ COREY +++$+++ No, you're not a guy.
L484301 +++$+++ u7434 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ COREY +++$+++ Lloyd, you have to understand her family is being ripped apart. Like you and she were ripped apart.  Like Joe and I were ripped apart.
L484300 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I draw the line at seven un-returned phone calls.
L484173 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Read it.
L484172 +++$+++ u7434 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ COREY +++$+++ What does it say?
L484171 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I already did.
L484170 +++$+++ u7434 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ COREY +++$+++ Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter.  Something.
L484169 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Alright.
L484161 +++$+++ u7434 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ COREY +++$+++ You've got to do something special.  You've got to make a statement.
L484160 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ So, what's your point?
L484159 +++$+++ u7434 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ COREY +++$+++ Lloyd, listen to me.  EVERYTHING has changed.  You've had sex. No matter what you might think, nothing will ever be the same between you two.  You might be sixty.  You might be walking down the street, and you'll talk to her about something, whatever. But what you'll really be thinking is 'We had sex'.
L484158 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Alright, alright, alright, calm down, alright, calm down. Nothing's different.
L484154 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I admit nothing.
L484153 +++$+++ u7434 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ COREY +++$+++ Did you sleep with her?
L483925 +++$+++ u7434 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ COREY +++$+++ See you.  Bye.  Bye Diane.
L483924 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ See you tomorrow.
L483923 +++$+++ u7434 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ COREY +++$+++ Yes.
L483922 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Hang in there, man.
L483921 +++$+++ u7434 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ COREY +++$+++ You are such a great person Lloyd.  I'm a good person, but you are a great person.
L483663 +++$+++ u7434 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ COREY +++$+++ Okay, I got it.
L483662 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Wait for me for when I get round to the front. 
L483661 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Please? COREY Alright. Alright, Okay, here.
L483660 +++$+++ u7434 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ COREY +++$+++ That's just so embarrassing.
L483659 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Please?
L483658 +++$+++ u7434 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ COREY +++$+++ C'mon Lloyd.
L483657 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ C'mon, just do it.
L483656 +++$+++ u7434 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ COREY +++$+++ Lloyd.
L483655 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Do me a favor; take a picture of me with her.
L483654 +++$+++ u7434 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ COREY +++$+++ Lloyd, give it up.
L483653 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Look at those eyes.
L483627 +++$+++ u7434 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ COREY +++$+++ Brains stay with brains.  The bomb could go off and their mutant genes would form the same cliques.
L483626 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Sounds great to me, I'm going to call her, that's what's cool about her.
L483623 +++$+++ u7434 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ COREY +++$+++ Diane Court doesn't go out with guys like you.  She's a brain.
L483622 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ I'm gonna call her.
L483621 +++$+++ u7434 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ COREY +++$+++ Then what's love?
L483617 +++$+++ u7434 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ COREY +++$+++ Going out as friends.
L483616 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ What's a scam?
L483615 +++$+++ u7434 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ COREY +++$+++ That's not even a scam.
L483614 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Yes I did- I sat across from her in a mall.  We ate together.  We ate, that's eating, sharing an important physical event.
L483613 +++$+++ u7434 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ COREY +++$+++ But you never had a first date.
L483612 +++$+++ u7442 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ The movies are a good second date, you know, as a date?
L483611 +++$+++ u7434 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ COREY +++$+++ That's unlikely.
L484175 +++$+++ u7436 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DC +++$+++ I dream about it.
L484174 +++$+++ u7434 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ COREY +++$+++ "Dear Diane, I'll always be there for you, all the love in my heart, Lloyd."  I've never gotten a letter like this, have you?
L484168 +++$+++ u7436 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DC +++$+++ I've forgotten what I was going to say... okay, okay, I remember. Let him do what he wants.
L484167 +++$+++ u7434 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ COREY +++$+++ What?  I'm sorry, talk.
L484166 +++$+++ u7436 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DC +++$+++ You know I just sit here listening, and you never let me talk.
L484165 +++$+++ u7434 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ COREY +++$+++ And above all, just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever...
L484164 +++$+++ u7436 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DC +++$+++ Wait a minute.
L484163 +++$+++ u7434 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ COREY +++$+++ You've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like Joe...
L484162 +++$+++ u7436 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DC +++$+++ Wait a minute.
L484157 +++$+++ u7436 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ DC +++$+++ You're an inspiration Lloyd; you should go on the seven hundred club or something.
L484156 +++$+++ u7434 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ COREY +++$+++ Look at his face, he did the deed.

L483984 +++$+++ u7434 +++$+++ m503 +++$+++ COREY +++$+++ Meaning that she made the second date a family audition, which is the kiss of death for Lloyd.
