L611551 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ He knows me?
L611550 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ But he is not unhappy with you because he knows you.
L611548 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ He wants to know if you ever watch the Cookie Monster. He says the Cookie Monster is not to be trusted -- a trickster.
L611547 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What did he say?
L611545 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Good question. Hardly sees anybody anymore. Hasn't left this place in twenty years. Did you bring some tobacco?
L611544 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Why does he wanna see me?
L611543 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Medicine. As in medicine man?
L611542 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Grandpa Samuel Reaches. Heavy duty medicine.
L611541 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Let's go.
L611540 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ He sent me to find ya. He says he's got information.
L611539 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ They're sayin' that nobody's gonna talk to you cuz they don't give away one of their own. But they did say there's somebody way across the Little Walking River who wants to talk to you.
L611538 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Is that right? What are the trees saying today?
L611537 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ You're an easy man to track, Ray. Ya walk like a penguin with a hard-on.
L611478 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Easy. Easy... I'm goin'.
L611477 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Thank God. Now listen to me, asshole. I'm giving you a break. But if my partner finds out you're here, you're gonna be reading rat tracks in Sioux Falls Maximum Security.
L611476 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ To us Indians, our spiritual relatives are as close as family. I've got seven mothers on this reservation. Sisters. Brothers. You ain't one of them.
L611475 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ His spiritual mother...
L611474 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ I'm talkin' his spiritual mother. Maisy Blue Legs.
L611473 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ -- his mother never lived here. She was from up in North Dakota.
L611472 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Go back to the M.E., take a look inside Leo's exit wounds and tell me how chicken feed got in there. Trust me, there ain't chickens in the Badlands. His mother's place is --
L611471 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Maybe you're not aware of this, Crow Horse, but I just flew in from a place called the Twentieth Century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods, psycholingusitics, DNA fingerprinting; I don't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers. Leo was killed right here.
L611470 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ You got no know-how. About Indian Way. Or about Jack Shit for that matter.
L611469 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You've got no jurisdiction.
L611468 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ No, this is the home of the Oglala Sioux and I want the dog-fucker who killed Leo. Whether you get him or I get him, I just want him. Shit's been goin' on too long.
L611467 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Is that right? Well, listen to this: drag your ass. This is a restricted area.
L611466 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ No. Not just a track. You gotta listen to the trees, man. To the leaves. To this sand, you FBI's kicked all up. You gotta listen to the earth.
L611465 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track?
L611464 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ -- Well, maybe two-seventeen.
L611463 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Bullshit.
L611462 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Big sonuvabuck. Based on the depth of that print, pressure releases... I'd say he goes two-ten, two-fifteen --
L611459 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ -- Leo wasn't killed here. He was dumped here. Out of a vehicle. Bald tread. Muffler held on with baling wire.
L611458 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Hey.  Hey, you, listen up --
L611457 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ You're steppin' on sign.
L611456 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What?!
L611455 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ Watch out!
L611454 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What are you --
L611385 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ After we've completed our investigation.
L611384 +++$+++ u3303 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ CROW HORSE +++$+++ I said when can Leo be taken to ceremony?
L611813 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Great.
L611812 +++$+++ u3306 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy.
L611811 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What?
L611810 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ NO.  My father never told anybody he had Indian blood. But he still used a few Indian words around the house. He called me Washee. Said it meant... good boy.
L611809 +++$+++ u3306 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Your relatives must've taught you something.
L611803 +++$+++ u3306 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ You forced an innocent man to run like an animal. You've tried to poison my people's hearts against me with your manipulation, with letters I never wrote... you've been watching me eat, work, raise my family... wash myself in the river. And now you're here, arresting me at a sacred place.  In your eyes, that's power.
L611802 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I desecrated it?
L611801 +++$+++ u3306 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ -- You desecrated it, it had to be burned.
L611800 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You burned an American flag today. And left it for me...
L611623 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Move it, Magdelana.
L611622 +++$+++ u3306 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Grandpa Reaches says you come from heavy Indian blood. I used to think Grandpa was gettin' senile. Now I know he is.
L611621 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ When you see Jimmy, tell him the sooner he turns himself back into a human being and gives himself in... the sooner we back off this reservation. Okay?
L611620 +++$+++ u3306 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Thank you.
L611618 +++$+++ u3306 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ I'm from Minneapolis. Fifth Street. I did four years at Dartmouth before I ever set foot on this res. So I know about the other world, Ray.
L611617 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Look. You and I can stand here in a culture clash til the sun comes up, talking about what's right and what's wrong. You're from the reservation. It's a different world.
L611616 +++$+++ u3306 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Try the Fort Laramie Treaty. All over again.
L611615 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ A Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect. Before somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine.
L611614 +++$+++ u3306 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ You're the FBI. That's your job, isn't it? Ya know how many of our Warrior brothers got killed out here? I never saw any investigating then. Why now? What's going down here?
L611613 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Who did?
L611612 +++$+++ u3306 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ -- Leo was an apple, that's right. Red on the outside, white on the inside. And Jimmy hated him. Kicked his ass a coupla times. But he didn't kill him.
L611611 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ He tried to kill him twice before. That's a good place to start don't ya think? Leo was on the other side, wasn't he?
L611610 +++$+++ u3306 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ Jimmy didn't kill Leo. Why do you wanna do this?
L611609 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Is that like an hereditary thing, Magdelana, or can one take classes?
L611608 +++$+++ u3306 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ You're not gonna catch him. He can shape-shift into different animals. Bear. Elk. Porcupine.
L611607 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ This Jimmy's?
L611604 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ That's right. Turn around.
L611603 +++$+++ u3306 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ MAGGIE +++$+++ You're the Indian FBI.
L611993 +++$+++ u3307 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RADIO +++$+++ Yellow Bird committed suicide at three o'clock this morning. Some gung-ho agent from D.C. pushed him into a corner. You're playing a losing game. Pull over.
L611992 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Yellow bird... is gonna sing.
L611946 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I'm on my way back in. Over.
L611945 +++$+++ u3307 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RADIO +++$+++ What are you doing on the reservation?
L611943 +++$+++ u3307 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RADIO +++$+++ Ray. What's your 20?
L611942 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ X21. Come back.
L611788 +++$+++ u3307 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RADIO +++$+++ They took it down, set fire to it, and threw it on the doorstep of room 13 at the Buffalo Butte Motel. Your room.
L611787 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Good.
L611786 +++$+++ u3307 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RADIO +++$+++ Remember that upside down flag back at Jimmy's house? Somebody took it down.
L611785 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I read, Cooch.
L611784 +++$+++ u3307 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RADIO +++$+++ Ray. X22.
L611783 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Never mind.
L611782 +++$+++ u3307 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RADIO +++$+++ Come back?
L611781 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ No plates. No registration. Serial numbers removed. And all prints washed off by the river. That's great. This is turning out to be a walk in the park, do you know that?
L611600 +++$+++ u3307 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RADIO +++$+++ Okay, Ray. I'm coming in. If he starts to leave the area, move in. And hold him. Over.
L611599 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I have a pick-up truck. No plates. Subject -- Indian -- entering suspect's house. Over.
L611598 +++$+++ u3307 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RADIO +++$+++ Go ahead, Ray.
L611597 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ X22. Read.
L611491 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Black Tail District, X22. You ready for this? Leo wasn't killed in the Badlands. I... I found the location.
L611490 +++$+++ u3307 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RADIO +++$+++ X21, give me a 20.
L611332 +++$+++ u3309 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ TULLY +++$+++ -- your father was part Sioux.
L611331 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Woh, excuse me, Sir... I see what you're saying... I've got a little Indian blood, that's true. But --  I am not an... an Indian. I can't just go in and --
L611330 +++$+++ u3309 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ TULLY +++$+++ With an Indian representative out there, we hope to keep hostilities dormant; this is a COINTELPRO, Selective Operations Unit, and it'll be easier on Agent Couture if you can gain the people's trust and maybe --
L611325 +++$+++ u3309 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ TULLY +++$+++ -- yes, Teton Sioux. Father's side.
L611324 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I'm not that sure. Yeah, I think --
L611311 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ No. No, no. Thank you.
L611310 +++$+++ u3309 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ TULLY +++$+++ Do you want a coffee?
L611309 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Mister Tully.
L611308 +++$+++ u3309 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ TULLY +++$+++ Ray...
L611890 +++$+++ u3310 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ YELLOW BIRD +++$+++ All I know... is I did what I did... and I ain't in solitary, gettin' pumped up with downer, gettin' beat to shit. But I tell you what, Suit. Take me back. Cuz I can't take this shit no more.
L611889 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Keep talking, Yellow Bird...
L611886 +++$+++ u3310 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ YELLOW BIRD +++$+++ Red Deer Table! What's with you, man?
L611885 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What's Tashka Sha, speak English, speak English!
L611884 +++$+++ u3310 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ YELLOW BIRD +++$+++ I took him out before he got the chance. He didn't say nothin' about Tashka Sha. And now his spirit is in the dirt. Forever.
L611883 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Leo knew something heavy and was trying to tell Jimmy. But you must not know how serious it was or you would have delivered. Do you realize what Leo could have told Jimmy?! Do you?!
L611882 +++$+++ u3310 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ YELLOW BIRD +++$+++ What do you know about spirits? You ain't no In'dn.
L611881 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You turned Leo over on his face. But the coyotes must've turned him back over, man, cuz his spirit is out. It's out, and it knows.
L611880 +++$+++ u3310 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ YELLOW BIRD +++$+++ Miles. Three other suits. That's all I know 'em as -- suits. Were you there?
L611879 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ The men who came to see you at Leavenworth. The one's who made the arrangement... who were they? Maybe I can talk to them.
L611878 +++$+++ u3310 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ YELLOW BIRD +++$+++ I blew his back out with a buffalo gun, that's how I know! Now you're gonna say I didn't, so you can throw me back in solitary?
L611877 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ How the hell do you know?
L611876 +++$+++ u3310 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ YELLOW BIRD +++$+++ No way. No fuckin' way.
L611875 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Leo Fast Elk... is alive.
L611874 +++$+++ u3310 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ YELLOW BIRD +++$+++ What the fuck, man? What do you people want? I did what you wasi'cu's told me to do.
L611873 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ They sent me here, Richard because they said you didn't hold up your end of the arrangement, and I have to transport you back to Leavenworth.
L611872 +++$+++ u3310 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ YELLOW BIRD +++$+++ They said I'd never see FBI again, and I'm livin' with you fuckers. I don't feed ya information on the Warriors, it's back to the pen. I don't do this, back to the pen. Your word against my word. Against a con Indian's word. I really got a chance, man, right?
L611871 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Get up!
L611870 +++$+++ u3310 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ YELLOW BIRD +++$+++ I get thrown in solitary until I don't know my own fuckin' name, and then you people tell me I can beat nine years if I help you. I helped you!
L611869 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Get up out of the chair, and walk toward the backdoor, Richard.
L611868 +++$+++ u3310 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ YELLOW BIRD +++$+++ What's with you people? Why do ya have to fuck with my head all the time? I came through, man.
L611867 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Get up out of the chair, Richard.
L611866 +++$+++ u3310 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ YELLOW BIRD +++$+++ What the fuck you talkin' about?
L611865 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Not for long, Richard. You got early parole under the stipulation that you would help us in a situation, and you didn't deliver.
L611862 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Yes, Washington sent me, Richard. They sent me here because this whole thing has been fucked. Do you know what I mean when I say this whole thing has been fucked, Richard?
L611861 +++$+++ u3310 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ YELLOW BIRD +++$+++ Washington sent ya. I know that.
L611860 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ No. Can't say that I have, Richard. Richard do you know why I'm here?
L611859 +++$+++ u3310 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ YELLOW BIRD +++$+++ You ever try solitary confinement?
L611858 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Leavenworth a tough joint?
L611857 +++$+++ u3310 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ YELLOW BIRD +++$+++ No, that was Leavenworth. This --  was Sioux Falls. What ya want?
L611856 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ At Sioux Falls Pen?
L611855 +++$+++ u3310 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ YELLOW BIRD +++$+++ Since I got a iron pipe put across my knees, man. Fight with three wasi'cus, ya know.
L611854 +++$+++ u3308 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair. How long you been in it?
L611853 +++$+++ u3310 +++$+++ m219 +++$+++ YELLOW BIRD +++$+++ What ya want?
L619579 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ Right on the flight line?
L619578 +++$+++ u3311 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I live here, remember?
L619577 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ Oh...I'll think of something... What are you doing here?
L619576 +++$+++ u3311 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You got your F-14, you got Top Gun, you got your MiGs....You're our new Top Gun instructor...Now what?
L619575 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ Well what?
L619574 +++$+++ u3311 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Well?
L619365 +++$+++ u3311 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I think I have... I could be wrong. I have been before. Just remember one thing. If you're not Top Gun, if you're not fighting jets, you're not gonna be able to act like a fighter pilot... You're gonna have to act like the rest of us. You're gonna have to master humility. For you guys, that's the toughest maneuver of all.
L619364 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ I hope you find him.
L619363 +++$+++ u3311 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Hey, I never said I was a fighter pilot...I never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm. I can find contentment in a good book. I don't have to roar by someone at Mach two with my hair on fire. Sometimes...I just get happy being with the right man.
L619362 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ Big talk for someone who's never been shot off her computer.
L619361 +++$+++ u3311 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ And I'm gonna sneak off, and be by myself for awhile, like until I can think of a new career...hotel management or something...
L619360 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ ...Something like that.
L619359 +++$+++ u3311 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I've got a gift just like you do. My gift is I just know what people mean, even if they can't say it. It helps when you're trying to communicate with fighter pilots. Like what you just said was "I'm embarrassed, I feel I've done something wrong, that I've failed, and I don't think I can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting, intelligent woman like yourself." That about it?
L619358 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ How could you?
L619357 +++$+++ u3311 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I know exactly what you mean.
L619356 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ I didn't want to see you. I mean, I did...but I didn't..
L619355 +++$+++ u3311 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Long distance? I wouldn't do that to you. I'd at least talk to you.
L619354 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ I was, later.
L619353 +++$+++ u3311 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You weren't gonna say goodbye?
L619328 +++$+++ u3311 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ We'll say it together. On the count of three...One...two...
L619327 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ Who's gonna win?
L619326 +++$+++ u3311 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Looks like a tie.
L619324 +++$+++ u3311 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Your watch.
L619323 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ One more.
L619322 +++$+++ u3311 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ And that's one!
L619321 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ That's three.
L619320 +++$+++ u3311 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You didn't mean it. You didn't think. You'd do anything to take it back.
L619319 +++$+++ u3311 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ That wasn't fair. It was a question. Penalty round!
L619318 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ What does it mean?
L619311 +++$+++ u3311 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ That's up to you.
L619310 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ Off me or off you?
L619309 +++$+++ u3311 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Take something off.
L619308 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ Now?
L619307 +++$+++ u3311 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ True.
L619306 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ Goose is dead.
L619305 +++$+++ u3311 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ The big one. The one that's most on your mind.
L619304 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ What truth?
L619303 +++$+++ u3311 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You say the truth.  Go ahead. Don't be afraid. You want to win the game, don'tcha?
L619302 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ How does it go?
L619301 +++$+++ u3311 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Want to play the game?
L619300 +++$+++ u3311 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Not as silly as some. You know the silliest one? ...that we are gods. That we control events on the beach... that we can turn back time...
L619299 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ You're crazy.  That's a pretty silly game.
L619298 +++$+++ u3311 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ It's like strip poker, only, without the bluffing.  One person says something and if the other one accepts that it's true, the one who says it, gets to take one item of clothing off.
L619297 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ Strip reality! How do you play that?
L619296 +++$+++ u3311 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ It's strip reality, actually, like what the pilots always want to play.
L619295 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ How do you play reality.
L619294 +++$+++ u3311 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I like to play "reality".
L619293 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ What kind of games?
L619292 +++$+++ u3311 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I sit. I think. I play games.
L619291 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ What do you do when you come here?
L619289 +++$+++ u3311 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Everything passes. Immutable law of the Universe.
L619288 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ It does.
L619287 +++$+++ u3311 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Only when you're depressed. Then it passes.
L619286 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ Hardly ever.
L619285 +++$+++ u3311 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You don't believe that.
L619282 +++$+++ u3311 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Of course the line's just imaginary. You can cross it twenty times...nothing really changes.
L619281 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ That's what I want.
L619280 +++$+++ u3311 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You look way out there. Out past the date line. West becomes East, all things change. You cross the line...today becomes yesterday...or tomorrow, I forget which.
L619279 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ Yesterday.
L619278 +++$+++ u3311 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What?
L619277 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ I want it back.
L619276 +++$+++ u3311 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What do you want?
L619275 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ No.
L619274 +++$+++ u3311 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I don't think so, but if that's what you want...
L619273 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ I'm not good company. I should be alone.
L619272 +++$+++ u3311 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Do what, show you a good time?
L619271 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ You don't have to do this.
L619270 +++$+++ u3311 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Where are we? You know where we are. It's called the beach. It's where life first crawled up out of the sea. I come here sometimes... when I feel like crawling back in.
L619269 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ Where are we?
L619268 +++$+++ u3311 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You knew it. You all do. It's part of it. Maybe the most important part.
L619267 +++$+++ u3321 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ MAVERICK +++$+++ Not to me.
L619266 +++$+++ u3311 +++$+++ m220 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Why? You act like you didn't know one day this would happen.
