L148203 +++$+++ u727 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ GILES +++$+++ Did she?  You were pretty thick at one time.
L148202 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ She went back to South Africa.
L148201 +++$+++ u727 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ GILES +++$+++ What a memory you've got. Maths always was your strong suit. What happened to the moaning Lisa?
L148200 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Three years, two months. March '93.
L148923 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ How can anyone be that naive?
L148922 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I want to buy a car.
L148921 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ What?
L148920 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I hate public transport.
L148919 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Why did you take the money?
L148916 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ You're already alone.
L148915 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Leave me alone, Marion.
L148914 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Here...use a spoon.
L148913 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Give up being a croupier, Jack. Or I'll shop you. All you have to do is keep your word. It's that simple.
L148912 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Then what?
L148911 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Nothing about you.
L148910 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Marion!  What did you tell the police?
L148909 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.
L148908 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ There was a message, wasn't there?
L148907 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.
L148903 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ I thought you wouldn't want to spend Christmas Day alone in here.
L148902 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ How did you know I was here?
L148890 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Gambling's about not facing reality. Ignoring the odds.
L148889 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Really?
L148888 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Gambling's not about money.
L148887 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...
L148886 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Never. Why do you ask?
L148885 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?
L148844 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Not talking. Writing.
L148843 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ You were talking in your sleep.
L148842 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What?
L148840 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Within a month. Believe me, I'm going to quit!
L148839 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ You will?
L148838 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'll leave the casino soon.  I promise.
L148837 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ It's none of my business what you write. And your job, that's none of my business either. I love you. And I've done everything wrong.
L148836 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You're entitled to your opinion.
L148835 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ -- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I?
L148834 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ That girl, she works at the casino --
L148833 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ It will.
L148832 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ I hope it brings you luck.
L148831 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ It's beautiful. Thank you.
L148665 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ No. Answer it!
L148664 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Leave it.
L148663 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ The door, Jack.
L148661 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Crap. It's not relative. It's unfair. Like your casino. It's designed unfair. And your croupier's a little shit because he goes along with it.
L148660 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative.
L148659 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Without hope there's no point to anything.
L148658 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ It's the truth.
L148657 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack.  There's no hope in it.
L148656 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Marion. It's a book.
L148655 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ I don't give a fuck about the sex. Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's just a miserable zombie. Is that the way you feel now? Is that what's happened to you?
L148654 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ -- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it.
L148653 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and --
L148652 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ He was a loser. This guy's a croupier. He can't lose. People have shat on him all his life. Now he's in control. He's a winner.
L148651 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic.
L148650 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Why not?
L148649 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ I don't like it.
L148529 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Well, that's our life now, isn't it?
L148528 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'm on at nine.
L148527 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ I don't finish till eight. Make it nine and you're on.
L148526 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What about a drink on the way home?
L148525 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ What are you doing here?  You know the rules.
L148524 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Haven't you got a conscience of your own?
L148523 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You're my conscience.
L148522 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ What do I mean to you? I want to know. Tell me.
L148521 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Marion, stop this.
L148520 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Well, that's my poor upbringing. I didn't go to no private school. I haven't got no class. I want to live with a writer. Not a fucking croupier. I don't even know what the word means. Croupier.
L148519 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Do you have to swear all the time?
L148518 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ This fucking job's getting to you. You haven't written a fucking word since you started.
L148517 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Probably.
L148516 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Are you drunk?
L148515 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I take it back. You're not a cop any more. You're a store detective.
L148514 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Take that back!  Fucking take that back. I'm not a cop any more.
L148513 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Don't play the cop with me, Marion.
L148512 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Where've you been? I've got to give evidence in court at nine.
L148451 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'll see you in my dreams.
L148450 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ When you get home, I'm asleep. When I leave home, you're asleep.
L148449 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ It's only hair. I haven't changed.
L148448 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ I loved it blond.
L148447 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Poor baby.  This'll relax you.
L148446 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Tension. It'll go.
L148445 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ You're shaking. What is it?
L148444 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Fine.
L148443 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ How did it go?
L148442 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I don't know.
L148441 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ What's the time?
L148381 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ You've got such beautiful hands.
L148380 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Are you trying to read my palm?
L148378 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ I love you Jack, you know that.
L148377 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious.
L148376 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ You sold the car. You got a job. What's the third thing? Tell me.
L148373 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I start Monday week.
L148372 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ You were a croupier there? You never told me that. I thought you just knew some gamblers.
L148371 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I had training. In the Republic.
L148370 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ 450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?
L148369 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ It came my way. 450 a week.
L148368 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ How did you land that?
L148367 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ In a casino. As a croupier. A dealer.
L148366 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ What job?
L148365 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I've got a job.
L148364 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ I want to hear it.
L148363 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I've got something to tell you.
L148362 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ You're my prisoner.
L148358 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Of course they will. You just have to be patient. I'm betting on you.
L148357 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Come on, Marion. Let's face the truth. Nobody's going to publish it.
L148356 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Take it back. Till you sell your book.
L148355 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I owe you for the rent. It's only a car. I can get another.
L148354 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ You shouldn't have done that. I know what it meant to you.
L148353 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I. sold the car.
L148352 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ Where did you get it?
L148350 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Turn around.
L148349 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ It's not just inner beauty, is it?
L148348 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You really are a beautiful woman.
L148347 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ I won't be that long.
L148346 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You want me drunk?
L148345 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ No, no. I'm not ready for you. There's some vodka in the freezer.
L148344 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You mean I won't resist them.
L148343 +++$+++ u733 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ I couldn't resist them.
L148237 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I won't.  Goodbye, dad.
L148236 +++$+++ u729 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK SR. +++$+++ Don't let yourself down.
L148235 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yes, I know that.
L148234 +++$+++ u729 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK SR. +++$+++ Great. I've just started a new company. Solid financing. It's good.  I love you Jacko, you know that
L148233 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ So how are you doing, dad?
L148232 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ All right, dad. Yes, I'll call him.
L148231 +++$+++ u729 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK SR. +++$+++ For Christ's sake, Jacko, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Have you written that name down? Reynolds, at the Golden Lion. 
L148227 +++$+++ u729 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK SR. +++$+++ I've set this up for you. Call the Golden Lion and ask for Mr Reynolds, he's the Manager. I don't know him personally, but I've spoken to his boss. Don't say no, Jacko. Give yourself a break.
L148226 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ It's not that.
L148225 +++$+++ u729 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK SR. +++$+++ Don't be stubborn. The pay won't be grand, but it's regular. That's what you need, isn't it? I know you don't like taking my advice...
L148223 +++$+++ u729 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK SR. +++$+++ Well I've got something for you. In London, I mean. I've been chatting to some friends. Do you know the Golden Lion casino? It's in Bayswater, I believe... They're looking for a dealer, a croupier.
L148222 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No.
L148221 +++$+++ u729 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK SR. +++$+++ Found a job?
L148220 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Great.
L148991 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ Yes. I'm all over that now. Jack, hold on a minute. There's someone here who wants to talk to you...
L148990 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Did you solve your problems?
L148989 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
L148988 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ How are you?
L148987 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months.
L148986 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Jani! Where are you?
L148985 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ Jack! It's Jani.
L148984 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Hello...
L148867 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ It's a shame there aren't more men in the world like you.
L148866 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I don't think we should meet again.
L148865 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No thank you.
L148864 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ Would you like a drink?
L148863 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ I took the bandage off yesterday.
L148862 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ And your hand too.
L148861 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I've still got mine.
L148860 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ Bruise?  Oh, yes. It's better.
L148859 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ That bruise has cleared up nicely.
L148858 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats.
L148857 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yes.
L148856 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ Do you?
L148855 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ It's all relative.  I need the money too.
L148854 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ Well, life's not fair. We know that.
L148853 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ It doesn't seem fair. You're offering me ten grand in cash but you can't afford a decent place.
L148852 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ Thank you.
L148851 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yes.
L148850 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ Is it yes?
L148820 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ I have to take the car.
L148819 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What for?
L148818 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L148817 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ I told you, all bets are off.
L148816 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Did they tell you to sleep with me?
L148815 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ Let it go.
L148814 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ How much do you owe?
L148811 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ No, forget it. The bet's off.
L148810 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Wait a minute...
L148809 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ I want you to forget what I said.
L148806 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ I'm asking you, as a...friend. You'd be saving the life of a friend.
L148805 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I can't do it, Jani.
L148804 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ I want to go back to Cape Town, I want to start again, clean.
L148803 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What about my neck?
L148802 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ Next time it'll be my neck.
L148800 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Reynolds? You've done your research.
L148799 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ These people will pay you ten thousand before and ten thousand after. They want someone they can be sure of, an honest dealer. That's the point. Not all dealers are honest. Mr Reynolds will never suspect you.
L148798 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What ten thousand pounds?
L148797 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ You keep the ten thousand pounds.
L148796 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ But if it does.
L148795 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ It won't.
L148794 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What'll you do when it all goes wrong?
L148793 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
L148792 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ And I thought you were only after my body.
L148791 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ You won't be committing a crime. The man will cheat, you'll just be doing your job, that's all.
L148790 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You're serious.
L148789 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ You don't have to be criminal. A man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat. You'll see him, stop him, and the guy will make a big scene. There'll be chaos. And that's when it'll happen.
L148788 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Robbery's not criminal?
L148787 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.
L148786 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ And I thought you were a bright woman.
L148785 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ The point is, they want a man inside.
L148784 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.
L148783 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ My creditors. One night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino -
L148782 +++$+++ u728 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Who's they?
L148781 +++$+++ u730 +++$+++ m46 +++$+++ JANI +++$+++ They mean it.
