L133081 +++$+++ u4498 +++$+++ m297 +++$+++ SALVATORE +++$+++ I don't care. I'll wait.
L133071 +++$+++ u4498 +++$+++ m297 +++$+++ SALVATORE +++$+++ Sssssh, Be quiet, pretend everything's normal. I'm Salvatore.
L133070 +++$+++ u4495 +++$+++ m297 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ But...who...
L133069 +++$+++ u4498 +++$+++ m297 +++$+++ SALVATORE +++$+++ We'll talk about that later.
L133068 +++$+++ u4495 +++$+++ m297 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Father, I have sinned...
L133043 +++$+++ u4498 +++$+++ m297 +++$+++ SALVATORE +++$+++ Bye-bye, Elena.  ...What an idiot! What an idiot! 'Nice day'! Christ!!
L133042 +++$+++ u4495 +++$+++ m297 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Yes, nice day.  ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.
L133041 +++$+++ u4498 +++$+++ m297 +++$+++ SALVATORE +++$+++ No particular reason...  Nice day, huh? 
L133040 +++$+++ u4495 +++$+++ m297 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Hi. Why are you running?
L133039 +++$+++ u4498 +++$+++ m297 +++$+++ SALVATORE +++$+++ Hi, Elena!
L133021 +++$+++ u4495 +++$+++ m297 +++$+++ ELENA +++$+++ Elena. My name's Elena.
L133020 +++$+++ u4498 +++$+++ m297 +++$+++ SALVATORE +++$+++ My name's Salvatore...And yours?
L133187 +++$+++ u4498 +++$+++ m297 +++$+++ SALVATORE +++$+++ You never used to do that!
L133186 +++$+++ u4496 +++$+++ m297 +++$+++ MARIA +++$+++ And I never asked for one! You have nothing to explain. I always thought that what you did was right, and that was that. With no beating around the bush...  Only one thing made me suffer: bolting the door shut before going to bed at night...
L133185 +++$+++ u4498 +++$+++ m297 +++$+++ SALVATORE +++$+++ No...It's nothing to do with you. It's just that I was scared of coming back. Now, after all these years, I thought I was strong, that I had forgotten lots of things. Instead, I find it's quite the opposite, as if I had never left. And yet, I look at Lia and feel as if I didn't know her, and you, Mamma...I abandoned you, ran away like a thief, thought only of myself, and never gave you an explanation...
L133166 +++$+++ u4496 +++$+++ m297 +++$+++ MARIA +++$+++ You shouldn't tell me that now. After all these years!  I put all your things in here. Go in, go in...
L133165 +++$+++ u4498 +++$+++ m297 +++$+++ SALVATORE +++$+++ No, Mamma, it only takes an hour by air, you know.
L133164 +++$+++ u4496 +++$+++ m297 +++$+++ MARIA +++$+++ See how pretty the house is? We did everything over.  If it hadn't been for you!  Come, I have a surprise....  You must be tired. If you want to rest, there's time before the funeral.
L133163 +++$+++ u4498 +++$+++ m297 +++$+++ SALVATORE +++$+++ They're always writing to me saying they want to come to Rome!
L133162 +++$+++ u4496 +++$+++ m297 +++$+++ MARIA +++$+++ Lia'll be so glad to see you, you'll see. And you won't recognize the kids any more, they're grown up by now.
L132890 +++$+++ u4496 +++$+++ m297 +++$+++ MARIA +++$+++ It's not true! No! It's not true!!! I'll show you he's coming back!
L132889 +++$+++ u4498 +++$+++ m297 +++$+++ SALVATORE +++$+++ Daddy's not coming back...He's dead. 
L132865 +++$+++ u4498 +++$+++ m297 +++$+++ SALVATORE +++$+++ Somebody stole it.
L132864 +++$+++ u4496 +++$+++ m297 +++$+++ MARIA +++$+++ Then where's the money?
L132863 +++$+++ u4498 +++$+++ m297 +++$+++ SALVATORE +++$+++ No...
L132862 +++$+++ u4496 +++$+++ m297 +++$+++ MARIA +++$+++ I've been looking for you all day. Did you buy the milk?
L132838 +++$+++ u4496 +++$+++ m297 +++$+++ MARIA +++$+++ It takes years to get there. And years to come back...Now go to bed, Toto, it's late.
L132837 +++$+++ u4498 +++$+++ m297 +++$+++ SALVATORE +++$+++ I don't remember him any more—Ma, where's Russia?
L133171 +++$+++ u4499 +++$+++ m297 +++$+++ SPACCAFICO +++$+++ Well, it's hard to call an important person by his first name. But if it really matters to you, I'11 call you...  Toto!...
L133170 +++$+++ u4498 +++$+++ m297 +++$+++ SALVATORE +++$+++ But why do you call me 'Mr. Di Vita'? It didn't used to be that way...
L133169 +++$+++ u4499 +++$+++ m297 +++$+++ SPACCAFICO +++$+++ Six years ago this May. No one came any more. You "know better than me, Mr. Di Vita, the crisis, television, videos. By now the movie business is only a dream. The city's bought it now to make a new parking lot. Next Saturday they're tearing it down...A pity!...
L133168 +++$+++ u4498 +++$+++ m297 +++$+++ SALVATORE +++$+++ How long's it been shut?
L133126 +++$+++ u4498 +++$+++ m297 +++$+++ SALVATORE +++$+++ OK...
L133125 +++$+++ u4499 +++$+++ m297 +++$+++ SPACCAFICO +++$+++ Toto, this is no film for the common herd. One day'll be more than enough...So tonight, please set up tomorrow's film, so the projectionist who is coming will find it ready.
L132987 +++$+++ u4499 +++$+++ m297 +++$+++ SPACCAFICO +++$+++ What the fuck you talking about? You getting into the act too, Toto? Titanus has trouble giving me even one copy and I have to say thanks! If I ask for two, the least they'll do is cut off my head and play ball with it!
L132986 +++$+++ u4498 +++$+++ m297 +++$+++ SALVATORE +++$+++ The projector's all rusty, but I could fix it in two or three days. Give the place a good cleaning, put in some seats and bring in a projectionist and we'll show Catene in two houses.
L132985 +++$+++ u4499 +++$+++ m297 +++$+++ SPACCAFICO +++$+++ So what's that got to do with it?
L132984 +++$+++ u4498 +++$+++ m297 +++$+++ SALVATORE +++$+++ Don Ciccio, I've got an idea...You remember that old abandoned movie house where they're supposed to build those low-rent houses?
L133880 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Well, the way I look at it -  -  You want to know what I really think would be wonderful?
L133879 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Please, Mr. Bernstein.
L133878 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ I do.  I do.  I mean, since you're running for Governor - and you want to be elected -  I think it's wonderful you're going to be elected.  Only -  -  Can I say something?
L133877 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ You don't really think so?
L133876 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ It's wonderful, Mr. Kane.  Wonderful. Wonderful.
L133650 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Huh?  Oh, I forgot - you've been away so long I forgot about your joking -
L133649 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ We certainly do.  Vacation's over - starting right after dinner.  But right now - that lady over there -  - that's the new society editor, I take it?  You think I could interrupt her a moment, Mr. Bernstein?
L133648 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ So then, tonight, we go over everything thoroughly, eh?  Especially the new papers -
L133647 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Sit down, everybody - for heaven's sake!
L133646 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein.
L133638 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ I promise not to bring any more Venuses and not to worry - and not to try to get in touch with any of the papers -
L133637 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ But please, Mr. Kane, don't buy any more paintings.  Nine Venuses already we got, twenty-six Virgins - two whole warehouses full of stuff -
L133627 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Two hundred and one thousand, six hundred and forty-seven.
L133626 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Gentlemen of the "Enquirer"!  This has, I think, been a fitting welcome to those distinguished journalists -  Mr. Reilly in particular - who are the latest additions to our ranks. It will make them happy to learn that the "Enquirer's" circulation this morning passed the two hundred thousand mark.
L133623 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ I know.
L133622 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ You know how long it took the "Chronicle" to get that staff together?  Twenty years.
L133621 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ You're right, Mr. Bernstein.
L133620 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Say, with them fellows -  - it's no trick to get circulation.
L133617 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Look at that.
L133616 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ From the Chronicle Building that sign is the biggest thing you can see - every floor guaranteed - let's hope it bothers them - it cost us enough.
L133615 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Let's hope they like it there.
L133607 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ These'll be kept.  I'll provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly.  I will also provide them -
L133606 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ You don't wanta make any promises, Mr. Kane, you don't wanta keep.
L133605 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ I'll write it myself.
L133604 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -
L133603 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ My Declaration of Principles -  Don't smile, Brad -  Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein -
L133578 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Oh!
L133577 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ It's a saying, Mr. Bernstein.  A new broom sweeps clean.
L133574 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Mr. Leland, if Mr. Kane, he should decide to drop the price to one cent, or maybe even he should make up his mind to give the paper away with a half-pound of tea - you'll just hold him until I get back, won't you?
L133573 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Ready for dinner, Brad?
L133572 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ All right, but I'll keep these figures, too, just in case.
L133571 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
L133570 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ This is all figured at three cents a copy.
L133569 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Two cents.
L133568 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Three cents.
L133563 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ I ordered six already this morning! Got a discount!
L133562 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ I've just made a shocking discovery. The "Enquirer" is without a telephone. Have two installed at once!
L133527 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Get me a typewriter.  I'll finish the notice.
L133526 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ I can't take shorthand.
L133525 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm dictating it.
L133524 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ I didn't see that.
L133523 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that it represents a new low...  Have you got that, Mr. Bernstein? In the opinion of this reviewer -
L133522 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ That's all there is.
L133521 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Go on!
L133520 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ "Her singing, happily, is no concern of this department.  Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to..." 
L133519 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Thais.
L133518 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ "Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty but hopelessly incompetent amateur -  - last night opened the new Chicago Opera House in a performance of - of -"  I can't pronounce that name, Mr. Kane.
L133516 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ What does it say there?
L133515 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Hey, Brad!  Brad!  He ain't been drinking before, Mr. Kane. Never.  We would have heard.
L133513 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ That's all right, Mr. Bernstein.
L133512 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Mr. Kane -
L133510 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Where is he?
L133509 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ He sure did, Mr. Kane.
L133432 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ I rather like it myself.  Send it right away.
L133431 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ That's fine, Mr. Kane.
L133426 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ The food is marvelous in Cuba the senoritas are beautiful stop I could send you prose poems of palm trees and sunrises and tropical colors blending in far off landscapes but don't feel right in spending your money for this stop there's no war in Cuba regards Wheeler.
L133425 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ That's all right.  We have no secrets from our readers.  Mr. Thatcher is one of our most devoted readers, Mr. Bernstein.  He knows what's wrong with every issue since I've taken charge. What's the cable?
L133422 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ How are you, Mr. Thatcher?
L133421 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Thatcher -
L133490 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Well, well - isn't that nice?
L133489 +++$+++ u4502 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ CITY EDITOR +++$+++ Yes, very!  Naturally.
L133488 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Enthusiastic?
L133487 +++$+++ u4502 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ CITY EDITOR +++$+++ Oh, yes, it's already made up.  Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.
L133486 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ And the social.  How about the music notice?  You got that in?
L133485 +++$+++ u4502 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ CITY EDITOR +++$+++ Yes.  I thought it was a good idea. We've covered it from the news end, of course.
L133482 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ That's a long story.
L133481 +++$+++ u4502 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ CITY EDITOR +++$+++ He's a great guy - Leland.  Why'd he ever leave New York?
L133480 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ That's right.  They called us the "Three Musketeers."
L133479 +++$+++ u4502 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ CITY EDITOR +++$+++ You and Leland and Mr. Kane - you were great friends back in the old days, I understand.
L133478 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ I might make him nervous.
L133477 +++$+++ u4502 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ CITY EDITOR +++$+++ Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein? You know Mr. Leland.
L133476 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Go in and ask him to hurry.
L133670 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Just old age.  It's the only disease, Mr. Thompson, you don't look forward to being cured of.  You ought to see Mr. Leland.  There's a whole lot of things he could tell you - if he wanted to.
L133669 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me.  Just - 
L133668 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ You don't say!  Why I had no idea -
L133667 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ In case you'd like to know, Mr. Bernstein, he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital on 180th Street.
L133666 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Maybe that was something he lost. Mr. Kane was a man that lost - almost everything he had -  You ought to talk to Bradford Leland. He could tell you a lot.  I wish I could tell you where Leland is, but I don't know myself.  He may be out of town somewhere - he may be dead.
L133665 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ Yes -
L133664 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ It ended -  Then there was Susie - that ended, too.  I guess he didn't make her very happy -  You know, I was thinking - that Rosebud you're trying to find out about -
L133663 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ It didn't end very well, did it?
L133662 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ The way things turned out, I don't need to tell you - Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud!
L133532 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Oh, yes.  He saw to that.  I tell you, Mr. Thompson, he was a hard man to figure out.  He had that funny sense of humor.  And then, too, maybe he thought by finishing that piece he could show Leland he was an honest man. You see, Leland didn't think so.  I guess he showed him all right.  He's a nice fellow, but he's a dreamer.  They were always together in those early days when we just started the Enquirer.
L133531 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ Well, then, how could he write that roast?  The notices in the Kane papers were always very kind to her.
L133530 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ He thought she was great, Mr. Thompson. He really believed that.  He put all his ambition on that girl.  After she came along, he never really cared for himself like he used to.  Oh, I don't blame Susie -
L133529 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ I guess Mr. Kane didn't think so well of Susie's art anyway.
L133528 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ He finished it.  He wrote the worst notice I ever read about the girl he loved.  We ran it in every paper.
L133471 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ It's not trick to make an awful lot of money if all you want is to make a lot of money.  Thatcher!
L133470 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ He made an awful lot of money.
L133469 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Thatcher!  That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
L133468 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ Nobody else, but I've been through that stuff of Walter Thatcher's. That journal of his -
L133467 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Who else did you see?
L133466 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ I'm going back there.
L133465 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Sure, sure.
L133464 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ You know why?  She was so -
L133463 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Susie?  I called her myself the day after he died.  I thought maybe somebody ought to...  She couldn't even come to the 'phone.
L133462 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ Well, I went down to Atlantic City -
L133461 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Who else you been to see?
L133460 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ I'm calling on people who knew Mr. Kane. I'm calling on you.
L133459 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ You're pretty young, Mr. -  Mr. Thompson.  A fellow will remember things you wouldn't think he'd remember. You take me.  One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on a ferry and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in -  - and on it, there was a girl waiting to get off.  A white dress she had on - and she was carrying a white pastrol - and I only saw her for one second and she didn't see me at all - but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl.  See what I mean?  Well, so what are you doing about this "Rosebud," Mr. Thompson.
L133458 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ Not some girl he knew casually and then remembered after fifty years, on his death bed -
L133457 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ That Rosebud?  Maybe some girl?  There were a lot of them back in the early days, and -
L133456 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ -  We thought maybe, if we can find out what he meant by that last word - as he was dying -
L133455 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ From before the beginning, young fellow. And now it's after the end.  Anything you want to know about him - about the paper -
L133454 +++$+++ u4520 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ Well, Mr. Bernstein, you were with Mr. Kane from the very beginning -
L133453 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Who's a busy man?  Me?  I'm Chairman of the Board.  I got nothing but time ...  What do you want to know?
L133993 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Mr. Kane is finishing your piece the way you started it.
L133992 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ I suppose he's fixing it up - I know I'd never get that through.
L133991 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Kane?  Charlie?  Where is he?
L133990 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Mr. Kane is finishing it.
L133989 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Where is it - where's my notice? I've got to finish it!
L133988 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Hello, Bernstein.
L133987 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Hello, Mr. Leland.
L133795 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Yes, Mr. Bernstein.
L133794 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Not to me.  But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you?
L133793 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
L133792 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ If you hadn't come along and protected me when you did, I'd have killed them fellows.
L133789 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ I'm all right, Mr. Leland.  Only there was some fellows out front that thought they ought to take things up with me.  I learned 'em! Didn't I, officer?
L133788 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ What's happened?
L133732 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ September the ninth?
L133731 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Well, he'll be coming back in September. The Majestic.  I got the reservations. It gets in on the ninth.
L133729 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ 
L133728 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ If you thought I'd answer different from what Mr. Kane tells you - well, I wouldn't.
L133727 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Yes.
L133726 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?  Am I a New England school-marm?
L133725 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Don't I always?  Most of the time?
L133724 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Mr. Bernstein, I wish you'd let me ask you a few questions, and answer me truthfully.
L133723 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ I wanted him to have fun - and with me along -
L133722 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Mr. Leland, why didn't you go to Europe with him?  He wanted you to.  He said to me just yesterday -
L133721 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Certainly not.
L133720 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Do you, Mr. Leland?
L133688 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Probably.  There's always a chance, of course, that they'll change Mr. Kane - without his knowing it.
L133687 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Certainly not.  So what's that got to do with it?  Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week.
L133686 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Do we stand for the same things that the "Chronicle" stands for, Mr. Bernstein?
L133684 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Sure.  They're like anybody else. They got work to do.  They do it.  Only they happen to be the best men in the business.
L133683 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Mr. Bernstein, these men who are now with the "Enquirer" - who were with the "Chronicle" until yesterday - weren't they just as devoted to the "Chronicle" kind of paper as they are now to - our kind of paper?
L133682 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ What's the matter?
L133680 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Yes.
L133679 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Isn't it wonderful?  Such a party!
L133645 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Certainly not.
L133644 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Do you, Mr. Leland?
L133614 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ That looks pretty nice.
L133613 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Sixty-two thousand -
L133600 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ You just made the paper over four times today, Mr. Kane.  That's all -
L133599 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ Charlie?!
L133598 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Wasted?
L133594 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ It's three hours and fifty minutes late - but we did it -
L133593 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ We'll be on the street soon, Charlie - another ten minutes.
L133576 +++$+++ u4500 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ BERNSTEIN +++$+++ Who said anything about brooms?
L133575 +++$+++ u4507 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ LELAND +++$+++ I'm not guaranteeing a thing, Mr. Bernstein.  You people work too fast for me!  Talk about new brooms!
L133586 +++$+++ u4501 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ But Mr. Kane, I meant -
L133585 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ It is accepted, Mr. Carter, with assurances of my deepest regard.
L133584 +++$+++ u4501 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ I've been a newspaperman my whole life and I don't intend -  - if it's your intention that I should continue to be harassed by this - this -  I warn you, Mr. Kane, it would go against my grain to desert you when you need me so badly - but I would feel obliged to ask that my resignation be accepted.
L133565 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ That'll be all today, Mr. Carter. You've been most understanding. Good day, Mr. Carter!
L133564 +++$+++ u4501 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ But, Mr. Kane -
L133560 +++$+++ u4501 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ Really, Mr. Kane, I can't see the function of a respectable newspaper -
L133559 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.
L133558 +++$+++ u4501 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives.  If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily -
L133557 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ The "Chronicle" doesn't say she's murdered, Mr. Carter.  It says the neighbors are getting suspicious.
L133556 +++$+++ u4501 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ As a matter of fact, we sent a man to the Silverstone home yesterday afternoon.  Our man even arrived before the "Chronicle" reporter.  And there's no proof that the woman was murdered - or even that she's dead.
L133555 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough.  The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -
L133554 +++$+++ u4501 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ CARTER +++$+++ There is no news big enough.
L133553 +++$+++ u4505 +++$+++ m298 +++$+++ KANE +++$+++ I'm still hungry, Brad.  Let's go to Rector's and get something decent.  The "Chronicle" has a two-column headline, Mr. Carter.  Why haven't we?
