L66076 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ You and the Colonel go back.
L66075 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Gotta be honest, I love what you've done with the place --
L66061 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ And you notice I'm not in the Army anymore.
L66060 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.
L66059 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ I didn't mean that as a compliment.
L66056 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ He was our Drill here. Man's older than sand.
L66055 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ You knew Sergeant West?
L66054 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Ah, Christ
L66051 +++$+++ u479 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ HARDY +++$+++ Fantastic. You want to tell me what's going on?
L66050 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Hostile and uncooperative.
L66608 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Although that won't matter much when coupled with the murder charge --
L66607 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Pike, please --
L66392 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! We'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West, all we gotta do is tell the story right.
L66391 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ I don't think I want to hear this --
L66390 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --
L66389 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ How?
L66388 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ A gay Senator's son who let his Sarge get fragged on a training exercise? The press'll crucify you and your father. His career will be over and it'll be your fault. But we do this different and you come out a hero.
L66387 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L66386 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ The thing is, we've got a real opportunity here. You turn me in tomorrow and we're both fucked --
L66592 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ To start a fire, goddammit!  What about him, huh? Maybe he offed the Sarge and changed shirts, brought an extra one in his pack. Y'ever think of that? Go ahead, cut him loose! First chance he gets, he'll waste the rest of us, that's how they work --
L66591 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ So you took off your shirt?
L66590 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ I was freezing from the hurricane --
L66361 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ I'm about two seconds away from seeing if fairies really can fly --
L66360 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Oh, you remember now --
L66359 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ I remember now, it was before the explosion --
L66358 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Yeah and he doesn't know when --
L66357 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ Pike and I got separated --
L66354 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ You better watch it, faggot, I'm not sure you and Childs didn't do him --
L66353 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Poor fucker my ass...
L66352 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ They found him. Poor fucker was practically blown in half --
L66278 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ Oh, yeah, "Excuse me, Sergeant, sir, we don't feel like going out -- we don't want to get rained on." He'll kick our asses from here to Cleveland.
L66277 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ We should tell him we're not going.
L66274 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
L66273 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
L66272 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ The faggot speaks.
L66271 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Maybe we shouldn't go.
L66738 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ He came after us. And I told Dunbar he had to kill him...
L66737 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ What happened with Nunez?
L66735 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ So you framed him. The same way Childs was going to frame Pike.
L66734 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ I scared Dunbar into silence. He's been trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here, you came to see me... I didn't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret --
L66733 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ I told him what had really happened to West. Told him to keep quiet about it or I'd destroy him. Because if it came out that I was involved with the whole PX scam, my father would be finished.
L66725 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Childs.
L66724 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Who, Levi --
L66720 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ We did get our stories straight, but not because we killed anyone.  It was because I threatened him.
L66719 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Wrong answer --
L66718 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Dunbar's telling the truth.
L66717 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ What.
L66716 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Wait --
L66715 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Enjoy your flight to Washington --
L66714 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ It will and you know why? Because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the United States Army; you have no identity, no Miranda warning, and no rights. So I'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you, I'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off!
L66713 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ It won't work --
L66710 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ What?
L66709 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ It doesn't matter, Levi. We're going to find those bodies and when we do, I'm going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon --
L66706 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ You can't threaten me --
L66705 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ You and Dunbar got your stories straight. Little details, little inconsistencies, designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other, asking questions, killing time, until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where Senator Daddy can protect you. You think you're just going to slide out of this? You're an accessory to murder, Levi, you're going to jail --
L66681 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Then he's mistaken. You know, I really don't think my father would approve of this line of questioning --
L66680 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Dunbar says you were.
L66677 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ No, but it got you interested, didn't it? Got you to dig. Inspired Ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses where they didn't belong.
L66676 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Pike never confessed.
L66669 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Not much time to solve the crime. Tell me, detective, how did it feel taking blood money from Guissepe Torres? Did it weigh on your conscience or did you just not think about it?
L66668 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Fifty minutes.
L66667 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Running out of time, are we? Tick- tock, tick-tock, how long till your witnesses fly the coop?
L66666 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ We've been making progress, I see.
L66665 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Pike never confessed.
L66400 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Like I said, I was in the kitchen. When I came out, Mueller and Pike were dead, Nunez and Childs were hit and Dunbar was gone.
L66399 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ But you didn't see it, right?
L66398 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ Because he'd shot Mueller.
L66397 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Nunez was chasing Dunbar.
L66289 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ He whispered it in my ear.
L66288 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ No one else heard it?
L66287 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ "You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.
L66286 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ He said what?
L66264 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ He wanted more than that.
L66263 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ He couldn't kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own.
L66246 +++$+++ u480 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ KENDALL +++$+++ What, "The Truth"? Please. There are degrees of truth, officer, always degrees. Things are not what they seem.
L66245 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ We just want --
L66606 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ -- failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself --
L66605 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ Tell him to shut up --
L66600 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ Shut up!
L66599 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Until we return to base, and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in Sergeant West's body --
L66598 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ Bullshit --
L66597 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --
L66596 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ The fuck are you talking about --
L66595 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Cadet Michael Mueller, I hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of Sergeant Nathan West --
L66594 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ We're not going anywhere.
L66593 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of here --
L66589 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Still got mine on, not a speck of blood on it. Not a bad trick for a murderer -- you said you burned yours?
L66588 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ I used it to start the fire --
L66587 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Where's your shirt, Mueller?
L66586 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ We all know what you did, Pike. I don't know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here, but --
L66582 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ Shut the fuck up.  He was gonna cut him loose.
L66581 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ This place is going, Mueller. We gotta move --
L66579 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ What the fuck are you doing?
L66578 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Thank God...
L66515 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Blame the nigger, then, huh? Someone turns up dead, you just look for the darkest face in the crowd --
L66514 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ Whoever shot the Sarge blew a grenade first --
L66502 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ What the fuck happened to you? One minute you're next to me and the next you're gone and the sky lights up like fucking Christmas --
L66501 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ What the fuck happened to you --
L66270 +++$+++ u481 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ MUELLER +++$+++ Toughens us up, Pike. You don't like it, quit.
L66269 +++$+++ u483 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ PIKE +++$+++ Hurricane's due after midnight and we're still going out?
L66815 +++$+++ u484 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ SERGEANT +++$+++ Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
L66814 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ So?
L66811 +++$+++ u484 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ SERGEANT +++$+++ You mean Ray Dunbar? Well, that ain't right.
L66810 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ No, no that was Cadet Dunbar --
L66809 +++$+++ u484 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ SERGEANT +++$+++ Funny. I swear I saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning.
L66807 +++$+++ u484 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ SERGEANT +++$+++ Terrible tragedy. One of those Section Eight boys worked in here. Pike. Heard he got out okay.
L66806 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Yeah.
L66805 +++$+++ u484 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ SERGEANT +++$+++ Sign here and here.  Hey, ain't you the folks workin' on that whole hulabaloo from last night?
L67038 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ The army kicked you out for drugs...
L67037 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ You never told me why you got kicked out of...
L66783 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ Gets on his plane in ten minutes, which means you two are done. You'll understand if I don't walk you out.
L66782 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ What happens to Dunbar now?
L66661 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ I'm giving you a chance to walk away.
L66660 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ We know.
L66659 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ You both know if you do this, if you go after a Senator's son and you're wrong... it's not just me in the hot seat anymore.
L66658 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ He tried to burn Dunbar to us. You don't do that if you're not involved.
L66657 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ You want Kendall, don't you?
L66410 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ It's too neat.
L66409 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ What do you think?
L66142 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ No --
L66141 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ You think he did it?
L66068 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ I called the JAG Corps, the two cadets we retrieved are to be flown to D.C. on a transport leaving here at 1700 --
L66067 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ Search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup. If they're hurt and we can get to them in time...
L66039 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ Then it's unofficial.
L66038 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ He's not Army, it's not official --
L66037 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.
L66036 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
L66035 +++$+++ u485 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ STYLES +++$+++ He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.
L66034 +++$+++ u482 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ OSBORNE +++$+++ This is totally unnecessary --
L66283 +++$+++ u487 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ WEST +++$+++ LZ is two clicks North of a cabin, you are to split into teams of two and work your way through your designated area blasting as many targets as you can find! Each area has twenty targets, first team to take all twenty and find the cabin wins! Teams are as follows -- Dunbar and Nunez, Pike and Mueller, Kendall and Childs!
L66282 +++$+++ u486 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ THE CADETS +++$+++ Sir, yes, sir!
L66281 +++$+++ u487 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ WEST +++$+++ Some of you may have heard there's a hurricane coming! American soldiers do not wait for good weather -- they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty! An American Soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy! Anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh, feel free to lay down and die, you get me?
L66157 +++$+++ u487 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ WEST +++$+++ So forget what you've seen on Sixty fucking Minutes about the kinder, gentler military -- you will either succeed, quit, or die by my hand!
L66156 +++$+++ u486 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ THE CADETS +++$+++ Sir, yes, sir!
L66155 +++$+++ u487 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ WEST +++$+++ In my time I have killed sixteen men for the good of my country, sixteen men whose entrance into this Army I could not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of this nation's defense! This base suffers an average of three training accidents a year, unfortunate incidents that I will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me, understand -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
L66154 +++$+++ u486 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ THE CADETS +++$+++ Sir, yes, sir!
L66153 +++$+++ u487 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ WEST +++$+++ Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
L66152 +++$+++ u486 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ THE CADETS +++$+++ Sir, yes, sir!
L66151 +++$+++ u487 +++$+++ m29 +++$+++ WEST +++$+++ You motherfuckers have just made the worst mistake of your lives! You have chosen to join my Army! This Army is my mother, my father, and my little virgin sister and I will not allow anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her pretty little virgin cooze, do you understand me -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
L84067 +++$+++ u488 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ AMOS +++$+++ Good luck, kid.
L84066 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Thank you.
L84065 +++$+++ u488 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ AMOS +++$+++ Her name is Sandra Templeton. She's going to Auburn. The semester's almost over, so you better hurry.
L84064 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ There's only one I want.
L84063 +++$+++ u488 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ AMOS +++$+++ I was wrong about you kid. You may not have much, but what you got, you got a lot of. You could get any girl.
L84062 +++$+++ u488 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ AMOS +++$+++ That would explain the indigestion.
L84061 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead.
L84060 +++$+++ u488 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ AMOS +++$+++ Didn't kill anything, did I?
L84045 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I'll work night and day, and you won't have to pay me. You just have to tell me who she is.
L84044 +++$+++ u488 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ AMOS +++$+++ Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
L84043 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I don't have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one. And I may not have much, but I have more determination than any man you're ever going to meet.
L84041 +++$+++ u488 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ AMOS +++$+++ Kid, you were a big fish in a small pond. This here is the ocean, and you're drowning. Take my advice and go back to Puddleville. You'll be happy there.
L84040 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Someone stole my backpack.
L84039 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I've got a whole backpack full of clothes!
L84038 +++$+++ u488 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ AMOS +++$+++ Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.
L84037 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ What do you mean? You don't even know me.
L84036 +++$+++ u488 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ AMOS +++$+++ Kid. Don't waste your time. She's out of your league.
L84035 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Who is she? Where does she live?
L84034 +++$+++ u488 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ AMOS +++$+++ I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
L84033 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Yes!
L84032 +++$+++ u488 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ AMOS +++$+++ Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?
L84031 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. That or die alone.
L84030 +++$+++ u488 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ AMOS +++$+++ Tough break. Most men have to get married before they lose their wives.
L84029 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her.
L84028 +++$+++ u488 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ AMOS +++$+++ See! The big guy likes it.
L84024 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ That's great.
L84023 +++$+++ u488 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ AMOS +++$+++ Hey kid! Your friend just made himself a star.
L84021 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost.
L84020 +++$+++ u488 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ AMOS +++$+++ Great, great. That's fantastic.
L83943 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I don't expect to.
L83942 +++$+++ u489 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ BEAMEN +++$+++ You won't find a better place!
L83939 +++$+++ u489 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ BEAMEN +++$+++ No one's ever left.
L83938 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.
L83937 +++$+++ u489 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ BEAMEN +++$+++ Why?
L83936 +++$+++ u492 +++$+++ m30 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I have to leave. Tonight.
