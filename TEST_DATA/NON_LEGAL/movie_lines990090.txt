L360053 +++$+++ u6408 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ KYRA +++$+++ I'm so sorry.  No one would switch flights with me.
L359539 +++$+++ u6409 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ Yeah, once I cut them off.  Why?
L359538 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ They ever love you back?
L359537 +++$+++ u6409 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ Too many times.
L359536 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ You ever been in love?
L359535 +++$+++ u6409 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ Hey.  You just worry about playing your behind off for that recruiter tonight. Let me worry about your date.
L359534 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ I don't know how to walk in heels.
L359533 +++$+++ u6409 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ If you were tore up I would not be claiming you.  Trust.
L359532 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Yeah, right.
L359531 +++$+++ u6409 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ You do.
L359530 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Oh, great.
L359529 +++$+++ u6409 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ I told him you looked like me.
L359528 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ How'd you get him to say yes?
L359527 +++$+++ u6409 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ And he's fine, girl.
L359526 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ He's in college?
L359525 +++$+++ u6409 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ This brother from my college.
L359524 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Damn, Lena...  Who is he?
L359523 +++$+++ u6409 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ No.
L359522 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Mom tell you to do this?
L359521 +++$+++ u6409 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ I know...
L359520 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Found?  I'm not some charity case.
L359519 +++$+++ u6409 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ I found you someone.
L359518 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.
L359517 +++$+++ u6409 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ So what's going on with the Spring Dance? You have a date yet?
L359515 +++$+++ u6409 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ Just try and chill a little bit, alright.
L359514 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ No one's forcing her.
L359513 +++$+++ u6409 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ You need to.  She's alone in this house all day, taking care of Dad and your ungrateful behind.
L359512 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Just cause I don't kiss her booty like you...
L359511 +++$+++ u6409 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ Like you don't give her a hard time.
L359510 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Always on my ass, anyway.
L359509 +++$+++ u6409 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ Mom's going to hate it.
L359508 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ No.
L359507 +++$+++ u6409 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ LENA +++$+++ That too tight?
L360136 +++$+++ u6411 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ I'll take that as a compliment.
L360135 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ You shoot like a girl.
L360132 +++$+++ u6411 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ So how's the job going?
L360131 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
L360130 +++$+++ u6411 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ I was upstairs for a meeting.  I've been hearing good things about you.
L360129 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Dad.  What are you doing here?
L360128 +++$+++ u6411 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Hey, munchkin.
L359406 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Chances are there's still a chance.
L359405 +++$+++ u6411 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ I know.  But chances are...
L359404 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.
L359403 +++$+++ u6411 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ You only have one game left and you haven't been recruited.  Munchkin, I wanted it as bad as you did, but we have to face reality.
L359402 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ What?
L359401 +++$+++ u6411 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ Monica, I think her point is...maybe it's time to start thinking about other things besides basketball.
L359392 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ I was just showing emotion.
L359391 +++$+++ u6411 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ You lost your head.
L359390 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ The coach from Tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench.
L359389 +++$+++ u6411 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ NATHAN +++$+++ And what am I supposed to say to the man?
L359388 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Dad, you have to talk to Coach for me.
L359987 +++$+++ u6415 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ SIDRA +++$+++ Sometimes.  But what's the alternative, not playing?  You remember big Toni?  She quit last year, now she's working at some bookstore.  I mean, look at us. They treat us like we're Hollywood stars over here.  We just played in the championship game.  It doesn't get much sweeter than this.
L359986 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ You ever think about going back?
L359985 +++$+++ u6415 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ SIDRA +++$+++ Shoot, Italian boys love them some black women.  They can't get enough of me.
L359984 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Just not my type, I guess.
L359983 +++$+++ u6415 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ SIDRA +++$+++ What?  You've been over here seven months and you ain't tapped anything?
L359982 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ I wouldn't know.
L359981 +++$+++ u6415 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ SIDRA +++$+++ So what are these Spanish guys like?
L359979 +++$+++ u6415 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ SIDRA +++$+++ It's better.  Even though the whole first season my teammates didn't pass to me cause they were mad "The American" was making more money.  I led the team in rebounds cause it was the only way I could touch the damn ball.
L359978 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ How's that been?
L359977 +++$+++ u6415 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ SIDRA +++$+++ Yup.  So I've been playing with this Italian club the last three years.
L359976 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Just like that?
L359975 +++$+++ u6415 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ SIDRA +++$+++ Yeah, four years ago.  They had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people.  I'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock.  Then the whack club I'm on loses three games in a row and I get blamed.  So they fire me.
L359972 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ You mean my championship trophy?  My bad.
L359971 +++$+++ u6415 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ SIDRA +++$+++ Can you take that damn thing off the table.
L359970 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ How do you say "you're dreaming" in Italian?
L359969 +++$+++ u6415 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ SIDRA +++$+++ I'm gonna love winning this championship in your house.
L359968 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ What's up, Sidra.
L359967 +++$+++ u6415 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ SIDRA +++$+++ Well, what do you know.
L359860 +++$+++ u6415 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ SIDRA +++$+++ Never let a freshman take your spot.
L359859 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ What's that?
L359858 +++$+++ u6415 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ SIDRA +++$+++ Just one word of advice for next season.
L359857 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ I know.
L359856 +++$+++ u6415 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ SIDRA +++$+++ But that was a dumb-ass pass to Toni. Ten seconds left, you run out the clock.
L359855 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Thanks.
L359854 +++$+++ u6415 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ SIDRA +++$+++ No buts.  Took a lot of heart to take that charge.
L359853 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ But?
L359852 +++$+++ u6415 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ SIDRA +++$+++ Just wanted to say good game.
L359851 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ What's up?
L359682 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Didn't have to try very hard.
L359681 +++$+++ u6415 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ SIDRA +++$+++ You were trying to make me look bad.
L359680 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ I was just playing ball.
L359679 +++$+++ u6415 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ SIDRA +++$+++ That's what you get for trying to show out, freshman.
L359647 +++$+++ u6415 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ SIDRA +++$+++ Besides.  I've been starting point the last two years.  Ain't no way some dumb- ass freshman is taking my spot.
L359646 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Thanks, Sidra.
L359645 +++$+++ u6415 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ SIDRA +++$+++ Hey, don't take it personal.  And don't think just cause we play the same position we have to compete with each other.  We're teammates, okay?
L359644 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ What's up with that?
L359643 +++$+++ u6415 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ SIDRA +++$+++ She hates all freshmen.
L359642 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Coach hates me, doesn't she?
L360211 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding present.
L360210 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ And what happens when you lose?
L360209 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you.
L360208 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ So?
L360207 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.
L360206 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ What will this prove?
L360204 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Monica, after that stuff with my dad, I couldn't trust anybody, okay.  I mean, I was lost.  So you are forgiven.  But that was five years ago.  I moved on.
L360203 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ I know why you broke up with me in college.  And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you.
L360202 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ What's that supposed to be, psychology?
L360201 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ So you're gonna bitch up?
L360200 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ You're out of your mind.
L360199 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Your heart.
L360198 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ For what?
L360197 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ One game.  One-on-one.
L360196 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ What?
L360195 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ I'll play you.
L360194 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Wrong.
L360193 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Better late than never, right?
L360192 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.
L360191 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Then why are you so upset?
L360190 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ You haven't changed.  You still think the sun rises and sets on your ass.  Well, guess what, it doesn't.
L360189 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ I know, I probably should have said it two weeks ago.
L360188 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ We haven't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this?
L360187 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you since I was eleven and the shit won't go away.
L360186 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ I heard enough.
L360185 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ It's not fun for me anymore because you're missing.
L360184 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ you woke me up to tell me that?
L360183 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ From basketball.
L360182 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ What?
L360181 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ You asked me what was missing.
L360179 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ We need to talk.
L360178 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ What's going on?
L360168 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Find.
L360167 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ It doesn't matter, alright.  Just leave it alone.
L360166 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ What?
L360165 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Something was just missing.
L360164 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Cause I don't get it.
L360163 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Why do you keep asking me that?
L360162 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ So why'd you give up ball?
L360161 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ It's a trip, you know?  When you're a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it's not gonna turn out that way.
L360160 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ I mean, Kyra hasn't heard the school thing yet.  She'll probably say it's the painkillers talking.
L360159 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Wow.
L360158 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Maybe go back to school.
L360157 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Like what?
L360156 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Seems like I needed a ball when I was trying to be like my pops...or trying to be better than him.  Now, I kinda think I need to try something else.
L360155 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ You're serious.
L360154 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Nah.  I haven't dribbled a ball in four and a half months.  Maybe I miss some of the attention, but besides that...
L360153 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ And you tore up your knee.  Rehab is tough.
L360152 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
L360151 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ You had a rough couple years, that's all.
L360150 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.
L360149 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ It just isn't.
L360147 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ That's okay.  I'm probably, you know, busy.
L360146 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Yeah.  Two weeks.  I didn't get to send you an invitation, but if you...
L360145 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Strong enough to get you down the aisle?
L360144 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Getting there.
L360143 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ So...how's the knee?
L360142 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Darryl.  He's alright, kinda corny.
L360141 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Who's this guy I always see her around?
L360140 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Kyra's gone for a couple days.  Figured I'd keep Mom company.
L360139 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ You visiting?
L360067 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Thanks.
L360066 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Yeah, and Quincy, good luck with your knee, and everything.
L360051 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ No.
L360050 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun anymore.  You know?
L360049 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ A rest?
L360048 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ I'm tired of playing overseas.  Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.
L360047 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ What do you mean?
L360046 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Actually, I don't...
L360045 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Figured it was something like that.
L360044 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine.  It was always messing up.
L360043 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Wanted to give you props on making First Team All-American.  And then when Magic retired, I tried calling you again.
L360042 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Oh yeah?
L360041 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Tried calling you a couple times.
L360040 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Kiss my ass.
L360039 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Funny.  I never did.
L360038 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Well, I tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical.
L360037 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Still working on being the first girl in the NBA?
L360036 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ We won the championship.
L360035 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ So, how's pro-ball, Europe?
L360034 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ I forgot, "Q-man."
L360033 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Not for Quincy McCall.
L360032 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.
L360031 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ A lot of things.  All I know is I'll be back in six months.
L360030 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ What are the doctors saying?
L360029 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Yup.
L360028 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ I'm fine.  My dad said you tore your ACL.
L360027 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ I'm alright.  But you can sit.
L360026 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Shouldn't you be lying down, or...
L360025 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Thanks.
L360024 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.
L360023 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Just something I'm trying.
L360022 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ I was.  I see your peach fuzz finally grew in.
L360021 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Alright.  I heard you were in Spain.
L359956 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ Uh huh.
L359955 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ So...I guess I'll see you around.
L359953 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Damnitt, Monica.  This ain't about us anymore, it's about me.
L359952 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ So that's it, just forget about us?
L359951 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Few days ago.
L359950 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ When did you decide all this?
L359949 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ I decided to go pro.  And who knows where I'll end up, you know?
L359948 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ You're what?
L359947 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Look, I'm entering the draft.
L359946 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ You don't think so?
L359945 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ I don't think so.
L359944 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ How are you going to tell me what I have time for?  I mean, whatever I did...we can fix this.
L359943 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ I'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for.
L359942 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ What?
L359941 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ I'm not asking for us to be together.
L359940 +++$+++ u6410 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ MONICA +++$+++ How do I know next time you're feeling neglected or whatever, you're not going to run around on me?  If we're going to be together I have to be able to trust you.
L359939 +++$+++ u6413 +++$+++ m427 +++$+++ QUINCY +++$+++ Well, if all you care about is basketball, why you fucking me?  Go fuck Dick Vitale.
