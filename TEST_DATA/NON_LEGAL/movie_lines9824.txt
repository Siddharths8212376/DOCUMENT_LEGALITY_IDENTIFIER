L217490 +++$+++ u5315 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ SONDRA +++$+++ Jack, it's a sitcom -- you're not defining Pi.
L217489 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ ... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body.  Do you know what that means?  What this could lead to?

L217485 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You know, tomorrow's a very big day for me... It would be nice if you acted like you understood.
L217484 +++$+++ u5315 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ SONDRA +++$+++ You're so witty.  I'm so jealous... I <u>need</u> to get out of here, Jack, and do something other than sit in this apartment and count how many funny lines you have per page.
L217483 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ About dinner as a concept or about dinner with...  <u>Raoul</u>?
L217481 +++$+++ u5315 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ SONDRA +++$+++ You can ask.
L217480 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Can I ask that when you clean your hands you wipe the ink off the inside of the sink before it stains the stainless steel.

L217891 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Lydia.  Lydia what?
L217890 +++$+++ u5314 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ RECEPTIONIST +++$+++ Oh, Lydia!

L217888 +++$+++ u5314 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ RECEPTIONIST +++$+++ What girl?  I didn't notice.
L217887 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Could you help me-- what was the name of that girl who just came in...
L218266 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah.....Hey they're moving....  Am I doing that?
L218265 +++$+++ u5313 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ PARRY +++$+++ Beautiful night huh?
L218068 +++$+++ u5313 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ PARRY +++$+++ I know!
L218067 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Parry, it's Lydia Sinclair - our membership winner.
L218063 +++$+++ u5313 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ PARRY +++$+++ I'm still scared.
L218062 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No. Nothing bad's going to happen. Anne'll be there. I'll be there. Nothing bad will happen.
L218061 +++$+++ u5313 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ PARRY +++$+++ ...I feel so much for her...I feel like something awful is going to happen.
L218045 +++$+++ u5313 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ PARRY +++$+++ What are the other reasons?
L218044 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No. But that's not the only reason people get together or..stay together.
L218043 +++$+++ u5313 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ PARRY +++$+++ Tch...how romantic. Yeah. If I wasn't already committed to Lydia, boy. Except Anne'd never go for me though. She loves you too much. And you really love her, huh?
L218042 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ In a bar called Hellfire.
L218041 +++$+++ u5313 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ PARRY +++$+++ I'm sorry....I'm just so excited.  You must have felt this way when you first met Anne, huh? Where did you two meet?
L218040 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Will you stand still so I can do this!
L218015 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ <u>Parry</u>!  Close your pants...
L218014 +++$+++ u5313 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ PARRY +++$+++ Holdin' my penis...
L217886 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Sure...
L217885 +++$+++ u5313 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ PARRY +++$+++ Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
L217884 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
L217883 +++$+++ u5313 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ PARRY +++$+++ Happily married, probably.
L217882 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Well, see, I think she can help...You know women are great..they...they make homes and they..ya know, kill the livestock so the knights can go out and get Grails and...and slaughter villages with a clear head...I mean, where would Arthur be without Guinevere...
L217881 +++$+++ u5313 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ PARRY +++$+++ Maybe, when we get the Grail...
L217880 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman. It's the twentieth century.
L217879 +++$+++ u5313 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ PARRY +++$+++ I can't ask for her...I have to earn her.
L217873 +++$+++ u5313 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ PARRY +++$+++ Then let's begin with the story itself. It's a story of the Grail myth...And although there are several variations, my favorite begins with the Fisher King as a young boy... who had to spend a night alone in the forest to prove his courage... and during that night, he is visited by a sacred vision. Out of the fire, appears the Holy Grail - God's highest symbol of divine grace. And a voice says to the boy, "You shall be the guardian of the Grail, that it may heal the hearts of men"...But the boy was overcome ...Innocent and foolish, he was blinded by greater visions - a life ahead filled with beauty and glory, hope and power...Tears filled his eyes as he sensed his own... invincibility. A boy's tears of naive wonder and inspiration. and in this state of...radical amazement...he felt for a brief moment, not like a boy, but like God...  ...And so he reached into the fire to take the Grail. And the Grail vanished. And the boy hands were left caught in the flames...leaving him wounded and ashamed at what his recklessness had lost him. When he became King, he was determined to reclaim his destiny and find the Grail... But with each year that passed, with each campaign he fought, the Grail remained lost, and this wound he suffered in the fire grew worse... He became a bitter man. Life for him lost it's reason. With each disappointment, with each betrayal... with each loss ... this wound would grow... Soon the land began to spoil from neglect and his people starved...Until finally, the King lost all faith in God's existance and in man's value...He lost his ability to love or be loved And he was so sick with experience... that he started to die. As the years went on, his bravest knights would search for the Grail that would heal their King and make them the most respected and valued men in the land, but to no avail.  Pretty soon, finding the Grail became a ruthless struggle between ambitious men vying for the King's power, which only confirmed the King's worst suspicions of man, causing his wound to grow. His only hope, he thought, was death. Then one day, a fool was brought in to the King to cheer him.  He was a simple-minded man... not particularly skilled...or admired... He tells the King some jokes...sing him some songs, but the King feels even worse...Finally, the fool says, "What is it that hurts you so much? How can I help?"...And the King says, "I need a sip of water to cool my throat"...So, the fool takes a cup from the bedstand, fills it with water and hands it to the King...Suddenly, the King feels a lot better. And when he looks to his hands, he sees that it was the Holy Grail the fool handed him...an ordinary cup that had been beside his bed all along...And the King asks, "How can this be?...how could you find what all my knights and wisest men could not find"? And the fool answers, "I don't know. I only knew you were thirsty."... And for the first time since he was a boy, the King felt more than a man - not because he was touched by God's glory...but rather, by the compassion of a fool.
L217872 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What?
L217871 +++$+++ u5313 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ PARRY +++$+++ Are there any questions?
L217867 +++$+++ u5313 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ PARRY +++$+++ Bingo!
L217866 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!
L217865 +++$+++ u5313 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ PARRY +++$+++ Who are you talking to Jack?
L217864 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ ..Ha...Little fella? I mean the man talks to invisible people - he sees invisible horses - and he's naked in the middle of Central Park. I should be surprised? I'm not surprised. I'm fucking outta my mind to even be here!
L217863 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ NO! I will not! This is nuts! I'm leaving! I mean it...this is nuts.  This is too nuts...I'm leaving. I mean it!
L217862 +++$+++ u5313 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ PARRY +++$+++ Come on, try it. Ya feel the air on your body - ya little fella's flappin' in the breeze. ...everybody in the city is busy with their business and no one knows we're bare assed in the middle of it. Come on!
L217861 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You can't do this! This is New York! Nobody lies in naked in a field in New York..It's...it's too Midwestern.
L217860 +++$+++ u5313 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ PARRY +++$+++ Have you ever done any cloudbusting? You lie on your back and you concentrate on the clouds...and you try yo break them apart with your mind. It's wild.
L217859 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ .....What are you doing?
L217858 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yes. I think that's very fair.
L217857 +++$+++ u5313 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ PARRY +++$+++ Well that's stupid. This is my park just as much as it is theirs. You think it's fair they keep us out just because they make us think we'll get killed or something?
L217856 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Don't you think it's time to go now? Running around here during the day is one thing but at night we could be killed by a wide variety of people.
L217850 +++$+++ u5313 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ PARRY +++$+++ It's a classic.
L217849 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ It's such a great song.
L217814 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Well, maybe he wants to stay here.  Do...do you want to stay here?
L217813 +++$+++ u5313 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ PARRY +++$+++ Who?
L217812 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Listen, he just needs to sleep it off. Someone will take care of him.
L217807 +++$+++ u5313 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ PARRY +++$+++ Buddy, the days of the debutantes are ... not what they used to be.

I know who you are.. or who you were.                                   You're acting really- You don't belong on the                            No, no, no, no... streets.

L217782 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!
L217781 +++$+++ u5313 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ PARRY +++$+++ That's why the Little People sent you. Just <u>like</u> magic.
L217780 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'm self-centered, I'm weak - I don't have the will power of a <u>fly</u> on shit...
L217779 +++$+++ u5313 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ PARRY +++$+++ You're a real honest to goodness <u>good</u> guy.
L217778 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'm not. Believe me. <u>I'm</u> scum.

L217774 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Please don't hug me in public again, O.K.?
L217773 +++$+++ u5313 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ PARRY +++$+++ ...You are such a great guy. First the money, now this.  Isn't he fabulous!?
L217772 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No. I think you're a moron and I don't want to get into trouble.
L217771 +++$+++ u5313 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ PARRY +++$+++ Tch. You are so sweet...Now I know why you're saying this. ...You're afraid I'm in danger and you're trying to protect me.
L217770 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I take it back - you're fucking deranged... And you're going to get yourself killed trying to get in there!
L217769 +++$+++ u5313 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ PARRY +++$+++ I don't need a job. I have a quest.
L217768 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Look, you're only sort of insane, really. People like you can lead semi-normal lives. You could get a job...
L217767 +++$+++ u5313 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ PARRY +++$+++ Of course there is, Jack. What do you think the Crusades were - a frat initiation? I don't think so...There has to be a Grail.
L217766 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ All right! Listen - please...don't start drooling or...rolling your eyes when I tell you this but - You shouldn't do this..There is no Holy Grail.
L217765 +++$+++ u5313 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ PARRY +++$+++ O.K...let me explain this one more time...The Holly Grail is in -....
L217764 +++$+++ u5310 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You can't just break into Langdon Carmichael's house. This man has done nothing.
L217763 +++$+++ u5313 +++$+++ m352 +++$+++ PARRY +++$+++ Pretty impressive huh?...Don't let it scare you. I'll admit it's formidable but everything has it's weakness.
