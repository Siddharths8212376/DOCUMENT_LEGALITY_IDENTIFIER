L513025 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Have a damn party! Call Morris and them and get the band together and just party our asses off. I'd like to show that fuckin' Karl to the guys. They'd get a kick out of that. Don't you know they would.
L513024 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Please Doyle, don't.
L513023 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ You know what we ought to do tonight?
L513022 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ What?
L513021 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ You know what, by God?
L513016 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ He does make some funny noises.
L513015 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Who could eat with him settin' there makin' that goddamn racket with his throat.
L513014 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I just feel sorry for the poor thing.
L513013 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Well, I wouldn't let it get to you.
L512969 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ See, you made him somethin'. Hey Vaughan, I was just goin' on with you, jokin' around, buddy.
L512968 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Let's go, Vaughan.  Frank, we'll be back in a little while. I'll bring you back somethin'. You're food's in the oven warmin' over.
L512940 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Frank, why don't you go off and play in your room if Doyle's gonna talk nasty.
L512939 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Boy, ain't you somethin' else. Talkin' back and everything. It kinda makes me horny when you talk back.
L512938 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ You're not crippled. Get in there and make somethin'.
L512937 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Ain't that the sweetest thing. What am I supposed to do about supper with you traipsin' around with that fag?
L512936 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ He'll be here in a little while, he's takin' me to get an ice cream.
L512935 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ You sure are hung up on people bein' sweet.  Speakin' of which, where's your girlfriend? I thought he was comin' by here for something.
L512934 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Yeah, that's right, Frank, you better ask him. I mean, don't hurt his feelin's or anything, but it would be good to know. I'm sure it's nothin'. He seems real sweet.
L512931 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ He had of went nuts and did somethin'. They don't put you in there for just bein' a retard. They's retards all over the place that ain't in the nuthouse. Do you know, Frank?
L512930 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ He's just mentally retarded, I guess.
L512929 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ I ain't sayin' it's right. I'm just tellin' the truth. What was he in the nuthouse for?
L512928 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Doyle, you're awful. You shouldn't be that way.
L513392 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Karl can stay if he wants to. Mama said --
L513391 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Now here's the deal. Now that I'm gonna throw my entire life away doin' what I want to come live here with y'all, we have to get a few things straight. See, Frank, me and you mama wouldn't have any problems if it wadn't for you. We'd never have a bad word between us. But since you do exist, if I'm gonna be here as the head of the household, we'll have to live by my rules. And my rules are you don't speak unless you're spoken to. Stay out of my way and do what a regular kid does. You're a weird little shit. I don't get you. So wake up. Face what they call reality. We're gonna be a family now. And it's my family. I'll be payin' the bills so you got me. But I ain't your daddy. You just treat me like I am. I'm the boss, okay. And the other thing is your friend Karl has to go. We can't have a normal family with him livin' in the garage and comin' in the bedroom at four in the mornin' with hammers and shit. See?
L513121 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Well, I hate you, too. No I don't. I love your mama. Nobody understands what I go through. I'll leave. You bunch of freaks have fun. I'll call you tomorrow honey. I'm sorry. You can kiss my ass, really.  You ever hit me again you little bastard and I'll make you sorry your daddy ever squirted your little ass out.
L513120 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I hate you!
L513119 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Okay, I'll leave and sober up. Everything's botherin' me, that's all. I'm hurtin' Linda. I love you.
L513029 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ That ain't none of your damn bidness. Besides that's the way friends do one another. Fuck it, I'm gonna go call 'em. Honey, find my guitar, I think it's out there in the garage with that loony tune.
L513028 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Last time you got mad and run Morris and them off and said to stay away from here.
L513020 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I get nervous, that's all I know.
L513019 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ What have you got to be nervous about? You're a damn kid. You ain't got any bills to pay or bidness to run or old lady to stay on your ass all the time.
L512986 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Don't talk about daddy. Y'all go on to the garage and let me be.
L512985 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Stop it, Doyle! Don't talk about daddy, you hear me!
L512982 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ You be quiet, Frank, we're talkin'. The adults are talkin'. Were you in the lockup for cuttin' somebody up with a hatchet?
L512981 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Stop it, Doyle!
L512973 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Goddamnit, I'm talkin' to the man. You set right there, Karl.
L512972 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Come on, Karl, let's go out to the garage.
L512942 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Yeah, honey, let the kid watch T.V. Hell, let's all watch T.V. like a family till your retarded friend and your homosexual friend gets here.
L512941 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I want to watch T.V.
L512933 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ You might want to find out. He might of hacked his family to pieces with a hatchet or somethin'.
L512932 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I ain't sure.
L512927 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ No sir's right. I'm talkin' to your mama. This is your mama's decision, not yours. I'm lettin' it go on because she asked me, not you.  Now is this the kind of retard that drools and rubs shit in his hair and all that, 'cause I have trouble eatin' around that kind of thing. Just like I am about antique furniture and midgets. I can't so much as drink a glass of water around a midget or a piece of antique furniture. Same thing with a droolin' retard.
L512926 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ No sir.
L512925 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Now son, I wadn't talkin' to you, was I?  Was I?
L512924 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ He's real honest. He wouldn't steal nothin'.
L512923 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Well, honey, I don't guess I give a shit. I ain't here half the time anyway. If you want a retard livin' in the garage, I don't guess I care. I've got a good tool box and socket set out there I don't want stol'd. I guess I could take it home with me.
L513110 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ I thought I told you to keep out!
L513109 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ I'm a witness. I heard you threaten her life.
L513105 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ That's funny.  You go to bed and take snot nose with you.
L513104 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ Doyle, don't you lay one hand on her.
L513095 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ I'll kill you, you fuckin' faggot! You mind your own business. Now get out! Now, before I get too mad to turn back.
L513094 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ It's not your house, Doyle, it's Linda's.
L513093 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ We don't have a goddamn band! Y'all just shut the fuck up! We don't need no practicin' or managers cause we ain't no fuckin' band! Morris ain't no genius and the rest of you are just losers. Am I the only one sane human bein' around here? Just get the hell out of my house and don't come back!
L513088 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ If y'all don't shut up I'm gonna go out of my mind. And plus you're liable to bust a spring in Karl's head. He's already off balance.
L513087 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ I don't really understand the meaning of the words.
L513074 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ What exactly do you mean by that? I don't understand.
L513073 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ You got that shit right.
L513064 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Sarcastic right?  You know the boys in the band are probably gonna stay over tonight. We'd be glad to have you.
L513063 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled.
L513062 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ I bet you like sittin' between two men in a dual wheel truck don't you?
L513053 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Shhhh! This is the national anthem.
L513052 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ Are you sure you can drive? You've really had a lot of alcohol.
L513049 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Come on, don't be a pussy. Everybody has to work.
L513048 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ I'd better go on home now, it's late. I have to work tomorrow.
L513044 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ You enjoying yourself, Karl?
L513043 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.
L513042 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ You like that Vaughan?
L512967 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ That's ridiculous. That's just a total lie.
L512966 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ I heard you was more than friends. I heard Dick Rivers caught y'all all bowed up and goin' at it in the same room with poor, little, old Mizz Ogletree and her dead as a doornail layed out on a gurney.
L512965 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ I know Albert. We're friends.
L512964 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Hey, Vaughan, you know what I heard? I heard you been puttin' it to Albert Sellers that works over at the funeral home.
L512961 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Don't rush ever'body, honey.
L512960 +++$+++ u7673 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ VAUGHAN +++$+++ Sure, I guess.
L513451 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I aim to kill you with it.
L513450 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ I told you to get away from here, didn't I? I'm tryin' to relax and look at TV.  What are you doin' with that piece of iron? I swear to God you're the weirdest son of a bitch I ever heard of.
L513449 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ What numbers do you punch?
L513448 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Pick up the fuckin' phone and call 'em, I guess.
L513447 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ How does a feller go about gettin' ahold of the police?
L513446 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Where's ever'body else? You seen 'em?  I thought I told you to get the hell moved out of here anyway.
L513394 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ You shut up you, fuckin' retard. Get your shit and get out of here.  That was a wake-up slap, Frank. Remember. Reality, like I said. Don't forget any bit of what I said to you and we'll be fine.
L513393 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Don't hit that boy no more.
L513377 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Baptized? Well, get baptized then. I don't give a shit. Call a fuckin' preacher, goddamnit! I can't baptize you.
L513376 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I want to be baptized.
L513041 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Karl Childers just in from the state facility. Make one of them gruntin' sounds Karl or whatever it is you do.  Oh well, Karl's a little retarded, he don't know what the hell I'm talkin' about. And to Vaughan who fucks a mortician in the rear entrance right in front of his clients. Now that takes balls. Our number one tune for the folks, boys. Kick it off Johnson!
L513040 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Childers.
L513039 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ On the bass, give it up for Terence "One Ball" Atkins.  On the tambourine and lyrics Morris Hobbs the fuckin' genius of the group.  On drums "The Johnson."  And last and most importantly, Doyle Hargraves on rhythm guitar and business affairs and the only motherfucker with a truck big enough to haul this outfit on the next world fuckin' tour. Come on, a big hand for these guys. They're workin' their asses off here.  Okay I'd like to dedicate this next one to some very special people in our audience tonight. To my lovely female companion Linda, her lovely son Frank, our new boarder Karl - what's your last name Karl?
L512984 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ You're just crazy in a retarded kind of way then.  It wouldn't matter to me if you did do violence on somebody 'cause I ain't afraid of shit. You think I'm afraid for you to stay here. You're just a humped over retard it looks like to me. Not really, I'm just jokin' with you. Welcome to our humble home, buddy. Frank needs all the friends he can get. Frank's a real weak little kid. His daddy taught him how to be a pussy.
L512983 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I ain't never used no hatchet that I remember.
L512980 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Well, I can't understand none of it. This one begat this one and that one begat this one and begat and begat and begat and lo somebody sayeth some shit or another. Just how retarded are you?
L512979 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ A good deal of it, I reckon. Can't understand all of it.
L512978 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ You believe in the Bible?
L512977 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em.
L512976 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ What's all them books?
L512975 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ This and that. Toothpaste and whatnot.
L512974 +++$+++ u7662 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ What's in your bag?
L513321 +++$+++ u7665 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I'm closing the door now. I told you, I'll see you later.
L513320 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ But maybe just for awhile --
L513319 +++$+++ u7665 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Frank, I just like you as a friend. Only at the secret place. Okay? I can't go there now. I'll see you later.
L513318 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Can you go there with us now? Me and Karl. We could just hang out. Karl has some cool books.
L513317 +++$+++ u7665 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Here give me the flowers, I'll do something with them. Thank you. Now you better go. Maybe I'll see you down at the secret place one day in a week or two or something. I have a boyfriend now you know. And we're pretty serious. He gave me a ring.
L513316 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ He's gonna be around a lot and I hope you are too, so...
L513315 +++$+++ u7665 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Why? Hi, Karl.
L513314 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I wanted for you to meet Karl, too. He's my new friend. But I feel like I've always known him. I thought you should meet him.
L513313 +++$+++ u7665 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ They're from the Dollar Store. I'm not an idiot. Besides we have a garden full of flowers.
L513312 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I wanted to bring you some flowers. They're pretty good ones.
L513311 +++$+++ u7665 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Hey Frank. You shouldn't be coming over here. My parents really don't want you to.
L513434 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Okay.
L513433 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Ever'thing's okay, boy. I kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then I'm gonna go on and leave here.
L513432 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Okay. I give you my word. Is ever'thing gonna be okay? Are you all right?
L513431 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Don't go home tonight and stay with that Doyle. He's got it in for ye tonight. I got me a feelin', too. Feels like to me you ort not be there in that house with him liquored up and mean. Ye mama neither. When you get up from here, I want you to go to that feller's house. Your mama's friend. I want you to give me your word on it.
L513430 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You know I would. Whatever you want.
L513429 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Will ye do somethin' for me if I ast you to?
L513428 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Like something different. I don't know.  You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?
L513427 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Reckon what kind of a feelin'?
L513426 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I've got a feelin' today.
L513425 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Yes sir.
L513424 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Man. Thanks.  You know when you get a feelin' and you don't know why?
L513423 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I aim fer you to have 'em.
L513422 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You don't want to give away all your books.
L513421 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Maybe you can make more sense out of them than I can. I made you a little old book marker and stuck it in that book on Christmas.
L513420 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Hit don't make no difference where I was to be. We'll always be friends. There ain't no way to stop that.  I aim for you to have these books.
L513419 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I care for you, too. But you'll be around, don't say that.
L513418 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I'm tired, too, Frank.  If I ain't around no more, it don't mean I don't care fer ye. I care for ye a good deal. I care for you more than anybody they is. We made friends right off the bat.
L513417 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Yeah, I guess so. I'm real tired, you know that. A kid my age shouldn't be tired of things.
L513416 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ That feller's a whole sight meaner than me. He'd just whup the tar out of me.
L513415 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Karl, I ain't tryin' to say nothin' bad about you, but why don't you stop Doyle when he gets that away? You're older than him. You're strong, too. My daddy wouldn't let him do that to me and Mama.
L513414 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ You're just a boy. You ort not to use that sort of language.
L513413 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You have to Karl. You have to look out for me. You don't let that son of a bitch run you off.
L513412 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I'm glad of it you was borned.  I reckon I ain't gonna be there in the garage no more.
L513411 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Just diggin'.  I ain't ever gonna be happy now. Not with that son of a bitch movin' in for good. I wish me and you and Mama could just run away. But she said he would find us wherever we went. He's crazy. Sometimes I think it would of been better if I wadn't ever born.
L513410 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I knowed you'd be here.  What are you a-doin' digging with that stob?
L513409 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Hey, Karl. How'd you know to come out here?
L513386 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Yes ma'am. I like a fried chicken leg.
L513385 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Yeah, I guess.
L513363 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ If I ain't too stove up. I ain't like you. I'm old and give out.  I'm proud of ye.
L513362 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Can we play ever' Saturday?
L513361 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I wadn't thinkin' about nothin' else just like you told me I'd do.
L513360 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It was fun, anyhow.
L513359 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ No sir.
L513358 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It don't matter to me about us losin' does it to you?
L513357 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You're strong though. You let me make them touchdowns so I'd feel good. My daddy used to do that kind of thing.
L513356 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Them boys was tryin' to pull me down pretty hard.
L513355 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I know you could of scored them three touchdowns by yourself instead of throwing 'em over to me.
L513353 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ We're liable to win if we keep this up. For somebody like you, you sure run fast.
L513352 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got a-hold of me there so I figured I better give it off to you. I seen you over there follerin' me.
L513351 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Way to go, Karl. We got a touchdown. That was a good lateral, man. That was just like the Wishbone.
L513350 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Yessir.
L513349 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ We'll be on teams, me and you?
L513348 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Yeah.
L513347 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You will? For sure?
L513346 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I'll play ball with ye. I reckon if neither one of us is no count it won't make no difference.
L513345 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Is that right?
L513344 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Bill Cox is goin' to a funeral for a Mister Turner tomorrow and a closin' up shop early.
L513343 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Make believin' always made me feel good too from time to time.
L513342 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I feel sad about Karen Cross, too. I just make like to myself she loves me. I know better, though. It just feels good to me when I imagine it.
L513341 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I don't reckon I know. I ain't found no way yet and I'm three or four times as old as you. Might be that's just the way folks is.
L513340 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Seems like Doyle's wormed his way back in. Mama said he's stayin' over tonight and he's talkin' about movin' in for good. We ain't ever gonna be happy. We'll always be nervous, won't we Karl?
L513339 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Readin' on this book on how to work carpentry. I aim to learn how to build things out of wood one of these times. I've always been partial to wood buildin's and cabinets and whatnot. These drawin's they got here don't make no sense to me so far.  You seem like yore tails a'draggin' a might. You got somethin' wrong with ye?
L513338 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What you readin'?
L513323 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I reckon.
L513322 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ She said she'd see me later. That's kinda good, right?
L513302 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Yes sir, I reckon it does.
L513301 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Bible says the same thing about killin' others, too.
L513300 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I've studied about it. The Bible says not to or you end up goin' to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.
L513299 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I didn't mean to say anything bad about you. I know you're good. You didn't mean no harm.  Did you ever think about killin' yourself on purpose like my daddy did?
L513298 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Hits been hard thinkin' about it. They ain't a day goes by I don't think about it. I kindly have a picture of it up in my head that I see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have bad thoughts on it. I wished they was somethin' I could of did, too. Shouldn't no bad things happen to childern. All the ol' bad things ort to be saved up for folks that's growed up, the way I see it. I shouldn't of told you about that. A boy ort not hear about such things. It just kindly come out.
L513297 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ That makes me feel real sad. Couldn't you have done somethin', Karl? I would have. I wish I would of had him. He'd be here right now. Livin'.
L513296 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I wadn't but six or eight. I reckon I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to care for no baby. Mama and Daddy didn't want him. They learned me to do what they told me to. These days I figure it might of been best to give him right back to the Good Lord right off the bat anyhow.
L513295 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ That don't seem right. It seems like you should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your brother.
L513294 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I heared it cryin' a little through that box.
L513293 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It was still alive when you buried it?
L513292 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I didn't feel right about doin' that. I takened a shoe box from there in the shed and emptied out some screwdrivers and nuts and warshers from it and put the little feller in that and buried him in the corner of the yard there. That seemed more proper to me, I reckon.
L513291 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You threw it in a trash barrel?
L513290 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ A little ol' boy.
L513289 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ A boy or girl?
L513288 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Yes sir. Right then it was.
L513287 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It was alive?
L513286 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. Hit was bloody-like around that towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel.
L513285 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ So it died when it come out?
L513284 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Hit was borned a little too early on. My mother and father made hit come too early some way or other. I reckon they changed their mind about havin' another'n. I was about six or eight year old then and they didn't care too much for me so I reckon they didn't need somethin' else to worry 'em with.
L513283 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Why?
L513282 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Yeah.
L513281 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Why not? It died?
L513280 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I had one there for little bit. Hit didn't get old enough to play with.
L513279 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ 'Cause it's fun. It don't matter if you ain't no good. It takes your mind off of everything else while you're doin' it. When you run real fast tryin' to make a touchdown you don't think about anything else. I ain't no good, but my daddy always said he was proud of me when I threw a ball or ran with it. Did you have any brothers and sisters growin' up to play with?
L513278 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Naw.
L513277 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ And then some people you don't like right off. It's funny.  You know why I want you to play ball with me?
L513276 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I don't reckon I know.
L513275 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You don't seem like a daddy. You seem like a brother.  Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know 'em like what happened with me and you.
L513274 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ He ain't no count.
L513273 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I kind of like you tellin' me what to do and not to do. Just like my daddy. I didn't mind him tellin' me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to do. Mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us. That we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her.
L513272 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ You ort not to pull on yourself that away.
L513271 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I didn't know till here while back a year or two ago when I spent the night with Ronnie Smart one time. He said just tug on your peter and think about your mama. I tried it, but I felt funny thinkin' about my mama. So, I switched over to thinkin' about his mama and then what he told me would happen, happened. It sure tingles, don't it?
L513270 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Yes sir. You ort not know that language.
L513269 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Oh, jackin' off?
L513268 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Pull on your works. Your privates.
L513267 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What do you mean?
L513266 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ That's real good. You ort not to if ye ain't married to somebody. Bible tells you that much. Hit tells some things that don't seem right too, I reckon. I guess a feller ort to foller it close as he can, though.  You don't touch yourself, do you?
L513265 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ And I don't try to touch her. You know, in a bad way. Foolin' around, sex and all.
L513264 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Naw.
