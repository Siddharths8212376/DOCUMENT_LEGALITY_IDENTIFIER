L198685 +++$+++ u5172 +++$+++ m342 +++$+++ NINA +++$+++ What are they?
L198684 +++$+++ u5164 +++$+++ m342 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ My days are not the old days, genius.
L198683 +++$+++ u5172 +++$+++ m342 +++$+++ NINA +++$+++ Is that what you used to do?
L198682 +++$+++ u5164 +++$+++ m342 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ In the old days, every man had a shaving mug that he kept at the barber shop.  Then, whenever he wanted a shave, held go down to the barber shop and there would be his mug, waiting for him.
L198450 +++$+++ u5172 +++$+++ m342 +++$+++ NINA +++$+++ Married.
L198449 +++$+++ u5164 +++$+++ m342 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What happened to the donut king?
L198448 +++$+++ u5172 +++$+++ m342 +++$+++ NINA +++$+++ Process server. Ma said it's like a lawyer only the hours are more regular.  All I know's he came to take the TV one afternoon and ended up staying for dinner.  And breakfast.
L198447 +++$+++ u5164 +++$+++ m342 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Sounds big.  What's he do?
L198446 +++$+++ u5172 +++$+++ m342 +++$+++ NINA +++$+++ Guess they're up.
L198444 +++$+++ u5164 +++$+++ m342 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Eddie did.
L198443 +++$+++ u5172 +++$+++ m342 +++$+++ NINA +++$+++ Did you break a cup, Jack?
L198420 +++$+++ u5164 +++$+++ m342 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ He's losing his teeth.
L198419 +++$+++ u5170 +++$+++ m342 +++$+++ MRS. BAKER +++$+++ Yes.  Right.  Eddie.  How is he?
L198418 +++$+++ u5164 +++$+++ m342 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Eddie.
L198417 +++$+++ u5170 +++$+++ m342 +++$+++ MRS. BAKER +++$+++ How's that dog of yours?  What was his name?
L198416 +++$+++ u5164 +++$+++ m342 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I'm not much for sweets.
L198415 +++$+++ u5170 +++$+++ m342 +++$+++ MRS. BAKER +++$+++ None?
L198414 +++$+++ u5164 +++$+++ m342 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Huh? Oh, no.
L198413 +++$+++ u5170 +++$+++ m342 +++$+++ MRS. BAKER +++$+++ Big piece or little?
L198412 +++$+++ u5170 +++$+++ m342 +++$+++ MRS. BAKER +++$+++ Oh, fine.
L198411 +++$+++ u5164 +++$+++ m342 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Fine.  You?
L198410 +++$+++ u5170 +++$+++ m342 +++$+++ MRS. BAKER +++$+++ So. How are you?
L198398 +++$+++ u5164 +++$+++ m342 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Good to see you, Ma.
L198397 +++$+++ u5170 +++$+++ m342 +++$+++ MRS. BAKER +++$+++ John.  It's good to see you.
L201015 +++$+++ u5191 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ WAXY +++$+++ He hit a guard.
L201014 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ What did he do?
L201013 +++$+++ u5191 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ WAXY +++$+++ They don't give two fucks about your health.  The Clinic's where they send the real hard-cases for attitude adjustment.  Look at O'Neill --
L201012 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ You mean if I get sick?
L201011 +++$+++ u5191 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ WAXY +++$+++ Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."
L201010 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ Don't they ever let us take these boots off?
L200849 +++$+++ u5191 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ WAXY +++$+++ You look great, Castor. Really.  Here -- I got a shot of your favorite -- Mescal.  Even has the worm.
L200848 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ Do I look wasted -- asshole?
L200847 +++$+++ u5191 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ WAXY +++$+++ They never should've voted against U.S. statehood -- the scumbags.  We heard you got wasted.
L200846 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ Waxy Wright.  Didn't Jon Archer bust you for poisoning five members of the Canadian parliament?
L200777 +++$+++ u5185 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ LAZARRO +++$+++ What do you expect us to do -- shut down the city, evacuate two million people on a hunch?
L200776 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ I don't care -- he's manipulating it.  That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere.
L200775 +++$+++ u5185 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ LAZARRO +++$+++ Jon, he's hooked up to a full-spectrum polygraph. No one has ever beaten --
L200774 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ He's lying.
L200740 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ Sorry, Admiral.  It wasn't mentioned in the job description.
L200739 +++$+++ u5185 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ LAZARRO +++$+++ Try to kiss my butt just once before I'm transferred.
L200738 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ ... Thanks.
L200737 +++$+++ u5185 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ LAZARRO +++$+++ I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say "thanks"?
L200736 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ Yeah, real fine.  Especially all the casualties.
L200735 +++$+++ u5185 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ LAZARRO +++$+++ Fine work, Jon.
L201130 +++$+++ u5187 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ SASHA +++$+++ You're not holding him right ... Caz ...
L201129 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ Yes ... someone might want to tear him apart -- snuff him out -- for revenge.
L201128 +++$+++ u5187 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ SASHA +++$+++ Five.  No one knows you're his father.  I thought someone might want to hurt him -- just to hurt you.
L201127 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ How old is he?
L201126 +++$+++ u5187 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ SASHA +++$+++ Go on, Adam ...  I'm not asking you for anything -- I was never even going to tell you. But hell, I never thought I'd see you again, either.
L201121 +++$+++ u5187 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ SASHA +++$+++ Of course he is ...  -- He's yours too.
L201120 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ Nice-looking kid.
L201119 +++$+++ u5187 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ SASHA +++$+++ Should be.  It's yours.
L201118 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ Perfect fit.
L201114 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ I'm not the same person you remember.
L201113 +++$+++ u5187 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ SASHA +++$+++ Like I had a choice with that anal-retentive Jon Archer rising my ass at the probation hearing.  At least he took an interest. You took off without leaving so much as a Post-it.
L201112 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ I hear you're a manicurist now -- got your own business and everything.  I'm glad you've stayed clean.
L201111 +++$+++ u5187 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ SASHA +++$+++ Better than you bleeding all over my car upholstery. Trust me, Caz, you won't be here long.
L201110 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ You shouldn't have brought me here ... it's dangerous.
L201109 +++$+++ u5187 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ SASHA +++$+++ My place.
L201108 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ Where am I?
L201093 +++$+++ u5187 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ SASHA +++$+++ The last time I took orders from you I ended up with five years probation.
L201092 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ Drive.
L201091 +++$+++ u5187 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ SASHA +++$+++ Jesus Christ, Castor.
L201090 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ Yeah -- me.
L201089 +++$+++ u5187 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ SASHA +++$+++ Uh-oh, somebody's in trouble.
L201151 +++$+++ u5180 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ DIETRICH +++$+++ Right ... like Jon Archer would ever let that happen.
L201150 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ Or reactivated the first one.
L201149 +++$+++ u5180 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ DIETRICH +++$+++ He's your brother, you figure it out.  Maybe he made another bomb.
L201148 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ Why would he need more?
L201147 +++$+++ u5180 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ DIETRICH +++$+++ Yes.  Pollux bought one along with the original batch.  Obviously, he found a way to make more.
L201146 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ And this thing can grow it?
L200893 +++$+++ u5186 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ POLLUX +++$+++ "Thanks?"  I guess they really did fuck you up.
L200892 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ For being one helluva guy.
L200891 +++$+++ u5186 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ POLLUX +++$+++ For what?
L200890 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ Thanks, Pollux.
L200888 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ Being stuck in this rat-hole when it blows.  Bro, what you built was a work of art. That little fucker belongs in the Smithsonian.
L200887 +++$+++ u5186 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ POLLUX +++$+++ What's worse than losing five million bucks?
L200886 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ That's not the worst part.
L200883 +++$+++ u5186 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ POLLUX +++$+++ Only one you've never broken.
L200882 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ And I bet I've kept that promise ...
L200881 +++$+++ u5186 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ POLLUX +++$+++ After that.  You promised you'd always take care of me.
L200880 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ Uh -- to kill the doctors?
L200879 +++$+++ u5186 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ POLLUX +++$+++ Retching and convulsing while those bastards didn't even try to save her sorry ass.  You gave her mouth to mouth -- man -- even then you had some constitution.
L200878 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ Oh, God -- Mom OD'd at County General.
L200876 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ Like ...
L200875 +++$+++ u5186 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ POLLUX +++$+++ A few blanks?  Like what?
L200874 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ I don't know.  Everything's jumbled -- so you're going to have to help me fill in a few blanks.
L200873 +++$+++ u5186 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ POLLUX +++$+++ You porked his wife the day he was arrested.  How could you forget that?
L200872 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ Do you know what it is to be in a coma?  It fucks up everything -- including your memory! I can't even tell you why Dobbs jumped me yesterday!
L200871 +++$+++ u5186 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ POLLUX +++$+++ Let me have a look.
L200870 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ I was in a coma, Pollux. I still feel like shit.
L200869 +++$+++ u5186 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ POLLUX +++$+++ You shoot hoops like a chick, you smoke like a wuss, and -- I don't know -- you're different.
L200868 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ What do you mean?
L200867 +++$+++ u5186 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ POLLUX +++$+++ So?  The procnias averano is a South American bird.  The flight here was only three hours!  And yesterday a European swallow flew by! Where the fuck are we?
L200866 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ So?
L200865 +++$+++ u5186 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ POLLUX +++$+++ Shut up.
L200864 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ Pollux ...
L200859 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ They haven't found it yet -- Listen, Pollux ...
L200858 +++$+++ u5186 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ POLLUX +++$+++ You're not my brother.  The brother I knew would never have been caught by that dumb fuck Archer.  At least tell me the bomb is still going off.
L200857 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ Hey, bro ...
L201266 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Damn right.
L201265 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ Would it?
L201264 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I started wondering -- if you couldn't switch back -- would it make a difference?
L201259 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ That's what they always say.
L201258 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
L201257 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ How is he?
L201204 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ Eve ...
L201203 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Jon, if I'm not there, he will be tipped off.  I'll get rid of Jamie -- but you and I are in this together.
L201202 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ I know Lazarro -- the first person she'd call is "me." We can't take the chance of tipping Castor off.
L201201 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Can't we call someone? Admiral Lazarro?
L201200 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ The bomb.  He's reactivated it.  And everyone there is going to die.
L201199 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Jon, what is it?
L201198 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ You can't go.  You can't be anywhere near that place.
L201197 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ -- Or maybe all at once.  There's a get-together tonight at New St. Marks. For all the bureau chiefs and their families.  He's insisted Jamie and I be there too.
L201196 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ He's going to kill off our bureau chiefs -- one-by-one.
L201195 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ What do you mean?
L201194 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ Our Pacific Rim stations. These numbers must be bounties. Castor's not wasting any time.
L201193 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ He freaked out when he thought I had seen this stuff.  I think it's a list of cities -- Santiago, Ho Chi Minh City, Nandi ...
L201191 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ Whatever happened, whatever he did -- I know it's my fault and I know I can never make it up to you --
L201190 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Christ, Jon!  How could you do this to yourself? How could you do this to us?  Do you know -- do you know what he did to me ...?
L201188 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Tell me what happened on April 9th -- 13 years ago.
L201187 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ What more proof do you need?
L201186 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's already dead.
L201185 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ Why point it at me?  I'm the real thing.
L201184 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I took it from my fake husband.
L201171 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ An NSA surgeon gave me Castor's face.  He handled the transplant, the vocal implant, everything.  But somehow Castor came out of his coma -- and killed everyone who knew about the mission. But not before he was transformed into me.
L201170 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ How did he expect to do that?
L201169 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ -- I called, but I'm not Castor.  I'm your husband.
L201168 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I know you -- you're the one who called.  You're Castor Troy.  You killed my son --
L201086 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ Don't hang up ...
L201085 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Whoever you are, don't call again.
L201084 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ Think about it, Eve! Everything he's done recently has been peculiar, right?  He's said and done things your husband would never do ...
L201083 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Okay, you're having an emotional crisis.  You need to seek the help of a trained --
L201082 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ Never mind that!  Just take Jamie and get out of that house.  Don't tell anyone where you're going -- especially not him -- just GO.
L201081 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Who is this?
L201079 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ Eve, listen carefully.  The man you think is your husband -- isn't.
L201078 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Is someone there?
L200809 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ You want me to tell you it's okay to leave?  Okay, go on!  GO!
L200808 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ I can't tell you ... except only I can do it.
L200807 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ You said you'd be here! You promised me -- you promised Jamie!  What could be more important than that?
L200806 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ One last time.  It's important ...
L200805 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ What are you saying?  Oh, God -- you're going on assignment again ...
L200803 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ And you wouldn't be.
L200802 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ Five years ... I still can't get it out of my head -- an inch to the left, Matty would still be alive.
L200801 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I don't know ...  Maybe because you've never needed my help.
L200800 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ How come?
L200799 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ No.
L200798 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ Were you there to catch me?
L200797 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Totally -- you were being very, very bad.  You went up in the plane and jumped out.  You had a parachute, but it didn't open.
L200796 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ So you had a nightmare.
L200795 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother.
L200794 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ Must've been after we got engaged.
L200793 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ We were back in high school. You wanted to join the sky diving team, but I wouldn't let you.
L200792 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ Something good?
L200791 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ ... I was dreaming ...
L200758 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ So is finishing my residency and passing my boards ...
L200757 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ It's important.
L200756 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ I'm late for surgery.
L200755 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ We need to talk.
L200754 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Jon ... we just remember how it used to be.  You staying for a while or is this just a piss-stop?
L200753 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ Is that what you think?
L200752 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ She's only 12.  Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying "I love you."
L200751 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
L200750 +++$+++ u5182 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ EVE +++$+++ Well, you tried.  You failed miserably, but you tried.
L200833 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ Just make sure you're there.  On time.
L200832 +++$+++ u5188 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ TITO +++$+++ This is it, Jon.  For the next 72 hours -- you're on your own.
L200831 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ Call Lazarro.  Castor just came out of his coma.
L200830 +++$+++ u5188 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ TITO +++$+++ Now what?
L200818 +++$+++ u5188 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ TITO +++$+++ Either way, come Saturday morning -- I'm pulling you the hell out of there.
L200817 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ Don't worry.  I've done my homework.  I'll get Pollux to talk.
L200816 +++$+++ u5188 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ TITO +++$+++ You haven't got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24-hour hard-on.  He's nothing like you.
L200815 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ She doesn't know -- and she never will.
L200814 +++$+++ u5188 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ TITO +++$+++ Jon, this is goddam insane. You can't go through with it.  What about Eve?
L200783 +++$+++ u5188 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ TITO +++$+++ The left, I think.  Those surgeons in Witness Protection can fix things nobody's even broken yet.

L200780 +++$+++ u5177 +++$+++ m343 +++$+++ ARCHER +++$+++ He'd see that a mile away.  The only person he'd talk to about that bomb is his brother.  Unfortunately, turnips can't talk.
