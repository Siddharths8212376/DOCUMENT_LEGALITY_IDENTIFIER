L586 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ No, I ' m not.
L585 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
L584 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
L583 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
L500 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
L499 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You told me that part already.
L433 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ It's her favorite band.
L432 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Assail your ears for one night.
L425 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Okay!  I wasn't sure
L424 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ He's pretty!
L419 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Dead at forty-one.
L418 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Her favorite uncle
L417 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ It's a lung cancer issue
L416 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Number one.  She hates smokers
L391 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.
L390 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Will Bogey get bent?
L389 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
L388 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
L245 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
L244 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ You got him involved?
L225 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.
L224 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ I thought you hated those people.
L223 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.
L222 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ That's what I just said
L221 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
L220 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
L219 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
L218 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
L217 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
L216 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ He seems like he thrives on danger
L215 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ What makes you think he'll do it?
L213 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You wanna go out with him?
L212 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ What about him?
L211 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?
L210 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.
L159 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
L158 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ That's her?  Bianca's sister?
L157 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.
L147 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You could consecrate with her, my friend.
L146 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
L145 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
L144 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
L143 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You know French?
L142 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
L141 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ He always have that shit-eating grin?
L140 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
L139 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
L92 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility.
L91 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Why not?
L90 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
L89 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Who is she?
L88 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You burn, you pine, you perish?
L87 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ That girl -- I --
L78 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
L77 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ That I'm used to.
L74 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Couple thousand. Most of them evil
L73 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ How many people go here?
L72 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Get out!
L71 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Thirty-two.
L70 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ How many people were in your old school?
L69 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
L68 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I was kidding. People actually live there?
L67 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ North, actually.  How'd you   ?
L66 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ So -- which Dakota you from?
L65 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the tour.
L64 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ So they tell me...
L63 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ You the new guy?
L781 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ You get the girl.
L780 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ What's the worst?
L745 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Where?
L744 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ She kissed me.
L743 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ You makin' any headway?
L741 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
L740 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote
L726 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
L725 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ What'd you do to her?
L625 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Then, go get her
L624 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Sure
L623 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Cameron -- do you like the girl?
L622 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ She's partial to Joey, not me
L621 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ What 're you talking about?
L620 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ It's off. The whole thing.
L619 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Cameron, I'm a little busy
L431 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Don't make me do it, man
L430 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
L427 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
L426 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion".
L412 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
L411 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ What've you got for me?
L386 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Yeah -- we'll see.
L385 +++$+++ u2 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ CAMERON +++$+++ And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
L558 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ And why would I do that?
L557 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Leave my sister alone.
L556 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Your sister here?
L555 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Away.
L554 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Where ya goin?
L336 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Not at all
L335 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Hey -- do you mind?
L150 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ They're running the rest of me next month.
L149 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
L148 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?
L748 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
L747 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --
L609 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Get her to act like a human
L608 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Do what?
L607 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ How'd you do it?
L606 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ A deal's a deal.
L605 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ It's about time.
L358 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Forget her sister, then.
L357 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Forget it.
L356 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ A hundred bucks a date.
L355 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ What?
L354 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I just upped my price
L352 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
L351 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
L350 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I'm on it
L349 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ When I shell out fifty, I expect results.
L301 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Fifty, and you've got your man.
L300 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.
L299 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Fine, thirty.
L298 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
L297 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ How much?
L296 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
L295 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
L294 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.
L292 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
L291 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ You need money to take a girl out
L290 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ You just said
L289 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
L288 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
L287 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Two legs, nice rack...
L286 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ What do you think?
L285 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Yeah
L509 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
L508 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested.
L505 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ What?  We took bathes together when we were kids.
L504 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ You and Verona?
L503 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
L502 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ I hear you're helpin' Verona.
L240 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ So what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her.  Someone who's up for the job.
L239 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Does this conversation have a purpose?
L238 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?
L236 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ We're not.
L235 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
L234 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ We don't chat.
L233 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Nope - just came by to chat
L232 +++$+++ u4 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Are you lost?
L231 +++$+++ u7 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Hey.
L949 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
L948 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ William - he asked me to meet him here.
L947 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Who?
L946 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ Have you seen him?
L755 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
L754 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
L753 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
L752 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
L751 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
L750 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?
L721 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.
L720 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ You didn't
L719 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
L718 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
L717 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I didn't have a choice.
L716 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.
L491 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Who cares?
L490 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ What'd he say?
L448 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ No fear.
L447 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ You think this'll work?
L254 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ If I was Bianca, it would be, "Any school you want, precious.  Don't forget your tiara."
L253 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ Does it matter?
L252 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming.  Do you mind?
L251 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Neither has his heterosexuality.
L250 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ That's never been proven
L249 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ William didn't even go to high school
L248 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ William would never have gone to a state school.
L247 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.
L152 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.
L151 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
L134 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
L133 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.
L132 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ An attempted slit.
L131 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ What's this?
L130 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ Just a little.
L129 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.
L128 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Block E?
L127 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ He always look so
L126 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
L125 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.
L124 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Patrick Verona   Random skid.
L123 +++$+++ u6 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ MANDELLA +++$+++ Who's that?
L1043 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Don ' t you even dare. . .
L1042 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
L1041 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Because I like to torture you.
L1040 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
L1035 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.
L1034 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ Is that right?
L1033 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.
L1032 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
L1031 +++$+++ u5 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ KAT +++$+++ A Fender Strat. You bought this?
L977 +++$+++ u9 +++$+++ m0 +++$+++ PATRICK +++$+++ I didn't care about the money.
