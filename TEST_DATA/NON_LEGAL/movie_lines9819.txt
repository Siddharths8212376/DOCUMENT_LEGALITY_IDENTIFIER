L212498 +++$+++ u5262 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Would that be a problem?
L212497 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ Why don't you cut the shit and ask if you can stay at my place?
L212496 +++$+++ u5262 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No, I...
L212495 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ You called me so you could have a place to stay.
L212494 +++$+++ u5262 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Huh?
L212493 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ We're on our third pitcher of beer. Just ask me.
L212492 +++$+++ u5262 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I don't follow...
L212491 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ So, you called me up, because you just wanted to have a drink before you... go find a hotel?
L212490 +++$+++ u5262 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah.
L212489 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ A hotel?
L212488 +++$+++ u5262 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ God, it's late.  I should find a hotel...
L212487 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ Do what you like.
L212486 +++$+++ u5262 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Don't I?
L212485 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ The things you own, they end up owning you.
L212484 +++$+++ u5262 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Well, I have to file a claim...
L212483 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You'll be occupied for weeks.
L212482 +++$+++ u5262 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I don't... think so.
L212481 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ The "now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again" list.  That list.
L212480 +++$+++ u5262 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What list?
L212479 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
L212478 +++$+++ u5262 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Insurance'll cover it.
L212477 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ Delivered from bullshit colors like "Cobalt," "Ebony," and "Fuchsia."
L212476 +++$+++ u5262 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Delivered from Martha Stewart.
L212475 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ Delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns.
L212474 +++$+++ u5262 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Delivered from Swedish furniture.
L212473 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ But maybe, just maybe, you've been delivered.
L212472 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ I mean, you did lose a lot of nice, neat little shit.  The trendy paper lamps, the Euro-trash shelving unit, am I right?
L212471 +++$+++ u5262 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ ...no ...no ...
L212470 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
L212469 +++$+++ u5262 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ There's always that.
L212468 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ Could be worse.  A woman could cut off your penis while you're asleep and toss it out the window of a moving car.
L212467 +++$+++ u5262 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ All gone.
L212466 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ And, now it's gone.
L212465 +++$+++ u5262 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I guess so.
L212464 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ This is how we fill up our lives.
L212463 +++$+++ u5262 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You buy furniture.  You tell yourself: this is the last sofa I'll ever need.  No matter what else happens, I've got the sofa issue handled.  Then, the right set of dishes.  The right dinette.
L212428 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ Keep it up, then.  Keep it right up.
L212427 +++$+++ u5262 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Well, uh... great.
L212426 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ Being clever.
L212425 +++$+++ u5262 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What?
L212424 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ How's that working out for you?
L212423 +++$+++ u5262 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Thank you.
L212422 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ The spork.  I get it.  You're very clever.
L212421 +++$+++ u5262 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You see, when you travel, everything is small, self-contained--
L212414 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ Why?  So you can say, "Oh, that's what you do." -- And be a smug little shit about it?
L212413 +++$+++ u5262 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I mean -- for a living.
L212412 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ What do you want me to do?
L212411 +++$+++ u5262 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What do you do, Tyler?
L212408 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ Oxygen gets you high.  In a catastrophic emergency, we're taking giant, panicked breaths...
L212407 +++$+++ u5262 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No, supply oxygen?
L212406 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ You know why they have oxygen masks on planes?
L212405 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ Tyler Durden.
L212404 +++$+++ u5262 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ This is how I met --
L212403 +++$+++ u5262 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Pardon me?
L212402 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ Two, equal parts gasoline and diet cola.  Three, dissolve kitty-litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick.
L212221 +++$+++ u5262 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Somehow, I realize all of this -- the gun, the bombs, the revolution -- is really about Marla Singer.
L212220 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ Look what we've accomplised.  Thirty seconds.
L212219 +++$+++ u5262 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ We have front row seats for this Theater of Mass Destruction.  The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns of ten buildings with blasting gelatin.  In two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges, and those buildings will be reduced to smoldering rubble.  I know this because Tyler knows this.
L212218 +++$+++ u5262 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ That old saying, how you always hurt the one you love, well, it works both way.
L212217 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ It's getting exciting now.
L212213 +++$+++ u5262 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ ... i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
L212212 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ One minute.  This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
L213312 +++$+++ u5271 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Well, sir, you said you might.
L213311 +++$+++ u5262 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?!
L213310 +++$+++ u5271 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ You told me you'd say that, too.
L213309 +++$+++ u5262 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Abort the plan.
L213308 +++$+++ u5271 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ You told me you'd say that.
L213307 +++$+++ u5262 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...
L213306 +++$+++ u5271 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Don't worry about us, sir.  We're solid.
L213305 +++$+++ u5262 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Excuse me?
L213304 +++$+++ u5271 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Very good, Sir.
L213303 +++$+++ u5262 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Listen, something is going to happen, something terrible...
L213302 +++$+++ u5271 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Maintenance.
L213301 +++$+++ u5262 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Who is this?
L213177 +++$+++ u5262 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No!
L213176 +++$+++ u5267 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ His name is Robert Paulson!
L213171 +++$+++ u5262 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Robert Paulson is dead.  He's dead, because of you...
L213170 +++$+++ u5267 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Robert Paulson?
L213169 +++$+++ u5262 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No!  Wrong!  This man's name is Robert Paulson.
L213168 +++$+++ u5267 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names.
L213167 +++$+++ u5262 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No, no.  This is a man -- this man has a name...
L213166 +++$+++ u5267 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ But, this is Project Mayhem.
L213165 +++$+++ u5262 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What he wanted?  Look... look at him. Look at him!  What does he want?  This is a person.  This is not a cog in your machine...
L213164 +++$+++ u5267 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ It's what he would have wanted, sir.
L212937 +++$+++ u5264 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Let go of me!!
L212936 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ Thank you.  Thank you, sir...
L212935 +++$+++ u5264 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Alright, Christ!  Fucking let me go!
L212934 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ We need some towels, Lou.  We need replacement light bulbs.
L212933 +++$+++ u5264 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Okay!  Okay, fuck it!  Use the basement!  Get off me!
L212932 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ Pleeeeeease!
L212931 +++$+++ u5264 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ What are you doing?!
L212923 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ You and your friend.
L212922 +++$+++ u5264 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Did you hear what I just said?!
L212921 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ You're welcome to join our club.
L212920 +++$+++ u5264 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Look, stupid fuck, I want everyone outta here now!
L212919 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ Yes, it is.
L212918 +++$+++ u5264 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Ain't that something?
L212917 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ It's free to all.
L212916 +++$+++ u5264 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Really?
L212915 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ There is no money.
L212914 +++$+++ u5264 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ He don't own this place, I do.  How much money's he getting for this?
L212913 +++$+++ u5264 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Irvine?  Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone.
L212912 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
L212911 +++$+++ u5264 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ LOU +++$+++ Who told you motherfuckers you could use my place?
L212986 +++$+++ u5266 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ No, please, no, God, no!
L212985 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ Would you rather be dead?
L212984 +++$+++ u5266 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Too much school.
L212983 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ Stuff.  That means you have to get more schooling.
L212982 +++$+++ u5266 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Yeah ... animals and s-s-s ---
L212981 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ Animals.
L212977 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ What did you want to be, Raymond K. Hessel?
L212976 +++$+++ u5266 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ I... I don't know...
L212975 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ Why?
L212974 +++$+++ u5266 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Biology, mostly.
L212971 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ "Stuff."  Were the mid-terms hard?
L212970 +++$+++ u5266 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ S-S-Stuff.
L212967 +++$+++ u5266 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Please, God, no...
L212966 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ Your mom and dad will have to call kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up your dental records, because there won't be much left of your face.
L212965 +++$+++ u5266 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Yesssss...
L212964 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ Is this a picture of Mom and Dad?
L212963 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ They give basement apartments letters instead of numbers.  Raymond, you're going to die.
L212962 +++$+++ u5266 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ How'd you know?
L212961 +++$+++ u5269 +++$+++ m348 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ Raymond K. Hessel. 1320 SE Benning, apartment A.  A small, cramped basement apartment.
L215510 +++$+++ u5273 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ I have to save Eugene!
L215509 +++$+++ u5281 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ No!  It can't be.
L215500 +++$+++ u5281 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ I was dead.  And came back to life. An EEG machine.  Where's Eugene?
L215499 +++$+++ u5273 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ What did you see?
L215464 +++$+++ u5281 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Yeah, fuck 'em.  No offense.
L215463 +++$+++ u5273 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ Speed up.
L215462 +++$+++ u5281 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ What do you want me to do?
L215452 +++$+++ u5281 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Yes.  I was in a hospital.  There was screaming... A nurse was choking me.  I couldn't tell what she looked like, but the name tag was right in my face.  Kalarjian.
L215451 +++$+++ u5273 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ Another premonition?
L215450 +++$+++ u5281 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ No, it's not here.  This one was different.  More like the pile up and the van going into the lake.
L215449 +++$+++ u5273 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ What did you see?  What am I looking for?
L215441 +++$+++ u5273 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ I don't think so.  Alex's premonitions happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we tried to change it.
L215440 +++$+++ u5281 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ This makes no sense.  Isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake.  Could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested?
L215431 +++$+++ u5281 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ And when it was Rory's turn to die, and Thomas was in the way?
L215430 +++$+++ u5273 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ Six duds in a row.
L215429 +++$+++ u5281 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
L215428 +++$+++ u5273 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ Are you crazy?  What makes you think you'd survive?
L215427 +++$+++ u5281 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ No.  If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me.  But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive.  I'm last on Death's list.
L215426 +++$+++ u5273 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ What are you doing?  You're going to kill us!
L215416 +++$+++ u5273 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ How you doing in there, hero?
L215415 +++$+++ u5281 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ What about that?
L215205 +++$+++ u5273 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ So let's do it.
L215204 +++$+++ u5281 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ So if you give us the pregnant lady's number, we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby.
L215203 +++$+++ u5273 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ Please, what else could it mean?
L215198 +++$+++ u5273 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ Then it wasn't just a sign. It was a premonition?
L215197 +++$+++ u5281 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ I can practically taste the water in my throat.  And something else.  The smell of flowers...
L215196 +++$+++ u5273 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ You were there?
L215195 +++$+++ u5281 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ I was driving a white van.  It must've gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and I drowned.  It was...horrible.
L215193 +++$+++ u5281 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ I...I...
L215192 +++$+++ u5273 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ You have to tell us now.
L215159 +++$+++ u5273 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ I hope you're ready for this.
L215158 +++$+++ u5281 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ The second one just dies.  A 16 year old kid.
L215118 +++$+++ u5281 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ How can you say that?  What kind of monster are you?
L215117 +++$+++ u5273 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ I didn't beat it; I hid from it. If you were smart you'd put a down payment on a burial plot and say goodbye to the dog, because what little life you have left is over as you know it.  Don't make new friends, don't fall in love, and don't ever bother trying to save others.  That's the worst killer of them all.
L215115 +++$+++ u5273 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ That's what Alex used to ask himself right up until...
L215114 +++$+++ u5281 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ The songs on the radio.  But wait.  I don't understand.  Why is this even happening to me?
L215113 +++$+++ u5273 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ If you have the same power as Alex, you'll be seeing signs soon.  When you see anything creepy or ominous, an in-your-face irony kinda thing? Don't ignore it.  It usually means the difference between life and death.
L215112 +++$+++ u5281 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Signs?
L215111 +++$+++ u5273 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ That's good.  Get all your tears out now, you'll need your eyes.  For the signs.
L215107 +++$+++ u5281 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ That still doesn't make sense.  You said you die in the same order you were originally meant to.  But Evan Shaeffer died last in my premonition, not first.
L215106 +++$+++ u5273 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ Congratufuckinglations.  That makes you last to go.  But don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you.  Always does.
L215105 +++$+++ u5281 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Officer Burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends.
L215103 +++$+++ u5281 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ Exact order?  Then I'm next!  I was meant to die with my friends, so I'm next!
L215102 +++$+++ u5273 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ The survivors of Flight 180 died in the exact order they were originally meant to die in the plane crash. That was Death's original design.
L215101 +++$+++ u5273 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ Death's list.  The precise order you're going to die in.
L215100 +++$+++ u5281 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ What list?
L215099 +++$+++ u5273 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ Well, if you put them on the list, they're already tits up.
L215098 +++$+++ u5281 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ It's not just about me.  Someone I saved died last night in a freak accident.  What if the others are in danger, too?
L215097 +++$+++ u5273 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ Nice work.  Maybe if you're real lucky, you'll wind up in here with me.  But I doubt you'll survive that long.
L215096 +++$+++ u5281 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up... I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.
L215095 +++$+++ u5273 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ Yeah, how?
L215094 +++$+++ u5281 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ KIMBERLY +++$+++ I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.
L215093 +++$+++ u5273 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ Kimberly Burroughs, eh?  What do you want?
L215494 +++$+++ u5273 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ She had the baby?
L215493 +++$+++ u5287 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ Don't sweat it.  It's over.
L215492 +++$+++ u5273 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ A guard grabbed me before I could find Eugene.
L215443 +++$+++ u5273 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ If only Alex and I had done that with the others, Alex might still be...
L215442 +++$+++ u5287 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ Then the only way to survive is to get to the hospital and protect Eugene and Isabella for as long as we can.
L215221 +++$+++ u5273 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ We need to hurry.
L215220 +++$+++ u5287 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ Here we go.  The vehicle's a delivery van registered to Jorge and Isabella Cruz.  And Christ, there's almost a dozen domestic disturbance complaints on these two.
L215215 +++$+++ u5287 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ THOMAS +++$+++ Taken care of.

L215376 +++$+++ u5273 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ That's why Death is working backwards. It's tying up all the loose ends, sealing the rift once and for all This chapter of the screenplay contains scene that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie. In order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay, it has not been edited.

L215374 +++$+++ u5273 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ CLEAR +++$+++ Being alive after our time caused an outward ripple - a rift in Death's design.
L215373 +++$+++ u5276 +++$+++ m349 +++$+++ EUGENE +++$+++ I'm not sure I understand.
