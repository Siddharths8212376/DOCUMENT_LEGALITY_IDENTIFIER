L233408 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ You don't open an account, Leo, you put it in a safe deposit box. Dip in whenever you want.
L233407 +++$+++ u1079 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ They report it to the IRS.
L233406 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?
L233405 +++$+++ u1079 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ LEO +++$+++ I didn't know where else to keep it.  Where would you?
L233404 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ I wouldn't think you're that dumb, leave over three hundred grand in the closet, underneath the extra blanket, but I guess you are.
L233008 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ I know who he works for. Where's your phone.
L233007 +++$+++ u1080 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ Mr. Barboni is a good customer.  Works for Jimmy Capp.
L233006 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Lemme get this straight. You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new one? Is that what you're telling me?
L233005 +++$+++ u1080 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ We call you a taxi.
L232997 +++$+++ u1080 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ Maybe you don't see my sign?
L232996 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine.
L232995 +++$+++ u1080 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ It's not one of these?
L234145 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Couldn't find my toothbrush.
L234144 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ What took you so long?
L234110 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Go get your stuff.
L234109 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ I'll be right back.
L234108 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ I was scared then, not now. How long you want me to be scared?
L234107 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You don't act like it?
L234106 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ You bet.
L234105 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Were you scared up there?
L234102 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Oh, shit... I'm sorry... I thought that was... I'm so sorry...
L234101 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Karen! What the fuck are you doing?!
L234072 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for Christ's sake.
L234071 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ You okay?
L234024 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ I'll go. I'll go.
L234023 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You're as bad as Harry...
L234022 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ I don't know.
L234021 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Are you going down?
L234020 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ It's not Dave. It's a movie.
L234019 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.
L234018 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ You sure?
L233981 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Yeah, Harry, you look like you belong in one of your horror movies.
L233980 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Harry, what're you doing? You're supposed to be in the hospital.
L233979 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Because a movie star can never order straight from the menu. They have to think of something they have to have that isn't on the menu.
L233978 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Why not?
L233977 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Continental, but it doesn't matter. Martin won't order from the menu.
L233976 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ What kinda food they serve at this Ivy place anyway?
L233931 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ What happened?
L233930 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Harry... My God...
L233925 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Hey, Chili? Look at me.
L233924 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ I mean I could see myself in movies Robert De Niro had been in. Or I could maybe do an Al Pacino movie, play a hard-on. But I couldn't see myself in ones, like say the one where the three guys get stuck with a baby. They don't know how to take care of it and you see these big grown-up assholes acting cute -–
L233923 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Whichever. Let's talk about it tomorrow.
L233922 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ You don't mean a movie star? More like a character actor?
L233921 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Oh.
L233920 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general.
L233919 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ You thought I was faking?
L233918 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I think you could be an actor. I know you're acting sometimes, but you don't show it.
L233917 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Really.
L233916 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
L233915 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Yeah?
L233914 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ That's a different story. I'm still working on that one, you know, getting the visual fabric just right.  Although I've added to it.
L233913 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ How 'bout Chili's Hollywood Adventure.
L233912 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
L233911 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?
L233910 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ For starters, Marty wasn't Martin back then.
L233909 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Oh, I like him. I just think he's... short. I mean, he's a good actor and all, but I'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in Marty.
L233908 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You don't like Martin much, do you?
L233907 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together.
L233906 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
L233905 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ How'd you meet Martin anyway?
L233904 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Definitely not Martin. Movie stars never pick up the check. They have no idea what things cost. Most of them don't know their zip code and a lot don't even know their own phone number.
L233903 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Depends, who pays?
L233902 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ That was Martin. He wants to have lunch tomorrow. That is, if you can make it.
L233709 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ The guy's setting you up. You pulled out of their Freaks deal so he's paying you back.
L233708 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ A locker at the airport? Jesus Christ, Harry. Tell me you're not really that stupid.
L233664 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Yeah. We understand you read the script and like it... a lot.
L233663 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Well actually, Martin the movie we came to talk about is Mr. Lovejoy.
L233574 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You were supposed to wait for me with Harry at the restaurant.
L233573 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ This thing's actually accurate. I bought it for ten bucks from a kid in a lawn chair on Sunset...
L233525 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Yeah well... I like movies. I figure if I help Harry make one, I'll find out what you have to do outside of have an idea and raise the money. That doesn't sound too hard. I was in the money business and I get ideas all the time.
L233524 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ And you think the movie business is any different?
L233523 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ I was never much into it. All that bullshit having to do with respect. It's bad enough having to treat those guys like they're your heroes, having to smile when they make some stupid remark they think's real funny.
L233522 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Yesterday, you were a loan shark.
L233521 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Why does anyone want to be in movies?
L233520 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I want to know.
L233519 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ That why you came over here, to ask me that?
L233518 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ What do you get out of it?
L233517 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Sounds fair.
L233516 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I don't want to act in it, I want to produce it with Harry. Especially if I help him get Martin.
L233515 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ There a part in it for you?
L233514 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You and Harry'll make a great team.  I'm gonna make a deal with him.
L233513 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Not yet.
L233512 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Then you've read it?
L233511 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name.
L233510 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I think it's not horrible.
L233509 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ What do you think?
L233508 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
L233507 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ I got you a copy of the script.
L233505 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I just caught the end.
L233504 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ You been here the whole time?
L233397 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Yeah. Right.  Listen, "Touch of Evil"'s playing near my hotel. You wanna go check it out? Watch Charlton Heston play a Mexican?
L233396 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Right. See how your story ends.
L233395 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Well, I gotta have a talk with Leo, my runaway dry cleaner.
L233394 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Don't go out of your way.
L233393 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you.
L233392 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Yeah, well Martin is known for his flipping. He flips over a script, and when the time comes to make a deal, he flips out.
L233391 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Harry told me Martin loves it, he flipped.
L233390 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Harry's dreaming of a forty-million- dollar production he'll never get off the ground with a star he'll never sign. With or without my help.
L233389 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie?
L233388 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ He must mean after "Slime Creature 3".
L233387 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
L233386 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I married Martin. That was a full- time job.
L233385 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ How come you stopped making movies with Harry?
L233381 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Yeah, you know when Bette comes up to the guy on the porch, gives him a flirty look and says, 'I'd kiss you, but...'
L233380 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ "Cotton".
L233379 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Yeah. It's a real gift.  I'm just saying it'd be nice, one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line. You know, like in that Bette Davis picture, "Cabin in the..."
L233378 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Man, can you scream.
L233377 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I know I'm better than what I've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream.
L233376 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ For any movie.
L233375 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Yeah... that was a good scene. I mean, for a horror movie.
L233374 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Yeah. When you turn to the camera to tell the alien mother that her time on earth is finished... when you give us all that look, Joan Crawford wishes on her best day she had that much presence. Not even in "Mildred Pierce" -– which by the way was a better book than a movie -– did Crawford even touch the intensity you had in that look.
L233373 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You saw that one?
L233372 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Like in "Bride of the Mutant", when you played the whole end with that torn top.
L233371 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ ...That's what we finally decided.
L233370 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.
L233369 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I spent all day crawling out of a grave. The costumer kept bitching 'cause I was ripping my nylons –-
L233368 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Rough day on the set?
L233367 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Yeah, well make sure you lock it on the way out.
L233366 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ No, no... you left the patio door open. You gotta stop doin' that, all the nice things you got around here.
L233365 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Lemme get this straight, you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before?
L233364 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ I wanted to come by, apologize for coming into your house like I did last night.
L233363 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ What're you doing here?
L233362 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Hey... Karen. How ya' doin'?
L233179 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ How much is the wife offered?
L233178 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ A couple days ago by, people from the airliner come to see his wife, tell her how sorry they are and all that their plane exploded and offer her a settlement, the amount based on what he would've earned operating the dry cleaner's the rest of his life. Leo had some kind of trouble with his kidneys, so they were giving him about ten years.
L233174 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ A real bargain.
L233173 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ A hundred and fifty-six. Some'll charge you more'n that, go as high as six for five on a short-term loan. So three a week's not too bad.
L233172 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ But a week. That's a hundred and fifty percent a year.
L233171 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ That's right. Three percent.
L233170 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ The interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand?
L233156 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I know what a vig is.
L233155 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Well, basically, this guy owes a shylock fifteen thousand, plus he's a few weeks behind on the vig, the interest you have to pay.
L233151 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ What if it was?
L233150 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ No, it was open. It wasn't locked.
L233149 +++$+++ u1078 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You broke in?
L233148 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ The door from the patio, in back.
L233360 +++$+++ u1084 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Hey, Chil? I think you're fulla shit.
L233359 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ I don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer.
L233358 +++$+++ u1084 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ How you gonna do that? You don't know shit about making movies.
L233357 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ I'm thinking about producing.
L233356 +++$+++ u1084 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
L233355 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ I'm going into the movie business.
L233354 +++$+++ u1084 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Whatta you doing out there?
L233353 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
L233352 +++$+++ u1084 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ He already knew it.
L233351 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?
L233350 +++$+++ u1084 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't.
L233349 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
L233348 +++$+++ u1084 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
L233347 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
L233346 +++$+++ u1084 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time.
L233065 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Don't say a fuckin' word.
L233064 +++$+++ u1084 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ I told you not to -–
L233035 +++$+++ u1084 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ In an armchair. Or I go to a coffee shop, sleep there. Sit in a booth, pull my hat down.
L233034 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Where do you sleep?
L233033 +++$+++ u1084 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ No, I said I'm never goin' to bed. There's a difference. See, the article says most people die in their beds. I figure long as I stay outta bed, I'm safe.
L233014 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Don't worry about it. I won't say any more than I have to, if that.
L233013 +++$+++ u1084 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Hey, Chili.  Get your coat, but don't piss the guy off, okay? It could get complicated and we'd have to call Momo to straighten it out. Then Momo gets pissed for wasting his time and we don't need that.
L233011 +++$+++ u1084 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Tomorrow, I see on the TV weather, it's gonna be nice and warm. You won't need the coat.
L233010 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ That's what the guy said.
L233009 +++$+++ u1084 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ You sure it was Ray Bones took the coat?
L232982 +++$+++ u1084 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ What's Momo gonna want with an old place, shows old movies people don't care about no more. Outside of maybe turnin' it into a porno house, I don't think he's gonna give much of a fuck. And you already got a job.
L232981 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ Momo could buy it, I could run it for him. Show some Cagney films.
L232980 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ What I'm thinkin' is maybe Momo could buy it.
L232979 +++$+++ u1084 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ TOMMY +++$+++ Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
L232978 +++$+++ u1071 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ CHILI +++$+++ They're closing the Granview. You know, theater down on Biscayne?
L233458 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ What she did not say was, 'I just loved the way the director moved the camera so much it made me fuckin' seasick.' All she cared about was that look. All she remembered was that look. And why do we remember things in movies? Because we can see them.
L233457 +++$+++ u1074 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ DIRECTOR +++$+++ That's great, Harry. So what's the --
L233456 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ So Mildred says to the cashier, 'I saw the new Streisand picture.'  'God, I just love it at the end when she brushed Robert Redford's hair off his forehead the way she did when they were together, and the way they gave each other this look that said they still loved each other, but knew they couldn't be together. That look was so... romantic.'

L233452 +++$+++ u1074 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ DIRECTOR +++$+++ Hm?
L233451 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Pick 'n' Save.
L233450 +++$+++ u1074 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ DIRECTOR +++$+++ Yeah? What three words, Harry?
L233449 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ She's scared! Fear is an emotion!  Look, kid, if you remember anything from your time working with Harry Zimm, let it be the three key words to filmmaking.
L233448 +++$+++ u1074 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ DIRECTOR +++$+++ What 'emotion'? Girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick.
L233447 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ All these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gonna distance us from the emotion of the scene.
L233438 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Get down here. I wanna talk to you. Come on... right now...  She's gonna talk to Martin?
L233437 +++$+++ u1074 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ DIRECTOR +++$+++ Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.
L233436 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Yeah, but whose point of view?
L233551 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ How honorable of you.
L233550 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ DORIS +++$+++ He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.
L233549 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Yeah, what'd he have to say?
L233548 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ DORIS +++$+++ No. But now that you mention it, I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount the other day... who just happened to get his hands on the script.
L233547 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ So this means you've reconsidered our deal on Mr. Lovejoy?
L233546 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ DORIS +++$+++ Murray's dead.
L233545 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I mean morally. Murray was my friend.
L233544 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ DORIS +++$+++ You seem to feel fine about it.
L233543 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I'm not sure how I feel about this, Doris.
L233539 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ DORIS +++$+++ What he was, was a hack, couldn't get a job writing for anybody but you.  I'm being honest. He was a lousy writer, but he was a good husband. I just didn't know it until too late.
L233538 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Yeah, me too. He was a helluva good writer. And I would know. I discovered him. Made him what he was.
L233537 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ DORIS +++$+++ I miss Murray, Harry.
L233536 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Yeah, lovely. Last night I watched two guys carjack a Camaro down on the corner of Argyle there.  What do you want, Doris?
L233535 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ DORIS +++$+++ What a spectacular view.
L233534 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Come on in.
L233533 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ DORIS +++$+++ Well, aren't you gonna offer me whatever it is you taste like?
L233532 +++$+++ u1075 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ DORIS +++$+++ Harry Zimm. You look like a wet kiss.
L233531 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Hello, Doris.
L233720 +++$+++ u1077 +++$+++ m70 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Man's in town two days, thinks he's David O. fucking Selznick.
