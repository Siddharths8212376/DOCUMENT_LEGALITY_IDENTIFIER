L36414 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ If you don't see it, it's not real...
L36413 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ What?
L36412 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ Don't turn around.
L36411 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Swimming. Swimming is good.
L36410 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ Stop it. This is just sad.
L36409 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Aw, shucks, ma'am...
L36408 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ Jesse, have you ever noticed that when you're trying to charm your way out of trouble, your accent gets all farm boy?
L36407 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Now, sweetie, y'all wouldn't go believing one of them silly dime novels, would you?
L36406 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ Oh, I'm not finished.  "When he sauntered into a saloon, his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold, the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple."  As I said. Hmm.
L36405 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Let me see that.
L36404 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ "Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James." Only a dime in the hotel lobby.
L36403 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ I beg your pardon?
L36402 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ "But the life of the James Gang wasn't all robbing and shooting and killing, for these young Missouri bucks had a taste for the ladies... especially the handsome and charismatic Jesse James."
L36401 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ "Hmm" what?
L36400 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ Hmm.
L36370 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ Now wait a minute. There are certain things that have to wait until after the wedding.
L36369 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ I've got you. You keep me busy. I figure we'll get over to the hotel... get checked in, cleaned up... then I'd like to do something I've been thinking about for a long time.
L36368 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?
L36367 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.
L36366 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ I would never have imagined us in a place like this.
L36364 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ She's beautiful. Smart. And has the biggest... buck teeth in all of Missouri.
L36363 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...
L36362 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.
L36361 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ I don't understand.
L36360 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ I had to see you. I'm getting married.
L36359 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
L36358 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Zee.
L35987 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ When my name makes them cry in their sleep. When I've brought them to ashes.
L35986 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?
L35985 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
L35984 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ Let the law --
L35983 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Me neither.
L35982 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ You and I, we've started... something, you know?  I don't know what'll happen if you do this.
L35981 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Frank and me have to go away for a while.
L35980 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ I am so sorry, Jesse.
L35945 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ I've been planning on kissin' you for a very long time.
L35944 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
L35943 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Yep.
L35942 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare poems you're trying to quote?
L35941 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Little ones.
L35940 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ Sparkling rocks?
L35939 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Ahem. "From this doctrine..." No, ah... "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive, they sparkle still like ... shiny... sparkling rocks..."
L35937 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Honestly, you'd do if only you had the buck teeth.
L35936 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ Where will you find such a girl?
L35935 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.
L35934 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ And what's this right girl like?
L35933 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Not if I find the right girl.
L35932 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
L35931 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.
L35930 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?
L35929 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
L35928 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ A river pirate.
L35927 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate.
L35926 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ You didn't want to farm?
L35925 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older.
L35905 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Unfair. You are completely unfair.
L35904 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?
L35903 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.
L35902 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole. We're all so proud of you, Jesse. And not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. You're everybody's hero.
L35901 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ What?
L35900 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ I shouldn't tease a hero.
L35899 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.
L35898 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ Teasing you is completely unfair.
L35897 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ No! I mean, of course not. No.
L35896 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ You're sick of my company?
L35895 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.
L35894 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ You shouldn't be up.
L35873 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Nuh-huh ...
L35872 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ Jesse, is that your hand?
L35871 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Mmmm.
L35870 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ Jesse, are you awake?
L35712 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ If there's anything we can do for you, Dr. Mimms. We want to help.
L35711 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ But still died.
L35697 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ But you got big!
L35696 +++$+++ u326 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ ZEE +++$+++ You were little Jesse James when you left.
L35695 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?
L36508 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Fair enough.
L36507 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse James. But chasing you takes up too much of my time.
L36506 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Thanks.
L36505 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ The railroad has no business in Tennessee. Therefore I have no interest in the state of Tennessee.
L36499 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ He's too important, James.  They'll set the army on you. You and your wife.
L36498 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ That was for my Ma. Now this is for everybody else.
L36457 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ No, I'll hang you.  But I may miss you just a bit.
L36456 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Ahh, you'll miss me.
L36455 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ You cocky little bastard.
L36454 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ I'm not hanged yet.
L36453 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ That's what I would have done.
L36452 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.
L36451 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ Was it worth it?
L36450 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ I figured.
L36449 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ Oh. That's nice to know.  We're going to hang you, you know.
L36448 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ No, that one was close. A couple fellas quit after that one.
L36447 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.
L36446 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Almost got me in Billings. I saw you there, shooting at me.
L36445 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ Damn.
L36444 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town.
L36443 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ Yes?
L36442 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ You had all those cattle there, so I'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive?
L36441 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ Mmm.
L36440 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Last February?
L36439 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ How did you spot the ambush in Torrell?
L36438 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ Pity.
L36437 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ You almost ended my career before it began.
L36435 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ Not that day. I am guilty of many things, but that was Mr. Thaddeus Rains and Parker, that day.
L36434 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Did you order our houses burned down?
L36433 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ That's the idea.
L36432 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?
L36431 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers.
L36430 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ But I like the presidential suite.
L36429 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ We're moving you tomorrow.
L36383 +++$+++ u321 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PASTOR +++$+++ Communion.
L36382 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Right here in church?
L36381 +++$+++ u321 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PASTOR +++$+++ Now let's have a drink.
L36380 +++$+++ u321 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PASTOR +++$+++ Who needs to repair a leaky church roof.
L36379 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Thank you.
L36378 +++$+++ u321 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PASTOR +++$+++ Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth.
L36377 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ I could have lied I suppose, but I want this marriage to be legal. I just want you to know, I'm trying to start a new life here. I'm depending on your...
L36376 +++$+++ u321 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PASTOR +++$+++ The Lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable.  "Jesse Woodson James." Jesse James? The Jesse James?
L36375 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ You don't think God'll mind, do you?
L36374 +++$+++ u321 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PASTOR +++$+++ This is unusual. Most of our marriages are members of the congregation.
L36339 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ You're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her, Jimmy.
L36338 +++$+++ u314 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...
L36337 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ This time we'll make an exception.
L36336 +++$+++ u314 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ ... too young for whisky...
L36310 +++$+++ u314 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ It's his money.  He's putting up the payroll out of his own fortune. You do want to hurt Thaddeus Rains, don't you Jesse?
L36309 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ What about that Rock Island bastard?
L36227 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ You do that.
L36226 +++$+++ u314 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Tell you something else.  I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up.
L36225 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ I swear.
L36224 +++$+++ u314 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You and Frank and Cole, and even Bob, get all these girls because you're good looking and famous. You don't have to pay. They just look at me like I'm the baby brother.  Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse?
L36223 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ I think so.
L36222 +++$+++ u314 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?
L36221 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ You been with a girl ever?
L36220 +++$+++ u314 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Well, not exactly.
L36219 +++$+++ u314 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Tonight? Why, I'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm.
L36218 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Jim, you been with a girl yet?
L36217 +++$+++ u314 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I was always jealous Web Mimms got to go off and fight with you and Cole. Now it's my turn.
L36216 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ I guess so.
L36215 +++$+++ u314 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink.
L36214 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.
L36213 +++$+++ u314 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You okay, Jesse?
L35968 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ No.
L35967 +++$+++ u314 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I like that.
L35848 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ And the same age Web was. No.
L35847 +++$+++ u314 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.
L35846 +++$+++ u313 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JESSE +++$+++ And you're too young.
L36245 +++$+++ u314 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Don't talk about it much, though.
L36244 +++$+++ u316 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ Really?
L36243 +++$+++ u314 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once.
L36242 +++$+++ u316 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ That is so gentlemanly of you.
L36241 +++$+++ u314 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
L36240 +++$+++ u316 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.
L36239 +++$+++ u314 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?
L36238 +++$+++ u316 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ Lyla Devereux.
L36237 +++$+++ u314 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Thank you, Miss -- ?
L36236 +++$+++ u316 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ I just though you were awful cute.
L36235 +++$+++ u314 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Not at all.
L36234 +++$+++ u316 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ I hope I'm not being too forward.
L36233 +++$+++ u314 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Really?
L36232 +++$+++ u316 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ Yes, but just so I could find out who you were.
L36231 +++$+++ u314 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
L36230 +++$+++ u316 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ LYLA +++$+++ I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.
L36229 +++$+++ u314 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Why, yeah.
L36496 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ Move you fools!
L36495 +++$+++ u320 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ There's only four of them...
L36158 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ They donate money to farmers, to churches. Rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of Maddox so much money they were able to build a school.
L36157 +++$+++ u320 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ How can that be?
L36090 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ By burning down their homes?
L36089 +++$+++ u320 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ They had to be dealt with!
L36088 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time.
L35858 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ It's not my job to relax. I've put men facing out both ways down Main Street, so nobody can ride in shooting. I've got a sharpshooter up on the water tower just in case.
L35857 +++$+++ u320 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Relax, Alan. The Army has this all in hand. And Mr. Thaddeus Rains will be very pleased with this news. Nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate.
L35795 +++$+++ u320 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ I'm doing you folks a favor --
L35794 +++$+++ u322 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PINKERTON +++$+++ Well, this land is about to be condemned.
L36462 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ Not such a menace now, is he, Pinkerton?
L36461 +++$+++ u320 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ How did you know?
L36459 +++$+++ u320 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ I remember you.
L36458 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ This is him.
L36253 +++$+++ u320 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain.
L36252 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ That.
L36251 +++$+++ u320 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ What, sir?
L36250 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ What is that?
L36249 +++$+++ u320 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Sir?
L36248 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ Parker.
L36247 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ I look forward to seeing it.
L36246 +++$+++ u320 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ The final route for the railroad is complete.
L36160 +++$+++ u320 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ We should go burn that school to the ground, sir!
L36159 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ With my money!
L36087 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ What is going on here, man?
L36086 +++$+++ u320 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Your men knew the risks.
L36081 +++$+++ u320 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ We did.
L36080 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ THEN WHO DID?!
L36079 +++$+++ u320 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
L36078 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!
L36077 +++$+++ u320 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ PARKER +++$+++ Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins and currency. And the delay from the miles of destroyed track --
L36076 +++$+++ u323 +++$+++ m19 +++$+++ RAINS +++$+++ How much did they get from the safe?
