L142776 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ And a hundred mile airspace.
L142775 +++$+++ u4607 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ KITZ +++$+++ Colonel Jarrod, I'd like a twenty mile radio-silent perimeter put around this installation immediately.
L142770 +++$+++ u4607 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ KITZ +++$+++ You don't seem to understand that it's your interests I'm trying to protect -- !
L142769 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ -- which we'll also need the network's help to receive and decode!
L142766 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ You want to classify prime numbers?
L142765 +++$+++ u4607 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ KITZ +++$+++ I'm saying you might have consulted us; the contents of this message could be extremely sensitive...
L142764 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ This isn't a person to person call, Mr. Kitz.  I don't really think the civilization sending the message intended it just for Americans.
L142763 +++$+++ u4607 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ KITZ +++$+++ I'll come right to the point, Doctor.  Your sending this message all over the world may well be a breach of National Security.
L143310 +++$+++ u4612 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Childhood is over, Ellie.  It's time to grow up.
L143309 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ No.  Please.
L143308 +++$+++ u4612 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ It's time to go home now.
L143306 +++$+++ u4612 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Ellie... this is the way it's been done for billions of years...
L143305 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Please -- if you... downloaded... everything about us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have -- it could make the difference --
L143304 +++$+++ u4612 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ No more stalling, Captain.
L143303 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ But you said you wanted to help -- don't you see what it would mean?
L143302 +++$+++ u4612 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ That isn't the way it works.
L143301 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ But -- other people from our planet should see what I've seen -- they should witness this for themselves.
L143300 +++$+++ u4612 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Eventually you'll get here on your own.  This was just the first step; in time you'll take another.
L143299 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ None taken... but ... do we get to come back?  Others of my kind, I mean.
L143298 +++$+++ u4612 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ If we don't engineer a consistent causality it'll work itself out on its own, and that's almost always worse.  Ellie, according to your physics none of this is possible.  A lot of it you're simply not capable of understanding, not yet.  No offense.
L143297 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ No!  I mean... why so soon?
L143296 +++$+++ u4612 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Now... you go home.
L143295 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ So.  What happens now?
L143294 +++$+++ u4612 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You always have been.  We're all descendants of the same stars, Ellie.  All made of the same primordial atoms.
L143293 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ ... all those voices... you gather them all together.  Millions of intelligences in one consciousness... and now we're a part of it.
L143292 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ The librarian... or the library...?
L143291 +++$+++ u4612 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Am I one... or many?
L143282 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Can you help us?
L143281 +++$+++ u4612 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ ... life is unspeakably rare.  So whenever we do find another civilization, especially one that's... struggling... We send a message.  Sometimes we can offer help.  Sometimes we can't.  But we always try.  Life is simply too precious not to.
L143279 +++$+++ u4612 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You have your mother's hands...  There are no tests, Ellie.  We don't sit in judgment.  Think of us more as... librarians.  Curators of the Universe's rarest and most valuable creation...
L143278 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ So we passed some kind of test?
L143277 +++$+++ u4612 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Not all.  Some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams.  Some never make it this far.
L143276 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ The scale... it's just...  So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?
L143275 +++$+++ u4612 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ We don't know.  Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here.
L143274 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ So who...?
L143273 +++$+++ u4612 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Oh, we didn't build it.  The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers.
L143272 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
L143271 +++$+++ u4612 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Many others.
L143270 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others?
L143269 +++$+++ u4612 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ You contacted us.  We were simply listening.  We've been listening for millions of years.
L143268 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Why did you contact us?
L143267 +++$+++ u4612 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Small moves, Captain, small moves.
L143266 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Can you show me?
L143265 +++$+++ u4612 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Originally just another species like yourselves.  Well, not like you at all actually, but...
L143264 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ So who -- what -- are you?
L143262 +++$+++ u4612 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ We thought this might make things a little easier.
L143261 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ But you're so... I mean how could you possibly...?  When I was unconscious.  You... downloaded... my thoughts, my memories, even...  This beach.  I've never been here but I remember... it's how I always imagined...  Pensacola.
L143260 +++$+++ u4612 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Am I artifact or dream?  You might ask that about anything.
L143259 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ So.  Are you an hallucination?  Or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin?
L143258 +++$+++ u4612 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ That's my scientist.
L143257 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ You're not real.  None of this is.
L143256 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Dad... But tell me, how did... I mean how can...?
L143255 +++$+++ u4612 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
L143254 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I used... I used to dream you were alive... and then I'd wake up and lose you all over again.
L142562 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Okay.
L142561 +++$+++ u4612 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Time to sleep now, Captain.  But you can ask more questions in the morning, okay?
L142558 +++$+++ u4612 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ That's a beauty, Captain.  Now get some sleep.
L142557 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Pensacola.
L142556 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Okay, okay... there.
L142555 +++$+++ u4612 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Mmm, that's a good one.  Maybe his echo...  Okay, no more stalling.
L142554 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Could we hear God?
L142553 +++$+++ u4612 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Big enough radio, I don't see why not.
L142552 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Could we hear to the moon?
L142551 +++$+++ u4612 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ On that old shortwave?  Maybe on a clear night.  Come on now, under the covers.
L142550 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Could we hear to China?
L142545 +++$+++ u4612 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Just be yourself, Captain.  Find out where he is.
L142544 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ But what do I say?
L142543 +++$+++ u4612 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Talk to him.
L142540 +++$+++ u4612 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Try again between the static and 'Hey Jude'; that's where they're hiding.
L142539 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I can't move any smaller.
L142538 +++$+++ u4612 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ TED +++$+++ Small moves, Captain, small moves.
L143162 +++$+++ u4603 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ HADDEN +++$+++ Can't.  Doctor's orders.  The low oxygen/zero gravity environment is the only thing keeping the cancer from eating me alive.  It's all right -- I like it here. Ever try sex in zero-G?
L143161 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Why don't you come back with me?
L143159 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ -- of Hadden Industries.
L143158 +++$+++ u4603 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ HADDEN +++$+++ As each component was tested and shipped off to Texas a duplicate was maintained and assembled in Hokkaido -- for backup purposes, of course. We've been right behind you the entire time.  You see my problem:  I couldn't appear to control too large a percentage; my enemies wouldn't stand for it.  So I simply made sure the Japanese consortium received the systems integration contract.  Of course no one had to know the corporations involved were recently acquired, wholly-owned subsidiaries --
L143157 +++$+++ u4603 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ HADDEN +++$+++ Mmm.  Look closer.
L143156 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ The systems integration site.
L143155 +++$+++ u4603 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ HADDEN +++$+++ Hokkaido Island.
L143154 +++$+++ u4603 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ HADDEN +++$+++ Wouldn't you if you saw Hitler on TV?  Come; I want to show you something.
L143153 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
L143152 +++$+++ u4603 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ HADDEN +++$+++ I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.
L143151 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ You sound like Joseph.  You think the world ends with the millennium?
L143150 +++$+++ u4603 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ HADDEN +++$+++ Oh, not quite yet.  At least for their sake...  ... I hope it's not.  Because they're running out of time.
L143149 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ What are you talking about?  It's over.
L143148 +++$+++ u4603 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ HADDEN +++$+++ Yes.  A shame.  Still... it'd be worse if they died for nothing.
L143147 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ It looks like pixie dust...  Kent would've given anything to see this.  David, too.
L143146 +++$+++ u4603 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ HADDEN +++$+++ Japanese squid fleet.  They use lights to attract them to the surface... then turn them into sushi.
L143145 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ What's that?
L143144 +++$+++ u4603 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ HADDEN +++$+++ Poor, tired, spinning girl... How we feasted on her.  And now that we've had our fill and given her a giant dose of the clap... we're pulling out.  That's Paris, where my daughter was born.  Moscow, where gangsters rule the night and I gave up smoking.  So many battles, so many lives... all that sturm, and drang.  As if it never happened.  If it weren't for a few power grids, you wouldn't know we existed.
L143143 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ It's so... small.
L143142 +++$+++ u4603 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ HADDEN +++$+++ A sunrise and a sunset every forty- five minutes.
L142894 +++$+++ u4603 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ HADDEN +++$+++ That's my girl.  Done.
L142893 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Mr. Hadden, I'm a scientist; I don't make deals... But.  If you wish to give me, in good faith, access to your information, I can assure you that I will exert all reasonable efforts to promote your cause wherever it doesn't conflict with the best interests of science... or my better judgment.
L142892 +++$+++ u4603 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ HADDEN +++$+++ In return... you get the primer -- and with it the power to stay in the game.  Do we have a deal?
L142891 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ And in return?
L142890 +++$+++ u4603 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ HADDEN +++$+++ That would seem to be the question of the hour.  I want to build it, Doctor.  Of course I'm already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption -- but as I said, my colorful past has made many of those channels... difficult to navigate. I need someone on the inside.
L142889 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ A machine.  But a machine that does what?
L142888 +++$+++ u4603 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ HADDEN +++$+++ Very good, Doctor.  I've also detected structural elements, back references, a general movement from the simple to the complex -- all of which would seem to indicate instructions -- an enormously complicated set of instructions -- for building something.
L142887 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Some kind of circuitry...?
L142884 +++$+++ u4603 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ HADDEN +++$+++ -- even if he doesn't receive the entire transmission.  Heaven is the mustard seed.
L142883 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ You're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is --
L142882 +++$+++ u4603 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ HADDEN +++$+++ Not if you think like a Vegan.
L142881 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ A page-break signal.  A period.
L142880 +++$+++ u4603 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ HADDEN +++$+++ Page after page of data -- over sixty-three thousand in all, if I'm not mistaken... and at the end of each...
L142878 +++$+++ u4603 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ HADDEN +++$+++ That's my girl...  Lights.
L142877 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ If I knew you any better I'd say that doesn't sound like you.
L142876 +++$+++ u4603 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ HADDEN +++$+++ I've had a long time to make enemies, Dr. Arroway.  There are many governments, business interests, even religious leaders who would like to see me disappear. And I will grant them their wish soon enough... But before I do, I wish to make a small contribution -- a final gesture of goodwill toward the people of this little planet who've given -- from whom I've taken so much.
L142875 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ You've... found it.  What could I possibly have that you would want, Mr. Hadden?
L142874 +++$+++ u4603 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ HADDEN +++$+++ Oh, maybe not out -- but definitely looking for you coat.  I understand you've had some difficulty locating the -- what are you calling it?  The 'primer' that will make decryption possible...  I've found it.
L142873 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I didn't realize I was out.
L142872 +++$+++ u4603 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ HADDEN +++$+++ The powers that be have been quite busy lately, falling over each other to position themselves for the game of the century, if not the millennium.  Perhaps you've noticed.  Perhaps I could help deal you back in.
L142871 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ What kind of deal?
L142870 +++$+++ u4603 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ HADDEN +++$+++ The infamous, unfashionable bluntness.  You're here so we can do business. I want to make a deal.
L142869 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Why am I here, Mr. Hadden?
L142868 +++$+++ u4603 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ HADDEN +++$+++ I find it convenient to keep my interests... mobile.  Anyway, I've had my fill of life on the ground. After spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer -- after outliving three wives and two children...  I find I've had quite enough of planet Earth.
L142867 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ You live here.
L142866 +++$+++ u4603 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ HADDEN +++$+++ Once upon a time I was a hell of an engineer.  Please, sit, Doctor.  I have guests so rarely, it's important to me they feel welcome in my home.  Did you know this was once Yeltsin's flying dascha?  That dent is where he threw a bottle of vodka at the pilot.  At least that's what the people who sold me the plane said...
L142865 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ S.R. Hadden...  You compromised our security codes.
L143122 +++$+++ u4604 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JEAN-CLAUDE +++$+++ I think it is your naivete I like best about you, Eleanor.  Oh, there'll be a worldwide protest, but we all knew it from the very beginning.  You Americans discovered the signal, you led the decryption effort.  The machine is being built on your home soil... Of course the passenger will be an American, chosen by Americans.  Anyway, it is what the whole world wants, no?  This is the big show. The sort you put on better than anyone.  It's good marketing.  It's good casting.  It's the American way.
L143121 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ You're implying that the whole selection process is a sham?
L143120 +++$+++ u4604 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JEAN-CLAUDE +++$+++ I do.  More than anything.  But I am also a realist.  Soon this... what is your charming term -- ?  Dog and pony show will finally be over, and I will go home.
L143119 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I thought you were here because you want to go.
L143118 +++$+++ u4604 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JEAN-CLAUDE +++$+++ Perhaps.  But on the off-chance that it is a 'doomsday device' of some kind, I plan to be very far away from your lovely Texas when it is activated.
L143117 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I'd say this is slightly different.
L143020 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ We've just lived through a century of incredible violence and self- destruction.  Do you call it 'interventionist' when you stop a toddler from walking in front of a truck?
L143019 +++$+++ u4604 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JEAN-CLAUDE +++$+++ Very well.  Assume this is true. Assume they have only the best of intentions.  Suppose they decide to just step in and solve all our problems for us.  You have no objection to them so flagrantly intervening in human affairs?
L143331 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ But the machine worked -- that's what I've been trying to tell everyone!  The tape -- it's all there, if they'd just look at...  ... the tape...
L143330 +++$+++ u4609 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ That's one way of putting it.  Kitz, the President, the I.S.C. have shut down all official communications; there've also been reports of riots flaring up across the U.S. and Europe.  Until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough, especially for you --
L143329 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Peter... What is going on?  Has everyone gone completely insane?
L143321 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ How long was I gone?
L143320 +++$+++ u4609 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What day?
L143319 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Peter, what are you talking about? What malfunction?  What day is this?
L143318 +++$+++ u4609 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ It's all right, the important thing is you're safe --
L143317 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Wait -- hold on a minute --
L143316 +++$+++ u4609 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Thank God.  When we lost contact, I thought -- we thought... but you're okay.  We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction.  Did you notice anything at all that --
L143315 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I'm -- I'm fine.
L143314 +++$+++ u4609 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Ellie -- are you okay?
L143211 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Like it.  Almost there.
L143210 +++$+++ u4609 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Like it or not.
L143209 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ That you, Valerian?
L143208 +++$+++ u4609 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ It's really happening.
L143207 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Someone tell me this is really happening.
L142929 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ You too.
L142928 +++$+++ u4609 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ It's good to see you, Ellie.
L142921 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Peter.
L142920 +++$+++ u4609 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Ellie.
L142644 +++$+++ u4609 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ That is true.  But it's also true that if I really thought we wanted the same things, I'd follow you anywhere... but the truth is I don't think you want the company.  Be honest, El.  There's nowhere you'd rather be than sitting out at some remote corner of the world searching for the answers to the mysteries of the universe.  And call me crazy, but I just can't compete with that... I'm sorry.
L142643 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ You sonofabitch.
L142642 +++$+++ u4609 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Ellie -- I'm getting married.  Her name's Laura.  She came up to Owens Valley to do her post-doc about six months after you left.
L142641 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I'm serious about this, Peter --
L142640 +++$+++ u4609 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Ellie --
L142639 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Right now -- we'll drive down to Ramey and get the base chaplain to marry us.
L142638 +++$+++ u4609 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Jesus --
L142637 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ And you think I don't want those things?  You think I don't stay up half the night wondering if I've made the right choice living half a world away from you, wondering if any of this is worth what I'm giving up for it everyday?  Let's get married.
L142636 +++$+++ u4609 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Maybe that's the problem.  I want... a family, Ellie.  I want kids.  A townhouse on L street instead of still living like a college kid.  A real life.  Maybe that makes me a sellout but I don't care anymore. It's what I want.
L142635 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Please, you're just as ambitious as I am, more --
L142634 +++$+++ u4609 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ 'The work,' Jesus, Ellie, can't there just once be more to life than the work?  Okay, maybe that's the only way to get the recognition, win the prizes --
L142633 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ But the work --
L142632 +++$+++ u4609 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ This is a chance to be of enormous help to other people's research -- to have the power to be a real advocate where David's got blind spots --
L142631 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ But what about your research -- ?
L142630 +++$+++ u4609 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I'm going on staff at the N.S.F.  To work for Drumlin.
L142629 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Greenbank?
L142628 +++$+++ u4609 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ -- I'm moving to Washington.
L142627 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ We could be together again --
L142626 +++$+++ u4609 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Actually --
L142625 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Peter -- if you can get him to do that for me he'd obviously do the same for you -- we could -- !
L142624 +++$+++ u4609 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Thirty-one linked dishes.  You could search more sky there in a day than you could in a year here.
L142623 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ The V.L.A.?
L142622 +++$+++ u4609 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What if I said I could get Drumlin to agree to sell you time in New Mexico?
L142621 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ It's almost there.  The hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time.
L142620 +++$+++ u4609 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ How close are you to getting this funding put together?
L142619 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ If we lived at any previous time in human history we wouldn't even have the option of failing -- we'd have to wonder our whole lives, unable to do anything about it.  This time, right now, is unique in our history, in any civilization's history -- the moment of the acquisition of technology.  The moment when contact becomes possible.  We've already beaten incredible odds by being lucky enough to be alive now.
L142618 +++$+++ u4609 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Ellie... even if you do manage to raise the money, have you thought about what it would really mean to follow through on this?  I mean a college fetish is one thing, but we're talking about your career. You won't be publishing.  You won't be taken seriously... and you could spend your entire life looking and never find anything at all.
L142617 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ ... We've been going after some of the big multi-nationals but without much luck; got a donation from a New York dowager... We've even been thinking about selling T-shirts.
L142616 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I've examined over forty stars of roughly solar spectral type but so far nothing.  Still, we've barely started...
L142615 +++$+++ u4609 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ And?
L142614 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Please.  Any chance of that died the day David Drumlin was appointed head of the N.S.F.  I have been in contact with a few other SETI people; we've been trying to find backing from private investors. I've even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there...
L142613 +++$+++ u4609 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Any luck on the grant money?
L142612 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ ... I keep telling myself okay, that's just the price, you have to do your time doing shitwork before you're allowed to get to the good stuff... but if I have to catalog one more quasar...  God, I've missed you.
L142596 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ '... is indistinguishable from magic.'
L142595 +++$+++ u4609 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ 'Any sufficiently advanced technology...'
L142594 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ It's like the pre-Copernicans who swore the sun revolved around the Earth, or the Victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made.  I mean... try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us -- then imagine trying to explain... I dunno, a microwave oven -- to someone even a hundred years ago -- I mean the basic concepts didn't exist...
L142593 +++$+++ u4609 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ They can't.  I think it's against human nature to admit to that level of... insignificance; to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe.
L142592 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ ... I'm just so sick of feeling defensive about the things I care about!  Or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by people like Drumlin, when if they'd just put aside their preconceptions for two seconds and look at the facts...
L142590 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ What a coincidence.  It happens to be my fetish too.
L142589 +++$+++ u4609 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Keep it down, okay?  Drumlin thinks I'm enough of a flake as it is.  Look -- everyone here has their little fetishes.  Caven goes to topless bars, Vernon's got his carnivorous plants... mine just happens to be extraterrestrial intelligence.
L142588 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I read your paper on ETI's.  It's brilliant.
L142586 +++$+++ u4609 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yavol.
L142585 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Sounds like a Russian general.
L142584 +++$+++ u4609 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Peter Valerian.
L142583 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Ellie.  Arroway.
L142582 +++$+++ u4609 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ That's what they all say.
L142581 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ He's an incredible prick but I never learned so much in my life.
L142580 +++$+++ u4609 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ It's beautiful but it does get a little lonely.  Sometimes I think the reason we build these things in such godforsaken places isn't to avoid excess radio traffic but because we're all such pathetic antisocial misfits... Speaking of which:  How're you getting on with the old man?
L142579 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ ... Drumlin said you're been down at Arecibo for the last year.
L143408 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ Something my dad -- they -- said. 'After all the suffering, after all the desolation of the void -- the one thing that makes the vastness tolerable is each other.'  The one thing that makes it bearable is love.
L143407 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ Meaning...
L143406 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I'm not sure...  Maybe it simply exists in the search for it.  Maybe its something we have to make for ourselves.
L143405 +++$+++ u4605 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ JOSS +++$+++ Does that mean you think it doesn't exist?
L143404 +++$+++ u4602 +++$+++ m304 +++$+++ ELLIE +++$+++ I don't know.  If it was a god, it was searching for a greater one.  It was still searching for meaning...
