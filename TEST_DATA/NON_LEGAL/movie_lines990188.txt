L433355 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ He got three years and fined fifty million dollars and wrote 'em a fucking check.  Like that, fifty mil, signed his name.  Whoa-- little help here!
L433282 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ I do, but I won't tell you just yet. Meet me in the chapel at eight-thirty, right before lock-down.
L433281 +++$+++ u6989 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ PUP +++$+++ You know who they are?
L433280 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Looks like tonight.
L433279 +++$+++ u6989 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ PUP +++$+++ When?
L433278 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ I hear six.
L433277 +++$+++ u6989 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ PUP +++$+++ Okay.  How many going out?
L433276 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ I expect you to look out for me, Pup, let me run off work details.
L433275 +++$+++ u6989 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ PUP +++$+++ How many?
L433274 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Some people are going out of here. What if I told you where and when?
L434513 +++$+++ u6991 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ If that's my fate, so be it.  I'm not leaving.  I love her, Jack.
L434512 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Don't be an asshole, Richard.  They're gonna kill you.
L434511 +++$+++ u6991 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I'm not leaving Midge.
L434510 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ I were you, I'd get up and run.
L434506 +++$+++ u6991 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Five point two.
L434505 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Dumbfuck Glenn was right, there's about five million worth in there, wouldn't you say, Richard?
L434503 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ I'm not angry, Richard.  In fact, I'm completely relaxed.  Thing is, I can't tell if it's the fish that're cooling me out or all those uncut diamonds on the bottom of the tank there.
L434502 +++$+++ u6991 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I can't believe you're still angry with me, Jack, after all this time.
L434495 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Siddown, Dick.  They're trying to open the safe, not your maid.
L434494 +++$+++ u6991 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Good God... they're shooting Midge!
L434487 +++$+++ u6991 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ We'll go to my bank.  I'll make a withdrawal.
L434486 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ You gonna write me a check?
L434485 +++$+++ u6991 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ What do you want from me, Jack?  Name it.  You want money?
L434477 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ A minute or two, you're gonna wish you were.
L434476 +++$+++ u6991 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her.  She told him I was down in Florida.
L434475 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ What kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night?
L434474 +++$+++ u6991 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Have they got Midge up there?
L434473 +++$+++ u6991 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Maurice?  From Lompoc?  Good God.
L434472 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.
L434471 +++$+++ u6991 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing here?  What's going on?  Who's upstairs?
L434470 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ How are you, Richard?
L434469 +++$+++ u6991 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Foley?  That you?
L434225 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Oh, yeah, I'm calm.  In fact, I'm totally "relaxed..."
L434224 +++$+++ u6991 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Gentlemen.  I think we've calmed down now.  Haven't we, Jack?
L434220 +++$+++ u6991 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Jack, I'm disappointed.  I guess I misjudged you.
L434219 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ How, Dick?  The way <u>you</u> earned it?  By marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her?  What is this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit?  Back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you were ice cream for freaks.  You were a goddamn dumpling.  Maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing.  Till you <u>were</u> nothing.  I saved your ass.  So you'll pardon me if I don't wanna sit on a fuckin stool all day saying "sign in here please" or "hey, pal, you can't park there."  Okay, Dick?  I can't do it.
L434218 +++$+++ u6991 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Today, I'm offering you a lousy job at a lousy wage.  You think you're better than that?  Fine.  Show me.  Show me that you're really willing to change and we'll talk about something better. A lot better.  But first, Jack, you gotta earn it.
L434120 +++$+++ u6991 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ First, I'm goin' to Israel for a year, study the Talmud, work on a Kibbutz... then come back, maybe take some tennis lessons.
L434119 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ You goin' right back to work?
L434118 +++$+++ u6991 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ What's to think about?
L434117 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ I still haven't made up my mind yet.
L434011 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ The next time I walk into a bank.
L434010 +++$+++ u6991 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ It works.  You should try it sometime.
L434009 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ And the guy sent you a bill for this?
L434008 +++$+++ u6991 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ The fish saved my life.  Two years ago, I found out I had high blood pressure.  So my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time I felt myself stressing out.
L434007 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ I can't say that I've paid that much attention to 'em before.
L434006 +++$+++ u6991 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Yeah, fish live in the present.  They don't dwell on yesterday and they don't worry about tomorrow.  Even when a big fish attacks a little fish, there's no neurosis involved.  No guilt afterward. No whining on some fish-shrink's couch. They just do it.  They accept.
L434005 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ The fish?
L434004 +++$+++ u6991 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ No need to decide now.  Be like the fish.  Let whatever happens happen.
L434003 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ My ex-wife's in Miami.  It's nice down there.
L434002 +++$+++ u6991 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Who is?  But then you gotta look at a job as more than just work.  You gotta look at it as peace of mind.  As <i>security</i>, you know what I mean?  I got offices in Detroit, Miami, Boston, take your pick.
L434001 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ I don't know.  I'm not exactly the nine-to-five type.
L434000 +++$+++ u6991 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Hey, Jack?  Bullshit.  I didn't make my first million until I was forty- two.  Forty-two.  You really <u>want</u> to change, it's never too late.
L433999 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ It's a little late for me.
L433998 +++$+++ u6991 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I was just thinking that I could use a guy like you, someone knows how to ask for things the right way.  I'm talkin' about when you're outta here.  I mean, you can't rob banks for ever.
L433997 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Twenty-two months, three days, two hours.  Why?
L433996 +++$+++ u6991 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Tell me something, Jack, how much longer you in here?
L433995 +++$+++ u6991 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ It's a big house.
L433994 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You <u>told</u> him you keep 'em at your house.
L433993 +++$+++ u6991 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.
L433992 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Of course not.
L433991 +++$+++ u6991 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do <u>you</u> believe Glenn?
L433990 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ You're the one with balls, Dick, say something like that to someone like Glenn.  Or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute.
L433989 +++$+++ u6991 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I know what you're talking about.
L433988 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ No?  Where do you keep it, Dick?  I'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about.
L433987 +++$+++ u6991 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.
L433986 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ You'd be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way.
L433985 +++$+++ u6991 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Really?
L433984 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ I don't know.  I never used a gun.
L433983 +++$+++ u6991 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Tell me something.  What's it like, walk in a bank with a gun, stick it up?
L433583 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Any time.
L433582 +++$+++ u6991 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Thanks for your help.
L433568 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ First of all, if he kills you, he's not gonna get any more money out of you.
L433567 +++$+++ u6991 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Really?  Well, I uhhh...
L433566 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ You're smart, Ripley, you'll tell this guy to fuck off.
L433559 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Must be a real soft pillow.
L433558 +++$+++ u6991 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Sounds high, doesn't it?
L433374 +++$+++ u6991 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Oh, uh, right, thanks...
L433373 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ You don't wanna be standing there, the hacks start asking questions you don't wanna answer.
L434625 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ I don't know.  It's a long way down to Florida.
L434624 +++$+++ u6982 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ HEJIRA +++$+++ Like what?
L434623 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Yeah, could be.  Or maybe she thought we'd have a lot to talk about.
L434622 +++$+++ u6982 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ HEJIRA +++$+++ Cheaper I guess, take us both down in one van.
L434621 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ She did, huh.
L434620 +++$+++ u6982 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ HEJIRA +++$+++ Apparently, yeah.  I was supposed to leave last night with the lady marshal, but for some reason she wanted to wait.
L434619 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ And so now you're off to Glades.
L434618 +++$+++ u6982 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ HEJIRA +++$+++ Hejira.
L434617 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ You must be some kinda walker, Henry.
L434616 +++$+++ u6982 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ HEJIRA +++$+++ Ten, you count the prison hospital in Ohio I walked away from.
L434615 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ The <u>ninth</u>?
L434614 +++$+++ u6982 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ HEJIRA +++$+++ Yeah.  That was the ninth.
L434613 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ There were others.
L434612 +++$+++ u6982 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ HEJIRA +++$+++ That time?
L434611 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ And how long was it before they caught up with you?
L434610 +++$+++ u6982 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ HEJIRA +++$+++ I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place.
L434609 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ You busted out?
L434608 +++$+++ u6982 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ HEJIRA +++$+++ Meaning time came, I left.
L434607 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ Meaning?
L434606 +++$+++ u6982 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ HEJIRA +++$+++ For a time.
L434605 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ You were at Leavenworth, huh?
L434604 +++$+++ u6982 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ HEJIRA +++$+++ The brothers in Leavenworth gave me the name.
L434603 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ The flight?
L434602 +++$+++ u6982 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ HEJIRA +++$+++ The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed from Mecca in 622.
L434601 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ What's it mean, "No Hair"?
L434600 +++$+++ u6982 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ HEJIRA +++$+++ Islamic.
L434599 +++$+++ u6980 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ FOLEY +++$+++ <i>Hejira?</i>  What kinda name is that?
L434381 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ If I didn't know you, Glenn, by tomorrow you'd be in jail or dead.  Look at it that way.  Go on.
L434380 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I believe it.  I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am.
L434379 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...
L434378 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ Really?
L434377 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You want to get out of here, run, it'll warm you up.
L434376 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ I'm freezing my ass off.
L434375 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Gee, I wonder why not.
L434374 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.
L434373 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
L434372 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.
L434371 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Why's that?
L434370 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.
L434369 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ And is Foley a part of this?
L434368 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I don't give a shit what they do.
L434367 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?
L434366 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, man, they're into shit I can't handle.
L434365 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ But I thought the whole thing was your idea?
L434364 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ Nothing.  I just wanna get the fuck outta here.
L434363 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ What's going on, Glenn?
L434362 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ Listen, these guys, they're gonna be out here any minute looking for me. They're fucking animals.
L434361 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ For the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and conspiring to do whatever you came here for.
L434360 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ You're gonna bust me for picking up a car?
L434359 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Glenn, I know your life history, who your friends are, where you've been and now, it looks like, where you're going.  Put your hands on the wheel.
L434358 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ Jesus.  How'd you know about Snoopy?
L434357 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ The two guys you were with -- that one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it? I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that didn't look like him.
L434356 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ I already stole it.  Last week or whenever it was, in West Palm.  I can't be stealing it again, can I?
L434355 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You're not?
L434354 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ I mean I'm not stealing the fucking car.
L434351 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Another one of those days, huh, nothing seems to go right?
L434350 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ Jesus, I don't believe it.
L434349 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Glenn, are you trying to steal this car?
L433640 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ No way, man, no fuckin' way am I gonna turn myself in.
L433639 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Glenn, take the exit.
L433638 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ What am I supposed to do <u>now</u>?
L433637 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Take the next exit.
L433534 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Wait.  <i>Have</i> you helped him, Glenn?  At this point, technically, I doubt you could be charged with aiding a fugitive. So you still have a choice.  You can help him and risk going down again, get cuffed and shackled, hope to God you pull a reasonable judge, not some hard-on.  Or, if you want to play it another way...
L433533 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--
L433532 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Look, I can understand if you and Foley are close.
L433531 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Foley's not going to make it.  And if he goes down, Glenn, you go with him.
L433530 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ I remember you now.  Shit.
L433529 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Do we have a gun in the car?
L433527 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Last fall, I drove you from the Palm Beach county jail to the federal courthouse, twice.  You're Glenn Michaels.  I never forget anyone I've cuffed and shackled.
L433526 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ But you're sure we've met, huh?
L433525 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ No, that's not what I'm thinking.
L433524 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking.  I was never out there.
L433523 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ You don't remember me, do you?
L433522 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Glenn?
L433521 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ I got a big score lined up up north. They wouldn't even know about it, it wasn't for me.  I could do it right now myself, except it's so fucking cold up there in January--
L433498 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a sewer?
L433497 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ I'll send it to you at Glades.
L434028 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ Why would I do that?
L434027 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ No.  You gonna stay close to me from now on.  So you don't disappear on me.
L434026 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ It's all right with you, I'll just hang in the car.
L434023 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Yeah, Kenneth, why you have to do that to that poor girl.
L434022 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
L434021 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ That was some shit, huh?
L433979 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Hey, shit, come on.  I say I want this car, man, it's mine.  You go get yourself another one.  I say I'm in on Ripley?

L433976 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ I don't have to prove shit to you. The Ripley job is <i>my</i> job.  You're either in or you're not.  You wanna pop some crack dealer pissed you off, that's your problem, not mine.
L433975 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Right now, son.
L433974 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ What-- when?

L433967 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ Wait a minute.  I'm letting <i>you</i> in on this, not all your friends.

L433957 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ You sure Foley and his pal aren't coming up here, do this themself?
L433956 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ It's lilac, man, the color, and the style's made known by Deion and other defensive backs in the pros.  I could be one of them living out here with doctors of my race and basketball players.  Okay, here comes Mr. Ripley's house up on the left.  Yeah.  The brick wall.  There's his drive, right there.
L433955 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they won't think anything of it.
L433954 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Watch the road, boy.  I like this Town Car.  We can cruise the man's neighbourhood without getting the police or private security people on our ass.
L433607 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ Oh, I'm here, all right.  I'm very here. Question is, why aren't <u>you</u> here?

L433599 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ I wanna talk to you about a job.
L433598 +++$+++ u6987 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ MAURICE +++$+++ You crazy, come up <u>here</u>?  It's fuckin one degree outside.
L433597 +++$+++ u6981 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ GLENN +++$+++ Listen, Snoopy, I'm on my way up to Detroit and need a place to crash.

L433713 +++$+++ u6990 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ We went out there, full SWAT, two choppers, the whole bit, but Linares started shooting anyway.  We put him down, but somehow Chirino got away.
L433712 +++$+++ u6983 +++$+++ m467 +++$+++ KAREN +++$+++ Oh...
