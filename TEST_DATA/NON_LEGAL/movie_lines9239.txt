L387187 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ I wanted to.
L387186 +++$+++ u1931 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ I know that.  I know you would have done anything to find me.  I know you would have died for me.
L387185 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ I was looking for you...
L387184 +++$+++ u1931 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ The more you want to believe something, the easier it is to be fooled.
L387183 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ I forgive you...
L387182 +++$+++ u1931 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Once I even told him I loved him.
L387181 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ I forgive you.
L387180 +++$+++ u1931 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ I feel bad about that.  I need you to forgive me.
L387179 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Sean --
L387178 +++$+++ u1931 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ The funny thing is, I started to believe he really was my Dad.
L387177 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Oh, Sean --
L387176 +++$+++ u1931 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ No.  He got tired of pretending.
L387175 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ You're alive?
L387174 +++$+++ u1931 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ I lived for a year with a man who was pretending to be my father.  He took me all over the world.
L387173 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ What the hell.
L387172 +++$+++ u1931 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Wanna hear something funny?
L387171 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ It's a little late for that.
L387170 +++$+++ u1931 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ You gotta have faith, Dad.
L387169 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Sean -- you're not real.
L386718 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ All right, I'll try...
L386717 +++$+++ u1931 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Come on!
L386716 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Are you kidding?  There's absolutely positively no way, on my best day, I could ever beat twelve seconds!
L386715 +++$+++ u1931 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ Okay... now let me time you.
L386200 +++$+++ u1931 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ I love you, too!  I love you daddy.  Love ya, dad.
L386199 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Four.  Wow.  What a big boy.  I love you, Sean.
L386196 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ What a big boy.  How old are you?
L386195 +++$+++ u1931 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ I won!
L386193 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ That's great.
L386192 +++$+++ u1931 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ SEAN +++$+++ I scored a goal!
L387028 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Good-bye, Crow.
L387027 +++$+++ u1919 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ CROW +++$+++ You're not gonna kill me...
L387026 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Let go of the gun.
L387025 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Tell me!
L387024 +++$+++ u1919 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ CROW +++$+++ Kill me!
L387023 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Who made you do this?
L387022 +++$+++ u1919 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ CROW +++$+++ If I tell you, my family gets nothing.
L387021 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Tell me, who was it, set this up?
L387020 +++$+++ u1919 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ CROW +++$+++ Fake.  He gave it to me.  Now --  -- shoot me, Goddammit, before I lose my nerve!
L387019 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ What about the picture --
L387016 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ What the fuck is going on?
L387015 +++$+++ u1919 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ CROW +++$+++ I don't know -- I never saw his face.  All I know is, the next day I was out, so the guy must've had juice somewhere.  Look, man, you gotta go through with this.
L387014 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ I'm asking you again, who made you do this?
L387013 +++$+++ u1919 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ CROW +++$+++ Look, believe me, I know it's hard, but you gotta do it --
L387012 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Crow.  I'm not gonna kill you.
L387011 +++$+++ u1919 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ CROW +++$+++ Look, I've put my family through enough misery.  You gotta kill me! This way I can leave 'em something.
L387007 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Who said I would?
L387006 +++$+++ u1919 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ CROW +++$+++ You're supposed to kill me.  He said you would.
L387005 +++$+++ u1919 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ CROW +++$+++ If you don't kill me, my family gets nothing!
L387004 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ The precogs were wrong.
L387003 +++$+++ u1919 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ CROW +++$+++ But you have to.  They said you would.
L387002 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ No.
L387001 +++$+++ u1919 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ CROW +++$+++ You're not gonna kill me?
L386996 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ NO!
L386995 +++$+++ u1919 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ CROW +++$+++ It floated back up.  I had to take him out and --
L386994 +++$+++ u1919 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ CROW +++$+++ I put him in a barrel and sunk him in the bay.
L386993 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Where've you got him?  Is he all right?  Tell me, you fuck -- WHERE IS HE?!
L386992 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ He's alive?
L386991 +++$+++ u1919 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ CROW +++$+++ ... and that I needed his help.  It wasn't so bad really.  I sang him a song, made him laugh, bought him a pretzel.  I took care of him.  I made him happy.
L386989 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ His name was Sean.  Six years ago. Francis pool.
L386988 +++$+++ u1919 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ CROW +++$+++ Some -- somebody's father?
L386987 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Do you know who I am?
L386985 +++$+++ u1919 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ CROW +++$+++ Did I?  I don't recall... I got lots of kids from that place --
L386984 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Six years ago.  Baltimore.  You grabbed a kid at Francis public pool in the West End.
L386593 +++$+++ u1925 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ The female.
L386592 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Which one is that?
L386591 +++$+++ u1925 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ It's always in the more gifted of the three.
L386590 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ How do I even know which one has it?
L386585 +++$+++ u1925 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ Sometimes in order to see the light, you have to risk the dark.
L386584 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ I'll get EYEscanned a dozen times before I get within ten miles of Precrime.  They'll pick me up...
L386583 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ You're insane or you think I am.
L386582 +++$+++ u1925 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ Actually, I think you'll have to run out, but yes, that's what you have to do.
L386581 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ -- and then walk out.
L386580 +++$+++ u1925 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ If... you have one.
L386579 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ That's all, huh?  Just walk right into Precrime, go into the Temple, somehow tap into the Precogs, and then download this Minority Report...
L386578 +++$+++ u1925 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.
L386577 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Where?
L386576 +++$+++ u1925 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ The safest place of all.
L386575 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ What safe place is that?
L386574 +++$+++ u1925 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ I said the record is destroyed. The original report exists for all time.  I designed the system so that whenever a report occurred, it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared.
L386573 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ You said they're destroyed.
L386572 +++$+++ u1925 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ You shouldn't.  You shouldn't trust anyone... certainly not the Attorney General who wants it all for himself.  Not the young federal agent who wants your job.  Not even the old man who just wants to hang onto what he's created.  Don't trust anyone.  Just find the Minority Report.
L386571 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Why should I trust you?
L386570 +++$+++ u1925 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ Hold that thought.
L386569 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ I'm not gonna kill anybody.
L386568 +++$+++ u1925 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ But you will bring it down if you kill Leo Crow.  Why, that will be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime... didn't work.
L386567 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ You want to bring it down.
L386566 +++$+++ u1925 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ Do you?  Really?
L386565 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ I believe in that system...
L386564 +++$+++ u1925 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ The system would collapse.
L386563 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Insignificant to you maybe, but what about those people I put away with alternate futures?  My God, if the country knew there was a chance they might not --
L386562 +++$+++ u1925 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ Yes, of course, he knew, but at the time, he felt -- we both felt their existence was... an insignificant variable.
L386561 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Answer my question.  Did Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?
L386560 +++$+++ u1925 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ I used to joke with Lamar that we were the mother and father of Precrime.  Well, in my experience, parents often see their children as they want them to be, not as they are.
L386559 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Does Burgess know about this? About the Minority Report?
L386558 +++$+++ u1925 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ I'm saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might, just might, have an alternate future.
L386557 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ You're saying that I've halo'd innocent people?
L386556 +++$+++ u1925 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ Obviously, for Precrime to function, there can't be any suggestion of fallibility.  After all, what good is a Justice system that instills doubt?  It may be reasonable, but it's still doubt.
L386555 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Why?
L386554 +++$+++ u1925 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
L386553 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Jesus Christ -- why didn't I know about this?
L386552 +++$+++ u1925 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ Most of the time, all three Precognitives will see an event in the same way.  But once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the other two.
L386551 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ What?
L386549 +++$+++ u1925 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ I can't help you.  No one can.  The Precogs are never wrong.
L386548 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ So you won't help me?
L386547 +++$+++ u1925 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ How can you avoid a man you've never met?
L386546 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Not if I stay away from him.
L386545 +++$+++ u1925 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ And, yet, a chain of events has started.  A chain that will lead inexorably to his death.
L386544 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ I'm not a murderer.  I've never even met the man I'm supposed to kill.
L386543 +++$+++ u1925 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ So many of them... despite what we did for them.  Or maybe because of what we did to them.  It doesn't matter.  It's a perfect system now, isn't it?
L386542 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ You say some of the children died?
L386541 +++$+++ u1925 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ Back then, he was still a DA, and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom. You have to understand, these people were the dregs of society. But once they saw their children... he decided he would do whatever he could for them.  He's that way, you know, paternal about certain things.  Precrime.  The precogs. You.
L386540 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ And how did Lamar become involved?
L386539 +++$+++ u1925 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ It began as play.  A guessing game like you play with any toddler, except these children always guessed right.  And then the nightmares started. They were all different, but all the same.  They were all about murder.  And the murders were all happening.
L386537 +++$+++ u1925 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ You think the three in the tank come from a test tube?  They're merely the ones who survived.
L386536 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ You're talking about the precogs...
L386535 +++$+++ u1925 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.
L386534 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ Heal who?
L386533 +++$+++ u1925 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ I'm not.  I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
L386532 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ You don't seem all that proud.
L386531 +++$+++ u1925 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime.
L386530 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ What's so funny?
L386528 +++$+++ u1925 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ And how would I know that?
L386527 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
L386526 +++$+++ u1925 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ Just what is it you think I can do for you?
L386522 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ I'm... not... a... killer.
L386521 +++$+++ u1925 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ You have three minutes to tell me what you're doing here before I feed you to a few of my more predacious plants.
L386516 +++$+++ u1925 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ The vine -- the Baneberry that scratched you during your illegal climb over my wall...
L386515 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ The what?
L386514 +++$+++ u1925 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ Yes, I'm afraid that would be from the Doll's Eye.
L386513 +++$+++ u1916 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON +++$+++ I'm a little dizzy...
L386512 +++$+++ u1925 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ IRIS +++$+++ Something wrong?
L387054 +++$+++ u1917 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON'S VOICE +++$+++ Lara, I don't know why this is happening.  I just know they're setting me up.  I can't trust anybody.  I don't know who to talk to or where to go...  Lara?  Are you there?
L387053 +++$+++ u1928 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ LARA +++$+++ Then how did he --
L387052 +++$+++ u1917 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON'S VOICE +++$+++ Nothing.  I didn't kill him.
L387051 +++$+++ u1928 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ LARA +++$+++ Oh, God, what did you do?
L387050 +++$+++ u1917 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ ANDERTON'S VOICE +++$+++ He's dead, Lara.
L387049 +++$+++ u1928 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ LARA +++$+++ John?
L387225 +++$+++ u1928 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ LARA +++$+++ Anne Lively... But I never said she drowned.
L387224 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ All right.  Tell you what I'll do. First thing Monday, I'll look over the Witwer evidence and I'll have Gideon run the Containment files, see if anyone drowned a woman named -- what did you say her name was?
L387223 +++$+++ u1928 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ LARA +++$+++ Lamar --
L387222 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ But I also know why he married you: you're as stubborn as he is.
L387220 +++$+++ u1928 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ LARA +++$+++ No.  I don't think you do.  The other day, when he came to the cottage, he talked about a lot of things, but Danny Witwer, the man he was supposed to have just killed?  He didn't mention him.  He didn't say his name even once.
L387219 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ I understand.
L387217 +++$+++ u1928 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ LARA +++$+++ No.  That's what everyone thinks.  John shot a man dead in Baltimore six months before.
L387216 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ Sean --
L387215 +++$+++ u1928 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ LARA +++$+++ Lamar, do you know the reason why John came here to work with you?
L387213 +++$+++ u1928 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ LARA +++$+++ He also said Crow was a fake.
L387212 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ We know why John was tagged.
L387211 +++$+++ u1928 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ LARA +++$+++ John said something about him being set up because he "found out about her."
L387210 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ I don't know who that is.
L387209 +++$+++ u1928 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ LARA +++$+++ Anne Lively.  John was talking about her right before they took him.
L387208 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ Who?
L387205 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ I was, but this whole incident with John made me realize the fragility of what we've built here.  This is John's legacy as much as mine and I want to protect that.
L387204 +++$+++ u1928 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ LARA +++$+++ I thought you were retiring?
L387203 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ It's insanity around here.
L387197 +++$+++ u1928 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ LARA +++$+++ You look great.
L387196 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ I haven't worn this damn thing in years.  I just wanted to make sure it fits before tonight.
L387194 +++$+++ u1928 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ LARA +++$+++ No, it isn't, Lamar.  There was nothing anyone could do.
L387193 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ This is all my fault.
L387251 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ Thank you.  This is Burgess.
L387250 +++$+++ u1932 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ You have an emergency call on your private line.
L387243 +++$+++ u1932 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ I padded your expense account for the last six months.
L387242 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ How did you get this?
L387241 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ My God...
L387240 +++$+++ u1932 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ Congratulations, sir.
L387227 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ I'll be right there.
L387226 +++$+++ u1932 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ Sir, the press conference is starting.
L387202 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ Not.  Now.
L387201 +++$+++ u1932 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ He just wanted a few minutes before --
L387200 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ Tell him not now.
L387199 +++$+++ u1932 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ SECRETARY +++$+++ The guy from USA Today is here.
L387104 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ Nothing.  No footsteps coming up the stairs.  No hovercraft out the window.  No clickity click of little spyders.  No one crashing through that door.  And do you know why I don't hear any of those things, Danny?  Because right now, the Precogs can't see.
L387103 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ What?
L387102 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ Shhh.  You know what I hear?
L387101 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ Of course, it would have to be someone with access to the Prevision in the first place, someone fairly high up --
L387100 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ Yes.
L387099 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ So there is a way to fool the system?
L387098 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ We teach the tech's to identify them and disregard...
L387097 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ Precog Deja Vu...
L387096 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ Yes... It's called an echo.  The act of murder is such a violent disturbance in the future continuum that it sometimes repeats to the Precogs.
L387095 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ By fooling the system.  All someone would have to do is wait for Precrime to stop the murder from taking place, then, a few minutes later, commit the crime in exactly the same way.
L387094 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ How?
L387093 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
L387092 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ Danny, tell me what you're thinking.
L387091 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ I did find it.  It was inside of Agatha all this time.  So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?
L387090 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ I know.  He came to me, told me about the missing data stream.  He was concerned that you might find it.
L387089 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ According to the Sentry, Anderton was watching this at Containment right before he was tagged.
L387088 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ This murder is happening at two different times.
L387087 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ I don't understand --
L387086 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ Now the second image.  Watch the water.  The wind's changed.  The ripples are going the other way.
L387084 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ Not quite.
L387083 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ It's the same prevision.
L387082 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ Yes.  This is from the twins, Arthur and Dashiel.  Agatha's stream was missing.  Now this one is from the cyberparlor.  Anderton downloaded it directly from Agatha. Watch...
L387081 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ He told me about this.  You got this from Containment?
L387075 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ Wait, just a second...
L387074 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ Good God.  What was that?
L387073 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ Where are you?
L387072 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ I don't wanna say over the phone, but I think we may be chasing the wrong man.
L387071 +++$+++ u1918 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ BURGESS +++$+++ What?
L387070 +++$+++ u1934 +++$+++ m126 +++$+++ WITWER +++$+++ Lamar, I found something.
