L180402 +++$+++ u835 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ NORA +++$+++ Yes... well, good day, Mr. Merrick.
L180401 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ I'll have to find some more.
L180399 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ ...I learned a long time ago.
L180398 +++$+++ u835 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ NORA +++$+++ The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this?
L180397 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ The main spire.
L180396 +++$+++ u835 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ NORA +++$+++ What's this?
L180395 +++$+++ u835 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ NORA +++$+++ It's alright, it was thrown away. No one wants it. It's just that it's a little dirty, that's all.
L180394 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.
L180393 +++$+++ u835 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ NORA +++$+++ The hallway? Oh, the wastecan!
L180392 +++$+++ u835 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ NORA +++$+++ Where did you get this box?
L180391 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Thank you... very much.
L180390 +++$+++ u835 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ NORA +++$+++ But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good.
L180389 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Yes.
L180388 +++$+++ u835 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ NORA +++$+++ What? Oh! I see! It's St. Phillips. Oh, of course. Why... why that's very good, I mean you've gotten the windows and arches just right.
L180385 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Good morning.
L180384 +++$+++ u835 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ NORA +++$+++ Good morning, Mr. Merrick.
L180329 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ No, nothing.
L180328 +++$+++ u835 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ NORA +++$+++ Well, if there is nothing more, I suppose we'll be leaving you now.
L180327 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Thank you very much.
L180325 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Yes.
L180324 +++$+++ u835 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ NORA +++$+++ Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?
L180732 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ You too, my friend. Goodnight.
L180731 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Goodnight John. Sleep well.
L180729 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ No, no, I wouldn't change a thing.
L180728 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Then I shouldn't change anything?
L180727 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ No, John, not one that I can see.
L180726 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?
L180725 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Yes John?
L180723 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ I'm glad, John. Goodnight.
L180722 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Oh yes! It was wonderful!
L180721 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Splendid. it's truly a masterpiece. Well, I suppose I'll be on my way now. I hoped your enjoyed yourself this evening.
L180720 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Yes, very soon.
L180719 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Will the cathedral be finished soon, John?
L180716 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ It's for you, John. It's all for you. Go ahead, let them see you.
L180715 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Oh no, I couldn't.
L180714 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Stand up, John. Let them see you.
L180689 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ John.... how can you ever forgive me?
L180688 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Mr. Treves! Treves.
L180551 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Mr. Treves. Thank you my... friends.
L180550 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Are you sure? Because I can take it back.
L180549 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.
L180548 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Is it the one you wanted?
L180547 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ There is one more thing, John. Here.
L180546 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ My home.
L180545 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Please... please thank the governing committee for me. I will do my utmost to merit their kindness.
L180544 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Yes.
L180543 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ You did this for me?
L180542 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Yes, John.
L180541 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ ...my... home?
L180483 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ You don't think it's too gaudy, do you?
L180482 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ You want a dressing bag, John?
L180481 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Please John, it would give me so much pleasure to give you something. Something just for yourself. Isn't there something you would like to have?
L180480 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you.
L180479 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ How blind of me. Is there anything else, John, anything at all that I could get for you?
L180478 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Yes, soon I will start the main spire, but I must finish these columns first, How kind of her!
L180477 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ The cathedral is coming along nicely.
L180471 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ I thought as much.
L180470 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ No John, I can't. I can care for you, but I can't cure you.
L180469 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ ...Can you cure me?
L180468 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Yes, John?
L180467 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Mr. Treves, there is something I've been meaning to ask you for some time...
L180466 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Never, oh! Never, nothing will die. the stream flows the wind blows the heart beats Nothing will die.
L180465 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ When will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye? When will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky? When will the clouds be aweary of fleeting? When will the heart be aweary of beating, and nature die?
L180406 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ John, there's someone here who would like to meet you. Would that be alright?
L180405 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Good morning.
L180404 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Good morning, John.
L180378 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Here.
L180377 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Your mother?
L180376 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Would you... would you like to see my mother?
L180368 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Friends. Ah yes, friends! How nice.
L180367 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.
L180366 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ The Children. Where are your children
L180365 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Of course.
L180364 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ The children! May I see?
L180363 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Oh, our relatives... the children.
L180362 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Who are they of?
L180361 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Oh yes.
L180360 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ I love the way you've arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that the way it's done in most houses?
L180359 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Not at all, John.
L180358 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit with you very much. It's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. I'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself.
L180357 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ How is your tea, John?
L180356 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Ohhh...
L180355 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ That's a canopy, John.
L180354 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Well, it's a lovely bedroom. What do you call that thing above the bed?
L180339 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ I'm not used to such kindness. From a beautiful woman.
L180338 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ John... what's the matter? John... why are you upset?
L180332 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ When one is invited to tea, one must look one's best.
L180331 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Thank you very much.
L180330 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ You look splendid, John.
L180312 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ I promise you. You will never see the inside of that horrible place again. You will never, ever go back to the workhouse... or that man. It's a splendid room, don't you think?
L180311 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ How long will I stay here?
L180310 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Of course! What did you think?
L180309 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ The hospital?
L180308 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Yes.
L180307 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ This... is my new home?
L180297 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Very well, thank you. I have something for you, John. I'm sure you'll enjoy it, it's very popular.
L180296 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?
L180295 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Good evening. How are you feeling?
L180232 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ We do have a lot to talk about, don't we?
L180231 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me.
L180230 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ I never thought to ask. How can you ever forgive me?
L180229 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ You did not ask me.
L180228 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Why did you let me go on like that, teaching you what you already knew? Why didn't you tell me you could read?
L180196 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ But the variety of food here is very pleasing... I commend you.
L180195 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ ...Yes potatoes... but...
L180191 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Oh yes! It is much better than what I am used to.
L180190 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Mr. Merrick likes the food here. Don't you John?
L180182 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Hello... my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you.
L180181 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ John, may I introduce you to Sir Carr Gomm.
L180173 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Hello, my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you!
L180172 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Very good, very good. Now, when your visitor comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. I will introduce him to you and you will say the words you've learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? I will say "May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm." And you will say...
L180171 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Righteousness for his namesake.
L180170 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Righteousness...
L180169 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want, he maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside still waters. He restoreth my soul: He Guideth me in the paths of righteousness...
L180109 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Hello, my name is John Merrick.
L180108 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Why, my dear Mrs. Mothershead, how good of you to join us. Mr. Merrick, will you please introduce yourself?
L180104 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Hello... my name is... John Merrick.
L180103 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Well, that's alright. I understand you. Now, say the whole thing again, Hello ...
L180102 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Mmmerrick.
L180101 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Say "Mmmerrick."
L180100 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Mmmerrick.
L180099 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Say "Mmmerrick."
L180098 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Merrick...
L180097 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Say "Merrick".
L180096 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ John... Merrick
L180095 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ John Merrick.
L180094 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ My... name is...
L180093 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ My name is...
L180092 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Hello...
L180091 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Excellent! Now, say... "Hello"
L180090 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Yes.
L180089 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand?
L180088 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Yes!
L180087 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ That's much better. I could understand that "yes".
L180086 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Yyess.
L180085 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Yyyess.
L180084 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ ...Yyes
L180083 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Yes John!
L180082 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Yyyy... Yyye... yyyess.
L180540 +++$+++ u833 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MOTHERSHEAD +++$+++ Welcome home, John.
L180539 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ So you see, John, there's no need for a lighthouse. All your friends are here.
L180493 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ John thinks it's very dashing. Something no gentleman should be without. I'm inclined to agree.
L180492 +++$+++ u833 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MOTHERSHEAD +++$+++ Well...
L180491 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.
L180490 +++$+++ u833 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MOTHERSHEAD +++$+++ A dressing bag?
L180489 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Yes. John wants it.
L180488 +++$+++ u833 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MOTHERSHEAD +++$+++ Very smart indeed.
L180487 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ A dressing bag.
L180486 +++$+++ u833 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MOTHERSHEAD +++$+++ Yes sir.  What's that?
L180485 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
L180484 +++$+++ u833 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MOTHERSHEAD +++$+++ Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.
L180463 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ You're right, Mothershead, please forgive me... Of course, I appreciate everything you've done for John, and I'm glad that you are concerned about his welfare. But, I'm the physician in charge and I must do what I think best. I'm also very late, so please forgive me.
L180462 +++$+++ u833 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MOTHERSHEAD +++$+++ I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it.
L180461 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Aren't you being just a little harsh, Mothershead? You yourself hardly treated John with much loving kindness when he first arrived.
L180460 +++$+++ u833 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MOTHERSHEAD +++$+++ But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John, they're just trying to impress their friends.
L180459 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Now Mothershead, you have to understand that this is very good for John. He relishes contact with people outside the hospital...
L180458 +++$+++ u833 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MOTHERSHEAD +++$+++ I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir.
L180457 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue.
L180456 +++$+++ u833 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MOTHERSHEAD +++$+++ Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.
L180455 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Incredible, isn't it? Well, I think John has had enough visitors for one day, Mothershead. I've got a lecture at the college, I'll be back this evening.
L180453 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ I regret that I must leave you here, m' Lord, m' Lady. Thank you so much for coming. It was an act of the greatest charity.
L180452 +++$+++ u833 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MOTHERSHEAD +++$+++ Watery headed bunch.
L180113 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ I'm sure that if Mr. Merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. Now I'm not expecting miracles. I'm not saying he'll be able to read or write, but I do think that I can get him to speak for himself. I'm going to arrange things with Carr Gomm right now.  That was very good, John, very good. That's all for today. We shall do some more tomorrow. Mothershead?
L180112 +++$+++ u833 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MOTHERSHEAD +++$+++ Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.
L180111 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.
L180110 +++$+++ u833 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MOTHERSHEAD +++$+++ Good Lord, Mr. Treves!
L180076 +++$+++ u833 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MOTHERSHEAD +++$+++ Perhaps you've got the time for that, Mr. Treves, I certainly don't. I've got an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. Don't waste your time with him sir, it's like talking to a wall. I don't mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? I'll be back later for his bath. And Mr. Carr Gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. Good day sir.
L180075 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ He's had his share of "smacks", Mothershead. I expect that's what drives him under the bed. We must use patience and understanding with this man.
L180071 +++$+++ u833 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MOTHERSHEAD +++$+++ Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle it.
L180070 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ No, he's very upset about something.
L180069 +++$+++ u833 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MOTHERSHEAD +++$+++ Won't come out, eh?
L180068 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning.
L180067 +++$+++ u833 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MOTHERSHEAD +++$+++ Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?
L180041 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Yes! The workhouse!
L180040 +++$+++ u833 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MOTHERSHEAD +++$+++ The workhouse.
L180033 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Yes... Yes, let's go in.
L180032 +++$+++ u833 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MOTHERSHEAD +++$+++ Sir, you don't have to worry about me. I'm not the sort to cry out. Shall we go in?
L180031 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Yes... Well, I want you to clear up a little mess, a breakfast tray was spilt. And bring up another breakfast. When you've done that, you and I shall give the man a bath. But, Mothershead, I'm counting on your many years of experience to get you through this, Above all, do not scream, do not cry out, or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him...

L180029 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Good. Excellent. Now then, Mrs. Mothershead, I want you to come into this room with me. Inside there is a man with a rather... unfortunate appearance.
