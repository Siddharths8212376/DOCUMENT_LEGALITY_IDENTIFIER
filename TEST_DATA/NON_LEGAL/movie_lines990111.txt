L373681 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ OK, ok...
L373680 +++$+++ u6539 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ For these prices don't be particular. That's all they had - but next week we'll see...
L373679 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Oh great...hey - Winstons?
L374232 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Bye.
L374231 +++$+++ u6533 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Why not here...Ok nevermind...6th Avenue and Waverly.
L374230 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Ok.  Chinese.  We'll meet on the corner of 6th Avenue and Waverly Place after you finish.
L374229 +++$+++ u6533 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Chinese food?
L374228 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Yeah, you know...you greet the people...see them to their tables... well...it'll be different though... Listen...why don't we get together and talk after your show tonight.
L374227 +++$+++ u6533 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Hostess?
L374226 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ No...no stripping...as the hostess.
L374225 +++$+++ u6533 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Stripper?
L374224 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I was thinking maybe you'd do very nicely for the place.
L374223 +++$+++ u6533 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ That's nice.
L374222 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ In a little while...I'm gonna have the opportunity of opening my own place...not here...much nicer than this...uptown...sort of nite-club and restaurant and everything.
L374221 +++$+++ u6533 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ I know.
L374220 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ No, I'm serious...You're really good.
L374219 +++$+++ u6533 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Fine.
L374218 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You know Diane...I've been wanting to talk to you for a while now...er... a...  aside from all that joking around we do out there...when you're on...I... a...I really...think that you're a terrific performer...
L374217 +++$+++ u6533 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ DIANE +++$+++ Fine.
L374216 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Diane, how are you feeling?
L374152 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Oh yeah, that's a possibility.
L374151 +++$+++ u6534 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ Well, maybe you missed something?
L374148 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ All right.
L374147 +++$+++ u6534 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ Who knows?  It's not hard to figure out what she'll wind up like.  When the respect for parents breaks down, that's bad...you know I'm "cumpari" with them...so I take an interest.  You live next door, keep an eye open...but don't get involved.
L374146 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What do they expect you to say?
L374145 +++$+++ u6534 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ Her mother and father come to me and ask advice...she wants to leave...get her own apartment...worries them sick...what am I gonna tell them?  Lock her up?
L374144 +++$+++ u6534 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ Yeah.  That's what I said, sick in the head.
L374143 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ No, she's got epilepsy.
L374142 +++$+++ u6534 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ ...The one who's sick, right?  In the head.
L374141 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Teresa.
L374140 +++$+++ u6534 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ His whole family has problems...his cousin, the girl who lives next door to you...
L374135 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ What did he do?
L374134 +++$+++ u6534 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ ...but it's the same thing, all the same...they're in there by having something on somebody...and when that doesn't work...they fight...Our life has honor...we have no show to put on because we do what we have to do.  They know where to come when they need us.  I realize this during the war...World War II...Vito Genovese... during WWII he worked with the government, taking care of the docks...
L374129 +++$+++ u6534 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ What I don't understand is why you have to go to college to read these books that you're gonna read anyway.
L374128 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Oh yes, he's pretty good.
L374116 +++$+++ u6534 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ You know, this boy over here, once, long time ago, tried to enrich my mind...so he gives me a book by this Hemin fella...to read, so I read it.
L374115 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Hemmingway.  Killed himself.  I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.
L374114 +++$+++ u6534 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth...  ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning?  Heming?
L374113 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I really couldn't believe it when you told me, you know that?
L373968 +++$+++ u6534 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ Our friend, Groppi, went to his mother's house.  And when he was there...at night...
L373967 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Who me? ...No, I don't know, not me...all I know is...
L373966 +++$+++ u6534 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ You heard what happened to GROPPI, eh?
L373965 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Oh...around...why?
L373964 +++$+++ u6534 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ Hey, where you been?
L373963 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Ok.
L373962 +++$+++ u6534 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ Take a drink!
L373913 +++$+++ u6534 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ No...his business is bad.  But I'll decide what to do and you...and you just keep out of anything that might...might...er draw attention to you.
L373912 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ About Oscar...I think he put on this act...about the restaurant being in bad shape and all that. He can't make the payments...I don't know what to make of it.  He says Groppi's run off with a girl. I could help if you want.
L373911 +++$+++ u6534 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ Yes, you did.
L373910 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You're right uncle.  I must have gotten it confused with something else.
L373909 +++$+++ u6534 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ No you weren't.
L373908 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ About that shooting last night...I was there and...
L373907 +++$+++ u6534 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ GIOVANNI +++$+++ Fine.  Did you have a good time last night?
L373906 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Uncle, how are you feeling?
L374150 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Oh, that's ok...I've been in and out of this place fifty times.
L374149 +++$+++ u6538 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MARIO +++$+++ Why don't you take a look around the place if you want?
L374131 +++$+++ u6538 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MARIO +++$+++ Charlie, couple of courses isn't enough to get you student deferred... I mean if they wanted to draft you, you would've been drafted by now.
L374130 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ It's only a couple of courses...just for the draft.
L374124 +++$+++ u6538 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MARIO +++$+++ Oh yeah...didn't read it but I saw the movie...Gregory Peck...pretty good.
L374123 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ "Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber."
L374122 +++$+++ u6538 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MARIO +++$+++ Wha?
L374121 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ "Francis Macomber."
L374120 +++$+++ u6538 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MARIO +++$+++ No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.
L374119 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Nothing.
L374118 +++$+++ u6538 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ MARIO +++$+++ What was it?
L374117 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Wasn't a book...was a short story.
L374242 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ For God's Sakes...I told you before...nothing.  Charlie, I can't stay in here too long at this hour...will you please listen to me?
L374241 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Are you sure he didn't say anything to you about tonight?
L374214 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ But...
L374213 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.
L374212 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ Charlie...I've got to see you.  I want to talk...
L374211 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Teresa?...Yeah, Charlie.  Listen, I'm looking for your cousin.  Yeah, well today's Tuesday, payday.  I haven't seen him all day...no...well, have you got any idea where he is?  I know it's early yet but I'm just getting worried that's all...
L374073 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Now don't get excited.  Don't get excited!!
L374072 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ The building on the corner.  That one!  He's been on the roof a half hour now!
L373947 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ The green capsules in the top drawer.
L373946 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You've been running round too much. Bet you've been forgetting your medicine.
L373945 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ I'm sleepy.
L373944 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Of all people.  Now say the truth. Do I look like Che Guevara.  C'mon.
L373943 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ Ummmmmmmmmmmmm.
L373942 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ ...He must have heard the name from those T.V.'s in the hall that were blaring all the time.  I remember GUEVARA was in town at the time. Must've heard it from there I guess...but that's funny, isn't it?
L373938 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ I know...I know.
L373937 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ I can take care of myself.  You know that.
L373936 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Well you can't blame them in a way.
L373935 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ You know why...with my parents.
L373934 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Uhuh...probably a good idea.  Why don't you do it this time?
L373933 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ I'm going to take that apartment uptown.
L373931 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Watch your language.
L373930 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ You're intolerable today.
L373929 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ That W.A.S.P. bastard.
L373928 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ No.  Of course he lives there. Would I point it out to you if he didn't?
L373927 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ Sure...He lives there?
L373926 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ See that...know who lives there? The name George Earhardt mean anything to you?
L373924 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ That's the word...preoccupied.
L373923 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ I know you don't.  You've been very preoccupied lately.
L373922 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Take your time.  I don't care.
L373921 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ It was nothing.  I'm almost finished.
L373920 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Yeah...but don't worry about that now.  The Hemmingway one is first.
L373919 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ A paper on that one too?
L373918 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Bore.
L373917 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ Ok.
L373916 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ No...we can come back in a couple of weeks.  Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right.
L373915 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ C'mon Charlie...one more day.  I'll call in sick for work.
L373862 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Not sick...just stupid.  Speaking of stupid, your cousin last night was feeling so good he decided to break into your mother's house...to get some food.
L373861 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ It's still sick.
L373860 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You missed the point.  The kid's a climber...not very bright...but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation.  He thinks he's in good standing.
L373859 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ It doesn't make any sense.  He wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy...not unless it was personal.
L373858 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ CHRIST, you should have seen it. Unbelievable.  The kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like Rasputin. That kid was scared.  Not half as much as we were though.
L373857 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ No.
L373856 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Did you?
L373855 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ Alright... Hey, did you hear any more about what happened last night?
L373854 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Don't ask.
L373853 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ What is it now?
L373852 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ You know...like restaurants, night clubs...
L373851 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ Anything specific?
L373850 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ See if you can get your hands on some pamphlets on laws or by laws...or proprietorship...you know...at your place.
L373849 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Nobody knows anything, believe me.
L373848 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ Charlie...?
L373847 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Maybe, who knows.
L373846 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ An apartment uptown?  Downtown?
L373845 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Well, if things go the way I hope they'll go, this money business will take care of itself.  God willing.
L373844 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ It's all right.
L373843 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Sure...it's not that...I mean...
L373842 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ I don't mind.
L373841 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Well...
L373840 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ Please take it.
L373839 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ Here.
L373838 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Well...with the hotel that's ten... fifteen...
L373837 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ Do you have enough?
L373836 +++$+++ u6532 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ CHARLIE +++$+++ Ok, we'll go for lunch.
L373835 +++$+++ u6542 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TERESA +++$+++ I'd like to eat something before I go back to work.
L374196 +++$+++ u6536 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Hey, c'mon - no bullshit - friends.
L374195 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Count it.
L374194 +++$+++ u6536 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ Don't count it...it's all there.
L374182 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ I feel fine--nothing wrong with me.
L374181 +++$+++ u6536 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ What's the matter with this kid?
L374180 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Girls?  You call those skanks girls?!
L374179 +++$+++ u6536 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOEY +++$+++ The girls like it loud.
L374178 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Lower the fuckin music--I can't hear nothin.
L374174 +++$+++ u6543 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++  Shut up.
L374173 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Scumbag--
L373757 +++$+++ u6543 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ We'll close up as soon as everybody leaves.
L373756 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Will you guys shut up with the witches and tigers.  Tony, you gonna close the place, we get out of here, get something to eat, or what?
L373702 +++$+++ u6543 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Yeah, so things'll be even.
L373701 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ Put it on the little tab so that it balances with the big one.
L373700 +++$+++ u6543 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Which one, the big tab or the little tab?
L373699 +++$+++ u6537 +++$+++ m434 +++$+++ JOHNNY BOY +++$+++ and a double for you and Charlie here.  And put it on my tab, willya?

L376182 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ You think so?
L376181 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ -- But he does seem very nice.
L376179 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ ...I don't know, Daddy seems funny to me.  Ever since Joe showed.  It's like he dropped from the clouds...
L376178 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Nothing's going on.  Maybe he doesn't want to be alone.  He's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
L376177 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ ...We're never all together two nights in a row.  Maybe Christmas, Thanksgiving, that's it.  What's going on?

L375862 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ ...I'm here, aren't I?  Wouldn't miss a loose end meeting.  What's on the table for discussion?  Party favors, flowers -- hi Dad, hi Drew --
L375861 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ You ate?
L375860 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Hi, everybody.  Sorry to be late -- had to have dinner with my depart- ment chief --
L375522 +++$+++ u6555 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ SUSAN +++$+++ Drew called from the AStar, they're still two minutes away.
L375521 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ I'm Allison, you're 'honey'.
L376271 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Well, maybe next time Joe goes, he'll take us along.
L376270 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ Did he?  That's more than we get to do.
L375894 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ Very.
L375893 +++$+++ u6544 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ ALLISON +++$+++ He's cute.
L375892 +++$+++ u6548 +++$+++ m435 +++$+++ DREW +++$+++ That was 'Joe'.
