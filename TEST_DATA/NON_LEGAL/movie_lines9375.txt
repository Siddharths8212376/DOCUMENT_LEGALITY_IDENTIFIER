L504265 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ So you're going to stop acting?
L504264 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.
L504263 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason. So I think it's great. It's time. You've got to have your eyes open, that's all. I mean, look at me. I thought Victoria and I were set for life.
L504262 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Come on, do you think I'm doing the right thing? Tell the truth. You've been through it.
L504261 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Whoa.
L504260 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You think I'm making a mistake marrying Christine?
L504259 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back.
L504258 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ We should have driven.
L504257 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ It's not even a mile.
L504256 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I thought you said it was close. Now I'm all pitted out.
L504255 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Just a minute!
L504254 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Hey Jack, hurry up!
L504253 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Want some?
L504252 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Are you chewing gum?
L504251 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yeah, that would be a good move.
L504250 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You know, you could work in a wine store.
L504246 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Usually they start you on the wines with learning disabilities, but this one's pretty damn good.  This is the new one, right, Chris?
L504245 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ How would you rate this one?
L504244 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Now.
L504243 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ When do we get to drink it?
L504242 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ That's what you do with every one.
L504240 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Now set your glass down and get some air into it.
L504239 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Huh. Maybe a little strawberry. Yeah, strawberry. I'm not so sure about the cheese.
L504237 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I don't know. Wine? Fermented grapes?
L504236 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What do you smell?
L504234 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Now tip it. What you're doing here is checking for color density as it thins toward the rim. Tells you how old it is, among other things, usually more important with reds. This is a very young wine, so it's going to retain its color pretty solidly. Now stick your nose in it.
L504233 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Huh.
L504232 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Depends on the varietal. Just get a sense of it. Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy? Inky? Amber, whatever...
L504231 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What color is it supposed to be?
L504230 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ First take your glass and examine the wine against the light. You're looking at color and clarity.
L504228 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Pinot noir? Not again!  You know, not all Pinots are noir.
L504227 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir.
L504226 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ This is rose, right?
L504220 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Now we're talking.
L504219 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Baked with a butter-lime glaze.
L504214 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I owe her a call anyway.
L504213 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.
L504212 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Let me call Christine.
L504211 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference.
L504210 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish?
L504209 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?
L504208 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I told you. Filet and salmon.
L504207 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ So what'd you guys finally decide on for the menu?
L504206 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Thanks, Jack. So do I.  Here we are.
L504205 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel sells.
L504203 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I like all varietals. I just don't generally like the way they manipulate Chardonnay in California -- too much oak and secondary malolactic fermentation.
L504202 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I thought you hated Chardonnay.
L504201 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ These guys make top-notch Pinot and Chardonnay. One of the best producers in Santa Barbara county.  Look how beautiful this view is. What a day!
L504200 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Whatever's closest, man. I need a glass.
L504199 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You know what? Let's take the Santa Rosa turnoff and hit Sanford first.
L504197 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ And get your bone smooched.
L504196 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Jack. This week is not about me. It's about you. I'm going to show you a good time. We're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style.
L504195 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Well, I say fuck that. You need to get your joint worked on, that's what you need.
L504194 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ And Lexapro, yes.
L504193 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax?
L504192 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I went on Monday. But I spent most of the time helping him with his computer.
L504191 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You still seeing that shrink?
L504190 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I'm working on it.
L504189 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books.
L504188 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I'd rather have a knife.
L504187 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ It'd be the best thing for you. You know what? I'm going to get you laid this week. That's going to be my best man gift to you. I'm not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit.
L504185 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ It's not worth it. You pay too big a price. It's never free.
L504184 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages.
L504183 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.
L504182 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ That's your problem, Miles.
L504181 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.
L504180 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Fuck, man. Too early in the morning for that, you know what I mean?
L504169 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ And Miles is my best man, Mrs. Raymond. My main man.
L504168 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ This Saturday, Mom, remember? We told you.
L504148 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Just a second. Guy's going for $2500.
L504147 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Let me show you something. The secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released, you keep pressure on it so you don't --
L504131 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ That's a good age.
L504130 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Um... seventy... something.
L504129 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ How old's she going to be?
L504128 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ It's her birthday tomorrow. And I don't feel right driving by her house and not stopping in, okay? It'll just take a second. She's right off the freeway.
L504127 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
L504126 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.
L504125 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What?
L504124 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I've just got to make one quick stop. Won't take a second.
L504123 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Whoa, why are we getting off?
L504098 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Well, then I guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different.
L504097 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.
L504096 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Oh yeah. Much better.
L504095 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ How about the new ending? Did you like that?
L504094 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something.
L504093 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ And?
L504092 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Oh, yeah. Yeah.
L504091 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Did you read the latest draft, by the way?
L504090 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Sure is tasty.
L504089 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color.
L504088 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Just tell me.
L504087 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron.
L504086 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?
L504085 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ 100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore.
L504084 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Oh, that's tasty.
L504083 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ You know how long I've been begging to take you on the wine tour. I was beginning to think it was never going to happen.
L504082 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah.
L504081 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass behavior, I'm really glad we're finally getting this time together.
L504080 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Shut up.  Here's to a great week.
L504078 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ That's a 1992 Byron. It's really rare. Don't open it now. I've been saving it!
L504077 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.
L504076 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Don't open that now. It's warm.
L504074 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ It's a long shot, all right? And Conundrum is just a small specialty press anyway. I'm not getting my hopes up. I've stopped caring. That's it. I've stopped caring.
L504073 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ I don't know. Senior editor? Sounds like you're in to me.
L504072 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ ...and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor. She was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and... It's always like this. It's always a fucking waiting game. I've been through it too many times already.
L504071 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Yeah, Conundrum.
L504070 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
L504069 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ You said you had it all lined up.
L504068 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Why did you tell them my book was being published?
L504067 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Okay, there was a tasting last night. But I wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up. Check out the box.
L504066 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Come on. You're fucking hungover.
L504065 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I can't help the traffic.
L504064 +++$+++ u2735 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Where the fuck were you, man? I was dying in there. We were supposed to be a hundred miles away by now.
L504928 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if you even care, but I had to call and tell you again how much I enjoyed our time together and how sorry I am things turned out the way they did. I think you're great, Maya -- always have. From the first time you waited on me.  And while I'm at it, I guess you should know that my book is not getting published. I thought this one had a chance, but I was wrong. Again. Don't bother reading it -- you've got better things to do. So you see I'm not much of a writer. I'm not anything really. The only real talent I seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand. We're leaving in the morning, and I want you to know that I take with me wonderful memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
L504927 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.
L504833 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ And I haven't been with anyone since my divorce. This has been a big deal for me, Maya -- hanging out with you, and last night. I really like you, Maya. And I'm not Jack. I'm just his... his freshman roommate from San Diego State.
L504832 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ You know, I just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception. And I've been doing just fine.
L504831 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Yeah.
L504830 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Oh, Maya. No.
L504829 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ But you wanted to fuck me first.
L504828 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Please believe me. I was even on the verge of telling you last night, but...
L504827 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I'm sure he believed every word.
L504826 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
L504825 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ He's an actor, so it can't be good.
L504824 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Do you know what he's been saying to her?
L504823 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I've told him. I've told him over and over, but he's out of control.
L504822 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Don't touch me. Just take me home.
L504821 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Maya.
L504820 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Of course I was. I mean, just now I could have made up some story, but I didn't. I told you the truth.
L504819 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Were you ever going to say anything?
L504817 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ What rehearsal dinner?
L504816 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ No, we've got to get back Friday for the rehearsal dinner.
L504815 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Did you hear about this Bordeaux tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara Saturday night? It's a little pricey, but if you wanted to go, I'd be into it. Why don't you stay through the weekend?
L504814 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Okay.
L504813 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ About two-thirty.
L504812 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Great. What's the latest we can get there?
L504811 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.
L504807 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ You too.
L504806 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Well, nice to see you now.
L504805 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ I had class.
L504804 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped by for a drink. Didn't see you.
L504803 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Hey, Miles, I heard you came by the restaurant last night looking for me.
L504642 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Goodnight, Miles.
L504641 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Hope you like it. Feel free to stop reading at any time. I'll take no offense.
L504639 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course.
L504638 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Um... did you still want to read my novel?
L504637 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Okay. See you around.
L504636 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Good. So did I.
L504635 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.
L504634 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Got it.
L504633 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ You know how to get back to the Windmill, right?
L504628 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Yeah.
L504627 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Bathroom over there?
L504625 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Like what a fraud he was.
L504624 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yeah? Like what?
L504623 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ I suppose I got really into wine originally through my ex-husband. He had a big, kind of show-off cellar. But then I found out that I have a really sharp palate, and the more I drank, the more I liked what it made me think about.
L504622 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I don't know. Why are you into wine?
L504621 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ What about me?
L504620 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I mean, Cabernets can be powerful and exalting, but they seem prosaic to me for some reason. By comparison. How about you?
L504618 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Why are you so into Pinot? It's like a thing with you.
L504617 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Sure.
L504616 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Can I ask you a personal question?
L504615 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.
L504614 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos.  Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?
L504613 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...
L504612 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Well...
L504611 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
L504610 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
L504609 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know there was a college here.
L504608 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Yeah. I'm working on a masters in horticulture. Chipping away at it.
L504607 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ A paper?
L504606 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes.
L504605 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yeah. Thanks.
L504604 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.
L504603 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It shifts around a lot. Like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father. And some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative, and then it evolves -- or devolves -- into a kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery -- you know, with no real resolution.
L504602 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?
L504601 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Um... yeah but it's more...
L504600 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Oh. You mean... today?
L504599 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ "The Day After Yesterday."
L504598 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ What's the title?
L504597 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Well, it's a little difficult to summarize. It begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke. Kind of based on personal experience, but only loosely.
L504596 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ So what's your novel about?
L504595 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yeah. Definitely.
L504594 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Yeah, weird. But great.
L504593 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird. Out of context.
L504592 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ It's kind of weird sitting here with you in Stephanie's house. All those times you came into the restaurant. It's like you're a real person now. Almost.
L504589 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Yeah, same here.
L504588 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up. That was the one unpolluted part of my divorce -- no kids.
L504587 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ You got kids?
L504585 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ She's with her grandmother. She's with Steph's mom. She spends a lot of time over there. Steph's... well, she's Stephanie.
L504584 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Is she sleeping or...?
L504583 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
L504582 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is cute.
L504581 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Yeah, I'd say you're right on the money.
L504580 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
L504579 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. Really good. How about you?
L504578 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ Eighty-eight Sassicaia.
L504577 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ What was the bottle that did it?
L504576 +++$+++ u2737 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MAYA +++$+++ I started to get serious about seven years ago.
L504575 +++$+++ u2738 +++$+++ m178 +++$+++ MILES +++$+++ How long have you been into wine?
