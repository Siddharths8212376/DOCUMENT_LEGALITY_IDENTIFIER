L435743 +++$+++ u2434 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HOOVER +++$+++ Well, then we're going to take that power away from those bastards.
L435742 +++$+++ u2438 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ RODGERS +++$+++ Well... like they say, there's a Panther born every minute in the ghetto. Uh... we seem to have "underestimated" the support of the Black community. It's their power base...
L435741 +++$+++ u2434 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HOOVER +++$+++ Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?
L435740 +++$+++ u2438 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ RODGERS +++$+++ Granted, the Free Huey thing has become a bit of a rallying cry for the left...
L435547 +++$+++ u2434 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HOOVER +++$+++ Work harder. And get me some results. Those Black Bastards could be up to anything.
L435546 +++$+++ u2438 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ RODGERS +++$+++ We're working on that...
L435545 +++$+++ u2434 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HOOVER +++$+++ Not good enough Rodgers. Not good enough at all. Black terrorists on the floor of a State Capitol. I will not say this again, these Negro Commies are to be stopped and now. You tear them down. Either from the outside or the inside.
L435544 +++$+++ u2438 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ RODGERS +++$+++ ...at least that takes Bobby Seale off the street...
L435679 +++$+++ u2435 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ You know I think Brother Judge needs our support right now, not our suspicion  This is beautiful man. Folks around here never read the truth like this before.
L435678 +++$+++ u2442 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ TYRONE +++$+++ Yeah man, but where's Judge?
L435589 +++$+++ u2435 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Look... can we deal with this tomorrow... I'm tired...
L435588 +++$+++ u2442 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ TYRONE +++$+++ Alone...
L435587 +++$+++ u2435 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ So talk...
L435586 +++$+++ u2442 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ TYRONE +++$+++ Huey man I got to talk with you...
L435518 +++$+++ u2442 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ TYRONE +++$+++ Where you been? I saw the cops rousting you at the rally.
L435517 +++$+++ u2435 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Alright, I'll stay. Judge, I want to...
L435488 +++$+++ u2435 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ No! Just harassment. Can't let it stop this.  Brother we got momentum!
L435487 +++$+++ u2442 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ TYRONE +++$+++ C'mon let's...
L435470 +++$+++ u2442 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ TYRONE +++$+++ Black people getting uppity, feeding their children breakfast, taking their destiny into their own hands. What's this world coming to?
L435469 +++$+++ u2435 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ You're a little old to be a school boy aren't you brother.  Cool it! You're probably not the only one they've gone after. Stall a little so they believe you're for real. Make them trust you.  Hey Tyrone, you figure feeding our children is gonna make The Man jumpy?
L435350 +++$+++ u2442 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ TYRONE +++$+++ We're like policing the police.
L435349 +++$+++ u2435 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ This here's a "Panther Patrol." We see a brother getting busted. We check it out, make sure the pig don't go beating on the man. Brother gets taken downtown, we post bail, hook 'em up with a lawyer.
L435299 +++$+++ u2435 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Yeah... Bobby you gotta...
L435298 +++$+++ u2442 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ TYRONE +++$+++ We need money first...
L435297 +++$+++ u2435 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ We'll get them. Right now we got to worry about being armed and ready to protect Betty Shabazz. Those phonies sure as hell can't. We need guns.
L435286 +++$+++ u2435 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Yeah... but it seems they're bringing Malcolm's widow Betty Shabazz to town, to speak at a rally, do an interview for Ramparts.  And they want us to help with security.
L435285 +++$+++ u2442 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ TYRONE +++$+++ Shit, nothing but Paper Panthers.
L435222 +++$+++ u2435 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ The white power structure wants us to act like savages.  But we're a different kind of animal altogether. We're Panthers. And The Black Panther Party for Self Defense is very painfully aware that America has historically reserved its most barbaric treatment for non-white people since the beginning of the country. So we need to organize, we  keep our shit correct! And effect revolution. We revolve the power into the hands of the people. Where it belongs.  Power to the people baby...
L435221 +++$+++ u2442 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ TYRONE +++$+++ That's right brother... listen and learn.
L435444 +++$+++ u2435 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ No you wait a second. You and your "Panthers" got three choices. One you join with us and follow our rules. Two you change your name.  Or three you face annihilation.
L435443 +++$+++ u2440 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Wait a second there brother...
L435442 +++$+++ u2435 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Tell that to the pigs. Better yet tell that to Malcolm.
L435441 +++$+++ u2440 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ A gun's a gun man. It don't need to be loaded.
L435440 +++$+++ u2435 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ We put our lives on the line today. Malcolm X's widow was on the line today. And your guns weren't even loaded.
L435294 +++$+++ u2440 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ I assure you that we as the revolutionary vanguard are as serious about this as you are. We'll be prepared.
L435293 +++$+++ u2435 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ No thank you sister.  Six?!! That seems a little light. Cops are watching Betty, watching her hard. We need at least twenty men. And that's twenty armed Panthers dig? You do have guns don't you?
L435292 +++$+++ u2440 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ ROY +++$+++ Get the brothers a beer. Me too while you're at it.  Men? Well we can spare six for security...
L435291 +++$+++ u2435 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ That's right. We'd be proud to provide as escort for Malcolm's widow. How many men you got?
L435598 +++$+++ u2435 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Me too. That's why I fight so hard.
L435597 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Yeah well, they want a lot for their money. They want a felony, preferably with "violent intent." We've got to give them something. They'll kill me if I don't. And the Panthers are going to kill me if I do. I'm scared.
L435596 +++$+++ u2435 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ If the pigs only knew they were subsidizing The Panthers...
L435595 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ I don't know man. I don't know. That reminds me.  Another little donation from the police.
L435592 +++$+++ u2435 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Like the manual says, "Information is...
L435591 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Huey, man who's gonna straighten out the brothers if they get on my ass?
L435590 +++$+++ u2435 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Listen Judge, Oakland's Panther International Headquarters. We shut the Pig's infiltration down here, they're gonna think twice about running their games on other chapters.
L435528 +++$+++ u2435 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ You got that right. And brother, I got a feeling it's going to get a whole lot thicker.
L435527 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Man, this shit's pretty thick.
L435526 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Yeah... I guess. Any of other Panthers know about this?
L435525 +++$+++ u2435 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ And you're gonna do just that. But I'll tell you what to feed the pig. You alright with this?
L435524 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Yeah.
L435523 +++$+++ u2435 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ You got to keep very cool on this. Icy god damn cool. Cause baby, you just became the strongest weapon we got. Let me guess, he wants you to call him, tell him what we're doing.
L435522 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Brimmer.
L435521 +++$+++ u2435 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ What's the pig's name?
L435520 +++$+++ u2435 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Chickenshits, they're grabbing at anything.
L435519 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Aw... uh... it's was just harassment. My driver's license expired.
L435457 +++$+++ u2435 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ You fit the profile, Brother. You look exactly like the kind of nigger they think they can trust...
L435456 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Me? You've got a whole lot of other folks signing up. Why me?
L435455 +++$+++ u2435 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ I'm talking about survival. Yours, mine, all of it. Outside and in. You got to do something for me. Staying alive might depend on it. The pigs are gonna try to infiltrate us and we're gonna let 'em. But their spy's gonna be our spy too. How about it?
L435454 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Huey, you're losing me. What are you talking about?
L435453 +++$+++ u2435 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ See, the thing about Panthers. For all their speed and strength. They are not naturally aggressive. They don't just go out killing, tearing through the jungles murdering. No, the Panther  keeps his claws hidden until he is attacked, until he's backed into a corner. Then  believe me those claws are fierce.
L435452 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ What, I don't know how you mean?
L435451 +++$+++ u2435 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ I do. You think you're smart enough to keep playing the game?
L435450 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ I don't know about that.
L435449 +++$+++ u2435 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ You were alright Judge, better than alright. You're what the Party needs. A fighter but also one that's going to school not making the man too nervous.
L435436 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ They were empty...
L435435 +++$+++ u2435 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ What it be Judge. Nobody got hurt, Sister Betty's safe. This was a good day...
L435418 +++$+++ u2435 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Right on Brother Judge...
L435417 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Whatever you need, I'll be there.
L435416 +++$+++ u2435 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Yeah I know. You're smart Judge. You ain't no bourgeois nigger like those Paper Panthers across the bay. I need every good man to help us with the security on Betty Shabazz, particularly soldiers. You do solid on that I might have something else for you, something real important.
L435415 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Hey, GI bill pays for school. And shit, if I stuck around here, instead of signing up, I'd probably be in jail, or sitting on the stoop drinking Bitter Dog with Rose, you know?
L435414 +++$+++ u2435 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Mind if I ask you something? Why'd you put up with shit like that for someone else's war?
L435413 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Don't I know it. Every brother I knew in 'Nam's dead. My company... a land mine. Twenty of my friends dead in less than a second.
L435412 +++$+++ u2435 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ You know, you're lucky to be back. Most niggers die on the front lines. Seems like that's what they're there for.
L435411 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ I'd hoped I was finished with all that. But... 
L435410 +++$+++ u2435 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Yeah... You were a lot of help with those guns. Your soldier shit is bad- ass.
L435409 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ I'm down.
L435408 +++$+++ u2435 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Welcome brother, have you decided to get down with us?
L435348 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ No man. Gonna walk.
L435347 +++$+++ u2435 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Okay man I ain't going to push. But remember the revolution isn't going to wait for anyone. Come on, we'll give you a lift.
L435346 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Yeah... let me think about it.
L435345 +++$+++ u2435 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ You are down for protecting Malcolm's widow aren't you?
L435344 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ I don't know.
L435343 +++$+++ u2435 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Judge... we're doing security for Betty Shabazz's visit next week. I'd like to have someone who knows there way around a pistol there. Someone like you.
L435342 +++$+++ u2435 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ Freedom... We're just gonna test some of the words in that law book.
L435341 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ So what's the deal?
L435340 +++$+++ u2435 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ We appreciate your help with this.
L435330 +++$+++ u2435 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ So I guess it's safe to say you know about firepower.
L435329 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Yeah.
L435328 +++$+++ u2435 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ HUEY +++$+++ You were. infantry right?
L435907 +++$+++ u2442 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ TYRONE +++$+++ Later for that. I'm done either way...
L435906 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ We'll all get out of here together.
L435903 +++$+++ u2442 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ TYRONE +++$+++ Look... You... take her and get the hell out of here. I'll keep 'em busy.
L435902 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Motherfuckers...
L435887 +++$+++ u2442 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ TYRONE +++$+++ Not really. Gimme the keys for the trunk.
L435886 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ You alright?
L435873 +++$+++ u2442 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ TYRONE +++$+++ Shut the fuck up!!
L435872 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ No man No!! Tyrone listen... we got to move man, they got a warehouse...
L435871 +++$+++ u2442 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ TYRONE +++$+++ Chickenshits? What you bring your buddies with you?
L435869 +++$+++ u2442 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ TYRONE +++$+++ Bullshit...
L435868 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ The pigs are gonna start flooding us with dope. Huey wants us to stop them.
L435867 +++$+++ u2442 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ TYRONE +++$+++ What are you saying?
L435866 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ You better just kill me Tyrone. And when Huey gets out, when Oakland's just wall to wall junkies, you tell him you blew away the only chance we all got. I'm sure he'll be real happy about that.
L435861 +++$+++ u2442 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ TYRONE +++$+++ Mothafucker! You just set Bobby Seale up to be kidnapped. They dragged him off to some bullshit conspiracy trial in Chicago. How much the pigs pay you for this one, Judge? 
L435860 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Fuck is up?!
L435637 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ S'alright. I'm sorry too. Shit, I gotta take a leak... Pull over at that gas station.
L435636 +++$+++ u2442 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ TYRONE +++$+++ Sorry man...
L435635 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Yeah, "brother" My best friend is stone dead.
L435634 +++$+++ u2442 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ TYRONE +++$+++ You got something on your mind... "brother."
L435633 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Nothing.
L435632 +++$+++ u2442 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ TYRONE +++$+++ What's up with you?
L435621 +++$+++ u2442 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ TYRONE +++$+++ Anything happens to Huey it ain't gonna be a finger. I'll...
L435620 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ If you got something to say, say it.
L435619 +++$+++ u2442 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ TYRONE +++$+++ What? You don't like to see a traitor get hurt? I wonder why that is?
L435407 +++$+++ u2442 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ TYRONE +++$+++ He had a feeling you'd be coming by.
L435406 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Huh?
L435332 +++$+++ u2442 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ TYRONE +++$+++ Just the legit shit.
L435331 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Busted firing pin.  You want only the legal stuff right?
L435317 +++$+++ u2442 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ TYRONE +++$+++ Fuck maybe... be there.
L435316 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Maybe...
L435315 +++$+++ u2442 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ TYRONE +++$+++ You're a smart brother... you should dig what Huey and Bobby got to say...
L435205 +++$+++ u2442 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ TYRONE +++$+++ What you see is what you got.  That's' Bobby Seale.
L435204 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ I thought you said all the Panthers were gonna be here.
L435203 +++$+++ u2442 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ TYRONE +++$+++ Yeah, well, cops kick the shit out of kids too.
L435202 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Just a kid.
L435201 +++$+++ u2442 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ TYRONE +++$+++ Shit, we made him get his moms to give permission before he could sign up.
L435197 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ And who is we?
L435196 +++$+++ u2442 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ TYRONE +++$+++ Don't let the cops provoke you. We're there to watch and take badge numbers...
L435194 +++$+++ u2442 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ TYRONE +++$+++ Well, act like it. Come on.
L435193 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Yeah, I do.
L435192 +++$+++ u2442 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ TYRONE +++$+++ But nothing... you do live here don't you?
L435191 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ I saw... but...
L435833 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ You don't even know it man, but you're a god damn hero.
L435832 +++$+++ u2439 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
L435831 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ God damn it's him. I gotta go.
L435830 +++$+++ u2439 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ No... wait, there's something else, something weird. I hear he's set up down at that warehouse on fifty deuce. He's talking big and living bigger.
L435829 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Motherfuck... well then I got something to do.
L435828 +++$+++ u2439 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yeah... Look man, what I gotta say. It's just you, me and the rats, right? Alright... well... Sabu's back.
L435827 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Rose?
L435673 +++$+++ u2439 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Didn't want folks to think I was a snitch. You know?
L435672 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Why didn't you tell me?
L435671 +++$+++ u2439 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Ain't no one seen him.
L435670 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Where is he?.
L435669 +++$+++ u2439 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ It was Sabu killed Cy.
L435668 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ What?
L435667 +++$+++ u2439 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Judge... I... I shoulda told you this before but... well... fuck...
L435666 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Not at all.  I'll catch you later.
L435665 +++$+++ u2439 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Unh... Unh Man... I don't take no money from friends that need help. Fuck no. What do you think I am a bum?
L435664 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ I don't know.  But I'm sure I'll find out. Rose, you did me solid.
L435663 +++$+++ u2439 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ This cool the heat off you any?
L435320 +++$+++ u2439 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Just come for the food, man. Ain't quite sure what their bag is but...
L435319 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Rose, what the hell you doing here?
L435183 +++$+++ u2439 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Funny you don't look like church folk to me.
L435182 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ My Mom's at that.
L435174 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ All of the above, man...  And then some.
L435173 +++$+++ u2439 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You supposed to be a wounded vet, Motherfucka. What you do in 'Nam anyway, shoot gooks or shoot hoops?
L435249 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ I don't know. I really don't.
L435248 +++$+++ u2437 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ You believe that?
L435247 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...
L435246 +++$+++ u2437 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.
L435245 +++$+++ u2436 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ JUDGE +++$+++ Yes... No... Mom it's not like you think. They're alright. There out there trying to do something.
L435244 +++$+++ u2437 +++$+++ m156 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ You meet those friends of yours in jail too?

L436623 +++$+++ u2443 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Do you think Frances with an "e" is too manly a name for a girl?

L436423 +++$+++ u2443 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ You call that a compliment?

L436373 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ His victories at Charleston and Camden were perfect, strategically, tactically, logistically.  But he has a weakness.

L436371 +++$+++ u2452 +++$+++ m157 +++$+++ MARION +++$+++ I've just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.
