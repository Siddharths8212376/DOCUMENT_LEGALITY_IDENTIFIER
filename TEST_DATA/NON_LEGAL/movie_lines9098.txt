L242850 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ What would the poster say: "Narcissus would kill for a taste of Golden Pompeii Olive Oil?"
L242849 +++$+++ u1164 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ PROXIMO +++$+++ At the end of the day I was approached by the Golden Pompeii Olive Oil company.  Small, but profitable.  They asked if you would endorse their oil.  We could get some very nice posters.  Make some very big money...
L242739 +++$+++ u1164 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ PROXIMO +++$+++ That's one way to look at it.
L242738 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
L242737 +++$+++ u1164 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ PROXIMO +++$+++ General, do you realize what happened out there today?
L242714 +++$+++ u1164 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ PROXIMO +++$+++ Then, you'll die...  Just, know this:  because you asked I asked:  I'm sorry but...
L242713 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ I'm not a gladiator.  I refuse to fight.
L242712 +++$+++ u1164 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ PROXIMO +++$+++ Legate Narcissus Meridas, general of the Spanish Felix Legions!  I'm proud to have you in my school!  Now, show them what you can do!
L242693 +++$+++ u1164 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ PROXIMO +++$+++ -- to fight?  We'll see...
L242692 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ I refuse to be your slave.  I refuse --
L242691 +++$+++ u1164 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ PROXIMO +++$+++ Sorry but I have to get at least one fight out of you otherwise I won't even get back the cost of the bribe I had to pay the arena slaves to get you here.  I know what you're trying to do:  kill yourself and trust in the Roman tradition of justice that the emperor will let your family survive and keep their lands.  The only thing you have accomplishes is to prove you're a very important individual.  You make me feel good about my investment!  And that puking pig Jerses -- he won't even discuss you.  Both of you have clamped mouths!  But I love all my fighters -- I'll find out about your family.  And about you.  That I promise.
L242690 +++$+++ u1164 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ PROXIMO +++$+++ Chain him.
L242689 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Take your hands off me animal!
L242682 +++$+++ u1164 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ PROXIMO +++$+++ Death is... everything for me.  Now you have to go to your cell, and I to dicker with Jerses... you'll be fed well.  I want you to be fit as you can be; I want you to win for me tomorrow!  I want all my gladiators to win and be happy!  Besides, I've never owned a Roman general before.
L242681 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Death is a very light thing for you.
L242680 +++$+++ u1164 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ PROXIMO +++$+++ You are to be killed, exactly. They'll give you a sporting chance, but just enough to make your murder... entertaining.  Romans like to mix their metaphors:  laughter with their executions, you know?  If you survive, though, you will become a gladiator.  A gladiator at least gets a fair fight.
L242679 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Thank you.  What is going to happen tomorrow?  Exactly?
L242676 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Impossible!  Every citizen has a right to trial -- this is Rome!
L242675 +++$+++ u1164 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ PROXIMO +++$+++ General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen.
L242674 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Condemned?  Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned?
L242673 +++$+++ u1164 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ PROXIMO +++$+++ I am the man who might save your life -- give you a bit more life at any rate.  I am Proximo Palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me.  I own this school and everything that's in it.  You're in it!  But why?  What did a Roman general do to get himself condemned to the Colosseum? Understand, we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets.  Please, I separated you from the others because...  ... my nose tells me you've been condemned for important reasons.
L242672 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ Who the hell are you?
L242671 +++$+++ u1164 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ PROXIMO +++$+++ I'm a Greek, thank you.  And I was brought up believing Romans were the barbarians.  Give our new colleague some of the Cretan white.  Relax, tell me everything, I'm your friend.
L242670 +++$+++ u1163 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ NARCISSUS +++$+++ I killed too many barbarians.
L242669 +++$+++ u1164 +++$+++ m76 +++$+++ PROXIMO +++$+++ You're a legate in the Roman army. Huh...?  and you act like one. What was your crime?
L251805 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ What?
L251804 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Benjamin?
L251692 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.
L251691 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ The day after tomorrow?
L251690 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ No.
L251689 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Are we getting married tomorrow?
L251686 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Where did he do it?
L251685 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Shhhh.
L251684 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Oh no. He said that.
L251683 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
L251682 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
L251681 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ No, Benjamin.
L251680 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ How did he do it? Did he get down on his knees? He didn't get down on his knees, I hope.
L251678 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Well -- I said I might marry him.
L251677 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Why do you have to see him?
L251676 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Yes.
L251675 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Who -- that guy at the Zoo?
L251674 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Carl Smith. He's a medical student. We've known him for years.
L251673 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Carl who?
L251672 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Carl who?
L251671 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Well -- I have to see Carl first.
L251670 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests.
L251669 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?
L251667 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I just don't think it would...
L251666 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Why wouldn't it?
L251665 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Why wouldn't it?
L251664 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I just don't think it would work.
L251663 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ We'll need our Birth Certificates. I happen to have mine with me. Where's yours?
L251662 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Benjamin -- I haven't even said I'll marry you yet.
L251661 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.
L251660 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Tomorrow?
L251659 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ We could go down and get our blood tests tomorrow.
L251654 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Yes.
L251653 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ You really will?
L251652 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I'll think about it.
L251651 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Elaine -- are you serious about this?
L251650 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I have to go back now.
L251649 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ We just can.
L251648 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I don't see how we can.
L251647 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Well -- look -- don't be confused. We're getting married.
L251646 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ You mean you're confused?
L251645 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
L251644 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --
L251643 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I don't know.
L251642 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ When?
L251641 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Yes.
L251640 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Is that so? You might marry me?
L251639 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I might.
L251638 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ But you might.
L251637 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I don't know.
L251636 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ You won't?
L251634 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Will you kiss me!
L251633 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ What?
L251632 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Benjamin?
L251630 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Goodbye.
L251629 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ But Elaine --
L251628 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I don't want you to go anywhere until you have a definite plan.
L251627 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I don't understand.
L251626 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I don't want you to leave tomorrow.
L251624 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Well -- where are you going?
L251623 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ No.
L251622 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Are you going home?
L251621 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I don't know.
L251620 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ What are you going to do now?
L251619 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Oh.
L251618 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.
L251617 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ The marble?
L251616 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ No. I have two. The other one is the one I'm looking for.  What's this?  It's from my grandmother.
L251615 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Don't you have it on?
L251614 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ My belt.
L251613 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ What are you looking for?
L251612 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ If you want.
L251611 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Can I just sit here while you're packing?
L251610 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Elaine -- right now I don't feel like talking much. I'm sorry about everything but I think I'll just do this now.
L251609 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Benjamin, when you came up here, what did you think was going to happen between us?
L251587 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ -- suddenly there she was without any clothes on -- I mean really naked --
L251586 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Benjamin -- this is my mother!
L251585 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ -- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off -- and --
L251584 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Don't tell me --
L251583 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ All right -- but listen to me. What happened was there was this party at my parents. I drove your mother home -- then we went upstairs to see your portrait --
L251582 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Please let me go.
L251581 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Elaine -- that is not what happened.
L251580 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Then you took her upstairs and you raped her.
L251579 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Then what?
L251578 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ She said she was having a drink in the hotel with a friend. You waited for her in the parking lot and told her she was too drunk to drive home and that you would get her a room for the night.
L251576 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I don't feel well.
L251575 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Because it isn't true.
L251574 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Why?
L251573 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ You've got to tell me what she said.
L251572 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Let me go.
L251571 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ What did she say?
L251570 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ -- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
L251569 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Did you say rape her?
L251568 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I don't understand --
L251567 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ What?
L251566 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Do you just hate everything? How could you possibly rape my...
L251565 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ How could you do that, Benjamin?
L251564 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Elaine -- I love you.
L251563 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Well, I want you to leave.
L251562 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ All right then! Yes!
L251561 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I said I think it is.
L251560 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I think it is.
L251559 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ What do you think?
L251558 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Is it because I'm here?
L251557 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Because -- I am.
L251556 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
L251555 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Come in.
L251554 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I want to ask you a question.
L251543 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ I've got a real feeling that this is the fellow.
L251542 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ What?
L251541 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Here he comes.
L251540 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ -- really incredible --
L251539 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Maybe we could get together some time and talk about it.
L251538 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Benjamin -- you're -- I don't know what to say -- you're --
L251537 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ No. I just sit in. They don't seem to mind. They've been very congenial about it.
L251536 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ But you're not enrolled.
L251535 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street -- and I've been getting to some classes --
L251534 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Yes.
L251533 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Here? In Berkeley?
L251532 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Benjamin -- I would like to know what you're doing here.
L251531 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Oh.
L251530 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I thought he said by the monkey house.
L251529 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Where did he say he was going to meet you?
L251528 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ No.
L251527 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Is that him over there?
L251526 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Oh. Well, I haven't either. I might just ride out there with you.
L251525 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I've never been to it.
L251524 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?
L251523 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ At the Zoo.
L251522 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Where are you meeting this person?
L251521 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Ah. Where?
L251520 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I'm meeting someone.
L251454 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Get out of here.
L251453 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Don't cry. 
L251452 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ GET OUT!
L251451 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ No -- don't cry --
L251449 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Oh my God --
L251448 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Elaine --
L251444 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Yes. The married woman -- it wasn't just some woman --
L251443 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ You mean the one who --
L251442 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ That woman. The older woman.
L251441 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ What?
L251440 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ That woman --
L251439 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ What is it?
L251436 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Because I want to know what's happening.
L251435 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Why aren't you ready?
L251433 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Hurry up. Put your shoes on.
L251432 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Benjamin -- what's happening?
L251431 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.
L251430 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ What's the matter?
L251407 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Benjamin -- I really do.
L251406 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ You do?
L251405 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I do.
L251404 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Because I wouldn't want you to do it unless you really wanted to!
L251403 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Yes.
L251402 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ You sure you really want to?
L251401 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Okay.
L251400 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ During the day? We'll go for a drive or something.
L251399 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ All right.
L251396 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ I'm glad.
L251395 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Yes.
L251394 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ And it's all over now.
L251393 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ No.
L251392 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Did they ever find out?
L251391 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Yes. She had a husband and a son.
L251390 +++$+++ u1172 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ With a family?
L251389 +++$+++ u1169 +++$+++ m77 +++$+++ BEN +++$+++ Yes.
