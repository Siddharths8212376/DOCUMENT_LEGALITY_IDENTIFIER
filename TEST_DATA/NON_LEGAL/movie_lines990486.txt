L639129 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ But why?
L639128 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ They're none of them right.
L639127 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ But I loved the second one she wore. And this one --  -- is beautiful.
L639126 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I'm trying to buy you a suit.
L639125 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Scottie, what are you doing?
L639123 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ No, it's not right.
L639122 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ But I like that one, Scottie.
L639118 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I want to! Come on!
L639117 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ But Scottie, you don't have to!
L639116 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ There's Ransohoff's. Nothing but the best. Come on.
L639115 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Honest?
L639114 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Okay. Now we're going to buy you some clothes.
L639109 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Yes --
L639108 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?
L639107 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I like that one.
L639105 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I suppose I could phone the store in the morning, and say I'm sick.
L639104 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Will you, Judy?
L639103 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Please! And don't look at me.
L639102 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Why?!
L639101 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ No, Judy, I'm not going to move! Please! Stay in the chair!
L639099 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ That's not very complimentary, either.
L639098 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ No.
L639097 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Why?  Because I remind you of someone?  That's not very complimentary.  And nothing would... happen...
L639096 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Yes.
L639095 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd "take care of me"?
L639094 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I just want to see you as much as I can!
L639093 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ No? Then what?
L639092 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ No.
L639091 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night.
L639090 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ No, Judy, you don't understand.
L639089 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.
L639088 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I'll take care of you.
L639087 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?
L639086 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Don't go.
L639085 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to work. I've got a job.
L639084 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Tomorrow morning.
L639083 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Tomorrow night? Well --
L639082 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Can I see you tomorrow?
L639081 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Thank you again. Good-night.
L639078 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Okay.
L639077 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Mmm.
L639076 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ An hour?
L639075 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Oh, no! Give me time to change and get fixed up!
L639074 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.
L639073 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Well... I've been on blind dates before... Matter of fact, to be honest, I've been picked up before.  Okay.
L639072 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Because I'd like to have dinner with you.
L639071 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Because I remind you of her?
L639070 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Just dinner.
L639069 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Dinner... and what else?
L639068 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Then will you for me?
L639067 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ No, you don't owe me anything.
L639066 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Well, I feel I owe you something for all this...
L639065 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Why?
L639064 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Will you have dinner with me?
L639056 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I told you! My name is Judy Barton! I come from Salina Kansas. I work at Magnin's! I live here! My gosh, do I have to prove it?
L639055 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I want to know who you are.
L639054 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Listen, what is this? What do you want?
L639053 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Salina, Kansas!
L639052 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ But before! Where did you live before!?!
L639051 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I told you! Right here!
L639050 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?
L639049 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ About three years.
L639048 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ But you haven't lived here long.
L639047 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ It's a place to live, that's all.
L639046 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ -- and how you happen to be living here.
L639045 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Just a girl, I work at Magnin's --
L639044 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Who you are --
L639043 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Judy Barton.
L639042 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Your name. And --
L639041 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ What do you want to know?
L639040 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Well... you don't look very much like Jack the Ripper...
L639039 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ You won't have to.
L639038 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.
L639036 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Let me come in.
L639035 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Well, it's not going to work. So you'd better go.
L639034 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ You're not far wrong.
L639033 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ I've heard that one before, too. I remind you of someone you used to be madly in love with, but she ditched you for another guy, and you've been carrying the torch ever since, and then you saw me and something clicked.  Huh!
L639031 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Why?
L639030 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ You.
L639029 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ What about?
L639028 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Just let me talk to you.
L639027 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I'm not going to hurt you! I promise! Please!
L639026 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
L639025 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ No, please! I Just want to talk to you!
L639024 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ 0h, I thought so! A pick-up!  Well, you've got a nerve, following me right into the hotel and up to my room! You beat it! Go on! Beat it!
L639023 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ No, I happened to see you come in, and I thought --
L639022 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Do you live here in the hotel?
L639021 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and --
L639020 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?
L639019 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ My name is John Ferguson, and --
L639018 +++$+++ u8761 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ JUDY +++$+++ What for? Who are you?
L639017 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Could I ask you a couple of questions?
L638975 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Please. Because I love you.  He stares at her, sees the pleading look in her eyes, and lets go. She turns and walks away toward the church, slowly, her head bowed. He watches her go and starts to move after her. Then slowly, as she goes, her head begins to go up until finally, as she walks, she is staring high above her.  And then, suddenly, she breaks into a broken run.
L638974 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Why?
L638973 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Let me go into the church alone.
L638972 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I won't lose you.
L638971 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ And if you lose me, you'll know that I loved you and wanted to go on loving you.
L638970 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Yes.
L638969 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ You believe that I love you?
L638968 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Madeleine!!
L638967 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Let me go! Let me go!!
L638966 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ It had to. We're in love. That's all that counts. Madeleine --
L638965 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ It's not fair, it's too late. It wasn't supposed to happen this way, it shouldn't have happened...!
L638963 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Please let me go.
L638962 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Madeleine --
L638961 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ To the church, I must go there.
L638960 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Where?
L638959 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Let me go.
L638958 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Why?
L638957 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ You can't.
L638956 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ There are things I have to tell you, about how we met, and why we are together. But they can wait. The only important thing now is that I love you and I'm going to keep you safe.
L638953 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Too late... there's something I must do...
L638952 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ No... we're together...
L638951 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I love you too... too late... too late...
L638950 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ My love... because I love you.
L638944 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Not merely as it was a hundred years ago. As it was a year ago, or six months ago, whenever you were here to see it.  Madeleine, think of when you were here!
L638943 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Yes.
L638942 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ And it's a all real.
L638941 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Here with you.
L638933 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I stood alone on the green, searching for something, and I started to walk to the church. But then the darkness closed in, I was alone in the dark, being pulled into darkness, and I fought to wake up...
L638932 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Go on with your dream. What was it that frightened you?
L638928 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ No, never! I've never been there! Scottie, what is it? I've never been there!
L638927 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Madeleine, a hundred miles south of San Francisco there's an old Spanish Mission, Mission San Juan Bautista. It's been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum. Now, think hard, darling. You've been there before. You've seen it!
L638926 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ No, never!
L638925 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ You've been there before. You've seen it.
L638924 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ It's all there. It's no dream.
L638923 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Yes?! But --
L638922 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ -- and an old wooden hotel of the old California days, and a saloon... dark... low-ceilinged... with hanging oil lamps.
L638921 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ At the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner --
L638920 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Go on.
L638919 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ There was a village square, a green with trees... and an old whitewashed Spanish church with a cloister. Across the green: a big, grey, wooden house with a porch and shutters and a balcony above... a small garden, and next to it, a livery stable... with old carriages lined up inside.
L638918 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Tell me.
L638917 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ But clear... so very clear... for the first time... all of it...
L638916 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Yes --
L638915 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
L638914 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ It was a dream, you're awake, you're all right, now. Can you tell me?
L638912 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I didn't wake him. I don't want him to know...
L638911 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Where's your husband?
L638909 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Only this far.
L638908 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ No, don't go away!
L638906 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I had the dream. The dream came back again...
L638905 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Why? What's happened?
L638904 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I should have phoned... but I wanted to see you... be with you...
L638863 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ All the time.
L638862 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Don't leave me... stay with me...
L638861 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I'm so afraid...  ...you won't let it happen...
L638860 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I'm here, I've got you...
L638859 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I'm not mad. I'm not mad. And I don't want to die, but there's someone inside me, there's a somebody else, and she says I must die... Scottie, don't let me go!
L638857 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ And so explain it away?  But there is a way to explain it, you see. If I'm mad? That would explain it, wouldn't it?
L638856 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ If I could find the key... find the beginning put it together...
L638855 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ No!
L638854 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ But I'm the woman in the mirror!
L638853 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Of the woman in the mirror. Would you know her if you saw her?
L638852 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ No.
L638851 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ A portrait? Do you ever see a portrait?
L638850 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ This part is dream, I think. There is a tower and a bell and... a garden below... but it seems to be in Spain... a village in Spain. And then it clicks off, and is gone.
L638849 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ What else?
L638848 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ No. It's new and clean, and waiting.
L638847 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ There's a name on the gravestone.
L638846 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I know.
L638845 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ How do you know?
L638844 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.
L638843 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Where?
L638842 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ A grave...
L638841 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ What else?
L638840 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ No... it's in shadow.
L638839 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Would you know the room?
L638838 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...
L638837 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ What do you remember?
L638836 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Vaguely...
L638835 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ But the small scenes, the fragments in the mirror: you remember them.
L638832 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Yesterday.
L638831 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ There is so little I know. It is as though I were walking down a long corridor that once was mirrored, and fragments of mirror still hang there, dark and shadowy, reflecting a dark image of me... and yet not me... someone else, in other clothes, of another time, doing things I have never done... but still me... And I can't stop to ask why, I must keep on walking. At the and of the corridor there is nothing but darkness, and I know when I walk into the darkness, I'll die.  But I've never come to the and; I've always come back, before then. Except once.
L638830 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ And you'll go on saving me? Again and again?
L638829 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I'm responsible for you now, you know.  The Chinese say that once you have saved someone's life, you are responsible for it forever. And so I'm committed. And I have to know.
L638826 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ ...somewhere in the light.
L638825 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Home?
L638824 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Take me away from here?
