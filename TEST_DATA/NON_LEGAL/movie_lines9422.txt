L542694 +++$+++ u3046 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ You could have killed us both!!
L542693 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Help me!!
L543264 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Don't worry. I'll be all right.
L543263 +++$+++ u3051 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ TEENAGER +++$+++ I have nothing to do. I'd like to help you.
L543262 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Sure.
L543261 +++$+++ u3051 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ TEENAGER +++$+++ Wait. Could I have your autograph?
L543260 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ It's easier not to tell if you don't know.
L543259 +++$+++ u3051 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ TEENAGER +++$+++ Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody.
L543258 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Pull over. I've got to get back there.
L543257 +++$+++ u3051 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ TEENAGER +++$+++ The five-fifty. We already passed it. But it'll take him way out of his way.
L543256 +++$+++ u3051 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ TEENAGER +++$+++ Fly.
L543255 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
L543254 +++$+++ u3051 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ TEENAGER +++$+++ I'm telling you, you're going to find him at the roadblock, or right after, or not at all.
L543239 +++$+++ u3051 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ TEENAGER +++$+++ Would be kinda neat if they were. I think I could outrun them. Maybe get my picture in the papers.
L543238 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ What? No, of course not.
L543237 +++$+++ u3051 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ TEENAGER +++$+++ They after you?
L543236 +++$+++ u3051 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ TEENAGER +++$+++ This is going to be a real drag. I thought you wanted to go fast.
L543235 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ I don't know where he is.
L543234 +++$+++ u3051 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ TEENAGER +++$+++ In the cars, too?!
L543233 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ I told you I'm looking for someone.
L543232 +++$+++ u3051 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ TEENAGER +++$+++ Geez, Mrs. Haydn, we just got going.
L543231 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ Slow down, slow down.
L543230 +++$+++ u3051 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ TEENAGER +++$+++ My grandmother's rich.
L543229 +++$+++ u3043 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ JENNY +++$+++ You sure this is your car?
L543249 +++$+++ u3044 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ LYMAN +++$+++ We're ready.
L543248 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ You get that, Lyman?
L543130 +++$+++ u3044 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ LYMAN +++$+++ I did.
L543129 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ Tell him I'm not here.
L543039 +++$+++ u3044 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ LYMAN +++$+++ Maybe he's turned her into one of them. They enter the crowd around the helicopter.
L543038 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ Doesn't make sense.
L543037 +++$+++ u3044 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ LYMAN +++$+++ I know. She bought him a ticket for Lathrop Wells and put him on the bus. He didn't stay on though and they drove off together.
L542899 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ Did your people have any contingencies rehearsed?
L542898 +++$+++ u3044 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ LYMAN +++$+++ Bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow.
L542897 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ Good... It looks like we might be the welcoming committee, so I think we should try and figure out what we're gonna do if we have to come face to face with this creature.
L542612 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ Any reports about monsters, people in Halloween masks, anything like that?
L542611 +++$+++ u3044 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ LYMAN +++$+++ That's because the ones that were hurt, died. They couldn't talk to you.
L542609 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ Give it a rest, Lyman.
L542608 +++$+++ u3044 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ LYMAN +++$+++ This is crazy. What were we going to do if that had been the ship? We have two thirty calibre machine guns, three M16's and some handguns.
L542602 +++$+++ u3044 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ LYMAN +++$+++ I wouldn't worry about it... There might not be any little league tomorrow.
L542601 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ Aghh... I'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow.
L542580 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ Get Fox.
L542579 +++$+++ u3044 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ LYMAN +++$+++ Is it for real?
L542895 +++$+++ u3044 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ LYMAN +++$+++ You jerk! You look at all the sweetness and light and goodness you think'll come out of this. You know what's gonna come out of this... The end of religion, the end of civilization, the end of the earth. We could become slaves, we could become a colony of these things. Don't you see that? Are you too stupid to see that?
L542894 +++$+++ u3045 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ MAJOR BELL +++$+++ You have no conception of this, do you?
L542893 +++$+++ u3044 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ LYMAN +++$+++ Bullshit!
L542892 +++$+++ u3045 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ MAJOR BELL +++$+++ Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.
L542891 +++$+++ u3044 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ LYMAN +++$+++ Save us all a lot of trouble.
L542890 +++$+++ u3045 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ MAJOR BELL +++$+++ They're gonna let some local cop blow him away.
L542604 +++$+++ u3044 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ LYMAN +++$+++ Then why did they try and sneak in the back door? Tell me that. Why didn't they contact us first and say...
L542603 +++$+++ u3045 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ MAJOR BELL +++$+++ I'm telling you they're probably friendly.
L542723 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ It was the husband. The police finally got a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman.
L542722 +++$+++ u3045 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ MAJOR BELL +++$+++ Nothing up there... The grass is matted down in a few places, but that could have been anything.
L542720 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ The police think he was high on drugs...
L542719 +++$+++ u3045 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ MAJOR BELL +++$+++ It was a man though... right?
L542718 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ Listen to this.  A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...
L542717 +++$+++ u3045 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ MAJOR BELL +++$+++ It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?
L542716 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ How would you describe the sounds we heard coming out of that thing's helmet?
L542715 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ I tried it once... Fourteen years ago... 'I was a lousy husband and a worse father. The only thing I'm good at is this... At least until yesterday.
L542714 +++$+++ u3045 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ MAJOR BELL +++$+++ Yes.
L542713 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ To the same woman?
L542712 +++$+++ u3045 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ MAJOR BELL +++$+++ Twenty-eight years.
L542711 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ You married, Major?
L542710 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ I know, but...
L542709 +++$+++ u3045 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ MAJOR BELL +++$+++ It was only an accident that we discovered them.
L542708 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ There's nothing... No reports of sightings or landings or anything... in the other parts of the country or overseas... Seems like a totally isolated incident.
L542573 +++$+++ u3045 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ MAJOR BELL +++$+++ We better get it into the box. Come on...
L542572 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ Oh, Jesus.
L542570 +++$+++ u3045 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ MAJOR BELL +++$+++ I've been investigating sightings for seventeen years, Mr. Shermin. This one's real. We have a dead extra- terrestrial in that tent and another one in the area that might be alive. We've been visited. It's finally happened and the sooner Washington accepts that and starts figuring out how we're going to deal with these beings, the better off we're going to be.
L542569 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ People have made mistakes in these situations before.
L542568 +++$+++ u3045 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ MAJOR BELL +++$+++ After I called in, I had a chance to sit down with the three locals. They swear there's another one that didn't make the ship... It might be alive.
L542567 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ It could have been anything.
L542566 +++$+++ u3045 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ MAJOR BELL +++$+++ No, sir. Radar.
L542565 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ Was there visual contact?
L542564 +++$+++ u3045 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ MAJOR BELL +++$+++ We had a flight of F16's play tag with the spaceship over Michigan for an hour. Then it shot straight up and disappeared.
L542563 +++$+++ u3045 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ MAJOR BELL +++$+++ Wait'll you see it.
L542562 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ There's a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then...
L542561 +++$+++ u3045 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ MAJOR BELL +++$+++ No.
L542560 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ Can you see under the faceplate?
L542559 +++$+++ u3045 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ MAJOR BELL +++$+++ Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
L542558 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
L542557 +++$+++ u3045 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ MAJOR BELL +++$+++ Very beautiful country up here...
L542556 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ This has always been my favorite time of day.
L543164 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ No.
L543163 +++$+++ u3046 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?'
L543162 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ I don't understand.
L543161 +++$+++ u3046 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ Good job, neither do I. What do you do for a living?
L543160 +++$+++ u3046 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ Parlez vous Francais?... Habla Ingles?... Sprechen zie deutsch?
L543159 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ I don't understand.
L543156 +++$+++ u3046 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ Hop in.
L543155 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.
L543154 +++$+++ u3046 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ Where are you going?
L542734 +++$+++ u3046 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ Scott Haydn is dead. He died about three months ago. We went to the funeral.
L542733 +++$+++ u3052 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ I know what I saw. I've seen him enough times.
L542732 +++$+++ u3046 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ You know that's impossible!
L542731 +++$+++ u3052 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Well, maybe these men won't think so. We were asleep when a helicopter woke me up. It made me so nervous I went into the kitchen for something to eat. I happened to look out the window and there was Scott Haydn with this green thing draped over his arm pulling Jenny down the walk to the car.
L542730 +++$+++ u3046 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ Judy, that's stupid.
L542729 +++$+++ u3052 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ I told you...
L543036 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ We will.  Something's wrong here. She's helping him now.
L543035 +++$+++ u3048 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SECURITY GUARD +++$+++ That's what I thought. So remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late, you know.
L543034 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ I wouldn't think so.
L543033 +++$+++ u3048 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SECURITY GUARD +++$+++ Eh... the store tells you to call when there's trouble, so they won't get sued... But that shouldn't matter if there's a reward, right?
L543032 +++$+++ u3048 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SECURITY GUARD +++$+++ Hey... he didn't look like no big time criminal to me.
L543031 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ You saw that?
L543030 +++$+++ u3048 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SECURITY GUARD +++$+++ Hey, it's none of my business why you're chasing a retard... You want my opinion, it's the girl. She had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid.
L543029 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that.
L543028 +++$+++ u3048 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SECURITY GUARD +++$+++ Because I'm the one who called the police, you know.
L543027 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ Huh?... Eh... no, there isn't
L543026 +++$+++ u3048 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SECURITY GUARD +++$+++ Is there a reward in this?
L543411 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ Hold on a minute... Let's take the chance, George.
L543410 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ If I talk to you, I will miss my ship.
L543409 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ All the roads into Death Valley are blocked. We'd like to talk to you.
L543408 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ I don't want to hurt anybody. I just want to go home.
L543407 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ We can't let you do that.
L543406 +++$+++ u3050 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ STAR MAN +++$+++ I must get to my ship, Mr. Shermin.
L543405 +++$+++ u3049 +++$+++ m199 +++$+++ SHERMIN +++$+++ Hello...
L550988 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Just not the eyes.
L550987 +++$+++ u3053 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ BEEMER +++$+++ I already got a real one.  Come on, it won't be too bad.  It's not personal.
L550986 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's everything I have on me, what do you say?  How about a Rolex?
L550985 +++$+++ u3053 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ BEEMER +++$+++ Come on, let's go, I got to get back.
L550984 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ It's always politics.  Like this thing we're in here, he's paying you to tune me up, right?  But I could pay you more not to.  See what I mean?  I could write you a check right now--
L550983 +++$+++ u3053 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ BEEMER +++$+++ Bullshit politics.
L550982 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I saw you play, man.  You were good. Like a fucking freight train I remember saying.  So what happened, injuries or what?
L550981 +++$+++ u3053 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ BEEMER +++$+++ Yeah, that's right.
L550726 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ A star is born.
L550725 +++$+++ u3054 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ EDUARDO +++$+++ No problem.
L550724 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Some tips.  Don't dart your eyes around.  Don't look in the mirror or you'll ID yourself.  OK?  You got a half hour of tape, so give me some lead-in to the main event.  But don't wait too long, I don't want to be going out for popcorn.  And don't act natural.  Don't act at all. Just forget the thing is on.  Got it?
L550723 +++$+++ u3054 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ EDUARDO +++$+++ Yeah, right.
L550722 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Easy, Eduardo, easy.  Preserve a sense of humor at all times.  Okay, the receptor rig... what I'm putting on your head... sends a signal to the recorder.  See we call it "being wired," but there's no wire.  You gotta keep the recorder close... five, six feet away max, like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you're going to close escrow, know what I mean?
L550721 +++$+++ u3054 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ EDUARDO +++$+++ Hey, fuck you, man.
L550720 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Superconducting QUantum Interference Device.  SQUID.  Got it?  There's gonna be a test.
L550719 +++$+++ u3054 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ EDUARDO +++$+++ What's all this squid shit?
L550718 +++$+++ u3057 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Okay, let's get you wired up.  I hope this axle grease you got in your hair doesn't screw up the squid receptors.
L551312 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I live for the moment.
L551311 +++$+++ u3062 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TRAN +++$+++ Take her up to the suite.  Have a glass of champagne... or six... I'll be up in a while to help you ring in the New Year.
L551310 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Well, I'm certainly in the mood for a party.
L551065 +++$+++ u3062 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TRAN +++$+++ Maybe later.
L551064 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Fuck you.
L551063 +++$+++ u3062 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TRAN +++$+++ The only time a whore should open her mouth is when she's giving head.
L551062 +++$+++ u3062 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TRAN +++$+++ I'd love to.  But he keeps showing up.  And you keep talking to him.  I can't have that--
L551061 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ He doesn't know what's going on. Leave him alone.
L551060 +++$+++ u3062 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TRAN +++$+++ Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  "Stand by your man". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him.
L551059 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ You said you were going to get her out of this.
L551057 +++$+++ u3062 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TRAN +++$+++ You're going down.
L551056 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I made my choice, Lenny.
L551051 +++$+++ u3062 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TRAN +++$+++ A tragic story, no doubt.  How'd you get up here?
L551050 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Look, Tran... Lenny just came by to give me some bad news.  An old friend of mine has been murdered. You remember Iris?
L550939 +++$+++ u3062 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TRAN +++$+++ Paranoia's only reality on a finer scale.
L550938 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ You're too goddamned paranoid.
L550937 +++$+++ u3062 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TRAN +++$+++ He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him.  Don't talk to anybody.  You understand?  Not with everything that's going on right now.
L550936 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Leave him alone, Tran.
L550935 +++$+++ u3062 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TRAN +++$+++ Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of stolen dreams.
L550931 +++$+++ u3062 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ TRAN +++$+++ Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely to his car.
L550930 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ We have nothing to talk about, Lenny.
L551428 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ 'We might as well make the best of it.'
L551427 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ And then she said, 'Since we're going to be spending so much time together--'
L551426 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ Uh huh.  And I said, 'That's good, because I like the feeling of someone watching me.  I acquired the taste from Lenny.'
L551425 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I said, 'Yeah.  I'd even do it for free.'
L551424 +++$+++ u3055 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ FAITH +++$+++ I know.  I don't always do exactly what I'm told.  So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?'  And you said -- come on Max.
L551423 +++$+++ u3059 +++$+++ m200 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You were supposed to go downstairs, baby.
