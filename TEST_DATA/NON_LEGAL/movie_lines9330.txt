L445491 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Now Gallagher, if we could only get a great scene - a tremendously emotional scene - something that would just wring the hearts out of the public - to bring the curtain down in the second act - that would be okay. Couldn't dig one out of your hat some place, could you?
L445477 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ All right, thanks. Now, let's see. How will I start? Hey pal, how would you start?
L445476 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Here you are.
L445475 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ You could be something.  I've got an idea, Gallagher. Let's get this set. That's a great idea for a play. Pal, get me a cigarette, will you?
L445474 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ What could I be?
L445473 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ And there's her mother - and what a character that old dame would make with her double-strength - and that lawyer friend of theirs - he'd make a great villain - and there's you!
L445472 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine...
L445471 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...
L445470 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Then why don't you write about something you know?  Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.
L445469 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Right.
L445468 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it?
L445467 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Right.
L445466 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Isn't he the one that always writes about things - only the things he knows about?
L445464 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ I don't know a thing about him, but isn't he the one you're always yelling about?
L445463 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ What do you know about Conrad?
L445462 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Conrad.
L445461 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Did who?
L445460 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Did Conrad draw on his imagination?
L445459 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
L445458 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Then how do you expect to write about it?
L445457 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Never even been to New Madrid.
L445456 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ To Old Madrid.
L445455 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Been where?
L445454 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Stewart, have you ever been to Old Madrid?
L445453 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Haven't I covered some territory? It feels like I've been on a Cook's Tour[18] some place.
L445452 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Well, you're not getting your play done, but you're certainly covering a lot of territory.
L445450 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Well, I've just been able to get off that Norway coast - so far.
L445449 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ How far have you gotten?
L445447 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Yes - and I'd love it.
L445446 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ You know what I should do with you? I should sock you right in that funny little nose.
L445434 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Smythe! Give them one drink and throw 'em out!
L445433 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Okay.
L445432 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ I see. Hank brought them all. That's all right. We'll give them a drink and throw 'em out. How's that?
L445431 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ I'm sorry, Stew. I asked Hank, and Hank did the rest.
L445408 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Hello, Hank. How are you?
L445407 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Hello, Stew.
L445406 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Well, Gallagher! Glad to see you.
L445248 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Yes.
L445247 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ No, no. Strange, I've never seen Anne act that way before.  It's funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it?
L445246 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Oh, that's all right, Stew. Forget it. As far as she's concerned, I'm just part of the hired help.
L445245 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ I'm sorry, Gallagher - really, I am sorry.
L445234 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Right!
L445233 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ They all consider me just as one of the boys.
L445217 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Must be my wife.
L445216 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ My mistake - she's glaring.
L445215 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Staring at us?
L445214 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Don't turn around now - but there's a very beautiful girl up there who seems to be staring at us.
L445213 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Oh, you dyed one and washed the other. Well! You certainly look good.
L445212 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ I dyed one and washed the other.
L445211 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress?
L445210 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Nothing.
L445209 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Gee Gallagher, do you look good! What are you doing to yourself?
L445208 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Say, who's been tying your ties lately? It looks rotten.
L445207 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
L445206 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
L445205 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Aw, you wanted to see some life in the raw, huh? Well gal, I'm afraid we ain't got no raw life up here.
L445204 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.
L445203 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Well, daughter of the slums - how did you get out of the ghetto?
L445202 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ There you are—!
L445201 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
L445200 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph.
L445030 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Her family? Oh, they'll be all right. I'll bring them around.  Gilded cage?!  Besides, I'm not marrying her family. Stew Smith in a gilded cage! Stew Smith? Ha!  That mug. What does he know?
L445029 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ How is her family going to feel about it?
L445028 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ I knew you would, pal.  A bird in a gilded cage, eh?
L445027 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Sure - I think so, Stew.
L445026 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Pay attention? I'm not paying any attention to him. You think that guy could get me upset? Hah! Not that mug. He's a tough mug - hard, cynical. He doesn't know the fine things in life - that guy.  A bird in a gilded cage, huh? It's getting so a guy can't step out without being called a magnolia. Stew Smith, a magnolia! Not me. Say, I'm not going to hang around and be a speakeasy rat all my life! I'll tell you that. Not me, not me. I'm going to step out and mean something in this world. You watch me.  Say, am I a lucky guy to be near Anne Schuyler?  I've been hit with a carload of horseshoes, and believe me I know it. Lucky, I'll say I'm lucky!  Don't you think I'm lucky, Gallagher?
L445025 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Don't pay attention to him, Stew. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
L444985 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Cut that out. Just because I'm married - there's no reason for that.
L444984 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Oh, I'll call you up some time. And if your social duties permit - why -
L444983 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Say, what kind of a pal are you? You're not going to leave me flat?
L444982 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're a married man now. Mother always warned me never to run around with married men.
L444981 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll come down alone.
L444980 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ My error.
L444979 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Now get this, Gallagher - Smith. That's the name.
L444978 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Remember, she's a Schuyler.
L444977 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Who - Anne? Sure, Anne would love that.
L444976 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Do you think your wife would walk up three flights of stairs just to eat out of paper plates?
L444975 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Remember the time we had a spaghetti party, and while I was serving the spaghetti I dropped it on the floor, and while those mugs weren't looking, I picked it up and served it to them anyway! Remember that? Yes, Anne would love that.
L444974 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Not since you broke into society.
L444973 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Ah! Thank you, Joe.  Tell you what - we'll have one of those parties down at your house - one of those spaghetti parties, you know. Gee, we haven't had one of those in a long time, have we Gallagher?
L444972 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Who me? She wouldn't want to meet me. I'm just an old load of hay.
L444971 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Joe! A little snifter.  Say, wasn't I a lucky guy to fall into a girl like that, huh?  Look at that! I don't know how I rate that, Gallagher. Gosh, there's a swell girl. I want you to meet her.
L444970 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ It's the smoke.
L444969 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Oh sure, we'll be happy. What's the matter with your eyes?
L444968 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ I hope you'll be very happy.
L444967 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Thanks, thanks.
L444966 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Sure. I wish you all the luck in the world, pal.
L444965 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Sure, you ran away. Aren't you going to congratulate a guy?
L444964 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ I didn't run away.
L444963 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Well, well, well! Gallagher, old pal! There you are. What did you run away for?
L444834 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Well, you're my pal, aren't you? Then don't turn female on me.
L444833 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Well!
L444832 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ There you go, talking like a woman!
L444831 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ And the rest of us are truck horses?
L444830 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Gallagher! She's the real McCoy!
L444829 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ On now, Stew, don't be too hard on her. I wouldn't call her a brewery horse.
L444828 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Sure, sure. You've got a nose, Gallagher. You've got a nose. But there's different women, Gallagher. You know, like brewery horses and thoroughbreds.
L444827 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Of course I haven't got a nose.
L444826 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Oh, you don't appreciate it. Her pictures don't do her justice. Why, Gallagher, she's queenly - she is queenly - and I know queens!  And oh, has she got herself a nose - and I know noses too. That little snozzle of hers is the berries, I tell you. And is she cute when she throws that little snozzle to the high heavens!
L444825 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Well, I've seen her pictures, and I don't think she's so hot.
L444824 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ —and those and them.
L444823 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ —and that—
L444822 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ And with it came love! Oh Gallagher, you've got to meet her. She's it—
L444820 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Sure, the story is cold, but I'm not. I'm sizzling - look! Psst!
L444819 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ For heaven's sake, Stew, are you completely bats? What for? I thought the story was cold. You can't go back there.
L444818 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench. Her wounds need soothing.
L444817 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ You what?
L444816 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ I hope not . . . I've got to call on her this morning!
L444815 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ You're sure going to be poison to that Junior Leaguer[4] from now on!
L444660 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ There's the third one. If I don't get the last one, there's a certain sob sister I know that's going to get a kick right in the . . . oh! Whoops, almost had that.
L444659 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ The boss is getting hoarse.
L444658 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Come on, come on. Here they come, Gallagher! Here they come!
L444657 +++$+++ u2489 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GALLAGHER +++$+++ Stew, your hands are shaking. You've been drinking again.
L445571 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ And now for that twentieth crack—
L445570 +++$+++ u2490 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GRAYSON +++$+++ Yes.
L445569 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Don't think. Let me do all the thinking. Now you go back to that Schuyler outfit and tell them that I didn't marry that dame for her dough and I don't want any of her dough now. I was too poor to buy her a wedding present when we got married, so I'm giving her a divorce for a wedding present. Now, stand up!
L445568 +++$+++ u2490 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GRAYSON +++$+++ We just thought that—
L445567 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Unconscious. You know, when you don't know anything. Your natural state. There are some people - you can't buy their self-respect for a bucket of shekels - well, I happen to be one of those guys.
L445566 +++$+++ u2490 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GRAYSON +++$+++ I beg your pardon.
L445565 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Remember what I told you about that twentieth crack? All right, you've just made it. Before you go unconscious I want you to get this through your nut.
L445564 +++$+++ u2490 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GRAYSON +++$+++ That's putting it crudely, but—
L445563 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Wait a minute. Do I get from you that she wants to pay me alimony?
L445561 +++$+++ u2490 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GRAYSON +++$+++ You don't seem to understand. Anne doesn't expect anything from you.
L445560 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast.
L445559 +++$+++ u2490 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GRAYSON +++$+++ She wants me to arrange the financial settlement.
L445558 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ She did—?
L445557 +++$+++ u2490 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GRAYSON +++$+++ Anne asked me to come and see you about the divorce.
L445556 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ You don't.
L445555 +++$+++ u2490 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GRAYSON +++$+++ I don't eat waffles.
L445554 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Surely, sit down. If I had known you were coming, I would have thrown you up a waffle.
L445553 +++$+++ u2490 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GRAYSON +++$+++ Thanks. May I sit down?
L445552 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Surely, come right in.
L445551 +++$+++ u2490 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GRAYSON +++$+++ Now don't be absurd, Smith—  May I come in?
L445550 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ No, I have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing.
L445549 +++$+++ u2490 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GRAYSON +++$+++ I suppose you know why I came—?
L445548 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Holy jumping swordfish!
L445547 +++$+++ u2490 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GRAYSON +++$+++ Hello, Smith.
L445310 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Certainly! I'll take care of this guy Bingy myself, personally.  Now what are you crying about?
L445309 +++$+++ u2490 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GRAYSON +++$+++ Traps shut!
L445308 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Why deny it? The more you deny, the more they print. Let them alone! The thing to do is to sit still and keep our traps shut.
L445307 +++$+++ u2490 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GRAYSON +++$+++ Well, at best you might deny it.
L445306 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ You quit trying to stop anybody—
L445305 +++$+++ u2490 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GRAYSON +++$+++ I've tried to stop the evening papers, but it's useless.
L444785 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Go?! Wait a minute - that's a great story! Newspaper reporter was forcibly ejected from Schuyler Mansion, and—
L444784 +++$+++ u2490 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GRAYSON +++$+++ I think you'd better go.
L444779 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Who, Bingy? Yeah, Bingy would. He never saw fifty dollars before. You could have bought him for six bits. Funny thing about Bingy. The more he gets - the more he prints. He looks stupid, doesn't he? But oh how smart he gets when he bends over a typewriter.
L444778 +++$+++ u2490 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GRAYSON +++$+++ The man from the Tribune seemed perfectly satisfied.
L444775 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Good.
L444774 +++$+++ u2490 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GRAYSON +++$+++ I have it here.
L444773 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ A statement? Good.
L444772 +++$+++ u2490 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GRAYSON +++$+++ We admit nothing. However, I have a little statement all prepared.
L444771 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Well, well. That takes it out of the rumor class, doesn't it?
L444768 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Oh I see, but Gloria doesn't seem to be satisfied with the twenty thousand dollars.
L444767 +++$+++ u2490 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GRAYSON +++$+++ No breach-of-promise case has been filed. The matter has been settled out of court.
L444766 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
L444765 +++$+++ u2490 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ GRAYSON +++$+++ Just a habit. Mr. Schuyler is a bit put out by all the rumors going around.
L444764 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Nice set of Conrads you have out there, Mrs. Schuyler. I was just glancing through this one.  What's Michael tearing the paper about?
L445428 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Now Hank, are you sure they're coming?  It will be lonesome without them.  Smythe, take this crowd in there and give them a drink. And find out what the boys in the back room want!
L445427 +++$+++ u2491 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ The rest of the gang had to get out the morning edition - but they'll be down later.
L445426 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ I'm sorry nobody could come.

L445413 +++$+++ u2491 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ I sort of invited him along to bend an elbow. You don't mind, do you?
L445412 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Sure.
L445411 +++$+++ u2491 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ Okay - you remember Joe—
L445410 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Come right in - I'll get you a drink.
L445409 +++$+++ u2491 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ HANK +++$+++ Fine, but kinda thirsty.
L445486 +++$+++ u2494 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ SMYTHE +++$+++ I have. Double-strength!
L445485 +++$+++ u2493 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ MRS. SCHUYLER +++$+++ Smythe, you've been drinking.

L445324 +++$+++ u2493 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ MRS. SCHUYLER +++$+++ Are the cars ready?
L445323 +++$+++ u2494 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ SMYTHE +++$+++ Pardon me, madam. They phoned through from the Mayor's committee to remind you it's past the hour for the reception.
L445297 +++$+++ u2493 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ MRS. SCHUYLER +++$+++ "Cinderella Man Grows Hair On Chest!"
L445296 +++$+++ u2494 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ SMYTHE +++$+++ Double-strength!

L444707 +++$+++ u2494 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ SMYTHE +++$+++ I've anticipated it, madame. The bicarbonate is ready.
L444706 +++$+++ u2493 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ MRS. SCHUYLER +++$+++ Oh, Smythe, some bicarbonate of soda, quick - double strength. I know those news mongrels[3] will upset me.
L444700 +++$+++ u2494 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ SMYTHE +++$+++ Pardon me, madam - but what am I to say to the newspapermen?
L444699 +++$+++ u2493 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ MRS. SCHUYLER +++$+++ What is it, Smythe?
L445522 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Sure I'm insane, but I've got some good news for you.  This magnolia is leaving your sweet smelling vanilla joint. This bird in a cage is gonna button his own pants from now on. And that is what is known as telling the mother- in-law.
L445521 +++$+++ u2493 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ MRS. SCHUYLER +++$+++ Heavens! The man's insane!
L445520 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Joan of Arc! What's it to you?
L445519 +++$+++ u2493 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ MRS. SCHUYLER +++$+++ What's going on here? Who is this woman?
L445318 +++$+++ u2493 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ MRS. SCHUYLER +++$+++ Anne Schuyler, are you going to sit there and watch this man insult us? Haven't you any decency left?
L445317 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ That's the fourteenth crack you've made to me. I'm keeping count. When you get to twenty, I'm gonna sock you right on the nose. As a matter of fact, I ought to sock you right now.
L445314 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Yes, I'm sorry, I struck him right here in your house. And I'll strike anybody in anybody's house that calls me a Cinderella Man.
L445313 +++$+++ u2493 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ MRS. SCHUYLER +++$+++ And you struck him right here in our house—?
L445304 +++$+++ u2493 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ MRS. SCHUYLER +++$+++ To engage in a brawl! A cheap, common brawl, in my own home! "I wear the pants!" The pants ! Not even the trousers!
L445303 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ He's a worm - and I'm gonna step on him!
L445302 +++$+++ u2493 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ MRS. SCHUYLER +++$+++ I beg your pardon?
L445301 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Yes - the worm!
L445300 +++$+++ u2493 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ MRS. SCHUYLER +++$+++ Have you seen this? 
L445299 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Good morning, everybody—  Well, maybe it isn't a good morning, huh?  Anne, did you ever get the feeling that there was someone else in the room with you?
L445053 +++$+++ u2493 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ MRS. SCHUYLER +++$+++ This man's impossible! I can't talk to him. Grayson, let's go where we can talk - hic!  See what you've done to me!?
L445052 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ All right, Grandma—
L445051 +++$+++ u2493 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ MRS. SCHUYLER +++$+++ Stop calling me Mother!
L445047 +++$+++ u2495 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ STEW +++$+++ Oh, my marriage to Anne. Now Mrs. Schuyler, we don't want you to go to any trouble about that. We just want the usual blessings, that's all.
L445046 +++$+++ u2493 +++$+++ m161 +++$+++ MRS. SCHUYLER +++$+++ About what? Your marriage to Anne!
