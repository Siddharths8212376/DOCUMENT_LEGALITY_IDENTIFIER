L51514 +++$+++ u3776 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ C-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. I got Sean from the bakery to baby-sit so let's go out.
L51513 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I'm on the last page. How do you spell conscience?
L51512 +++$+++ u3776 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ You're not still writing that thank-you note?
L51451 +++$+++ u3776 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ Come on. Why fight when we know how it will come out. This isn't like stocking or a string of pearls. You don't send this one back.
L51450 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ It lets a crazy man into our lives.
L51449 +++$+++ u3776 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ Do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in Emergency who keep telling us they can't help?
L51448 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ There is a seriously goofy man behind this. You are not allowed to block out that fact.
L51403 +++$+++ u3776 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ You met the gift.
L51402 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Huh?
L51401 +++$+++ u3776 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ BEVERLY +++$+++ I didn't know you had a secret admire.
L51531 +++$+++ u3788 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SPENCER +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L51530 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Do you love me?
L51405 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Stay out of this...  Doctor?
L51404 +++$+++ u3788 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SPENCER +++$+++ He's good...  And I'm an expert on doctors.
L51400 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ No, I didn't.  So why are you h...
L51399 +++$+++ u3788 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SPENCER +++$+++ Hi...  Did you know there are doctors who come to your house?
L51181 +++$+++ u3788 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SPENCER +++$+++ Not bad.
L51180 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Don't be silly. How bad?
L51179 +++$+++ u3788 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SPENCER +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L51435 +++$+++ u3780 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ DR. BETTES +++$+++ They're considerable. But Mr. Udall wants to be billed.
L51434 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Doc!!!  So listen, you gotta let me know about the additional costs -- one way or the other we'll...
L51432 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ No.
L51431 +++$+++ u3780 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ DR. BETTES +++$+++ Water...  Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room?
L51430 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Do you want some juice or coffee or two female slaves?
L51429 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ His home number.
L51428 +++$+++ u3780 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ DR. BETTES +++$+++ Me. My home number is on this card.
L51427 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Once the tests come back, is there someone I can reach in your office for the results?
L51426 +++$+++ u3780 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ DR. BETTES +++$+++ No. Actually, I think that's their technical name.
L51425 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me.
L51424 +++$+++ u3780 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ DR. BETTES +++$+++ It's amazing these things weren't done.
L51423 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ No. I asked. They said it's not covered under my plan. And it's not necessary anyway.
L51422 +++$+++ u3780 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ DR. BETTES +++$+++ They haven't done the standard scratch test. Where they make small injections into the skin?
L51421 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ No.
L51420 +++$+++ u3780 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ DR. BETTES +++$+++ Have they done skin testing for allergies?
L51419 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Emergency room only.
L51418 +++$+++ u3780 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ DR. BETTES +++$+++ Only in the emergency room or when he was well.
L51417 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Yes.
L51416 +++$+++ u3780 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ DR. BETTES +++$+++ Have they done blood tests on him?
L51415 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Since forever.
L51414 +++$+++ u3780 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ DR. BETTES +++$+++ How long has he been having problems?
L51407 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I'm a waitress.
L51406 +++$+++ u3780 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ DR. BETTES +++$+++ My wife is Melvin Udall's publisher.  She says I have to take great care of this guy because you're urgently needed back at work. What work do you do?
L51398 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Tell me how bad it is. I let him go out last night when it was so cool without an overshirt -- just and underone with just the straps and I know better...  and I let him talk me into it. He was whining and...  you don't need this. Give me a second to catch hold.
L51397 +++$+++ u3780 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ DR. BETTES +++$+++ He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.
L51396 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
L51395 +++$+++ u3780 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ DR. BETTES +++$+++ Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes ...  Dr. Bettes.
L51394 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ What? Please? Now? Tell me?!
L51910 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I'm gonna grab you.  I didn't mean it to be a question. I'm gonna grab you.
L51909 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ No! It's certainly not. No -- I don't think so. No.
L51907 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Just let me talk.  I'm the only one on the face of the earth who realizes that you're the greatest woman on earth. I'm the only one who appreciates how amazing you are in every single thing you do -- in every single thought you have... in how you are with Spencer -- Spence...  ... in how you say what you mean and how you almost always mean something that's all about being straight and good...
L51906 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ You know what? I...
L51905 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Hey, I've got a great compliment for you.
L51904 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Melvin, even though it may seem that way now -- you don't know me all that well...  I'm not the answer for you.
L51903 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I'm feeling... I've been feeling better.
L51901 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Okay.
L51900 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ If you need an excuse, there's a bakery on the corner. There's a shot it'll open soon -- that way we're not screwy -- we're just two people who like warm rolls.
L51899 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ See. It's four in the morning. A walk sounds a little screwy to me, if you don't mind.
L51898 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ It feels a little confined here. Let's take a walk.
L51896 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Maybe we could live without the wise cracks.
L51895 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.
L51894 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Boyfriend?
L51890 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ It relaxes me... I'd feel better just sitting on the curb in front of your house than anyplace else I can think of or imagine.
L51889 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Because...
L51888 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I had to see you...
L51887 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Is it a secret what you're doing here?
L51886 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ What a break...
L51885 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I wasn't asleep!!
L51883 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L51882 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Were you asleep?
L51881 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ What job?
L51880 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ ... 'Cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. So then I wouldn't even try.
L51879 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Grouchy?
L51878 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ 'Cause if you were asleep -- I'm sorry. And you could be grouchy.
L51877 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ What do you want?
L51876 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Were you asleep?
L51875 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ What do you want, Melvin?
L51853 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ So long.
L51852 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Okay. Good-bye.
L51851 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I should've danced with you.
L51850 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Go ahead.
L51849 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Okay to say something now?
L51847 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ You don't have to answer everything I say. Just listen to me. Okay?
L51846 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Cute.
L51845 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ See. There's an example. I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now.
L51844 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ The two might go together.
L51843 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I don't know whether I'm being sensible or hard on you.
L51842 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ That seems like a good choice.
L51841 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I can trust my brain.
L51840 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ How you doing?
L51839 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Yeah... Well...
L51838 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Hello.
L51813 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I don't care what you did for me. I don't think I want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself.  You have my number.
L51812 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I'll take you... why not?
L51811 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I'll take a bus.
L51810 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Here are the keys to my apartment. I'm going to park you in my place while I take Carol home.
L51809 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ It's your car but I don't want to hear it. If that means anything.
L51808 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ This one has a special meaning.
L51807 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I don't.
L51806 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ What do you mean? You said you liked it.
L51805 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I don't want to hear that music right now.
L51801 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Do it then. Get the dog picked up. I can't believe you let it stay there.
L51800 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!
L51799 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Nothing like no choice to make you feel at home.
L51783 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ To hell with sex.
L51782 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Sorry, didn't realize she was right there.  Did you have sex with her?
L51751 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ It was a mistake.
L51750 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I'll never forget you said it.
L51749 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I don't know why I brought you -- that idea occurred to me is all... It came out first... Hey, you kiss him -- me... He says he loves you. You two hit it off. But you don't want to... fine... Forget what I said about sex with Simon. It was a mistake.
L51748 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!
L51747 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ It's one idea...
L51746 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Sex with Simon?
L51745 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ There are lots of reason... I had a thought that if you had sex with Simon it might...
L51744 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ If you ask me... I'll say, "yes."
L51743 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Tell me even if you're scared. Tell me why you wanted me here. It's okay.
L51742 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Well, ah... that's a personal question.
L51741 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ That wasn't payment. When you first came into breakfast, when I saw you -- I thought you were handsome... Then, of course, you spoke... So now that your soft li'l underbelly is all exposed. Tell me, why did you bring me?
L51740 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ You don't owe me that.
L51739 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Here's the trouble with never.
L51738 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Never.
L51737 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Have you ever let a romantic moment make you do something you know is stupid?
L51736 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Takes months to know... They work little by little.  Talking like this is exhausting.
L51735 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ So how are you doing with those pills? Well, I hopahopahopa.
L51734 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Then I've really overshot here 'cause I was aiming at just enough to keep you from walking out.
L51733 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ That's maybe the best compliment of my life.
L51731 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I don't quite get how that's a compliment for me.
L51730 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Don't be pessimistic. It's not your style. Okay... Here I goes... Clearly a mistake.  I have this -- what? Ailment... And my doctor -- a shrink... who I used to see all the time... he says 50 or 60 percent of the time a pill can really help. I hate pills. Very dangerous things, pills. "Hate," I am using the word "hate" about pills. My compliment is that when you came to my house that time and told me how you'd never -- well, you were there, you know... The next morning I started taking these pills.
L51729 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I am so afraid you're about to say something awful...
L51726 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ One baked -- one fries.
L51725 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Fries.
L51724 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Two crab dinners and pitcher of cold beer.  Baked or fries?
L51723 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Can we order first?
L51722 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ And mean it...
L51721 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Okay.
L51720 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.
L51719 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ That monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away. Never fails.
L51718 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
L51717 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't mean it. You gotta sit down. You can still give me the dirty look... just sit down and give it to me.
L51716 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ No...  ... I don't get this place. They make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress. I don't get it.
L51715 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ And?
L51714 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.
L51713 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ You wanna dance?
L51694 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ You promised a nice place -- can't you just...  You have these dry cleaned all the time, don't you?
L51693 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ No... I'm not wearing that -- and just in case you were going to ask I'm not going to let you inject me with plaque either.
L51689 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Just him and that's it. Okay, you can answer -- we've worked it out.
L51688 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Stop asking everyone.
L51676 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Dancing?
L51675 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ My son was outside playing soccer. I never saw him playing ball. Come on, you guys -- take me out for a good time... Take me out dancing.
L51667 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Yes... sure.  I'll take the sofa.
L51666 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ No answer... Maybe we should just drive there tomorrow. Can I have that one?
L51662 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ No.
L51661 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ That's not true. Some of us have great stories... pretty stories that take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad. Just not anybody in this car. But lots of people -- that's their story -- good times and noodle salad... and that's what makes it hard. Not that you had it bad but being that pissed that so many had it good.
L51658 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Go ahead, Simon. Your father walked in on you and was yelling and... really, come on.
L51657 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ ... my father didn't leave his room for 11 years -- he hit my hand with a yardstick if I made a mistake on the piano.
L51654 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ You like sad stories -- you want mine.
L51653 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Hey -- you let him...
L51645 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Anybody here who's interested in what Melvin has to say raise their hands.
L51644 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Nonsense!
L51643 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I'm sure, Simon, they did something real off for you to feel this way... But when it comes to your partners -- or your kid -- things will always be off for you unless you set it straight. Maybe this thing happened to you just to give you that chance.
L51636 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Welcome.
L51635 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Thanks, Melvin.
L51631 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Let me go in back. You look like you need all the room you can manage.
L51630 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.
L51629 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
L51628 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I was going to do that for you.
L51625 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Hello... Oh, my God, who did that to you?
L51624 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Thanks for being on time... Carol, the waitress, this is Simon, the fag.
L51623 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Hi.
L51608 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Oh. Okay, then -- Melvin. Good night.
L51607 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Whether crabs are in season there now...
L51606 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?
L51605 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Oh.  We might. Yes. We can. Let's.
L51604 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or... I mean -- I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes.
L51603 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next.  That you might ask -- I'm not certain.
L51602 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Melvin... I'd like to know exactly where we are going.
L51601 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Yes.
L51600 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Are you still coming?
L51599 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Hello?
L51595 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ No.
L51594 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Is there another way to see it?
L51593 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?
L51592 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Write me a note and ain't she sweet. I need a hand and where'd she go.
L51591 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Funny, I thought it was a strong point.
L51590 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ What's that got to do with it?
L51589 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Melvin, I'd rather not.
L51588 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Bettes tells me he's doing fine.
L51587 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ My son.
L51586 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ You take off when you have to.
L51585 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I can't. I work.
L51584 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Two days.
L51583 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ The stiff one eye?
L51582 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I can't do this alone. I'm afraid he'll pull the stiff one eye on me. I need you to chaperon. Separate everything but cars. You said you liked convertibles. Now I'm on the hook.
L51581 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ No, sir...
L51580 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I want you to go on this trip.
L51579 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Oh, I'm sorry... Didn't I say, "what?" I thought I said, "what?"... What?
L51578 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Now I want you to do something for me.
L51577 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Thank you.
L51576 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Nice of you... thank you.
L51574 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ I also wrote one part... I wrote I'm sorry... I was talking about I was sorry when I got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so I wrote that.  I was sorry for busting you on that... and I'm sorry for busting in on you that night... when I said I was never... I was sorry and I'm sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler...
L51573 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Lovely.
L51572 +++$+++ u3777 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ CAROL +++$+++ Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.
