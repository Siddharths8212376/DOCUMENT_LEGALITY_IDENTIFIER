L464115 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ ...ttt..tt... two out of three?
L464114 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Got something to say to me, Nick?
L464110 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Nick, here's what we're gonna do. In the spirit of the season, I'm going to give you a chance. I understand you're unhappy. Right outta the lockup, here against your will, it's the holidays and there's reruns on TV.  So we're gonna have a contest.
L464109 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ ...never... tried...
L464108 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ A for effort, Nick, honestly, A for effort and an honorary degree. I'm surprised you never escaped from the Mountain.
L464013 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Monster. If we're working together here, we gotta be working together. I can't walk in there looking like the Lone Fucking Ranger with ten bucks to throw down. You don't want me getting noticed, right? Not getting noticed costs a guy at least a couple hundred.
L464012 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Don't tip.
L464011 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Ten dollars? What do I do with ten dollars?
L464010 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ I'm gonna need some money.
L464009 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ You got one hour.
L464007 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Get out.
L464006 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Y'know what, guys? I woke up this morning, I got a really lucky feeling going on. I mean it, I'm feeling that good. I wouldn't be surprised if I walk in there, pull a handle and hit jackpot. Hell, we wouldn't even have to --
L464005 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ You get recognized, convict, You get a country-western funeral.
L464004 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Do I get a country-western name?
L464003 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Shut the fuck up. You play what your girlfriend plays. Ashley's going in with you. You talk to her, otherwise you don't talk to nobody. You walk the room as many times as you want, but the second you come out, I want to know the run of the place.
L464002 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ At least gimme video poker.
L464001 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ You do.
L464000 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ What kind of half-ass cowboy plays the slots?
L463999 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ You're a country-western singer up from Nashville for the the holidays. Visiting your Grandma on the lake, driving into the Tomahawk for some scotch and slots. You only play the slots, you got that? Don't want no dealer friend of yours recognizing you, you sidle up to shoot some craps.
L463998 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Put it on.
L463997 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ A cowboy. You're going to send me into an Indian casino disguised as a cowboy. Have you thought this entirely through?
L463960 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Don't have Weather Channel in the Mountain, Nick.
L463959 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Might as well be.
L463958 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Rather be back in the Mountain?
L463956 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ More than you know.
L463955 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Bring back some memories, Nick?
L463953 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ 'Cause you're gonna get me a disguise.
L463952 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
L463951 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Trust me. They won't recognize me.
L463950 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Why not.
L463949 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ They won't recognize me.
L463946 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Wrong, convict. You walk in there, they recognize you.
L463945 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ You'd have to get me inside.  Get inside, watch where the money's moving, see where the guards are going. Then I could work with your map.
L463944 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ So what the hell good are you...
L463941 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ When I worked there, this was Bangs, office. Back here. He kept a little safe in the... uh, the wall, money held take for himself, skim from the Indians. Called it the... uh...  ...the Powwow Safe.
L463940 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ They wouldn't have changed the security setup.
L463933 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ And I worked there. For a year.
L463932 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ We walked the place for a week.
L463927 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ This is the front entrance, right? You get through the slots, you hit craps here, not blackjack. Blackjack's here to here -- lined up. What's this, the cage? Cage is over there, hard to get to, you got it all mixed around --
L463926 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ What the fuck are you talking about.
L463925 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ This isn't the Tomahawk.
L463924 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ I did.
L463923 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ I said, who the hell made the map?
L463922 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ What?
L463918 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ And which of these doors here lead up to the security level?
L463917 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Hell. Ten?
L463908 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ We got faith in you, Nick Mason.  You're our inside man.
L463907 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Hey, it's... been two years --
L463906 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ You know where the guards are. You know how to get in and out. You know where the money is.  We're taking down that casino, convict. You're the guy gonna tell us how.
L463905 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Christmas... Eve...
L463904 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?
L463903 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Five million?
L463902 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ The hell you don't.
L463901 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ I don't know.
L463900 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ How much money's in that casino? Day-to-day.

L463888 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Let's get back on the road. It's time to start talking, Nick. Time to start telling tales --
L463886 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ No. It's her brother.
L463885 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ Wrong, Nick. It's drowning.
L463884 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ Her brother.
L463883 +++$+++ u2596 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ GABRIEL +++$+++ What's her greatest fear?
L463882 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ A station wagon in Canada.

L464035 +++$+++ u2606 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ YOUNG GOVERNOR +++$+++ We want to see our casino making money again, Mr. Bangs. Making money for our community.

L464185 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ You lock down security, you move behind the cage. You hit the Count Room. There'll be a guy in there but he's got no guns; room's accessed by another code. Cashiers'll know it. They'll have alarms.
L464184 +++$+++ u2599 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ What about the money?
L464178 +++$+++ u2599 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ MERLIN +++$+++ How do we do that?

L464175 +++$+++ u2603 +++$+++ m169 +++$+++ RUDY +++$+++ What you gotta worry about first is the guards. Place doesn't look much richer than when I worked there, so let's figure you're gonna have to deal with ten of 'em. There'll be two on the floor, walking the room, that leaves eight up above. Eyes in the sky. They see something up, they're the ones who'll hit the silent alarm and you're fucked.
