L167381 +++$+++ u4860 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MULVANEY +++$+++ I'm not going.  I'm okay.
L167380 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ You know more than the Doctor? You're not okay, look at you.  Come on ...  ... let's get him out ...
L167379 +++$+++ u4860 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MULVANEY +++$+++ I'm okay ... I'm okay ...
L167107 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ What are you talking about?  What do you think I'm doin'?  I'm gettin' the ball rollin'.  I'm keeping these people happy ... I'm keeping you happy ... I gotta keep the cops cooled out ... I gotta do everything ... I gotta pay for the pizza ... I'm workin' on it, do you know what I mean?  I'm workin' on it ... Jesus Christ!  I gotta do it all ... I got all the ideas ... you want me to give you the gun?  You want to take it over?
L167106 +++$+++ u4860 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MULVANEY +++$+++ Are we going to get the ball rolling?
L167058 +++$+++ u4860 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MULVANEY +++$+++ I don't know.
L167057 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Do you think we can turn it on?
L167055 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ 
L167054 +++$+++ u4860 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MULVANEY +++$+++ I don't know, Sonny ... on the roof somewhere I guess.
L167053 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Where's the air conditioning?
L167004 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Wait a minute ... I've been looking at this all wrong ... Let's look at it the other way ...
L167003 +++$+++ u4860 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MULVANEY +++$+++ What now, Sonny?
L167002 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ You see what we're dealing with? They want me to kill all of you!
L166987 +++$+++ u4860 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MULVANEY +++$+++ I guess he didn't appreciate your use of language.  They don't speak that way on television.  It's a rule.  Do you realize you've cut off a valuable source of communication?
L166986 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Why the hell did he do that?  What the hell did I do?
L166959 +++$+++ u4860 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MULVANEY +++$+++ The TV ... they want to talk to you ...
L166958 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ What?
L166849 +++$+++ u4860 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MULVANEY +++$+++ I don't fool around with you.
L166848 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ You're just a nice guy, Mr. Mulvaney. Only don't fuck around with me, you know what I mean?
L166846 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ They'll shoot you; the fucking cops'll shoot you ... they don't give a damn.  In spite of that bank insurance.  You see what they did in Attica, they shot everybody, the hostages, prisoners, cops, guards, forty-two people they killed, the innocent with the guilty.
L166845 +++$+++ u4860 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MULVANEY +++$+++ If you take anybody, please take me.
L166844 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ What if I take you with me?
L166843 +++$+++ u4860 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MULVANEY +++$+++ I don't care who you are ...  I just want to get you outta here, safe, right?
L166842 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Don't ask me questions.  I got connections.  You find out who I am, you're cold meat.
L166840 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Ah, I know!  You're being very cooperative.  I got no complaint against you whatever; you got bank insurance?
L166839 +++$+++ u4860 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MULVANEY +++$+++ I got two kids ... and I'd like to see them again.
L166838 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ You got kids?
L166835 +++$+++ u4860 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MULVANEY +++$+++ They make $105 a week to start. They fold the flag, check the place out in the morning.  I don't know what they learn, Sonny.
L166834 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ To what ... learn how to shoot? They don't get a gun.
L166833 +++$+++ u4860 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MULVANEY +++$+++ Well, they go to guard school.
L166832 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Let's go to the back door.  How'd that guy get to be a guard?
L166831 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ You and me are checking the other ways in and out.
L166830 +++$+++ u4860 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MULVANEY +++$+++ Mulvaney...
L166829 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Now, you -- what's your name?
L166802 +++$+++ u4860 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MULVANEY +++$+++ It's locked on the inside.  It's through that passageway and to the right.
L166801 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Where's the back door?
L166776 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ I took too long.
L166775 +++$+++ u4860 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MULVANEY +++$+++ I swear to God... on my salary, I'm not gonna be any hero...
L166747 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Sal, get 'em in the vault.
L166746 +++$+++ u4860 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MULVANEY +++$+++ Hello, Mulvaney here...
L166742 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ You're goin' outside with me.  If there's no cops around, we just split.  Otherwise, you go with us.
L166741 +++$+++ u4860 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MULVANEY +++$+++ For God's sake, will you please go now?  We gave you every nickel we got.
L166729 +++$+++ u4860 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MULVANEY +++$+++ Give me the keys...
L166728 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ The gun's right on your back...
L166716 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Gimme the keys to get outta here!
L166715 +++$+++ u4860 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MULVANEY +++$+++ Howard, give him the keys...
L166708 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Gimme the traveler's checks and the register.
L166707 +++$+++ u4860 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MULVANEY +++$+++ Hello... I'm sorry I can't talk to you right now... I suggest you call during banking hours tomorrow. What is your name?
L166704 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ My side, shit!
L166703 +++$+++ u4860 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MULVANEY +++$+++ Believe me, I'm on your side.
L166702 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Hey, you, manager... Don't get any ideas, fucker... See that man there? I bark and he bites!
L166685 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Okay, don't worry about it.  Stick it in the bag...
L166684 +++$+++ u4860 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MULVANEY +++$+++ It's all we got.
L166683 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ This is it?  What am I gonna do with this?  Holy shit!
L166678 +++$+++ u4860 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MULVANEY +++$+++ Come on, lemme load you up...
L166677 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ What's the matter with you?
L166675 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Well, you get your mind right.  I'm a Catholic and I don't wanna hurt nobody, but goddamn it, don't you play no games with me.  Unnastand?!?
L166674 +++$+++ u4860 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MULVANEY +++$+++ I must of been outta my mind.
L166671 +++$+++ u4860 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MULVANEY +++$+++ I can take care of that.
L166670 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Okay, is the vault open?
L166658 +++$+++ u4860 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MULVANEY +++$+++ Do what the gentleman says, Howard.
L166657 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Hey... let him out!
L166653 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ If he moves - blow his guts out... Cover him!
L166652 +++$+++ u4860 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MULVANEY +++$+++ Okay, okay... we know it's a stickup!
L166740 +++$+++ u4860 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MULVANEY +++$+++ It's okay. [Regards to the family, Sam.]
L166739 +++$+++ u4864 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ I'm glad it's okay.
L166738 +++$+++ u4860 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MULVANEY +++$+++ Thanks again, Sam.
L166737 +++$+++ u4864 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Okay.
L166736 +++$+++ u4860 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MULVANEY +++$+++ Yeah, thanks for keeping an eye out.
L166735 +++$+++ u4864 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Yeah.  Well, you're okay?
L166734 +++$+++ u4860 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MULVANEY +++$+++ Little smoke: like a Polish four- alarm fire, is all.
L166733 +++$+++ u4864 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ You all right?
L166732 +++$+++ u4860 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MULVANEY +++$+++ Yeah, just a cigarette got in a wastebasket.
L166731 +++$+++ u4864 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SAM +++$+++ Everything's all right?  You okay?
L166730 +++$+++ u4860 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MULVANEY +++$+++ What is it, Sam?
L167557 +++$+++ u4867 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SYLVIA +++$+++ Hey.  It's raining.
L167556 +++$+++ u4860 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MULVANEY +++$+++ You were terrific, too!
L167555 +++$+++ u4867 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SYLVIA +++$+++ Ah, Sonny!  Good luck, you know?
L167415 +++$+++ u4860 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MULVANEY +++$+++ Girls, I wanta apologize.  For my language back there.
L167414 +++$+++ u4867 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SYLVIA +++$+++ I wish somebody would tell me I'm gonna live long enough for it to be a habit.  My parent, she'll be okay. My husband, he'll be okay.  I even know who the bum is gonna marry. Terrific.  She'll take good care of him.
L167252 +++$+++ u4867 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SYLVIA +++$+++ I told you, he's got diabetes.
L167251 +++$+++ u4860 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MULVANEY +++$+++ I didn't eat any pizza.
L166949 +++$+++ u4860 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MULVANEY +++$+++ What about Howard?
L166948 +++$+++ u4867 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SYLVIA +++$+++ Hey, girls -- I was on television...
L166895 +++$+++ u4867 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SYLVIA +++$+++ Howard!
L166894 +++$+++ u4860 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ MULVANEY +++$+++ It's up to you ladies.
L167552 +++$+++ u4862 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ No, that's all.
L167551 +++$+++ u4861 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ NEWSMAN +++$+++ Do you remember anything else about Sal?
L167550 +++$+++ u4862 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ Yeah.
L167549 +++$+++ u4861 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ NEWSMAN +++$+++ Did you always call him Junior.
L167548 +++$+++ u4862 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ No, not until after they killed him.
L167547 +++$+++ u4861 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ NEWSMAN +++$+++ Did you know he was a homosexual?
L167546 +++$+++ u4862 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ Oh, a long time.  Because I kept asking my husband where the heck could Junior be?  He wasn't around here.  I thought maybe he was in prison or some place.
L167545 +++$+++ u4861 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ NEWSMAN +++$+++ When was the last time you saw Sal?
L167544 +++$+++ u4862 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ PAULINE +++$+++ It was on the TV.
L167543 +++$+++ u4861 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ NEWSMAN +++$+++ How did you know your son was involved?
L167147 +++$+++ u4867 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SYLVIA +++$+++ Yes...
L167146 +++$+++ u4863 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ You gonna smoke the cigarette?
L167145 +++$+++ u4867 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SYLVIA +++$+++ You know, you remind me of my 19- year-old brother - only he's got his hair down to his knees - he looks like something that eats berries and roots out of the ground. God forbid I should say something to him like, 'Listen, if you ever smoke marijuana, just remember that it's illegal' and he storms outta the house.  You rob a bank, but you keep your body pure, is that it?
L167144 +++$+++ u4863 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ You're really pure, you know?  You got a perfect record.  You never used that stuff to ruin your body, why start now?
L167143 +++$+++ u4867 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SYLVIA +++$+++ You're serious!
L167142 +++$+++ u4863 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ Your body is the temple of the Lord.
L167141 +++$+++ u4867 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SYLVIA +++$+++ My body?  What for?
L167140 +++$+++ u4863 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ Go ahead.  Do what you want to do. I hate to see you break a perfect record.  You oughta take care of your body.
L167139 +++$+++ u4867 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SYLVIA +++$+++ For God's sake!  As soon as I'm outta this bank robbery, I'm gonna stop ... okay?
L167138 +++$+++ u4863 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ You shouldn't start now.
L167137 +++$+++ u4867 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SYLVIA +++$+++ Pure?
L167136 +++$+++ u4863 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ No!  I'm not kidding.  Don't you understand?  You're pure!
L167135 +++$+++ u4867 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SYLVIA +++$+++ You don't want cancer?  You're about to get your head blown off, you're worried about cancer.  Gimme the cigarette.
L167134 +++$+++ u4863 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ Because I don't want cancer.
L167133 +++$+++ u4867 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SYLVIA +++$+++ You stopped?  Why?
L167132 +++$+++ u4863 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ I used to, but I stopped.
L167131 +++$+++ u4867 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SYLVIA +++$+++ Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
L167130 +++$+++ u4863 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ You don't smoke ... why do you want to start now.
L167531 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Let's move it, goddamn it.
L167530 +++$+++ u4863 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ Hey, Sonny - You did it!
L167520 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Oh, Jesus!  Hey.  How about food? I forgot to ask to have food on board.
L167519 +++$+++ u4863 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ I'm here.
L167518 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ There it is, Sal.  Sal?
L167502 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ All right. 
L167501 +++$+++ u4863 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ Okay, Sonny.
L167500 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Just give me a receipt.  Hey, Sal, you okay?
L167402 +++$+++ u4863 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ Okay.
L167401 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Hey, Sal ... How you doin'?
L167247 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ He was showin' me how the airport bus is comin' in, like that, Sal.  What's wrong with him?
L167246 +++$+++ u4863 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ Why couldn't he talk about that here?
L167245 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ He was talkin' about arrangements ... we were talkin' about the TV.
L167244 +++$+++ u4863 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ What'd he say?
L167239 +++$+++ u4863 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ They gotta stop sayin' that.
L167238 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Sal?
L167226 +++$+++ u4863 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ Have him walk in backwards.
L167225 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ It's the FBI.  He wants to come in.
L167198 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ That's all they're interested in - it's a freak show to them.  I can't control it, Sal - let'em say what they want.  Forget it.  It don't matter.
L167197 +++$+++ u4863 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ They keep sayin' two homosexuals. I'm not a homosexual.  I want you to stop them saying that.
L167196 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ What?
L167105 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Look, I talked to him and it's not going to be a helicopter - they can't land on top of the roof - so they're comin' with a big ... limousine bus and they'll take us to the airport - and they're gonna get a jet ... so things are rollin' ... they're movin' ... I also ordered some food ... I got some pizzas for us, all right?  I got some things to drink - I got sodas ... I even asked them for aspirins ... I'm doin' what I can ... now I gotta pay for the pizza ... where are the marked bills?
L167104 +++$+++ u4863 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ Get over there!
L167103 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Okay ... okay ... all right, Sal, it's okay.  I got everything straightened out ... it's gonna be okay.
L167066 +++$+++ u4863 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ Everybody!  Back here!
L167065 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ They're trying to come through the door!
L167062 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ It's nothing - it just goes up - it's the safest thing in the world. Safer than a car.  Don't worry about it, Sal - it'll be all right ... they're great ...
L167061 +++$+++ u4863 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ I never been up in a plane before.
L167060 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Yeah ...
L167059 +++$+++ u4863 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ Sonny -
L167010 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Wyoming ... That's not out of the country -- that's in the United States ... Look, I'll be back.
L167009 +++$+++ u4863 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ Wyoming.
L167008 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ You realize, Sal, that we're gonna get outta the country, so if you wanna talk to somebody, do it now ... You gotta Mother or a Father? Friends?  If we gotta be outside the country, where do you wanna go?  Any country. Just name a country.
L166998 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ We're not there yet.
L166997 +++$+++ u4863 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ Does that still go?
L166996 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ We'd kill ourselves.
L166995 +++$+++ u4863 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ ... because if you're talking about coppin' a plea, I'm tellin' you right now, there's no deal ... I'm never going back to prison ... We got our own deal already ... Do you remember the pact we made?  You and me and Jackie - that night in the bar ... we were talkin' about if we get trapped in the bank, what are you gonna do ... Right?  What did we say?  What did we say!
L166994 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ 
L166993 +++$+++ u4863 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ What do you mean?  You talkin' about coppin a plea?
L166992 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Maybe we can get outta this thing alive ... get 'em to drop the kidnapping charges ...
L166991 +++$+++ u4863 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ What kind of a deal?
L166990 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ I figure maybe we can get the FBI to make a deal ...
L166989 +++$+++ u4863 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ 
L166988 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Okay, Sal ... what do we do?
L166898 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ All right ... let's go.
L166897 +++$+++ u4863 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ All right ... send them the guard.
L166896 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ To show that we're negotiating.
L166892 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ Alive.
L166891 +++$+++ u4863 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ Dead or alive?
L166890 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ He wants one.
L166827 +++$+++ u4863 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ I'll tell you right now - that I'm ready to do it.
L166826 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ We won't have to.
L166825 +++$+++ u4863 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ But I want to know what you think.
L166824 +++$+++ u4866 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SONNY +++$+++ I want him to think that.
L166823 +++$+++ u4863 +++$+++ m324 +++$+++ SAL +++$+++ But do you mean in? ... But you just told him that if worse comes to worse...
