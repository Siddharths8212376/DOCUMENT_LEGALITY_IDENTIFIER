L451002 +++$+++ u7133 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Yes...
L451001 +++$+++ u7141 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ STUCKEY +++$+++ And you just happened to run into her.  Great.  What's she do?  She work?
L451000 +++$+++ u7133 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ The night I left your house, I was lost.  I was looking for directions.
L450999 +++$+++ u7141 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ STUCKEY +++$+++ Come on, you can tell me.  I sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this.
L450998 +++$+++ u7133 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ We just did.
L450997 +++$+++ u7141 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ STUCKEY +++$+++ Fill me in on this.  How'd you and Vivian meet?
L450959 +++$+++ u7141 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ STUCKEY +++$+++ Bill Stuckey, Vivian.  My wife, Elizabeth.
L450958 +++$+++ u7133 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Bill, I'd like you to meet Vivian.

L450929 +++$+++ u7133 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Come on, Bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved. It's my money.
L450928 +++$+++ u7141 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ STUCKEY +++$+++ Excuse me for saying this but what is wrong with you this week? First, you go soft on the pension funds.  Now, you're giving him the chance to get away?  As of two minutes ago, you are committed to the tune of over fifty million dollars --
L450913 +++$+++ u7133 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Do it.
L450912 +++$+++ u7141 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ STUCKEY +++$+++ But, Edward...
L450911 +++$+++ u7133 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now.
L450910 +++$+++ u7141 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ STUCKEY +++$+++ We're letting them slide?
L450909 +++$+++ u7133 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Put the pension funds on hold until I say otherwise.
L450908 +++$+++ u7141 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ STUCKEY +++$+++ Our contract guys are working on the Kross pension funds. There's another forty million there.  We can bleed'm dry.
L450907 +++$+++ u7133 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.
L450906 +++$+++ u7141 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ STUCKEY +++$+++ Goddamit!  Where is he getting the money to fight?
L450749 +++$+++ u7133 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ No one you know.
L450748 +++$+++ u7141 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ STUCKEY +++$+++ Eight o'clock.  Kross is bringing his son.  Very bright kid, watch yourself with him.  Who's this girl you're taking?
L450747 +++$+++ u7133 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ What time's diner tonight?
L450742 +++$+++ u7133 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ We don't have the time to bring someone new up to speed. Besides...  You've already impressed everyone you need to, haven't you?
L450741 +++$+++ u7141 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ STUCKEY +++$+++ What!?
L450653 +++$+++ u7141 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ STUCKEY +++$+++ I know a lot of nice girls.

L450651 +++$+++ u7141 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ STUCKEY +++$+++ Edward, did you hear me?
L450609 +++$+++ u7133 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I'll bring it back.
L450608 +++$+++ u7141 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ STUCKEY +++$+++ Oh, god, what?
L450607 +++$+++ u7133 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Bill, we're businessmen, not the damn mafia.  I'll see you in the office.  By the way, about your car...
L450606 +++$+++ u7141 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ STUCKEY +++$+++ You shouldn't go alone.  He might claim that you tried to black mail him.
L450605 +++$+++ u7133 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I'll see him alone.  Everyone knows you're my muscle.  We'll make it social.  Tell Kross I'll meet him for dinner.  Tonight if you can arrange it.
L450604 +++$+++ u7141 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ STUCKEY +++$+++ Edward, if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the Wall Street Journal.
L450603 +++$+++ u7133 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ I want to.
L450420 +++$+++ u7141 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ STUCKEY +++$+++ Yes!  And you don't even know where you're going!
L450419 +++$+++ u7133 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Love this car!  Is it new?
L450415 +++$+++ u7133 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ No.
L450414 +++$+++ u7141 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ STUCKEY +++$+++ Cynthia's not coming?
L450413 +++$+++ u7133 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Really?  Some high class gold digger who speaks French better than I do?  No, thank you.  I just got off the phone with one.
L450412 +++$+++ u7141 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ STUCKEY +++$+++ Listen, there're some major local talent inside just dying to meet you...
L450411 +++$+++ u7133 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Apologize to Elizabeth for me.
L450410 +++$+++ u7141 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ STUCKEY +++$+++ At least stay for a drink.  This party's for you.
L450409 +++$+++ u7133 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Give me your car keys, will you, I'm going back to my hotel.
L450408 +++$+++ u7141 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ STUCKEY +++$+++ What's up, where you going?

L451291 +++$+++ u7135 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy.

L451182 +++$+++ u7142 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ VIVIAN +++$+++ All I'm doing is feeling lousy about it.  I don't know what to do.  What do I do, Kit?
L451181 +++$+++ u7135 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ I pray for that.

Give me two hundred to the scum bucket and the other hundred to that asshole landlord for part of the rent.  Spend it on drugs and I'll pull your hair out.
L450687 +++$+++ u7135 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ KIT +++$+++ I'm sorry, Viv'.  Carlos has been on my back.  Did you get the money up front like I taught ya'?
L450686 +++$+++ u7142 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ VIVIAN +++$+++ He... he just does.

L451266 +++$+++ u7142 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ VIVIAN +++$+++ Come on, Barney, you and me live in the real world.  You don't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, Mr. Thomas.
L451265 +++$+++ u7139 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ You're not accompanying him to New York?
L451264 +++$+++ u7142 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ VIVIAN +++$+++ Yeah, well, I check out today.
L451263 +++$+++ u7139 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.
L451262 +++$+++ u7142 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ VIVIAN +++$+++ Look I just wanted to say goodbye.
L451261 +++$+++ u7139 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ Miss Vivian.
L451260 +++$+++ u7142 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ VIVIAN +++$+++ Hi, Barney!
L451159 +++$+++ u7139 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ I'd send them up, but sadly, I don't trust the young lady to find you on her own.
L451158 +++$+++ u7142 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ VIVIAN +++$+++ Me?
L451157 +++$+++ u7139 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ Barnard Thomas here.  Miss Vivian, I wonder if you might come down to the front desk.  There's someone here to see you.
L450821 +++$+++ u7142 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ VIVIAN +++$+++ Professionally?
L450820 +++$+++ u7139 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ Miss Vivian... there's a salon here in the hotel.  Instead of worrying unnecessarily about table manners, why don't you just have your hair done instead?
L450819 +++$+++ u7142 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ VIVIAN +++$+++ Maybe I'll just order a burger, Barney, that way I can eat with my hands.
L450818 +++$+++ u7139 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ Miss Vivian --
L450817 +++$+++ u7142 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ VIVIAN +++$+++ Steak spoon!

L450815 +++$+++ u7142 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ VIVIAN +++$+++ I like steak.
L450814 +++$+++ u7139 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ Then you use your <u>soup spoon</u>.
L450813 +++$+++ u7142 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ VIVIAN +++$+++ But what if they serve soup?
L450812 +++$+++ u7139 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ They will serve salad.
L450811 +++$+++ u7142 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ VIVIAN +++$+++ What if they serve soup?
L450810 +++$+++ u7139 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ Actually, some of the richest people I know have the worst manners.  Of course, Mr. Harris, being of old money, knows his way around a table.  All right now, pay attention please.  Salad fork.
L450809 +++$+++ u7142 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ VIVIAN +++$+++ Hmmm... I vonder vich. 
L450808 +++$+++ u7139 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ Either you're European or badly brought up.
L450807 +++$+++ u7142 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ VIVIAN +++$+++ But I always eat like this.
L450806 +++$+++ u7139 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ In fifteen minutes I can teach you everything you need to know to dine with the Queen.  First, as you pick up the knife you shift your fork to the left hand.
L450803 +++$+++ u7142 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ VIVIAN +++$+++ Okay.  Thanks, Barney.  You're the best.
L450802 +++$+++ u7139 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ You'll like it fine.
L450801 +++$+++ u7142 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ VIVIAN +++$+++ Will I like it?
L450800 +++$+++ u7139 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ I think you'll find it normal enough.
L450799 +++$+++ u7142 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ VIVIAN +++$+++ Yeah, mine too.  Is it like, y'know, normal?
L450798 +++$+++ u7139 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ It's a bit beyond my... range, shall we say.
L450797 +++$+++ u7142 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ VIVIAN +++$+++ Edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner.  The Rex.  Ever been there?
L450796 +++$+++ u7139 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ What is it, Miss Vivian?
L450764 +++$+++ u7142 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ VIVIAN +++$+++ They were real nice to me there. They treated me, y'know... nice. Thanks, Barney.
L450763 +++$+++ u7139 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ That's all right.  I'm sure they're quite lovely.
L450762 +++$+++ u7142 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ VIVIAN +++$+++ I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too.  Wanna see?
L450761 +++$+++ u7139 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ I rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
L450760 +++$+++ u7142 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ VIVIAN +++$+++ I got a dress.
L450723 +++$+++ u7139 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ Of course.  Naturally when Mr. Harris leaves, I won't see you in this hotel again.
L450722 +++$+++ u7142 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ VIVIAN +++$+++ Niece?
L450721 +++$+++ u7139 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ Miss Vivian... things that go on in other hotels don't happen at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
