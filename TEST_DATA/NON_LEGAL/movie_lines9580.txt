L67659 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Why the hell not?
L67658 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I'm not afraid of her.
L67655 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ I feel fine!
L67654 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ You feeling better?
L67653 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Say what?
L67652 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ You don't like punk rockers?
L67651 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ What in the hell for?  You think I'm gettin' any at my age?  I don't like blue-haired women.  I don't like 'em.
L67650 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ You oughta use a rubber, pop.  You really should.
L67649 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ I don't give a... flyin'... chili- bean... fart about AIDS!
L67648 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I'm not gonna get AIDS, pop --don't worry about it.  I always use a rubber.
L67647 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ You... fucked her!  Goddamn dumb sonofabitch... You fucked her! Goddamn, you are one dumb sonofabitch --
L67646 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I wasn't there last night, either.
L67645 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ I went over last night, too.
L67644 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Easy there, partner -- I wasn't there.
L67606 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I know what that's like.
L67605 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Everybody that she plays with dies.
L67604 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ She want to play?  Fine.  I can play.
L67603 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Forgive me for askin', son, and I don't mean to belabor the obvious, but why is it that you've got your head so far up your own ass?
L67516 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Well, hell, son, it's got a certain ring to it, I'll say that.
L67515 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I don't think it's funny.
L67487 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ I don't son, but I got the minority opinion.
L67486 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ You think I --
L67469 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Somethin', though.
L67468 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I don't know.
L67467 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ What is it you got between you?
L67466 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ She knows where I live and breathe. She's coming after me.
L67465 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ You sure got real conclusive ways of demonstrating that.
L67464 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I got tired of being played with.
L67463 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ No, sir.  You won't.  There's smoke off yonder on the horizon.  They're gonna want your badge.
L67462 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Nothin'  I'll be okay, pop.
L67461 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ What's goin' down, son?
L67408 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Hell yes!  Couldn't get it outta my head for years.  Still can't. Nice little kids -- nice husband, wasn't porkin' around -- no financial problems.  One day -- outta the clear blue sky -- she does 'em.  All of 'em.  Used a knife. He got for a wedding present. Didn't even deny it.  Sweet as honey.  Said she didn't know why she done it.
L67407 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Do you remember a case -- 1956 -- Hazel Dobkins?
L67406 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ No, sir.  They never even got a statement from her.
L67405 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Was she ever suspect?
L67404 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ I came in here to jack off the damn machine.  One dead psychology professor. Noah Goldstein.  Dr. Noah Goldstein. And guess what?  He was her counselor.
L67403 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What are you doing here, Pop?
L67402 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Ain't you go nothin' better to do than to come in here and jack off the damn machine?
L67333 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ It's my first drink in three months. That okay with you, pop?  She doesn't know me.  I never saw her before Gus and I talked to her.
L67332 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ What you doin', son?
L67164 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Hallelujah.
L67163 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ She misses me.
L67162 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ How'd it go, son?
L67096 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ I'm a smart sonofabitch.  I just hide it.
L67095 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
L67094 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Ain't that cute?  They got his and her Pig-assos, son.
L67086 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ They're executives.  They're nervous about everything.
L67085 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Talcott doesn't usually show up at the office 'till after his 18 holes. What are they nervous about?
L67060 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Not now he don't.
L67059 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Before your time, pop.  Mid-sixties.  Five or six hits. He's got a club down in the Fillmore now.
L67058 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ I never heard of him.
L67057 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Rock and roll, Gus.  Johnny Boz.
L67056 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Who was this fuckin' guy?
L67400 +++$+++ u3883 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ LT. WALKER +++$+++ Go stick your head in a tub of ice water.  See where she leads.
L67399 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ You're already gettin' psychological input, son.
L67393 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ He looks a little shrunk, that's all.
L67392 +++$+++ u3883 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ LT. WALKER +++$+++ You look like dogshit.
L67372 +++$+++ u3883 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ LT. WALKER +++$+++ Yeah.  I know.
L67371 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ He ain't that way.  He's got heart.
L67370 +++$+++ u3883 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ LT. WALKER +++$+++ Sometimes I think he started banging her just to get himself off the hook with Internal Affairs.
L67369 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Maybe it's for old-time's sake.
L67347 +++$+++ u3883 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ LT. WALKER +++$+++ Maybe she did, Gus.  Maybe she grew herself an Afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face.  Let's polygraph her again and ask her about it.
L67346 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Not unless she got up in the ring and turned into one mean sonofabitch.
L67068 +++$+++ u3883 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ LT. WALKER +++$+++ She's 54 years old and weighs 240 pounds.
L67067 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Maybe the maid did it.
L67744 +++$+++ u3886 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ THE WOMAN +++$+++ She said she didn't know herself, just sort of did it on impulse.  The razor just happened to be there.
L67743 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ What was the motive?
L67106 +++$+++ u3886 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ THE WOMAN +++$+++ You're looking for Catherine, not me.
L67105 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Were you with him last night?
L67102 +++$+++ u3886 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ THE WOMAN +++$+++ Is he dead?
L67101 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ When was the last time you saw John Boz?
L67100 +++$+++ u3886 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ THE WOMAN +++$+++ What do you want?
L67099 +++$+++ u3882 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ GUS +++$+++ Homicide.
L67679 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Yeah.  But you didn't tell me to stay away from her car.
L67678 +++$+++ u3883 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ LT. WALKER +++$+++ I told you to stay away from Tramell.
L67677 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Gus and I talked to her at Tramell's house.  All we did was write her name down.
L67676 +++$+++ u3883 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ LT. WALKER +++$+++ You knew her, didn't you?
L67674 +++$+++ u3883 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ LT. WALKER +++$+++ Don't fuck with me, Nick.  I don't need a reason to put your ass in a sling.
L67673 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I don't think she meant to go off the hill, do you?
L67672 +++$+++ u3883 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ LT. WALKER +++$+++ You're driving around North Beach for no particular reason and this car won't get out of the way --
L67671 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ It was an accident.
L67670 +++$+++ u3883 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ LT. WALKER +++$+++ Tell me again.  I want to hear you say it again.
L67541 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ You don't but it, do you?  She knew nobody would but it.  She knew I'd say she did it.  And she knew nobody would buy it.
L67540 +++$+++ u3883 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ LT. WALKER +++$+++ First you've got her buying your file.  Now you've got her killing Nilsen.  Forget her, willya?  Go someplace.  Sit in the sun.  Get away from this goddamn fog.  Get her out of your system.
L67539 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Catherine Tramell.  It's part of her game.
L67538 +++$+++ u3883 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ LT. WALKER +++$+++ Beth?  Now you've got Beth killing people?
L67537 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ She killed him.
L67536 +++$+++ u3883 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ LT. WALKER +++$+++ I.A.'s going to talk to you more about Nilsen.  They're handling the investigation, we're not. Stay in touch with Dr. Gardner, it'll help on the evaluation.
L67509 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ No.
L67508 +++$+++ u3883 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ LT. WALKER +++$+++ I'll ask you once, Nick -- for the record did you kill him?
L67398 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What about me?
L67397 +++$+++ u3883 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ LT. WALKER +++$+++ Gus -- go over to Berkeley. Harrigan -- find out what else she's published.  Andrews -- get the files on her parents' accident. Carbon Beth on everything.  I want some psychological input on this Andrews and Harrigan go; Nick is left there with Gus.
L67349 +++$+++ u3883 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ LT. WALKER +++$+++ Fuck you, too Nick.
L67348 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Fuck you, Phil.
L67345 +++$+++ u3883 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ LT. WALKER +++$+++ How you're saying she killed her parents?  Did she kill Bobby Vasquez, too?
L67344 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ How did they die?  Was there an investigation?
L67343 +++$+++ u3883 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ LT. WALKER +++$+++ Her parents died in an accident. I don't care what else she's written.  What are you -- a book critic?
L67342 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Come on, Phil.  You're not gonna let this slide.  What about her parents?  What about what else she's published?  At least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing real-life coincidence.
L67341 +++$+++ u3883 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ LT. WALKER +++$+++ How the fuck do you know?  What is it with you and this broad anyway?
L67340 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ She knew she could beat it.  That's why she asked to take it.
L67339 +++$+++ u3883 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ LT. WALKER +++$+++ What now what? Now nothing.  She passed the polygraph.  That's it.
L67338 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Now what?
L67337 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I'm sure.
L67336 +++$+++ u3883 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ LT. WALKER +++$+++ You sure?
L67329 +++$+++ u3883 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ LT. WALKER +++$+++ And you volunteered.
L67328 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ She didn't ask me for the ride. She asked anybody.
L67327 +++$+++ u3883 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ LT. WALKER +++$+++ What is all this "Nick" stuff -- Nick would you like a cigarette. Nick can you give me a ride.
L67196 +++$+++ u3883 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ LT. WALKER +++$+++ We bring her in for questioning.
L67195 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ So what do we do -- nothing?
L67178 +++$+++ u3883 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ LT. WALKER +++$+++ You forgot her degree in literature. She's a writer.  She published a novel last year under a pen name. Do you want to know what it's about?
L67177 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ I love it.  She's got a hundred million bucks.  She fucks fighters and rock and roll stars.  And she's got a degree in screwing with peoples' heads.
L67174 +++$+++ u3883 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ LT. WALKER +++$+++ Formerly engaged to Roberto Vasquez, deceased --
L67173 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Are you kidding me?
L67090 +++$+++ u3883 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ LT. WALKER +++$+++ I said keep it.
L67089 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Do you want me to work the case, Phil, or do you want me to --
L67088 +++$+++ u3883 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ LT. WALKER +++$+++ Keep your three o'clock.
L67072 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ What was it?
L67071 +++$+++ u3883 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ LT. WALKER +++$+++ He left the club with his girlfriend about midnight.  That's the last time anybody saw him.
L67265 +++$+++ u3883 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ LT. WALKER +++$+++ Maybe that's what you're counting on to get you off the hook.
L67264 +++$+++ u3885 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ TALCOTT +++$+++ We know you're not stupid, Ms. Tramell.
L67199 +++$+++ u3885 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ TALCOTT +++$+++ It's yours.
L67198 +++$+++ u3883 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ LT. WALKER +++$+++ She was the last person seen with the guy -- I'll take the responsibility.
L67197 +++$+++ u3885 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ TALCOTT +++$+++ She's got enough money to burn this whole department down.
L67172 +++$+++ u3883 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ LT. WALKER +++$+++ Catherine Tramell.  Age 30.  No priors, no convictions.  Double major, magnum cum laude, Berkeley, 1980.  Literature and Psychology. Daughter, sole survivor -- Marvin and Elaine Tramell, killed in a boating accident, 1978, Catherine Tramell sole heir.  Estimated assets $110 million.
L67171 +++$+++ u3885 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ TALCOTT +++$+++ On what basis?
L67170 +++$+++ u3883 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ LT. WALKER +++$+++ She's a suspect.
L67858 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ He was shot.
L67857 +++$+++ u3886 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ THE WOMAN +++$+++ He died -- about five or six years ago.
L67758 +++$+++ u3886 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ THE WOMAN +++$+++ Only if you're making it.
L67757 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Can there be some mistake?
L67756 +++$+++ u3886 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ THE WOMAN +++$+++ No Lisa Anderson, detective.
L67755 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Can you check again?
L67754 +++$+++ u3886 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ THE WOMAN +++$+++ Yes I did.
L67753 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Did you check all four years?
L67752 +++$+++ u3886 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ THE WOMAN +++$+++ Anderson.  Jack W. Donald M.  I'm sorry.  No Lisa.
L67742 +++$+++ u3886 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ THE WOMAN +++$+++ Fourteen.  We seal juvenile records until they're deceased.  That's why you didn't find it in your computer.
L67741 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ How old was she when this happened?
L67108 +++$+++ u3886 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ THE WOMAN +++$+++ I'm Roxy.  I'm her -- friend.
L67107 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Who are you?
L67104 +++$+++ u3886 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ THE WOMAN +++$+++ You wouldn't be here otherwise, would you?
L67103 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ Why do you think he's dead?
L67098 +++$+++ u3886 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ THE WOMAN +++$+++ Are you vice?
L67097 +++$+++ u3884 +++$+++ m257 +++$+++ NICK +++$+++ We're sorry to disturb you, we'd like to ask you some --
L68638 +++$+++ u3887 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ ALBERT MILO +++$+++ As long as I've known Andy, he's never asked me for anything except to speak to you about getting off drugs. He's painted my picture, we've eaten dinner in God knows how many places together. But he doesn't care about me. He cares about you. You're the only person he cares about. He's your friend. Fuck that article. You want a toasted bagel with cream cheese?
L68637 +++$+++ u3891 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ BASQUIAT +++$+++ I haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out.
L68636 +++$+++ u3887 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ ALBERT MILO +++$+++ You're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. I read that. The person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. That's your enemy, not your audience. Your audience hasn't even been born yet. It's a lie that art is popular. The only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. I'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. There're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and Andy's one of them.
L68635 +++$+++ u3891 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ BASQUIAT +++$+++ What about the shit they write?
L68634 +++$+++ u3887 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ ALBERT MILO +++$+++ No. It's one of the few times I feel good. I used to have to go to work and cook every day. That I got sick of.
L68633 +++$+++ u3891 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ BASQUIAT +++$+++ The whole thing – painting.
L68632 +++$+++ u3887 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ ALBERT MILO +++$+++ Of what?
L68631 +++$+++ u3891 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ BASQUIAT +++$+++ Do you ever get sick of it?
L68630 +++$+++ u3887 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ ALBERT MILO +++$+++ This is painted on a backdrop from the Kabuki theater in Japan. I painted it after Joseph Beuys died. A rebirth painting. I felt like he could've painted it, or maybe someone else was painting it instead of me. The Chinese calligraphers used to change their name mid-career so they could start over as someone else..
L68626 +++$+++ u3891 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ BASQUIAT +++$+++ See ya in an hour.  So what do you think?
L68625 +++$+++ u3887 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ ALBERT MILO +++$+++ Let's get out of here.
L68624 +++$+++ u3891 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ BASQUIAT +++$+++ Naa..
L68515 +++$+++ u3887 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ ALBERT MILO +++$+++ No, I wanted to make a painting of you.
L68514 +++$+++ u3891 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ BASQUIAT +++$+++ Why, so you could humiliate me?
L68513 +++$+++ u3887 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ ALBERT MILO +++$+++ You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
L68512 +++$+++ u3891 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ BASQUIAT +++$+++ It's always how you would do it. This is my version.
L68511 +++$+++ u3887 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ ALBERT MILO +++$+++ I like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. But the black one's filled up with too many heads...  I'd take some of them out.  I think you're painting too fast. I wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it breathe a bit.
L68510 +++$+++ u3891 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ BASQUIAT +++$+++ What do you think?
L68266 +++$+++ u3887 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ ALBERT MILO +++$+++ I haven't decided yet.  Rene, you wanna come over to the studio tomorrow. I wanna make a painting of you.
L68265 +++$+++ u3891 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ BASQUIAT +++$+++ Not sure. How was yours?
L68264 +++$+++ u3887 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ ALBERT MILO +++$+++ When's your show?
L68263 +++$+++ u3891 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ BASQUIAT +++$+++ I don't know.
L68262 +++$+++ u3887 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ ALBERT MILO +++$+++ Is this finished yet?
L68261 +++$+++ u3887 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ ALBERT MILO +++$+++ Rene's been telling me about your work.
L68260 +++$+++ u3891 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ BASQUIAT +++$+++ Hey – it's the big A.M..
L68053 +++$+++ u3887 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ ALBERT MILO +++$+++ Really. Huh. Too bad.
L68052 +++$+++ u3891 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ BASQUIAT +++$+++ I'm a painter, too.
L68051 +++$+++ u3887 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ ALBERT MILO +++$+++ No. Should I have?
L68050 +++$+++ u3891 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ BASQUIAT +++$+++ My name is Jean Michel Basquiat. Have you heard of me?
L68390 +++$+++ u3888 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ ANDY WARHOL +++$+++ Oh, I didn't know that.
L68389 +++$+++ u3902 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ JACK MILO +++$+++ It's in New York.
L68388 +++$+++ u3888 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ ANDY WARHOL +++$+++ I think it's in New Jersey.

L68385 +++$+++ u3902 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ JACK MILO +++$+++ Saddle River, New York!
L68384 +++$+++ u3888 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ ANDY WARHOL +++$+++ Saddle River's in New Jersey.
L68383 +++$+++ u3902 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ JACK MILO +++$+++ Nixon lives in Saddle River, New York.
L68538 +++$+++ u3888 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ ANDY WARHOL +++$+++ That would be a pity because you're a real painter.
L68537 +++$+++ u3891 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ BASQUIAT +++$+++ After the show we should take a nice long vacation. Maybe go to Hawaii. That's what I'm gonna do. I'm going to give up painting and start playing music again. I wanna sing.
L68532 +++$+++ u3891 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ BASQUIAT +++$+++ When I was poor, everybody doubted I could make it. When I got rich, everyone said, `yeah, but he'll never keep it up.' Now everyone says `he's killing himself.' So I clean up, and then they say `Look. His art's dead.' I don't take drugs, anyway. I'm healthy now.
L68531 +++$+++ u3888 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ ANDY WARHOL +++$+++ Bruno called. In Europe, people are saying you're gonna die from drugs. They think they can cash in on your death.
L68530 +++$+++ u3891 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ BASQUIAT +++$+++ People are only interested in you because you're famous, not because they know a fuckin' thing about your work.
L68529 +++$+++ u3888 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ ANDY WARHOL +++$+++ Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you.
L68528 +++$+++ u3891 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ BASQUIAT +++$+++ I don't even have any friends anymore besides you. And everyone says "Warhol? That death-warmed over person on drugs? He's just using you."
L68526 +++$+++ u3891 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ BASQUIAT +++$+++ We can do better. It needed more white.
L68525 +++$+++ u3888 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ ANDY WARHOL +++$+++ That was my favorite part!
L68523 +++$+++ u3888 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ ANDY WARHOL +++$+++ I don't like beer.
L68522 +++$+++ u3891 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ BASQUIAT +++$+++ How come you're not peeing on them yourself?
L68521 +++$+++ u3888 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ ANDY WARHOL +++$+++ I wanted to make a few more of these. Frank's been drinking this Mexican beer. It makes a good green.
L68520 +++$+++ u3891 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ BASQUIAT +++$+++ Piss painting?
L68519 +++$+++ u3891 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ BASQUIAT +++$+++ You think those are good presents? Who wants an old wig?
L68518 +++$+++ u3888 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ ANDY WARHOL +++$+++ I'm going to send them to my friends for Christmas presents.
L68517 +++$+++ u3891 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ BASQUIAT +++$+++ What's with the wigs?
L68477 +++$+++ u3888 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ ANDY WARHOL +++$+++ Well, have you asked her to come back?
L68476 +++$+++ u3891 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ BASQUIAT +++$+++ Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her.
L68475 +++$+++ u3888 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ ANDY WARHOL +++$+++ Do you still love her?
L68474 +++$+++ u3891 +++$+++ m258 +++$+++ BASQUIAT +++$+++ That girl looks just like my old girlfriend Gina.
