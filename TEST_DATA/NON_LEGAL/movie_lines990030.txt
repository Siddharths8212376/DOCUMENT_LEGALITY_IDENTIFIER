L305475 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Forget the crucifix. Take him.
L305474 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ The crucifix -
L305473 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Take him.
L305470 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I want a woman.
L305469 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Come, you're going to feed now.
L305467 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Dying?
L305466 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ You're body's dying. Pay no attention. It will take twenty minutes at most.
L305464 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Sure...
L305463 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ You're sure?
L305458 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Yes...
L305457 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Did I hear a yes?
L305453 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ You asked for death. I didn't promise it -
L305452 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -
L305451 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ You really want to be with them?
L305450 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Because you're as strong as I was when I was alive.
L305449 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ But why do you want me?
L305448 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
L305447 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I can't go through with it, I tell you.
L305446 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?
L305445 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You're the devil, aren't you? That's who you are.
L305444 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Don't worry. He was white trash, they come at two a penny. I dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave, licked his wounds clean.
L305443 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Kill me if you will, but I can't do this...
L305442 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ You've just done it -
L305441 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I can't do it.
L305440 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Let's call that a start.
L305437 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Call him.
L305436 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ How do you mean, start?
L305435 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ You let your overseer run riot, work your slaves to the bone. We'll start with him.
L305430 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I want it!
L305429 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ Vampires. We thrive on blood.
L305428 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Give it to me!!!
L305427 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ You have to ask me for this. You have to want it, do you hear me?
L305426 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ NO!!!!!
L305425 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ They are gone, Louis. Death took them. Death which you can now destroy...
L305424 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Diane!!!!
L305419 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ I've come to answer your prayers. You want to die, don't you? Life has no meaning anymore, does it?
L305418 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ What do you want from me?
L305415 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Why should I be?
L305414 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ You're not afraid of anything, are you?
L305413 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it?
L305412 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house?
L305405 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Yes...
L305404 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ You want death? Is it death you want?
L305403 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Then my luck would have changed.
L305402 +++$+++ u6012 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LESTAT +++$+++ They would have killed you -
L306161 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Don't say anymore. The reels are still turning. I have but one chance to show you the meaning of what I've said.
L306160 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ No...
L306159 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Dear God. I've failed again, haven't I?
L306157 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ If I could see what you've seen, feel what you've felt I wouldn't let it end like this! You need a like to the world out there, a connection... then it won't end like this...
L306156 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Is this what you want? You ask me for this after all I've told you?
L306153 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ You need a new passion, Louis, a new reason to feel... what a story you've told, you don't understand yourself.
L306152 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ It's over, I'm telling you...
L306151 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ But you talk about passion, about longing, about things I'll never know in my life! It's still inside you, in every syllable you speak! And then you tell me it ends like that? Just empty?
L306150 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ But it has. There is no more to tell.
L306149 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ No... it can't end like that...
L306124 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ He hadn't even been there. And all those years I thought he was dead.
L306123 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ Lestat escaped the fire!
L305858 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Fictions, my friend. The vulgar fictions of a demented Irishman... So we repaired to Paris...
L305857 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ No vampires in Transylvania? No Count Dracula?
L305856 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Peasant rumours, superstitions about garlic, crosses, stakes in the hear, all that - how do you say again? Bull shit. But one of our kind? Not a whisper.
L305855 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ You found nothing?
L305847 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ He was dead to us. We were free. That was all that mattered.
L305846 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ Did he die in the fire?
L305752 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Where would she have gone? She was a child, and beautiful, heartbreaking merciless child. And I had made her that...
L305751 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ And did you lose her? Did she go?
L305750 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ How could I not? She had to know.
L305749 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ But why did you tell her?
L305672 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Perhaps. He knew me. He knew I would love her more than the waking world. But there was more to it than that. Perhaps in the end he did it -- to show me that he could. For he lavished affection on her, there was no doubt about that. Life was very different with madame Claudia, as you can imagine...
L305671 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ He did it to make you stay with him!
L305670 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Shall we go on?
L305582 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I was human then. Might as well ask can an angel feel love. Both are blesses or cursed with a certain... detachment. Though whether angels take as long to learn it as I, I will never know.
L305581 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ You loved your wife, surely.
L305580 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Can a vampire feel love?
L305579 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ You loved Yvette...
L305489 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Coffins... coffins unfortunately are a necessity...
L305488 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ What about coffins?
L305487 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.
L305486 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ The story about stakes through the heart?
L305485 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Nonsense, my friend. I can look on anything I like. And I am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes.
L305484 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ You can't look at them...
L305483 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Oh, that rumour about crosses?
L305482 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ You said the slave had a crucifix...
L305391 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ But times were different then. I was a man at that age. The master of a large plantation just south of New Orleans...
L305390 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ Yes.
L305389 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Why should I lie? 1791 was the year it happened. I was twenty-four - younger than you are now.
L305388 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ You're not lying to me, are you?
L305387 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ What can I do to put you at ease? Shall we begin like David Copperfield? I am born, I grow up. Or shall we begin when I was born to darkness, as I call it. That's really where we should start, don't you think?
L305386 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ The same way you do it. A series of simple gestures. Only I moved too fast for you to see. I'm flesh and blood, you see. But not human. I haven't been human for two hundred years.
L305385 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ How did you do that?
L305381 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ We love it. I only wanted to prepare you.
L305380 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ But I thought vampires didn't like the light.
L305379 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.
L305378 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ You believe this, don't you? That you're a vampire? You really think...
L305377 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Yes but you needn't worry about that now. Things change.
L305376 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ You were going to kill me? Drink my blood?
L305374 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Perhaps lucky for both of us.
L305373 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ Well, what a lucky break for me.
L305372 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Absolutely. I was watching you watching me. I was waiting for you in that alleyway. And then you began to speak.
L305371 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ See? I knew you were interesting. You mean this literally, I take it?
L305370 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I'm a vampire.
L305369 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ So shall we begin?  What do yo do?
L305368 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ It's just a room...
L305367 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ Saw you in the street outside. You seemed interesting. Is this where you live?
L305366 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You followed me here, didn't you?
L305365 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ So much the better. I've got a pocket full of tapes.
L305364 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You'd have to have a lot of tape for my story. I've had a very unusual life.
L305363 +++$+++ u6015 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MALLOY +++$+++ That's what I do. I interview people. I collect lives. F.M. radio. F.F.R.C. I just interviewed a genuine hero, a cop who -
L305362 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ So you want me to tell you the story of my life...
L306059 +++$+++ u6014 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Yes!
L306058 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Look at the gaslight. Don't tke your eyes off it. You will be drained to the point of death, but you must stay alive. Do you hear me?
L306057 +++$+++ u6014 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ My daughter...
L306056 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ And the child who did die?
L306055 +++$+++ u6014 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ A child who can't die...
L306054 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?
L306053 +++$+++ u6014 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Yes.
L306052 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ And you know what you ask for?
L306051 +++$+++ u6014 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Yes...
L306050 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You promise to care for her then?
L306040 +++$+++ u6014 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Au contraire, monsieur, I have.
L306039 +++$+++ u6013 +++$+++ m399 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ You haven't the vaguest conception under God of what you ask!
L308511 +++$+++ u6016 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ BROOKS +++$+++ I'd call this four spoiled city kids who wouldn't know a hurricane if it blew up their butts.  All we can do now is batten down and ride it out. If things get really bad, there's a storm shelter.
L308510 +++$+++ u6020 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ KARLA +++$+++ What the hell would you call this?
L308509 +++$+++ u6016 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ BROOKS +++$+++ Sorry. Emergencies only.
L308508 +++$+++ u6020 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ KARLA +++$+++ What about a radio?
L308507 +++$+++ u6016 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ BROOKS +++$+++ Duh. The next couple of days is gonna be rough, but we'll make it.
L308347 +++$+++ u6016 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ BROOKS +++$+++ July fourth weekend. Storm season starts today. The clouds roll in like clockwork.
L308346 +++$+++ u6020 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ KARLA +++$+++ Wait...Did you say off-season?
L308345 +++$+++ u6016 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ BROOKS +++$+++ And, while you're here, our marginally trained, off-season staff of five will attend to your every need.
L308344 +++$+++ u6020 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ KARLA +++$+++ Julie, we're talkin' suites!  That'll be just fine with us.
L308340 +++$+++ u6016 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ BROOKS +++$+++ Not at all. Those are our honeymoon suites.
L308339 +++$+++ u6020 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ KARLA +++$+++ Is that bad?
L308338 +++$+++ u6016 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ BROOKS +++$+++ You're in 201 and 202.
L308327 +++$+++ u6020 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ KARLA +++$+++ Checking in...Karla Wilson.
L308326 +++$+++ u6016 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ BROOKS +++$+++ What can I do for you?
L308505 +++$+++ u6016 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ BROOKS +++$+++ Phones went down a few minutes ago.
L308504 +++$+++ u6019 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Then I'll call the mainland for a charter.
L308501 +++$+++ u6016 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ BROOKS +++$+++ Not possible, I'm afraid. The last ferry left hours ago. And we got a storm coming. There won't be another one for days.
L308500 +++$+++ u6019 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I want off this island.
L308489 +++$+++ u6016 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ BROOKS +++$+++ Who? Who is here?
L308488 +++$+++ u6019 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Listen to me. He's here.
L308349 +++$+++ u6016 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ BROOKS +++$+++ It's our version of winter.  201 and 202. There's Scrabble and Parcheesi in the lobby. Enjoy.
L308348 +++$+++ u6019 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Storm season?
L308343 +++$+++ u6019 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ We haven't exchanged anything.
L308342 +++$+++ u6016 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ BROOKS +++$+++ Honeymoon suites. I take it you kids haven't exchanged vows, yet?
L308341 +++$+++ u6019 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Your what?
L308334 +++$+++ u6016 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ BROOKS +++$+++ Built in 1948 for a member of the Rockefeller clan. The tile work was imported from Spain. A lot of history in these walls...Judy Garland stayed here...Hemmingway fished for marlin right off that dock --
L308333 +++$+++ u6019 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ It sure is a beautiful old hotel.
L308262 +++$+++ u6017 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ The guy looks dead.
L308261 +++$+++ u6024 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ No.
L308260 +++$+++ u6017 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ I don't know, man. Maybe we should keep going, find a phone --
L308258 +++$+++ u6017 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ No way, man. Surprise her. She'll be psyched.
L308257 +++$+++ u6024 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ I should go up there. I should call her back, tell her I'm coming.
L308256 +++$+++ u6017 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Jeez, Ray, fourth and forty, throw the bomb.
L308254 +++$+++ u6017 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Stupid. What were you thinkng?
L308253 +++$+++ u6024 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Stupid. Stupid.
L308243 +++$+++ u6017 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ DAVE +++$+++ Idiot. Idiot. Idiot.
L308242 +++$+++ u6024 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ You'll go away with you're college friends, but you won't go away with me?
L308453 +++$+++ u6025 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ TITUS +++$+++ Up-tighteous and self-righteous.
L308452 +++$+++ u6018 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ DERRICK +++$+++ I got work to do. Take the bake elsewhere.
L308451 +++$+++ u6025 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ TITUS +++$+++ Storm is what makes it interesting. Thass why all the fish are up. Less hook us a couple big ones.
L308450 +++$+++ u6018 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ DERRICK +++$+++ There's a storm comin', Titus. No boats are going out.
L308449 +++$+++ u6025 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ TITUS +++$+++ That's why you'll come with Titus, mon.
L308448 +++$+++ u6018 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ DERRICK +++$+++ Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain.
L308447 +++$+++ u6025 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ TITUS +++$+++ Fish are all over the water...Come on, let us take a boat out.
L308446 +++$+++ u6018 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ DERRICK +++$+++ Get lost, you scared me.
L308758 +++$+++ u6020 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ KARLA +++$+++ Is he?
L308757 +++$+++ u6019 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ You're okay. Thank god.
L308756 +++$+++ u6020 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ KARLA +++$+++ Oh, god, it's you --
L308713 +++$+++ u6020 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ KARLA +++$+++ ...Nancy?
L308712 +++$+++ u6019 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ No, you're not.
L308711 +++$+++ u6020 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ KARLA +++$+++ I'm holding your hand!
L308708 +++$+++ u6019 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I'm right here. Grab my hand.
L308707 +++$+++ u6020 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ KARLA +++$+++ Julie?
L308705 +++$+++ u6019 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Come on, you can make it.
L308704 +++$+++ u6020 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ KARLA +++$+++ I don't know...
L308682 +++$+++ u6020 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ KARLA +++$+++ What do we do?
L308681 +++$+++ u6019 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ There's no way to lock it.
L308657 +++$+++ u6020 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ KARLA +++$+++ It's too late for that.
L308656 +++$+++ u6019 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn't want to involve anybody else.
L308655 +++$+++ u6020 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ KARLA +++$+++ I'm your best friend...You could have told me the truth about what happened. I would've understood.
L308643 +++$+++ u6019 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ Then, we fight --
L308642 +++$+++ u6020 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ KARLA +++$+++ Julie, the boats are gone, the phones are down. There's no way off this place.
L308638 +++$+++ u6019 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ JULIE +++$+++ I've got to see.
L308637 +++$+++ u6020 +++$+++ m400 +++$+++ KARLA +++$+++ Be careful, Julie.
