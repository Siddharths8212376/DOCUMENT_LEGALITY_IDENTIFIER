L151461 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I think we should do something with strong female characters...
L151460 +++$+++ u4736 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MR. GRANT +++$+++ Yes, that's what we're looking for.
L151459 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I can't read any more crap. These women are all victims.
L151440 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ A little.
L151439 +++$+++ u4736 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MR. GRANT +++$+++ Did you change your hair?
L151438 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ How about a "Man in Jeopardy" story?
L151219 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Your desk.
L151218 +++$+++ u4736 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MR. GRANT +++$+++ Coffee and...
L151217 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ On your desk.
L151216 +++$+++ u4736 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MR. GRANT +++$+++ Script coverage?
L151215 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ On your desk.
L151214 +++$+++ u4736 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ MR. GRANT +++$+++ The Nielson's?
L152042 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Thanks.
L152041 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Here's a towel.
L152030 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Okay.
L152029 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I'm going to take a shower.
L152026 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I know. The important thing is that it stop.
L152025 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't help it. You know I didn't mean to... to do any of that.
L152024 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ No way can anything be proved. All they have are some wolf hairs. No one believes in werewolves.
L152023 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ What about... those guys... I might have...
L152022 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.
L152021 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Worse than this?
L152020 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ We can work this out. Other couples have worse problems.
L152019 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Maybe we should have children. I don't think I'd kill the father of my child.
L152018 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I knew you wouldn't kill me.
L152015 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I'm staying here with you tonight. There's no getting rid of me.
L152014 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.
L152013 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you?
L152012 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Be careful!
L152010 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I have the silver bullets in case I need to protect myself. Does that make you feel better?
L152009 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I can't take that chance... I couldn't live with myself if I did anything to you.
L152008 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I don't think you would. No matter what form you take.
L152007 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ How do you know?
L152006 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I don't think you'll hurt me.
L152005 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Peter I love you too but...
L152004 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you.
L152003 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Go away. I might hurt you.
L151992 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I knew you wouldn't believe me! Just go away. Go very far away!
L151991 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ If you don't like me, just say so. You don't have to make up some bullshit like you're a werewolf.
L151990 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No you can't. It... it gets so bad that I become a werewolf.
L151989 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal with that.
L151988 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?
L151987 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You at least owe me the truth.
L151986 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yes or no? Frida, can't you just be honest with me?
L151985 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Yes, sort of. I mean no, not really.
L151984 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What? Is there someone else?
L151983 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ NO! Don't come over. Peter... I... I don't want to see you anymore. Ever.
L151982 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Frida? You okay? Look, I think I know what happened to Mark. I want to help. I'm coming over.
L151981 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Hello?
L151944 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ No. But I don't mind hairy. Are you okay?
L151943 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I did shave... Do I seem hairy? Peter laughs.
L151942 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ No, it's a good thing. I like it. Everything about you is great. I like how you don't shave your legs. Women are so much sexier when they're natural.
L151941 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ They do? Oh no...
L151940 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Your breasts feel larger.
L151913 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I loaned him to Jennifer. George moved out and she was lonely...
L151912 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You know, I've never seen your cat.
L151911 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ They're for my cat. I use them to train him not to rip up paper.
L151910 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What's with the squirt guns?
L151909 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I love you too.
L151908 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You didn't say it.
L151907 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.
L151906 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Is that how you feel?
L151905 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No, it's just... no one's ever said that. And I thought if someone did ever say it, I'd have to say it first and then they'd sort of say "I love you too" cause they felt they had to after I'd said it.
L151904 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Is it that funny?
L151902 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No, my bite's a lot worse.
L151901 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You can't mean that. I'm sure your bark is worse than your bite.
L151900 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ This is a lot worse than "Betty."
L151899 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ That's it? Hell my mom chased my dad around with a knife when she had it. She made us call her a different name. She'd say, "You're talking to Betty now" and we'd leave the house for a few days.
L151889 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Interesting possibility.
L151888 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Speaking of Mark -- we've tried to track him down and there's no sight of him. Vanished into thin air. I got a hunch he fled the country.
L151887 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No, but thanks for the warning.
L151886 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Did I tell you I have the worst sense of humor and I make bad jokes at totally inappropriate times?
L151885 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ What's that supposed to mean?
L151884 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Except Mark of course.
L151883 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yeah, every guy you date winds up dead.
L151882 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I just don't know if I should be dating anyone right now.
L151881 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I thought we were starting something... and then... I know it's unorthodox, I mean with you being involved in the case and all.
L151880 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ What happened?
L151879 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What happened?
L151878 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No, I got it. It's okay.
L151877 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I need to talk to you. About us. Frida... I... Can I carry your box?
L151876 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Yeah sort of. Where's Lloyd?
L151875 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Frida. I was looking for you. You changing jobs?
L151851 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ He was ripped to shreds also. In his apartment.
L151850 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No, why?
L151848 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Still haven't figured out how he or anyone else pulled that off. Never seen anything like it.
L151847 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ But you said the bodies were ripped to pieces?
L151845 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Mark wouldn't hurt a fly.
L151844 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ No, no... But Mark -- a jealous boyfriend gone mad. Maybe he kills men you date.
L151824 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ It wasn't a date. Jennifer invited me along to dinner with them.
L151823 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You had a date with Carlton?
L151807 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Uh... the buzzer's broken. I'll be down in a second.
L151806 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Frida, can we come in? We need to talk to you. It's important.
L151805 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Uh.... hi!
L151658 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ A man killed in Central Park.
L151657 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Everything okay?
L151653 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ NO! I... I checked when I put my stuff in. I always look through the washer first.
L151652 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You sure? It's my favorite shirt, mind if I check?
L151651 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No. Nope, nothing in it.
L151650 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Was there anything in that washer?
L151648 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I'm sorry -- I'm on edge today.
L151647 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ No. I was doing my laundry.
L151646 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Oh my god, you scared the shit out of me. You following me again?
L151546 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Frida, wait. Don't go. We can just sleep. I just want to wake up with you.
L151545 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No. No, I'm fine. Maybe I should go. I mean... I don't want our first time to be like this.
L151544 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I mean we can still... whatever... Maybe I should get a towel?
L151541 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ My period? No.
L151540 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Oh, nothing's wrong. Just... well don't you have your period?
L151539 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ What's wrong?
L151538 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Okay, you busted me.
L151537 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I'm a cop -- I notice everything. That drawer's ajar, that picture's been moved about an inch, the closet wasn't closed when I left...
L151534 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Oh just my wolf paraphernalia. Some people collect beanie babies... I collect silver bullets.
L151533 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ What are they for?
L151532 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Silver bullets. A collectors item. These are very valuable. They were melted down from a crucifix.
L151531 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ What are those?
L151521 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Goodnight.
L151520 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Goodnight.
L151519 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Yeah. Maybe.
L151518 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could... get a bite sometime?
L151517 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I really gotta get going.
L151516 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ He's bad news. He cheated on me, he insults me. Now suddenly he gets jealous if I have a date.
L151515 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Me neither. That's why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?
L151514 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.
L151513 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Briefs.
L151512 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ How about you? Briefs or boxers?
L151510 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Yeah but a guy hung like a horse would need briefs to keep things in line.
L151509 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ A lot of people don't wear underwear.
L151508 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you're in an accident? Well this guy wasn't wearing any underwear.
L151507 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Like what?
L151506 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Sometimes it's frustrating. Like this Gregory Jameson case. We don't even know what killed him. I'm putting together little details to see if we're missing something.
L151505 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I've read scripts about detectives, but never met one. Must be wild.
L151504 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ The weird thing is I've had an odd, morbid fascination with wolves ever since.
L151503 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective.
L151502 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ We lived in northern Minnesota. She went for a walk one night and they never found her body -- just her torn apart clothes with her blood and wolf blood on them. Then the town rounded up bunch of hunters and shot all the wolves in the area.
L151501 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Oh my god, by wolves?
L151500 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I've had time to get over it. She was killed by wolves they think.
L151499 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L151498 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ No, she died when I was twelve.
L151497 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Used to? Did it stop finally?
L151496 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ My mom used to get PMS too.
L151495 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I can forgive you a bestseller.
L151494 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ It's stupid.
L151493 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ No really, I love knowing what people read.
L151492 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Oh, it's nothing.
L151491 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ So what book did you buy?
L151490 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Okay well. Maybe some other time. They continue walking together.
L151489 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No. Really. I don't drink coffee anymore. I used to love it but my tastes have changed recently.
L151488 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Some decaf then? That was stupid. Obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off.
L151487 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I'm trying to stay away from caffeine.
L151486 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You wanna get some coffee?
L151485 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ There's a lot of that going around.
L151484 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ That's my ex. He's an asshole. In case you couldn't tell. I think he's been following me.
L151483 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Being a cop has such a warm effect on people.
L151477 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ At least let me give you this back. I washed it.
L151476 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I gotta get going. Peter gets the pillowcase out of his bag.
L151475 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Intriguing?
L151474 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ No... no... this is embarrassing. I was returning your pillowcase... and I saw you cross the street... and I sort of started following you. I just find you really intriguing. I don't know why.
L151473 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Are you following me?
L151472 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You busted me.
L151383 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Okay, if you think of anything else, please give us a call.
L151382 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I wish I could help but last I saw Gregory was outside my front door.
L151377 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ We... he walked me home and... we said goodnight. Um, he kissed me goodnight and that was it.
L151376 +++$+++ u4737 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ When's the last time you saw him?
L151680 +++$+++ u4738 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ SHRINK +++$+++ You use the word "fucking." You're sexualizing things. Stop berating yourself. It's okay to have sex.
L151679 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!!
L151678 +++$+++ u4738 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ SHRINK +++$+++ You say you killed a man and don't remember it. Couldn't you have had sex and not remember it? It's sexual. Why did you choose "eating him" as the method of killing?
L151677 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ We didn't have sex.
L151676 +++$+++ u4738 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ SHRINK +++$+++ Dreams about killing usually signify feelings of guilt. You had sex last night and you feel guilty.
L151675 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I don't know. I don't remember doing it.
L151674 +++$+++ u4738 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ SHRINK +++$+++ And how did you feel when you ate this guy?
L151673 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I ate a guy last night.
L151672 +++$+++ u4738 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ SHRINK +++$+++ Let's explore this. What makes you feel you're a werewolf?
L151671 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ I think I'm a werewolf.
L151225 +++$+++ u4738 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ SHRINK +++$+++ Oh, I see... interesting theory.
L151224 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ That I'm a doormat of course. The shrink makes more notes.
L151840 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Packages of money.
L151839 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No he's not. He's a courier. He picks up packages from the airport.
L151832 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ How big?
L151831 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No, I have a cat.
L151830 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ You got a dog?
L151829 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No. We left the restaurant, and... and I felt sick... so... so I took a cab home. Alone.
L151826 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ What makes you think I was the last one?
L151825 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Seems you were the last to see Carlton alive. And the last to see Gregory alive.
L151822 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Yes, Jennifer told me. What does that have to do with me?
L151821 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ You heard about Carlton Fraser?
L151388 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No, take it.
L151387 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ We can get a warrant if you like.
L151379 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No, I said it was our first date.
L151378 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ A kiss? Did you have sex with him?
L151375 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Looks like it was your only date. Unless you go to his funeral.
L151374 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ No, it was our first date.
L151373 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ Did he come home with you? Did you go to his apartment?
L151372 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Yes... I... we had dinner.
L151366 +++$+++ u4729 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ FRIDA +++$+++ Oh my god, what happened?
L151365 +++$+++ u4733 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ LLOYD +++$+++ It's about Gregory Jameson. He's dead.
L151688 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ She's my best friend. I gotta be there for her -- no matter how crazy it sounds. I've been in some bad relationships and she's been there for me. She's lonely. If pretending she's a werewolf helps, then more power to her.
L151687 +++$+++ u4730 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ You can't believe this bullshit.
L151686 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Take some allergy medicine.
L151685 +++$+++ u4730 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ GEORGE +++$+++ Oh great. What the fuck am I supposed to do?
L151684 +++$+++ u4732 +++$+++ m314 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Don't be stupid George. Obviously if she's a werewolf, she can't be around a cat. She might eat it and besides, cats are afraid of wolves.
