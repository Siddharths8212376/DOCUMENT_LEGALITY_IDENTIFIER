L598658 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ Yes, probably... maybe...
L598657 +++$+++ u8316 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ BEAUPERE +++$+++ We have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner...
L598656 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ No!  I warned the English to go back home -- I begged them not to force us to fight -- they knew the defeat I would bring on them... why didn't they listen to me?
L598655 +++$+++ u8316 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ BEAUPERE +++$+++ Then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger... too strong perhaps...?
L598654 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ No, of course not... I never killed anyone...
L598653 +++$+++ u8316 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ BEAUPERE +++$+++ Are you saying that if you had not been carrying your banner you'd have killed more people?
L598652 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ To avoid killing anyone.
L598651 +++$+++ u8316 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ BEAUPERE +++$+++ Why?
L598650 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ And so I... I prefer my banner.
L598649 +++$+++ u8316 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ BEAUPERE +++$+++ And?
L598648 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ No, it's just... a sword is a weapon.
L598647 +++$+++ u8316 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ BEAUPERE +++$+++ And why was that?  Did it have some particular value or power?
L598646 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ I was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword.
L598645 +++$+++ u8316 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ BEAUPERE +++$+++ Which did you prefer, your banner or your sword?
L598644 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ Yes...
L598643 +++$+++ u8316 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ BEAUPERE +++$+++ Didn't you also carry a banner?
L598642 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ Quite a few.
L598641 +++$+++ u8316 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ BEAUPERE +++$+++ Do you have a sword?
L598625 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ I leave the answer to God.
L598624 +++$+++ u8316 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ BEAUPERE +++$+++ Ah, yes, I forgot... God sent us an illiterate peasant to carry out such an important mission!  Do you think that God made the right decision, to take an ignorant girl to save the kingdom of France?
L598623 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ I can't read.
L598622 +++$+++ u8316 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ BEAUPERE +++$+++ That is not what is written in the evidence... look for yourself!
L598621 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ No... I said "Surrender in the name of the King of France"...
L598620 +++$+++ u8316 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ BEAUPERE +++$+++ And didn't you order the citizens of Paris to surrender the city in the name of the King of Heaven?
L598619 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ I don't know...
L598618 +++$+++ u8316 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ BEAUPERE +++$+++ Do you think is was a good idea to launch an attack on a holy day?
L598617 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ I don't remember.  Maybe.
L598616 +++$+++ u8316 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ BEAUPERE +++$+++ It was on a Sunday, wasn't it?
L598615 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ I tried to.
L598614 +++$+++ u8316 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ BEAUPERE +++$+++ Is it true that you launched an attack on Paris?
L598564 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ I don't know, but you're all men of the church... why not ask Him yourself?
L598563 +++$+++ u8316 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ BEAUPERE +++$+++ Good advice for the French, not for the English!  Do you think God hates the English?
L598562 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ Go onto the next question.
L598544 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ No.  But my revelations were for the King of France, not for you.
L598543 +++$+++ u8316 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ BEAUPERE +++$+++ Did God forbid you to tell the truth?
L598542 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ No...
L598541 +++$+++ u8316 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ BEAUPERE +++$+++ You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?!
L598540 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ I won't tell you more about that. I'm more afraid of displeasing Him than not answering you...
L598233 +++$+++ u8338 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ YOLANDE +++$+++ Performing a miracle.
L598232 +++$+++ u8317 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ W-w-what are you doing?!
L598231 +++$+++ u8317 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ No no, you don't understand -- this is no ordinary oil -- this is miraculous... this oil was brought from heaven by a white dove to crown King Clovis in this... very... cathedral...
L598230 +++$+++ u8338 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ YOLANDE +++$+++ Thirty years ago?  I'm not surprised it's gone...
L598229 +++$+++ u8317 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ Well... at the coronation of King Charles VI...
L598228 +++$+++ u8338 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ YOLANDE +++$+++ And when was that?
L598227 +++$+++ u8317 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ I don't understand... the holy oil of Clovis... it was quite full the last time I saw it...
L598213 +++$+++ u8317 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ BISHOP +++$+++ Oh yes, my lady.  All true kings of France must first be anointed in our great cathedral of Rheims... with the holy oil of Clovis... for it was within these very walls that Saint Remy received the sacred oil from Heaven, brought to him by a white dove for the anointing of King Clovis...
L598212 +++$+++ u8338 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ YOLANDE +++$+++ It is the sacred place that matters, Charles -- not the size.  Am I correct, Bishop?
L598715 +++$+++ u8318 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ BUCK +++$+++ Well find some other way!  Be creative.  Tell them she fucks the devil... Hmm, not a bad idea... why can't you say that?  Sounds good to me... and who can prove she doesn't?
L598714 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ I'm on the side of our Mother Holy Church.  Besides, a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt.
L598713 +++$+++ u8318 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ BUCK +++$+++ Whose side are you on, Cauchon?
L598712 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ Scared to make a mistake.  Supposing she's right... supposing she really has been sent by God??
L598711 +++$+++ u8318 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ BUCK +++$+++ Scared of a girl?
L598710 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ You won't be able to drag anything from her that way.  You also must realize that many of my colleagues are... well, scared...
L598709 +++$+++ u8318 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ BUCK +++$+++ Well what are you waiting for? You've got a castle full of racks and ropes and pulleys:  go and torture the bitch!
L598708 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ But we can't do that unless she admits to blasphemy...
L598707 +++$+++ u8318 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ BUCK +++$+++ ... and your prerogative is to find her guilty...
L598706 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ It is not for us to burn her, my lord.  That is your prerogative.
L598705 +++$+++ u8318 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ BUCK +++$+++ So long as this bitch remains alive, our armies refuse to fight!  Don't you understand?  They want proof that God is on their side... and the only way they're going to believe that is when they see her being burnt as a witch!
L598704 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ Be patient, my lord... you've seen how it is.  This girl has a way with people... but everyday we're making progress...
L598703 +++$+++ u8318 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ BUCK +++$+++ How can I calm down when I'm made the laughing-stock of the whole court?!  I've had enough!
L598702 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ Calm down, my lord, I beg you!
L598579 +++$+++ u8318 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ BUCK +++$+++ Well then?  Start proving... or else the church will have another martyr!
L598578 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ But in order to do so, the church must first prove her heresy, or else you'll be burning a martyr...
L598577 +++$+++ u8318 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ BUCK +++$+++ We want her burned as a witch!
L598576 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ But if this trial seems fixed, I fear you'll have the very opposite result to the one you want...
L598575 +++$+++ u8318 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ BUCK +++$+++ To hell with procedure!  We paid a bloody fortune for this slut, and we can do whatever the hell we like with her, whether the church likes it or not -- is that clear?
L598574 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ I understand your impatience, but if you want this trial to be acknowledged as legal we must follow correct procedure and...
L598572 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ She's loyal to her king... it's only to be expected that she...
L598571 +++$+++ u8318 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ BUCK +++$+++ Who's running this trial, you or her?  I can't believe it!  This wretched girl -- how dare she speak to us like that?
L598505 +++$+++ u8318 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ BUCK +++$+++ Rouen is in English territory.  I have the right to do anything I like.  Take them away.
L598504 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ What are you doing?  This is an ecclesiastical court -- you have no right to do this!
L598503 +++$+++ u8318 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ BUCK +++$+++ Arrest them!
L598377 +++$+++ u8319 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ BURGUNDY +++$+++ And God who allowed you to be caught?
L598376 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ God defeated the English, not me.
L598375 +++$+++ u8319 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ BURGUNDY +++$+++ Your king?  Ah yes, of course... What's he going to pay me with? Cows?  Chickens?  I prefer gold, and the English have plenty.  I wonder how much they'll pay... to have the Witch of Orleans in their clutches? Those English are so arrogant, they can't accept the idea of being defeated by a peasant girl... it has to have been the devil's work.
L598374 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ My king will pay any ransom you ask.
L598373 +++$+++ u8319 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ BURGUNDY +++$+++ Guess.
L598372 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ Where... where am I?
L598371 +++$+++ u8319 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ BURGUNDY +++$+++ Dead you're worthless, darling.
L598370 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ Am I... am I dead?
L598369 +++$+++ u8319 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ BURGUNDY +++$+++ So... here is the famous Jeanne... Savior of Orleans... terror of the English?  You look pretty ordinary to me...
L597699 +++$+++ u8320 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I'll be right here... I promise.
L597698 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ But where are you going to be?
L597697 +++$+++ u8320 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Don't worry about me -- just stay in here... and don't move!
L597696 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ What about you?
L597695 +++$+++ u8320 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Quick -- hide in here...
L597693 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ I was talking to the priest, and do you know what he said to me?
L597692 +++$+++ u8320 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Really?
L597690 +++$+++ u8320 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I was so worried -- we've all been looking for you!  The English are everywhere!  O thank you, lord!
L597689 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ No no, I'm fine, really...
L597688 +++$+++ u8320 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Are you alright?  Did they hurt you?
L598807 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ I -- I can't Jeanne... I can't hear your confession... I'm sorry...
L598806 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ I ask only one thing... to hear me in confession...
L598805 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ It's not my body I want to save. It's my soul.
L598804 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!
L598803 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ And you?  Why did you lie?  You promised I could be confessed...
L598802 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ I don't understand, Jeanne... why did you do it?  Why?
L598792 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ Silence her!  Take her away...!
L598791 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ I didn't mean it!  I didn't know what I was signing!  You tricked me...!
L598790 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ You have nothing to regret...
L598789 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ Please... may I have it back...
L598784 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ As often as you like -- now, please -- for the love of God -- sign!!
L598783 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ And may I go to Mass?
L598782 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ Sign this, and I will confess you myself if you want.
L598781 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ No... I want to be confessed.
L598780 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ Jeanne, I beg of you... sign!  In God's name, don't you understand? I'm trying to save you!  If you don't sign, the English will burn you to death!  Is that what you want??
L598601 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ I am sent by God, and I submit all my words and deeds to His judgment. Or do you think that you are better judges than He is?
L598600 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ It is for us to determine whether you are a good Christian, not you.
L598599 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ So it is the Church Militant that refuses to confess me, and so prevents me from being a good Christian?
L598598 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ Let me clarify things for you, Jeanne.  On the one hand there is the Church Triumphant, that is to say God, his saints, and the souls that are saved.  And then there is the Church Militant, that is to say our Holy Father the Pope, the cardinals, the prelates of the Church, the clergy, and all good Catholic Christians.  Moreover this Church, when assembled, is guided by the Holy Spirit and therefore cannot be in error.  That is why we ask you to submit to the Church Militant... that is to say, us.
L598569 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ Is it here?  Now?  In this room?
L598568 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ Yes...
L598567 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ Tell us, Jeanne... do you often hear this voice?
L598561 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ Did it give you advice?  Good advice?
L598560 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ Many things...
L598559 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ What did it tell you?
L598558 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ Yes.
L598557 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ The voice was in your cell?
L598556 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ Praying.
L598555 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ What were you doing when the voice came?
L598554 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ Last night.
L598553 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ When exactly?  A day, a week -- when?
L598552 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ Not long ago...
L598551 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ I assure you they do.  So... answer me... when was the last time you heard this voice?
L598550 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ These questions have nothing to do with your trial.
L598549 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ Jeanne, you are not helping yourself.  If you don't answer our questions properly, your refusal will be taken into account.
L598488 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ And you be careful, you who claim to be my judges, for you too will be judged one day...!
L598487 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ Jeanne -- be careful -- you're not helping yourself by refusing to submit to our judgment...
L598486 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ Not unless you hear my confession.
L598485 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ Jeanne, listen to me very carefully. We are all men of faith, and we shall earnestly strive for the salvation of both your soul and body as though it were our own.  We do so in the name of our Holy Mother Church, who never closes her arms to those who would return to her.  But we cannot help you unless you submit to our learned judgment and authority.  Take heed of this charitable admonition, for if you persist in refusing our help, then we shall have no choice but to abandon you to the secular powers, and I think you know well enough the punishment that would await you.  So now... will you please recite Our Lord's Prayer?
L598484 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ Not unless you hear my confession.
L598483 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ Recite the Lord's Prayer.
L598482 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ Yes.  In the church at Domremy.
L598481 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ Were you baptized?
L598480 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ Nineteen... or thereabouts...
L598479 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ How old are you?
L598478 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ In a village called Domremy.
L598477 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ Show us a little more cooperation first.  Where were you born?
L598476 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ My name is Jeanne.  My little cross I had round my neck was taken away from me.  I would like to have it back.
L598475 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ So... begin by telling us your name -- assuming you're allowed to tell us that much?
L598474 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ I will willingly swear to tell you what I am allowed to tell you, but as to the rest, even if you threaten to cut off my head, I still won't tell you.
L598473 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ You must take the oath!  Not even a king, would refuse to take an oath to tell the truth in a matter of faith.
L598472 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ I will willingly swear to tell the truth about earthly things, but as for my revelations, I've never told anyone except my king... Charles the Seventh... the one and only king of France.
L598471 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ You will swear to tell the truth about whatever you are asked.
L598470 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ I don't know what you're going to ask me questions about.  You may ask things that I won't want to answer.
L598469 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ Take the Holy Gospels in your hand and swear to tell the whole truth concerning everything you will be asked.
L598412 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ Yes.  They paid your ransom... tomorrow you will be transferred to their great castle at Rouen.
L598411 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ The English??
L598410 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ It seems that the English care more about you than the French.
L598409 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ But... the King -- my king -- didn't he pay my ransom?
L598408 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ Your trial, Jeanne.  On a charge of heresy.
L598407 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ Trial?  What trial??
L598406 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais. As you were captured in my diocese, the duty of conducting the trial falls upon me.
L598405 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ Who are you?
L598404 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ I will hear you... but not now, not here.
L598403 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ Oh, thank you Lord!  I'm so glad to see you!  I need to confess... I haven't been confessed since Easter... or been to Mass... Will you hear me now?
L598399 +++$+++ u8324 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ DIJON +++$+++ Don't look at the cost, look at what it brings.  What is your last offer?
L598398 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ 20,000?!  But... I heard King Charles was... financially embarrassed.
L598391 +++$+++ u8324 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ DIJON +++$+++ I understand.  How much?
L598390 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ This word is -- regrettably appropriate for the situation.  In fact what we -- the Church -- wish to do is determine whether or not this girl is sent by God, as she claims.  You understand that we cannot allow just anybody to abuse God's name in this manner...
L598389 +++$+++ u8324 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ DIJON +++$+++ Buying her?
L598388 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ Not so well, I regret to say.  This business with the Maiden... it's caused him endless grief and torment.  That's why he's entrusted me with the task of... shall we say...
L598387 +++$+++ u8324 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ DIJON +++$+++ And your Duke?  The Duke of Bedford?
L598386 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ Thanks be to God.
L598385 +++$+++ u8324 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ DIJON +++$+++ He's feeling wonderful.
L598384 +++$+++ u8321 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CAUCHON +++$+++ Good day, sir.  I trust my honorable Duke of Burgundy is feeling well?
L598316 +++$+++ u8338 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ YOLANDE +++$+++ Then her faith will have to be bigger.
L598315 +++$+++ u8322 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ But... her army's so small now...
L598314 +++$+++ u8338 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ YOLANDE +++$+++ Don't worry, Charles.  If God is still with her, she will be victorious.  We're not her judges... we're just spectators.  Let her go to Compiegne, as you let her go to Orleans, and let God decide her fate.
L598307 +++$+++ u8322 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ I... I can't stop her.
L598306 +++$+++ u8338 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ YOLANDE +++$+++ I assure you, Charles, the Maiden has no greater admirer than myself. But whatever our personal feelings, we cannot allow her to conduct her own private war.  For the sake of the kingdom, it is imperative that you stop her going to Compiegne...
L598305 +++$+++ u8322 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ It's true.  There's only one king... people need to be reminded of that. Nevertheless... Jeanne has done so much for us...
L597878 +++$+++ u8338 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ YOLANDE +++$+++ For the sake of France, Charles. And for the sake of my grandson.
L597877 +++$+++ u8322 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ You will??
L597768 +++$+++ u8338 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ YOLANDE +++$+++ You're a fine judge of character, Charles.  It'll take you less than five minutes to expose her if she's a fake.  But if she's not -- then she will give you your answers... and place the crown on your head.
L597767 +++$+++ u8322 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ You really think she's been sent... by God?
L597766 +++$+++ u8338 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ YOLANDE +++$+++ Who better than a messenger from God to give answers to your questions?
L597765 +++$+++ u8322 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ W-w-what has that got to do with this Maiden?
L597764 +++$+++ u8338 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ YOLANDE +++$+++ Mmmm.  Yes.  I know for example the sickness that plagues your heart.  I know how painful it is for you... to have loved a father... without ever knowing if he really was yours.
L597763 +++$+++ u8322 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ You think?
L597762 +++$+++ u8338 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ YOLANDE +++$+++ Your health and happiness has always been my first concern, Charles... ever since you were a little boy -- and I think I know you better than your own mother...
L598275 +++$+++ u8322 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Why do you have to be so bloodthirsty?  Do you enjoy it?  All that blood and noise and pain? Diplomacy is far more civilized... far safer... and far cheaper...
L598274 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!
L598273 +++$+++ u8322 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Well... we are, of course, enormously grateful for your past efforts, but your task is done.  Now it's time for negotiation... and after many months of skillful work, our dear Tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our Burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the English.  You see, my dear Jeanne... as it is written in the Bible, "to everything there is a season:  a time for war, and a time for peace"...
L598272 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ So how would you put it?
L598271 +++$+++ u8322 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Gave you?  Well now, I wouldn't quite put it like that...
L598270 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ Why did you betray me?  Paris was ours for the taking!  All I needed was another few hundred men... Why did you take back the army you gave me?
L598269 +++$+++ u8322 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Now hold on -- you're not captain here... on the battlefield perhaps, but not in the royal bedchamber!
L598268 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ Get them out of here!
L598236 +++$+++ u8322 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ ... and my crown doesn't fit and...  Really??
L598235 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ ... You look wonderful...
L598234 +++$+++ u8322 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Ah, Jeanne... come here...!  This whole coronation idea of yours is a fiasco... nothing is ready...
L597840 +++$+++ u8322 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ Orleans has held out for six months. I don't suppose a few days will make much difference.  Take some rest.
L597839 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ I don't need lodgings if we're to be marching on Orleans...
L597833 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ He said that I have to save France from her enemies and give her back to God, and He told me that I -- Jeanne -- will lead you to the altar at Rheims to be crowned King of France.
L597832 +++$+++ u8322 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ ... and what... what did he say?
L597830 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ I didn't wait long.  One day I was going to Mass, like I do every day, when the same strange wind started blowing again...
L597829 +++$+++ u8322 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ CHARLES +++$+++ You did well...
L597828 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ What was my mission?  To help my country?  But how could I do that? I was only a poor girl who knew nothing about riding or making war... so I decided to wait and not to speak to anyone about it.
L597810 +++$+++ u8329 +++$+++ m565 +++$+++ JEANNE +++$+++ I know you're not yet -- but you will be, soon.
