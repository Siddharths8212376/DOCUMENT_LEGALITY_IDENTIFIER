L521603 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ How can you think about food at a time like this?
L521602 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yes - all the money in the world - but what good is it?  Mint sauce or cranberries?
L521601 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ You poor, poor boy.
L521600 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Ever since then -  numb - no feelings.  Like my heart was shot full of novocaine.
L521599 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Talk about sad.
L521598 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yes.  Eight hours later they brought her up by mule - I gave her three transfusions - we had the same blood type - Type O - it was too late.
L521597 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Oh, no!
L521596 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Well, it was my freshman year at Princeton - there was this girl - her name was Nellie - her father was vice-president of Hupmobile - she wore glasses, too.  That summer we spent our vacation at the Grand Canyon - we were standing on the highest ledge, watching the sunset - suddenly we had an impulse to kiss - I took off my glasses - I took a step toward her - she took a step toward me -
L521595 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Oh, you couldn't possibly.
L521594 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I don't want to bore you.
L521593 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ What happened?
L521592 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Not anymore.  I was in love once - but I'd rather not talk about it.  How about a little cold pheasant?
L521591 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ You mean you can't fall in love?
L521590 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Oh, it's not your fault.  It's just that every now and then Mother Nature throws somebody a dirty curve.  Something goes wrong inside.
L521589 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ That makes me feel just awful.
L521588 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Complete washout.
L521587 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Nothing at all?
L521586 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ See?  Nothing.
L521585 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Have I?  I'm trying all the time.
L521584 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Have you tried?
L521583 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ It's more like a mental block.  When I'm with girls, it does nothing to me.
L521582 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ You mean - like frigid?
L521581 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ They just sort of leave me cold.
L521580 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ What thing?
L521579 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Well, I don't know how to put it - but I have this thing about girls.
L521578 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Harmless - how?
L521577 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Oh, it's not that. It's just that I'm - harmless.
L521576 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Well, of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.
L521575 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You're flattering me.
L521574 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ It's not the icebergs.  But there are certain men who would try to take advantage of a situation like this.
L521573 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Oh, it's perfectly safe.  We're well anchored - the ship is in shipshape - and the Coast Guard promised to call me if there are any icebergs around.
L521572 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ You know, I've never been completely alone with a man before - in the middle of the night - in the middle of the ocean.
L521571 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Completely.
L521570 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ You mean we're alone on the boat?
L521569 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ It's the crews' night off.
L521568 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ What's on Thursdays?
L521567 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yea, of course.  Now where could they have put it?  On Thursdays, I'm sort of lost around here.
L521566 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Where's your shell collection?
L521565 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'll say.  I had two ponies drowned under me.
L521564 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Water polo - isn't that terribly dangerous?
L521563 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Trophies.  You know - skeet-shooing, dog-breeding, water polo...
L521562 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Look at all that silverware.
L521561 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Bon voyage.
L521560 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Down the hatch - as we say at sea.
L521559 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ I don't mind if I do.
L521558 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Champagne?
L521557 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ They shrink when they're marinated.
L521556 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ A herring?  Isn't it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars?
L521555 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Oh - a member of the herring family.
L521554 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ What is it?
L521553 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Caught him off Cape Hatteras.
L521552 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ What a beautiful fish.
L521551 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ It's all right for a bachelor.
L521550 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ It's exquisite - like a floating mansion.
L521549 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Of course.  On Thursdays, they always serve me in the small salon.
L521548 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Oh - in here.
L521546 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yes - that's our hurricane cellar.
L521545 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Oh, you have an upstairs and a downstairs.
L521544 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yes - now let's see - where do you suppose the steward set it up?
L521543 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Love it.  Which way?
L521542 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Well, that depends - on whether you're coming or going - I mean, normally the aft is on the other side of the stern - and that's the bridge - so you can get from one side of the boat to the other - how about a glass of champagne?
L521541 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ My dad is more interested in railroads. Baltimore and Ohio.  Which is the port and which is the starboard?
L521540 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Mother keeps hers in Southampton - and Dad took his to Venezuela - the company is laying a new pipe line.
L521539 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Three?
L521538 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Just regulation size.  We have three like this.
L521537 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ It looked so small from the beach - but when you're on it, it's more like a cruiser - or a destroyer.
L521536 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ It's not how long it takes - it's who's taking you.
L521535 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Do you mind riding backwards? It may take a little longer -
L521534 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Looks like they're on the wrong track.
L521533 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I just got this motorboat - it's an experimental model.
L521531 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ It's sort of funny - you being out of gas - I mean, Shell Oil and everything -
L521530 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I seem to be out of gas.
L521529 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ It's the thought that counts.
L521528 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I wanted them to fly down some orchids from our greenhouse but all of Long Island is fogged in.
L521527 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Thank you.  And thank you for the flowers.
L521526 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ It's not how long you wait - it's who you're waiting for.
L521525 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Been waiting long?
L521511 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Oh, Josephine - just imagine - me, Sugar Kowalczyk, from Sandusky, Ohio, on a millionaire's yacht.  If my mother could only see me now -
L521510 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You heard her - yes.
L521505 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ For me?  It's Shell Oil.
L521504 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Well, you know how those millionaires are.  These came for you.
L521503 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ I guess he's not going to show up - it's give minutes to one - you suppose he forgot?
L521451 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Because he said he's coming to hear us play - maybe.
L521450 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I am?
L521449 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Anyway, you're going to meet him tonight.
L521446 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Shells?  Whatever for?
L521445 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Oh, I'm not going to let this one get away. He's so cute - collects shells.
L521444 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Maybe you'd better go after him - if you don't want to lose him.
L521443 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Well, he's young and handsome and a bachelor - and he's a real gentleman - not one of these grabbers.
L521440 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You don't say!
L521439 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Shell Oil, Junior.  He's got millions - he's got glasses - and he's got a yacht.
L521438 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ One of whom?
L521435 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ They repealed Prohibition?
L521434 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Guess!
L521433 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What?
L521432 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ The most wonderful thing happened -
L521431 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Oh, I didn't hear you come in.
L521430 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Josephine.
L521409 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ If it's at all possible -
L521408 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ And you will come to hear us tonight?
L521407 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ It's been delightful meeting you both.
L521406 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Well, I guess I'd better go -
L521399 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Yes, you're in the way.  He's waiting for a signal from his yacht.
L521398 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Would you mind moving along, please?
L521389 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Please - no names.  Just call me Junior.
L521388 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Shell Oil?
L521387 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yes.  So did my father and my grandfather - we've all had this passion for shells - that's why we named the oil company after it.
L521386 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ You collect shells?
L521385 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ It's on the account of the shells. That's my hobby.
L521384 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Oh?
L521383 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I only come ashore twice a day - when the tide goes out.
L521382 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Why?
L521381 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I'd like to - but it may be rather difficult.
L521380 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ I thought you might like to come to the hotel and hear us play.
L521379 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Tonight?
L521378 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Maybe I'll tell you when I know you a little better.  What are you doing tonight?
L521377 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What theory?
L521376 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ You see, I have this theory about men with glasses.
L521375 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I beg your pardon?
L521374 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ You're very kind.  I'll bet you're also very gentle - and helpless -
L521373 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You know, it's amazing we never ran into each other before.  I'm sure I would have remembered anybody as attractive as you.
L521372 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ - and always the same Four Hundred.
L521371 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ - riding to hounds -
L521370 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ - opening of the Opera -
L521369 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ - Inauguration balls -
L521368 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ They do indeed.  Daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent, but I don't care. It was such a bore - coming-out parties, cotillions -
L521367 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Good school!  And your family doesn't object to your career?
L521366 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ So do I.  as a matter of fact, I spent three years at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.
L521365 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Oh.  Well, I guess some like it hot.  But personally, I prefer classical music.
L521364 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Yeah.  Real hot.
L521363 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Syncopators - does that mean you play that fast music - jazz?
L521362 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Oh, yes.  Quite.  You know - Vassar, Bryn Mawr - we're only doing this for a lark.
L521361 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You're society girls?
L521360 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.
L521359 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ For your own amusement?
L521358 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ No - the ukulele.  And I sing.
L521357 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Could be.  Do you play the market?
L521356 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ I'll bet just while we were talking, you made like a hundred thousand dollars.
L521355 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Up, up, up.
L521354 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ How's the stock market?
L521353 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ That's very interesting.
L521352 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Well, I'm not.
L521351 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ I'm not interested at all.
L521350 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ No, my cocktail steward.  Look, if you're interested in whether I'm married or not -
L521349 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ And who mixes the cocktails - your wife?
L521348 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ No, my flag steward.
L521347 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ I quite agree.  Tell me, who runs up that flat - your wife?
L521346 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Certainly not.  with all that unrest in the world, I don't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve.
L521345 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Which one is yours - the big one?
L521344 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ You have a yacht?
L521343 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ They run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.
L521342 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Your view of what?
L521341 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Would you mind moving just a little? You're blocking my view.
L521340 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ That must be it.
L521339 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Possible you saw it in a newspaper - or magazine - Vanity Fair -
L521338 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Your face is familiar.
L521337 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Not at all.
L521336 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Are you staying at the hotel?
L521335 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Not very likely.
L521334 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
L521331 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Now, really -
L521330 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Who are you?
L521329 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Thank you.
L521328 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Well, don't worry.  I won't sue you - no matter who you are.
L521327 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars.
L521326 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ Why?
L521325 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I wish you'd make sure.
L521324 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ I don't think so.
L521323 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ You're not hurt, are you?
L521322 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ My fault.
L521321 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
L521296 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ She doesn't need one.  I don't have one either.
L521295 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Wait a minute, Daphne.  You haven't got a bathing suit.
L521248 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Just my feminine intuition.
L521247 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ What makes you so sure?
L521246 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Forget it, Sugar, will you?  Forget about saxophone players.  You're going to meet a millionaire - a young one.
L521245 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ What else?  And was I ever crazy about him. Two in the morning, he sent me down for knackwurst and potato salad - they were out of potato salad, so I brought coleslaw - so he threw it right in my face.
L521244 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Saxophone player?
L521243 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ 414 - that's the same room number I had in Cincinnati - my last time around with a male band. What a heel he was.
L521242 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ So do I.  But don't worry - we'll be seeing a lot of each other.
L521241 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ I wish they'd put us in the same room.
L521195 +++$+++ u7713 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Seventy-five.  That's three-quarters of a century.  Makes a girl think.
L521194 +++$+++ u7722 +++$+++ m522 +++$+++ SUGAR +++$+++ I'll bet there isn't one of them under seventy-five.
