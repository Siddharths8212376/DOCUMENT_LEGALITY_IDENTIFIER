L549501 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ They came out of my <u>body</u>!
L549498 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You are <u>marrying</u> the <u>greatest</u> guy who walks this <u>earth</u>.  Who I have <u>loved</u> from my <u>heart</u> for twelve<u>years</u>!

L549495 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ How would you know <u>anything</u>?

L549492 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You bet you are.
L549490 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You're not dying.
L549489 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Life's a trade-off.  You get cancer, your hair falls out, but you <u>do</u> get to smoke dope.
L549483 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Really.  By what right?  Six months of part-time screw-ups?
L549482 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I got used to...thinking of them. As...my kids too.
L549481 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ ...it's my problem, too.

L549477 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ We can't live like that.
L549476 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Bi-coastal parenting.  Happens every day.  Luke gets the kids every other summer, every other holiday, it's not ideal, but people make it work, and...

L549471 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Nobody likes a snoop.
L549470 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ And I know checking into your life was inexcusable...
L549469 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Don't flatter yourself.
L549468 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Look, you've never liked me...
L549467 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You're taking the kids.  And moving to San Francisco.
L549466 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You WHAT?
L549465 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You're not working at Random House, I talked to them.

L549399 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Wowie.  How wonderful!
L549398 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ ...thinking of going back to Random House.  On a part-time basis.
L549395 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Not great.  Plus, I've got things on my mind.  You know.
L549394 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You feeling all right?
L549392 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ When I twisted hair like this it means I'm intimidated by you...

L549390 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Jackie?
L549389 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ She was angry at herself.
L549388 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Last week when she chopped her Barbie's bangs all to hell --
L549387 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Anxiety.
L549386 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ What about obsessively picking her split ends?
L549334 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ No way.  I told her two, three years, maybe, for such an expens...
L549333 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Hey.  At least it's not an editing machine.
L549332 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I'm sorry, I just...
L549324 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ It's okay, it's twenty minutes.  The horse'll be there.
L549323 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Sorry I'm late, I got lost dropping Ben off at Kevin's.
L549213 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Do you have a word limit you need to hit every day or can I finish?
L549212 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Not personally.
L549211 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Ben likes to be read to.  Do you know Dr. Seuss...?
L549210 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Why not just bring the whole toilet?
L549209 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Bandaids for cuts.  Bandaids for new shoe blisters.  Packet of Wash n Dri's. Kleenex.  Sugar free lollipops, potty seat covers for public restrooms...
L549208 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Fine, forget it.
L549207 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
L549206 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ However many.  It's not enough.
L549205 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ What?  And have Federal agents jump out of the bushes with court orders? How many years do you get in this state for giving second-rate care to minors?
L549204 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I have an appointment this after- noon.  I need someone to take them to the park.
L549202 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I did it for her.

L549200 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Those are <u>my</u> children you're practicing on.  They deserve <u>first-</u> rate care.  Every minute.  Of every night.  And every day.
L549199 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I need practice.
L549198 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
L549197 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ She already hates me.  You've seen to that.
L549196 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I didn't do it for you.  Believe me.
L549195 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite...
L549194 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I have a snoop.
L549192 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I don't recall inviting you.
L549191 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I'm sorry.  Look, I'm not real comfortable being here, but...
L549190 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ ...in.
L549124 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ A court <u>order</u> is gonna say that <u>woman</u> is <u>never</u> <u>alone</u> with my children!  Ever <u>again</u>!  Do you HEAR that?
L549123 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Well, maybe they would if they thought it was okay, with y...
L549122 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I am not <u>here</u> to make it easier for you.  These are <u>my</u> children.  They don't want to <u>be</u> with you.
L549110 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You listen carefully because I am only going to say this once.  That woman has nothing more to do with my children.
L549109 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Jackie, if I thought for one moment...
L549105 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I'm sorry I didn't mean to break your concentration.  I thought it would be a nice moment to rememb...
L549104 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Annabelle doesn't really want to talk to you right now.
L549079 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Think twice.  Before you <u>ever</u> pull that again.
L549078 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Yeh?
L549068 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Of all the <u>cheap</u> excuses.  To break a child's heart.
L549067 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Look, I...
L549066 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Machines do not EAT message.
L549034 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You got to hell!
L549033 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ But it's not on the schedule!
L549032 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Get out!
L549031 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Maybe the problem is your <u>kids</u>.  Maybe they're spoiled, coddled <u>brats</u>!
L549030 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Oh and I don't because I have a children?! The problem is you're too self-involved to ever be a mother.
L549029 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You're damn right.  I'm gonna sick of your imperious bullshit.  I never said I was Betty Fucking Crocker.  If every time life hits her in the face you want to have a 12 hour talk every third Friday or the month -- go ahead!  I have a life!
L549028 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You mean for you.  A 10-year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family.  She sees her father naked with another woman for the first time. And you think it's best for her if every- one pretends it didn't happen?  This isn't going to work out.
L549027 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ No.  I thought it might be uncomfortable for her --
L549026 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Did you or Luke talk to her about it afterwards?
L549025 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I was in there in him.
L549024 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers.
L549023 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Luke was in the shower this morning and Annabelle sort of walked in without knocking.
L549021 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ <u>Forgiveness?</u>  For <u>what</u>, exactly?
L549020 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ ...a ridiculously <u>expensive</u> and <u>inappropriate</u> item, which her father and I have already <u>told</u> her she is <u>far</u> too young to own.  But <u>you</u> apparently want to <u>buy</u> her forgiveness, with...
L549019 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ She's been talking about this little editing machine, it's only...
L549017 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Nothing.  Look, I want to talk to you about...well...Luke said to ask you...
L549016 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ What did you do?
L549015 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Maybe you could back off just a little bit --
L549014 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ What happened with Annabelle?  Has nothing I said gotten through to you?
L549013 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Annabelle, how's your video rep...
L549012 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ What is this?  The Betty Ford Center?
L549011 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ We don't have any coffee.
L549010 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Can I please have a cup of coffee?
L549009 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Every Tuesday except the 3rd Tuesday of the month when it's switched to Friday except in April when she rides on Thursday.  It's not that hard.  Didn't you have a mother?
L549008 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ This is Friday, her riding lesson is on Tuesdays.  I got it right here...
L549007 +++$+++ u7883 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ How do you hold down a job?  It's 8:10. You were supposed to be here at 7:00. She's missed her sunrise Groom'n Ride.
L549888 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I'm gonna get me a drink.
L549887 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Where you goin'?
L549883 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ How about the promises we make to our kids?  About <u>their</u> future.  Do we shrug those off, just that easily?
L549882 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ We make our lives, one step at a time.  We do the best we can.  The truth about the future?  A promise. Is only a hope.
L549880 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Because you've changed so much.
L549879 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ That's not us.
L549878 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ 'But keep dancing, and if you're lucky, I might just never leave, who knows?'
L549877 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ No, here's ugly.  'I love <u>you</u>, babe. It's just our <u>life</u> together I'm not so sure about...'
L549876 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ That's a pretty ugly thing you just said.
L549872 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ No, she threw you out.  What a difficult woman.
L549871 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ '...I don't know if I can make it.' That's what I said.  But I didn't leave.
L549870 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Excuse me.  'Things are so confusing for me, Jack.  Our life feels too comfortable, too safe, too predict- able.  It's a partnership, it's juggling schedules.  When I think of playing that out, every day, for the rest of my life...'
L549869 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Restless.
L549868 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ By way of saying you were unhappy.
L549867 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I told her I loved her.
L549866 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Let me put it this way.  Hell, no.
L549865 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Can we go sit somewhere?
L549864 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ What do you call it?  You told her you had doubts.
L549863 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ She called it a fight.  <u>The</u> fight.
L549862 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ '...the kids have camp.  Their friends are here.  Over there, I'll just be shopping in a language I don't even know.  My life, and the kids' lives, aren't here to service your mid-life crisis.'  Did it go like that?
L549861 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ ...while she watched the kids.  Then, you booked this flat in Paris for your family's summer.  But she said...
L549860 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I needed some time away.
L549859 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You took a fishing trip with the boys. Liked it so much, you took another.
L549858 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Why in the world would she t...
L549857 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Imagine my relief.  So what's for dinner?
L549856 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Well, they will be.
L549855 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Just like to make sure.  That your past.  And my future.  Are real different.
L549851 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Hold your applause.  We're not having fun, here.
L549850 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ What a great surpri...
L549709 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I made that paella you liked. It's on the stove.
L549708 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ No problem.
L549559 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I know that.
L549558 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ She's not gonna die.
L549557 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Great, wallow in guilt, you <u>sure</u> you're not Jewish?
L549556 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ They're my kids.
L549554 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Are you hungry?  You could make us something?
L549553 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ It's Anna Sui, you should be doing it.
L549552 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ It's just an assignment.
L549551 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ It's no biggie.

L549312 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ What's eight, ten years?  Hell, you'll still be ambulatory.  I think.
L549311 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Rache, it may take time.
L549310 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Everything's gonna work out.  The kids and I...we're going to love each other.
L549308 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Because I can't hurt anyone like this ever again.
L549307 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?
L549306 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ It's forever you know.
L549305 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ I think so too...
L549304 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I think so...What do you think?
L549303 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ Oh my God.  Are you serious?

L549050 +++$+++ u7884 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Get ready.  To get <u>really</u> mad.
L548975 +++$+++ u7885 +++$+++ m533 +++$+++ RACHEL +++$+++ You know I don't need another person in this family making me feel like an idiot...your ex-wife's doing a bang up job and I have to face it every Tuesday and Thursday and every other goddamn weekend and I just don't know how the hell you were married to her for so goddamn long!
