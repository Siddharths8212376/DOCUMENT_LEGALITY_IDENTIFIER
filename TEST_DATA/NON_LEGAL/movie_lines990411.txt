L594783 +++$+++ u8288 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ ROBLES +++$+++ Professional hunters, who rid the state of cougars.
L594782 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ State hunters?
L594685 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ No. He was kidding Charlie.
L594684 +++$+++ u8288 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ ROBLES +++$+++ Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
L594683 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I've been trying to tell him, Sheriff. He won't listen to me.
L594612 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Nothing much -- just that it might not be a cat this time.
L594611 +++$+++ u8288 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ ROBLES +++$+++ What are you getting at?
L594608 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I know all that, chief, and I don't like it any better than you do, but there's something else --
L594607 +++$+++ u8288 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ ROBLES +++$+++ Yes, there is something wrong. People who want publicity and don't mind how they get it --what risks they make other people run - - what agony and sorrow they bring to other people --
L594606 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Something's wrong with this whole setup --
L594605 +++$+++ u8288 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ ROBLES +++$+++ That's why it just mauls and tears at them.
L594450 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ It's not for me.  I'm literally and figuratively a tenderfoot.
L594449 +++$+++ u8288 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ ROBLES +++$+++ Go on foot.
L594448 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I haven't done any posse work since last time I rode with Toni Mix at the old Bijou Theatre -- aged six, If you're interested,
L594445 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Thanks, Sheriff.
L594444 +++$+++ u8288 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ ROBLES +++$+++ You can go now, Manning. There is no way we can hold you legally responsible.
L594954 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Kiki, Galbraith said something to me once, -- something you ought to know. We were talking and he said that people were like that ball on the fountain at the hotel --they got pushed around by things bigger than themselves. That's the way it was with us -- and we were too small to see it that way.
L594953 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ It's a lovely town —- it was until we came and let the leopard loose and all this happened.
L594951 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ We ought to dare to tell each other everything, Kiki -- you and I.
L594950 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ Jerry, I want you to be soft. You are soft -- inside -— where it matters. I wanted it that day too, but didn't dare tell you.
L594949 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I know. What do you think I felt when you said, "don't be soft?"
L594948 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ I hated you that day —- you and your flip talk -— with that little girl lying dead.
L594947 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I know -- Teresa -—
L594946 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ We stood here once before.
L594926 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ It's all right. I'm not hurt.
L594925 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Kiki?
L594890 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ We will ——
L594889 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ No. No, thanks.  Now we've got to do it ourselves.
L594863 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ How do you know?
L594862 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Half to the Delgado family and half to Clo-Clo's family.
L594861 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ All right, I'm not ashamed of it! I split it two ways —
L594860 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Eloise doesn't own enough of anything to make a dent in your pay check, Kicks.
L594859 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ I -- I bought some silver jewelry and stuff from Eloise --
L594858 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ What! You can't be --
L594857 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ As a matter of fact, I'm out of cash myself.
L594856 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ That's funny -- I never knew you to lose that much before --
L594855 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I got into a little crap game.
L594854 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?
L594853 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Oh, by the way -- I'm out of cash --
L594852 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I'm no detective. I don't even know how to begin. All I know is I want to do something about all this.
L594851 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ You already know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again --
L594848 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Absolutely sure.
L594847 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ You're positive of that, aren't you?
L594846 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Kiki -- it wasn't the leopard.
L594845 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ If that's being a softie -- there are two of us.
L594844 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ Confession. I'm a complete softie. I've been conscience-stricken and worried sick ever since that leopard got away --
L594842 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ Maybe there ought to be less racket and more us.
L594841 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I'm glad you care about us, Kicks. Sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket --
L594840 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ You. Us.
L594839 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ What else do you care about, Kicks?
L594837 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ That doesn't make sense.
L594836 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ Maybe I want to feel badly.
L594835 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Why do you want to stay around here? It'll only make you feel badly.
L594832 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Robles says it looks that way. Belmonte had already been there and left. They only missed each other by a few minutes.
L594831 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ And she waited here for him?
L594830 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ Yes. Do you mind?
L594829 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You mean you want to take them to the cemetery.
L594828 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ Jerry, these flowers aren't really for me ——
L594826 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ Yes.
L594825 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I know. Funerals.
L594824 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ Pretty. You know -- it's funny but flowers only mean one thing to me now.
L594823 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ He's a nice guy. Vie ought to keep in touch with him.
L594822 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ That was nice of Mr. Galbraith.
L594816 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Do they close up every year for this Processionist business?
L594815 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ I can use them.
L594486 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ And not a sign of the leopard?
L594485 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ ——	As long as my feet held out.
L594483 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You remember the fellow this morning -- Galbraith. You've got time before the supper show.
L594482 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ Who is he?
L594481 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Forget it. I'm buying a drink for a fellow who was on the posse with me, a nice guy. Come along he'll get a great kick out of meeting you.
L594480 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience
L594479 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ The whole town's in a state, Kiki ——doors locked, people huddling together like scared sheep ——nobody on the streets at night ——
L594478 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ It must be the altitude —— you, bucking around the countryside with a lot of boot—and—saddle boys --
L594477 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ And did you find the leopard?
L594476 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Yeah.
L594475 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ Well, does everybody love us now? You've been gone long enough to soft—soap twenty editors!
L594456 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ We all, had to look at the body. It was awful, Kiki -- awful!
L594455 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ What did he have to do -— look at the body?
L594454 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I don't know —— a witness. He seemed to know something about animals -- you know -- expert testimony.
L594453 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ Who was the other man?
L594452 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ And I suppose you don't feel bad!
L594451 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I suppose he was trying to make me feel bad.
L594442 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ Don't be soft.
L594441 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Suppose I slip them a few bucks — for the funeral expenses.
L594379 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ Now look what you've done.
L594378 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Are you all right?
L594376 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ The red dress?  No. My black one. Then I'll be just like him.
L594375 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ You look swell in that three—alarm number --
L594371 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I thought you might strut this kitten in right in the middle of her act.
L594370 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ Clo-Clo?
L594369 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ And I never will -- you know what's between us -— we're a thing -- But this is serious -- big competition.
L594368 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ No —— not yet.
L594367 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Almost three years, isn't it? And have I ever done anything to hurt you?
L594366 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ This is l939. Can't you subtract?
L594365 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Look, Kicks, how long have we known each other?
L594364 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ You're too good to me.
L594363 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ No. I thought that might be just a little corny.  I want you to lead him in on a leash.
L594362 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ On his back, I suppose.
L594361 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I thought -— is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance  this town will never forget.
L594360 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ That's easy. Me.
L594359 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this time.
L594358 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ Makes no difference.  Get him out.
L594357 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Kiki - he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
L594356 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ Get it out of here!
L594355 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ And I never will- you know what's between us — we're a thing But this is serious competition.
L594354 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ No —- not yet.
L594353 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Look, Kicks, have I ever done anything to hurt you?
L594352 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ You're too good to me.
L594351 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash.
L594350 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ On his back, I suppose.
L594349 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ I thought -- is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight ——walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!
L594348 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ That's easy. Me.
L594347 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...
L594346 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ Makes no difference. Get him out!
L594345 +++$+++ u8285 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ JERRY +++$+++ Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
L594344 +++$+++ u8286 +++$+++ m563 +++$+++ KIKI +++$+++ Get it out of here!
L597318 +++$+++ u8290 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ ATTENDANT +++$+++ You a tourist?
L597317 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Ha-ha... Yeah...  What about that road back there, though? It says ‘closed to the public’, doesn’t it?
L597316 +++$+++ u8290 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ ATTENDANT +++$+++ Maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the Getty Museum...
L597315 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Nobody? Huh!... How come?
L597314 +++$+++ u8290 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ ATTENDANT +++$+++ Ain’t nobody out there, Mister.
L597313 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ All those soldiers out there... getting bored, thirsty. Come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps?
L597312 +++$+++ u8290 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ ATTENDANT +++$+++ Must it?
L597311 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Hot...  These roads all round here, closed to the public... Why’s that? Military bases?  Huh. I guess there’s space enough for war games... Must be good for business.
L597496 +++$+++ u8291 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ BUTLER +++$+++ Dial O-O-O on the telephone if you change your mind about the drink, sir.
L597495 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Mrs De Moraes must have taken it hard, eh?  Her brother’s death.
L597494 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ No. Thank you. I’ll be fine...
L597493 +++$+++ u8291 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ BUTLER +++$+++ You will have to ask Mr De Moraes that, sir.  Would you like a drink while you wait?
L597492 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ You wouldn’t recall if the brothers-in-law left together, would you?
L597491 +++$+++ u8291 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ BUTLER +++$+++ I work here, sir. I’m here most of the time.
L597490 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ By the way, Laurence, were you here last time your mistress’s brother came over? You know, just before he disappeared?
L597478 +++$+++ u8291 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ BUTLER +++$+++ Mr De Moraes is due back from Brazil late this evening. Mrs De Moraes is out and not expected before eight. Do you wish...
L597477 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ When will they be back?
L597476 +++$+++ u8291 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ BUTLER +++$+++ I’m afraid they are out at the moment, sir.
L597475 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?
L597474 +++$+++ u8291 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ BUTLER +++$+++ Good afternoon. De Moraes’s residence.
L596608 +++$+++ u8291 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ BUTLER +++$+++ That would be Mrs De Moraes mother, Sir. Mr and Mrs Spitz are here with their daughter.
L596607 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ De Moraes? I was asked here by a Mrs Spitz.
L596606 +++$+++ u8291 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ BUTLER +++$+++ I am Lawrence, sir. Mr and Mrs De Moraes’ majordomo. They are expecting you.
L596605 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ That might depend on where you’re going.
L596604 +++$+++ u8291 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ BUTLER +++$+++ Will you please come with me?
L596603 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ That’s right.
L597629 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ The dead can wait.
L597628 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ I... We have to bury Leon tommorrow...
L597624 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ You wouldn’t understand.
L597623 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Why the hell couldn’t you divorce the man?
L597620 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Your parents arranged the visit to my office?
L597619 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ I don’t know. Everyone’s dead...
L597618 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ What do you suggest?
L597617 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ On... Once...  Once... What are we... you going to do?
L597616 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ So you did talk about it, huh?
L597614 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ My parents flew back from Israel... Told him they would get him killed unless he flew back to Brazil immediately and agreed to a divorce. He flew back to Brazil...  And his drowning was arranged...
L597613 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Get to the point, will you...
L597612 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ The staff don’t know yet...  I called my parents, told them everything...  I just couldn’t take any more...
L597611 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Your flunkey said he was expected back tonight.
L597610 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ They found his body yesterday. In the pool at our house in Sao Paulo. He drowned. Drank too much, went for a swim and drowned.
L597609 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ No. Not us...
L597608 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ We? You and your parents killed your husband?
L597607 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Do you think we’d let him get away with the murder of my brother?
L597606 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ He... He is dead!  MY HUSBAND IS DEAD!  Call my parents. They’ll tell you. Call them!
L597605 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Do you think the boy you saved might identify your husband as his purchaser, Deborah? And then, your brother’s not buried yet. As I said earlier, an autopsy will...
L597604 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ What are you doing? You can’t. I...
L597603 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ You know something? I’ve just seen so much ugliness I don’t think I’d mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time.  I’d hoped to have a private word with Adonis, but if that’s the way you want it.
L597599 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Perhaps I did... Until fear turned into panic. That’s when he hit me, and told me he’d killed my brother... “You don’t know what you’ve done,” he said.  “We’re in deep trouble,” he said. “We,” he said. “We.”  We’d both be killed if Friedman ever found out you were working for us, he said. We had to stop you and Friedman meeting...
L597598 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Well, I hope you enjoyed yourself.
L597597 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ I didn’t intend it that way... It just happened.  He heard from Laurence that you’d been back.  That we’d argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldn’t help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...
L597596 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ To get me killed...?
L597595 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ My husband didn’t need to slap me about, Mr Lombard. I volunteered...
L597594 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Perhaps it came to me while dying in a Californian desert because a woman set upon giving her husband a fright got slapped about a little.
L597593 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ You seem to know what you’re talking about.
L597592 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ We all have to like what we become. Cowards included. We achieve this by complicating things a little. But it’s never that complicated really.
L597591 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Should I?
L597590 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Don’t you believe in simplicity?
L597589 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Simplify and damn.
L597588 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Where is that?
L597587 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Here we go again.
L597586 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ What happened? Adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice?
L597585 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Something like that.
L597584 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Something like that?
L597583 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Something like that.
L597582 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child supplier’s being tailed?
L597581 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ I didn’t know who or what had happened to my brother yet, Mr Lombard!
L597580 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ A fright?... Five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright?
L597579 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Maybe I wanted to give my husband a fright.
L597578 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ And you still haven’t told me why you sent me after Friedman.
L597577 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ ...We’re turning in circles.
L597576 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
L597575 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ You splendid bastard...
L597574 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Five years of it. Surely, you’d have divorced him if he disgusted you?
L597573 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ You bastard...
L597572 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Rich. Young. Beautiful. You must at least get a kick out of what he does to his kids.
L597571 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Why do I feel I needn’t answer that?
L597570 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Is there anything to understand?
L597569 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Good.
L597568 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ I don’t.
L597567 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ Think what you like. But don’t presume to understand.
L597566 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ One just doesn’t... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?
L597565 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ I didn’t know my husband and Friedman knew each other. I just...  Do you think we spoke about it? I’ve known for five years. He’s known I’ve known for five years... But not once have we spoken about it. There are things one just doesn’t speak about...
L597564 +++$+++ u8300 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ LOMBARD +++$+++ Why did you send me after Friedman? To atone for your sins?
L597563 +++$+++ u8292 +++$+++ m564 +++$+++ DEBORAH +++$+++ That my brother, my husband and your Mr Friedman were linked, that much I had guessed. But that my husband had killed Leon? No.
