L42688 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ You have a car?  So...  I don't understand why... if you have a car, so then-then wh-why did you say "Do you have a car?"... like you wanted a lift?
L42687 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, no, I have a car.
L42686 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ No, um... I was gonna take a cab.

L42681 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, bye. She laughs and backs up slowly toward the door.
L42680 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Hi. Oh, hi. Hi.
L42679 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Hi. Hi, hi.
L42619 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, I'd say so. You married-
L42618 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Well, no... not just, not only.
L42617 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, that's right. That you really like those New York girls.
L42616 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ La-de-da. If I-if anyone had ever told me that I would be taking out a girl who used expressions like "la- de-da"...
L42615 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, really? Well, la-de-da!
L42614 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, I-I think you're pretty lucky I came along.
L42613 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ He was creepy.
L42605 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Hey, that was last year.
L42604 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.
L42592 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, well, let's see, there was Dennis, from Chippewa Falls High School.
L42591 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Well, then, w-who was?
L42590 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh... no, no, no, no, uh, uh. No.
L42589 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ So, so-well, here's what I wanna know. W-what...  Am I your first big romance?
L42587 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ All right, here! Oh, God, it's disgusting!
L42586 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful... Ooooh, lovely!
L42585 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ All right! All right! All right! All right! Whatta yuh mean? Are yuh gonna take pictures now?
L42584 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Great! Great!  Goddammit!  Ooooh! These are... p-p-p-pick this lobster up. Hold it, please!
L42583 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ You know, I-I think... if I could pry this door off... We shoulda gotten steaks 'cause they don't have legs. They don't run around.
L42582 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Yeah. I'm gonna get my... I'm gonna get my camera.
L42581 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Annie, there's a big lobster behind the refrigerator. I can't get it out. This thing's heavy. Maybe if I put a little dish of butter sauce here with a nutcracker, it will run out the other side, you know what I mean?
L42580 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ All right. All right. All right.
L42579 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Okay, it's in. It's definitely in the pot!
L42578 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, God! Here yuh go! Oh, good, now he'll think-  Aaaah! Okay.
L42577 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Gimme! Gimme! Let me do it! What- what's he think we're gonna do, take him to the movies?
L42576 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I can't! I can't put him in the pot. I can't put a live thing in hot water.
L42575 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Talk to him. You speak shellfish!  Hey, look... put it in the pot.
L42574 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Get him!
L42573 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Look! Look, one crawled behind the refrigerator. It'll turn up in our bed at night.  Will you get outta here with that thing? Jesus!
L42572 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oooh! Here! Here!
L42571 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Don't give it to me. Don't!
L42570 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, all right. All right! It's all right. Here.
L42569 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.
L42568 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for God's sake.
L42567 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Well, maybe we should just call the police. Dial nine-one-one, it's the lobster squad.
L42566 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Stop it! Don't... don't do that! There.
L42565 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Look, I told you it was a... mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house.
L42564 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Alvy, now don't panic. Please.
L42515 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I mean, you've been married before, you know how things can get. You were very hot for Allison at first.
L42514 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ M'm.
L42513 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I know. Well, Alvy, it'll pass, it'll pass, it's just that I'm going through a phase, that's all.
L42512 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ It's always some kind of an excuse. It's- You know, you used to think that I was very sexy. What... When we first started going out, we had sex constantly... We're-we're probably listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.
L42511 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I know, well, it's just that- you know, I mean, I-I-I-I gotta sing tomorrow night, so I have to rest my voice.
L42510 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ What-what-I don't... It's not natural! We're sleeping in a bed together. You know, it's been a long time.
L42509 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I-you know, I don't wanna.
L42508 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ What-what-what-what's the matter?
L42507 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Alvy, I...
L42506 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, 'cause it's supposed to.
L42505 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ That movie makes me feel guilty.
L42504 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ You? You kiddin'?  If the Gestapo would take away your Bloomingdale's charge card, you'd tell 'em everything.
L42503 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture.
L42502 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Boy, those guys in the French Resistance were really brave, you know? Got to listen to Maurice Chevalier sing so much.
L42483 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Okay, I'm very sorry. My sexual problem! Okay, my sexual problem! Huh?
L42482 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.
L42481 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh!
L42474 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Well, he's spitting on my neck! You know, he's spitting on my neck when he talks.
L42473 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Stop it, Alvy!
L42470 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Hey, you... everybody in line at the New Yorker has to know our rate of intercourse?
L42469 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I know- because of our sexual problem, right?
L42468 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ You know what a hostile gesture that is to me?
L42467 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ The alarm clock.
L42466 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ How can you possibly oversleep?
L42465 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I missed my therapy. I overslept.
L42458 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, stop listening to him.
L42457 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I'm-I'm-I'm gonna have a stroke.
L42455 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ H'h, that's a polite word for what you are.
L42454 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Well, I'm sorry, I-I can't... I-I- I've gotta see a picture exactly from the start to the finish, 'cause- 'cause I'm anal.
L42453 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, come on, we've seen it. I'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis.
L42452 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I don't know now. You-you wanna go to another movie?  So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.
L42451 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
L42450 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Hey, can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody, 'cause I get embarrassed.
L42449 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Look, while we're talking we could be inside, you know that?
L42447 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Two hours? No, u-uh, I'm going in. I'm going in.
L42446 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next-
L42445 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ In the middle?  We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish.
L42444 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ No, I'm sorry, I can't do it. We- we've blown it already. I-you know, uh, I-I can't go in in the middle.
L42443 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Two minutes, Alvy.
L42439 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ I'm not getting my period. Jesus, every time anything out of the ordinary happens, you think that I'm getting my period!
L42438 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period.
L42437 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Okay.  Please, I have a headache, all right?
L42436 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
L42435 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
L42434 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Bad mood? I'm standing with the cast of "The Godfather."
L42433 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Alright, alright, I'm in a bad mood, okay?
L42432 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I-i-i-i-it's all right, fellas.  Jesus, what'd you do, come by way of the Panama Canal?
L43057 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Right. Tsch, well, I have to-I have t-o go now, Duane, because I-I'm due back on the planet earth.
L43056 +++$+++ u3689 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ DUANE +++$+++ I tell you this because, as an artist, I think you'll understand. Sometimes when I'm driving... on the road at night... I see two headlights coming toward me. Fast. I have this sudden impulse to turn the wheel quickly, head-on into the oncoming car. I can anticipate the explosion.  The sound of shattering glass. The... flames rising out of the flowing gasoline.
L43055 +++$+++ u3689 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ DUANE +++$+++ Can I confess something?
L43054 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
L43053 +++$+++ u3689 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ DUANE +++$+++ This is my room.
L43052 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?
L43051 +++$+++ u3689 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ DUANE +++$+++ Alvy.
L42374 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Tell the folks where you are today, Donald.
L42373 +++$+++ u3697 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ TEACHER +++$+++ Why couldn't you have been more like Donald?  Now, there was a model boy!
L42370 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I did.
L42369 +++$+++ u3697 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ TEACHER +++$+++ Six-year-old boys don't have girls on their minds.
L42368 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Why, I was just expressing a healthy sexual curiosity.
L42367 +++$+++ u3697 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ TEACHER +++$+++ You should be ashamed of yourself.
L42366 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ What'd I do?
L42365 +++$+++ u3697 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ TEACHER +++$+++ Step up here!
L42364 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ What'd I do?
L42657 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Well, I'm-I'm gonna take another in a series of cold showers.
L42656 +++$+++ u3696 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Where are you going?
L42655 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Jesus!
L42654 +++$+++ u3696 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Oswald and ghosts.
L42653 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Bad?
L42652 +++$+++ u3696 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I have a headache.
L42651 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Oh, you got a headache!
L42650 +++$+++ u3696 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ My head is throbbing.
L42649 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ What-
L42648 +++$+++ u3696 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I can't.
L42647 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Hey, come on, it's quiet now. We can- we can start again.
L42646 +++$+++ u3696 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Okay, okay, my analyst just thinks I'm too tense. Where's the goddamn Valium?
L42645 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Well, I can't li- We can't have this discussion all the time. The country makes me nervous. There's... You got crickets and it-it's quiet... there's no place to walk after dinner, and... uh, there's the screens with the dead moths behind them, and... uh, yuh got the-the Manson family possibly, yuh got Dick and Terry-
L42644 +++$+++ u3696 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ I'm too tense. I need a Valium. My analyst says I should live in the country and not in New York.
L42643 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Jesus, last night it was some guy honking his car horn. I mean, the city can't close down. You know, what-whatta yuh gonna do, h-have 'em shut down the airport, too? No more flights so we can have sex?
L42642 +++$+++ u3696 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Dammit! I was so close.
L42641 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Don't get upset!
L42640 +++$+++ u3696 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Oh, I'm sorry!
L42639 +++$+++ u3696 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ There are people out there from The New Yorker magazine. My God! What would they think?
L42638 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ "Why-why do you always r-reduce my animal urges to psychoanalytic categories?  he said as he removed her brassiere..."
L42637 +++$+++ u3696 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Alvy, don't! You're using sex to express hostility.
L42634 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ What's fascinating is that it's physical. You know, it's one thing about intellectuals, they prove that you can be absolutely brilliant and have no idea what's going on. But on the other hand...  the body doesn't lie, as-as we now know.
L42633 +++$+++ u3696 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Alvy, what is so fascinating about a group of pituitary cases trying to stuff the ball through a hoop?
L42632 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Hey, you wouldn't believe this. Two minutes ago, the Knicks are ahead fourteen points, and now...  they're ahead two points.
L42631 +++$+++ u3696 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Here you are. There's people out there.
L42629 +++$+++ u3696 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ No jokes-these are friends, okay?
L42628 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Oh, really, I heard that Commentary and Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery.
L42627 +++$+++ u3696 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Commentary.
L42626 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I'm so tired of spending evenings making fake insights with people who work for Dysentery.
L42625 +++$+++ u3696 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Is that Paul Goodman? No. And be nice to the host because he's publishing my book. Hi, Doug! Douglas Wyatt. "A Foul-Rag-and-Bone Shop-of- the-Heart."
L42624 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ 'Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on television.
L42623 +++$+++ u3696 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROBIN +++$+++ Why are you so hostile?
L42622 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Yeah, two more chairs and they got a dining-room set.
L43188 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ Uh, oh, I don't know. It might have been Leopold and Loeb.  Hello. Oh, hi... Uh, no, what-what's the matter? What-what-what? You sound terrible... No, what- Sure I- Whatta yuh what kind of an emergency?... No, well, stay there. Stay there, I'll come over right now. I'll come over right now.  Just stay there, I'll come right over.
L43187 +++$+++ u3694 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ REPORTER +++$+++ Who said that?
L43186 +++$+++ u3681 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ALVY +++$+++ I think-I think there's too much burden placed on the orgasm, you know, to make up for empty areas in life.
