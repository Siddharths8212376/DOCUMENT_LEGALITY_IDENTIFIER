L612430 +++$+++ u8420 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ TWA +++$+++ Out of a random selection of 150 locations with 150 possible sightings, there were 146 absolute negatives and four conditionals, most of which occurred in the early familiarization stages of the experiment and can be largely discounted.
L612429 +++$+++ u8416 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ PTO +++$+++ Well?
L612399 +++$+++ u8416 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ PTO +++$+++ You have nothing to fear.  You're safe again.
L612398 +++$+++ u8420 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ TWA +++$+++ How far did you go?  Was it cold?
L612388 +++$+++ u8420 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ TWA +++$+++ No, look!  Three degrees from the central azimuth.
L612387 +++$+++ u8416 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ PTO +++$+++ I can't see him at all.  He's been destroyed.

L612480 +++$+++ u8417 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ SEN +++$+++ What?
L612461 +++$+++ u8417 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ SEN +++$+++ But you can't...you.
L612460 +++$+++ u8419 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ THX +++$+++ Right now.
L612459 +++$+++ u8417 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ SEN +++$+++ When?.....How?
L612458 +++$+++ u8419 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ THX +++$+++ I'm leaving.
L612457 +++$+++ u8417 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ SEN +++$+++ What?
L612456 +++$+++ u8419 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ THX +++$+++ I'm leaving.
L612214 +++$+++ u8419 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ THX +++$+++ Get out of here, Leave me alone.

L612212 +++$+++ u8419 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ THX +++$+++ I'll report you.  It's....
L612211 +++$+++ u8417 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ SEN +++$+++ You know I have a way with the computers.  I can clear myself for any area.....almost.
L612210 +++$+++ u8419 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ THX +++$+++ What are you doing here?  You're not cleared for this area!
L612131 +++$+++ u8419 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ THX +++$+++ I don't feel well.
L612130 +++$+++ u8417 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ SEN +++$+++ I won't have another mate like ONA.  You rate very high in sanitation.  I've checked.  In fact, I am surprised that you were ever matched with LUH.  Her ratings are very erratic - you know what I mean.  We'll be happy.
L612128 +++$+++ u8417 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ SEN +++$+++ Don't say that.  You look...  You're not well.
L612127 +++$+++ u8419 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ THX +++$+++ You're in violation.
L612126 +++$+++ u8417 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ SEN +++$+++ We had a long talk and she agreed that it would be a good idea for you to switch.  She felt that you had not been accurately mated to her in the first place... You're upsetting yourself.  Would you like something?
L612125 +++$+++ u8419 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ THX +++$+++ I don't understand. Living....selection is computed. You can't... What have you done to LUH?  She was here..
L612124 +++$+++ u8417 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ SEN +++$+++ It will be good for both of us. I've got it all arranged.
L612123 +++$+++ u8419 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ THX +++$+++ Where's LUH?
L612122 +++$+++ u8417 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ SEN +++$+++ I want you for my roommate.

L612112 +++$+++ u8417 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ SEN +++$+++ I'm sure it's warmer in her than outside, though.  I haven't been out yet, but it usually is...the control is fouled... 
L612638 +++$+++ u8419 +++$+++ m571 +++$+++ THX +++$+++ I thought of something.....

L613018 +++$+++ u8428 +++$+++ m572 +++$+++ REILLY +++$+++ I know. I was working a drug ring, deep cover. Played the part too well. When they pulled me out, I wasn't a cop anymore. My fiance had dumped me. Next thing I knew, I was out here on the street, doped up, auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me, cleaned me up, gave me a second chance. He promised Captain Winters he'd look out for me.
