L640787 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ No, I mean the suitcases. We can't bury them in suticases.
L640786 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ We've already done this.
L640785 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ We can't do this.
L640784 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ What?
L640783 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Wait. Wait a minute.
L640782 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I'm not wrecking the transmission!
L640781 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Sun rises at 5:52.
L640738 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ The reality is, you take away the horror of this situation, take away the tragedy of the death, take away the moral and ethical implications of all the crap you have had conditioned, beaten, into your head since grade one. What are we left with? What? A 115 lb. problem. 115 lbs. that must be moved from point A to point B. Now, a straight line in the shortest distance but we are denied the luxury of a visible straight line. But that line exists and I see it.I see that line. Trust me. Adam. Trust me...I can take care of this.
L640737 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Have you ever done this before?
L640736 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works.
L640735 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ What about the blood?
L640734 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear.
L640733 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
L640732 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car...Done.
L640719 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ She's got bondage burns on her wrists. There's blow all over the room, Moore looks like he went at it with a mountain lion. This room looks like the Manson Family stayed here a month. Micheal goes down, we all go down.
L640718 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ So I didn't fucking do it!
L640717 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Her fucking head was caved in.
L640712 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ It's a marble floor, we can clean it up.
L640711 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Her blood is all over the bathroom. I'd say that's a bit of a DNA problem.
L640708 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Nobody knows she's here. I called her personally. Nobody knows.
L640707 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Have you completely lost your mind? So you get her out of here. So you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone?
L640706 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ We can do this. We can get her out of here.
L640705 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ You don't just casually walk out of a Vegas Casino with a dead woman.
L640702 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Sure, why not.
L640701 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Bury her out in the desert.
L640698 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ What were we doing officer? Why didn't we help her? Well...we're all a bit high, you know, bachelor party, that kind of thing. Fisher here is getting married in three days...Beautiful wife ...he didn't have anything at all to do with it...It was all Micheal here... just Micheal...
L640697 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I'm calling the police.
L640696 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Just giving the facts.
L640695 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Just stop.
L640694 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ There's more.
L640693 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Stop it!
L640689 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Yes sir, there sure is an option here. There are always options.
L640688 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ That is not an "option." There is no multiple choice here.
L640687 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Call the police. Okay, that's one option.
L640686 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.
L640685 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Stop it! Listen to me. Let's just take a second here and take hold of the situation, OK? Let's just review our options here.
L640680 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ You're a lying deviant. What did you do?!
L640679 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Are you sure this was an accident?
L640676 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Her head's bashed in and her heart isn't beating.
L640675 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First...are we sure she's dead?
L640674 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Everybody shut up. LISTEN TO ME!
L640665 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Why?
L640664 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ We have to call the ambulance.
L640663 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Why?  Why? She's dead. Why are you calling an ambulance?
L640662 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Calling the ambulance.
L640661 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Just wait a second. Wait one second. Okay. What are you doing?
L640660 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I'm calling the ambulance.
L640659 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ What do you think you are doing?
L640658 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L640657 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ What are you doing?
L640656 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ What?
L640655 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Wait!
L640648 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ You don't know what you're doing.
L640647 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ She's got no fucking pulse.
L640551 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life.
L640550 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ More.
L640545 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ I set up Fisher with the broker that found his house. Took care of that one, didn't I?  Prison Communications.
L640544 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ You can't keep bringing up Starbucks. That was your only real hit in like 75 tries.
L640543 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ One idea that if you had fucking listened to, you would each be worth approximately 15 million dollars.
L640524 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ You want to hear me out?
L640523 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Don't even start.
L640520 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I'm not getting a ticket.
L640519 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Four hours and fifteen minutes. I can make Vegas in 3 and change.
L640959 +++$+++ u8774 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ What do you mean? It's it's a Goddamn Mini-Mart?!
L640958 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ There is no candy!
L640957 +++$+++ u8774 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Where's the candy?
L640944 +++$+++ u8774 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ They're screaming like monsters and it's giving me a headache. Go get some fucking Starbursts.
L640943 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Later.
L640942 +++$+++ u8774 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ They're screaming for Starbursts.
L640941 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ What?
L640940 +++$+++ u8774 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Honey, go in there and get some Starbursts.
L640930 +++$+++ u8774 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ They're singing.
L640929 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ They're driving me nuts!
L640928 +++$+++ u8774 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Don't snap at them!
L640965 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Where's the bathroom?
L640964 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I got you.
L640963 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull, Mike Tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack...
L640962 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?
L640961 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Have you thought about what I said?
L640852 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ We are. We go to the police. We tell them the truth. Now. Before they find out. Now. We save ourselves.
L640851 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I don't think so.
L640850 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent.
L640849 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ What.
L640848 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I want you to hear me out.
L640799 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ It has to be done.
L640798 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ No way.
L640652 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ What happened? Oh my God...
L640651 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Either side you idiot. I'm calling 911.
L640617 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Y'see? That's the real point here. That's what I'm driving for, when the big storm comes and knocks down all the forests and the rocks fall down and the leave's are bare. What's left? The little trees, the little fellas that the storm didn't see. The tiny little...
L640616 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I know...
L640615 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ If anything ever happens to me...
L640614 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I know and I'm honored...
L640613 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I tell mine that they're little men. I tell them they're strong. They make me feel joy. I let 'em know. So they really know that I need them just as much. You know. Just as much man. And you know, you're their godfather...
L640609 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Don't eyeball your kids.
L640608 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I won't do it.
L640607 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Don't ever stare him down.
L640606 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ The bucks gonna stop right here.  If my son doesn't know the six New England states, if he has trouble with geography, I won't stick it in his face. I'll help the little guy. I'll put him in the car and take him out there. I'll take him to Maine for a big Lobster dinner, go skiing in Vermont, hot dogs at Yankee Stadium...I won't stare him down.
L640592 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Then fuck what your father said, cause I'm gonna tell you right now...You'll know what it's all about, why you got married and why you love her when you wake up at three in the morning, and the streetlight's coming through the window and it's just catching a corner of her face, like a sleeping angel. And her hair smells sweet and she's your's. She's all your's. Do you see where I'm going here?
L640591 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ No. I think it's fucked.
L640590 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ Are you solid with that?
L640589 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Right! That's exactly what I'm saying. My father said, first of all, I'm your father not your friend. I'm your father.
L640588 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ No. No. No. It's what my father said to me. He said it and he meant it... He said to me...He said, Adam, he said...He told me and I heard him... he said...  Hell he said so many Goddamn things I can't remember everything he said for Christsake.
L640555 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ They've all been real times. And as you prepare to enter into a new phase of life, as you prepare for new roles; father, husband, teacher, you will, as I have, come to except the letting go of of old ways. Soon, the mellowing will begin...
L640554 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Real times.
L640542 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ No...we want padded chairs...okay?
L640541 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ That's one idea.
L640454 +++$+++ u8768 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ ADAM +++$+++ I know you'll be.  Three hours.
L640453 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ We'll be ready Adam.
L641236 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Tomorrow.  We are getting married tomorrow.
L641235 +++$+++ u8769 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BARRY MORRIS +++$+++ So. When is the wedding.
L641228 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ So where's that leave us?
L641227 +++$+++ u8769 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BARRY MORRIS +++$+++ And a house. Valued at 350 thousand.
L641226 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Well, oh...
L641225 +++$+++ u8769 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BARRY MORRIS +++$+++ Actually, no. Adam was switching to a Whole Life Policy, but re-scheduled his medical exam...and failed to make his last payment...so his Term Life lapsed. So it's value is null and void.  Now he did have a pension account, worth another 150 thousand.
L641221 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ What does that mean?
L641220 +++$+++ u8769 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BARRY MORRIS +++$+++ Yes money. Adam had a five hundred dollar Term Life Insurance Policy.
L641219 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Money?
L641214 +++$+++ u8769 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BARRY MORRIS +++$+++ There's more.
L641213 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ My god.
L641136 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Lois please.
L641135 +++$+++ u8774 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ I will call the police right now if I don't start getting some answers.
L641134 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ He's upset about Adam. We're all upset.
L641130 +++$+++ u8774 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Shut up Boyd! Micheal?
L641129 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing...
L641128 +++$+++ u8774 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Micheal? Do you have something to tell me?
L641124 +++$+++ u8774 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ I don't want to hear it from the liar. Stick a plug in it Boyd. Fisher? What happened in Vegas?
L641123 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Nothing happened in Vegas.
L641122 +++$+++ u8774 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ You're a liar. I want to know what happened in Vegas.
L641121 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from...
L641120 +++$+++ u8774 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Don't sweet lip me.
L641119 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L640766 +++$+++ u8779 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ RALPH +++$+++ I'm just gonna let her know I'm here.
L640765 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ She's in there!
L640763 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Great. Fine. Perfect.
L640762 +++$+++ u8779 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ RALPH +++$+++ Is everything okay?
L640761 +++$+++ u8779 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ RALPH +++$+++ Sweet deal.
L640760 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ That's right.
L640759 +++$+++ u8779 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ RALPH +++$+++ She's still working?
L640758 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ She's in the bathroom...she's still working.
L640757 +++$+++ u8779 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ RALPH +++$+++ Sin City. Devil's Playground. The Black Bitch. All day every day.  Where's Tina?
L640756 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ That's right.
L640755 +++$+++ u8779 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ RALPH +++$+++ Doing the bachelor party thing?
L640754 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Yup.
L640751 +++$+++ u8779 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ RALPH +++$+++ The groom?
L640750 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Who?
L640749 +++$+++ u8779 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ RALPH +++$+++ So who's the lucky guy?
L640748 +++$+++ u8779 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ RALPH +++$+++ Okay. Hi.
L640746 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ She's here. She's just...Hold on a second.
L640745 +++$+++ u8779 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ RALPH +++$+++ Where is she?
L640744 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ She's not here.
L640743 +++$+++ u8779 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ RALPH +++$+++ I'm with Tina. Is she there?
L640742 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ What?
L640741 +++$+++ u8779 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ RALPH +++$+++ Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there?
L640740 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ What is it?
L641204 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ He's fine. Okay Mikey, let's go.  You guys stay here.
L641203 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ He's too drunk.
L641114 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Give me two more.
L641113 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ He just had two.
L641097 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ What is her disposition?
L641096 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ What's goosed?
L641080 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ I'm not talking to you?
L641079 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ What's your fucking point?
L640857 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ Today is the best day of the rest of our lives.
L640856 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ The past is the past. Today is the beginning of the rest of our lives.
L640804 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ Here's his head.
L640803 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ I got her arm.
L640704 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ We can take her out to Red Rock. Find some quiet place...and put her in the ground.
L640703 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ He's right.
L640650 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ Left side.
L640649 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Where do you look? What side of the neck?
L640561 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Jack Kerouback, Herman Melville, Henry Miller and Hunter S. Thompson. I dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing. So from sun set to sun rise, let me be heard...
L640560 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ Keith Richards, Dean Martin...
L640557 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ Not tonight.
L640556 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ But not tonight.
L640547 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Fine. Don't come crying to Boyd. No sir.
L640546 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ I don't think so Boyd.
L640538 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ That's the whole point. They rarely work out. But on occasion they do. And when they do, they do big.
L640537 +++$+++ u8777 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MOORE +++$+++ Your investment ideas never work out.
