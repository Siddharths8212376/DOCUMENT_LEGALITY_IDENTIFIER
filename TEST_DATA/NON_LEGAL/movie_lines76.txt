L86903 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Don't see generosity much these days. Everything always got a catch. Guess I'm tryin' to say... thank you.

L86357 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ You collar that dog, boy. I ain't gonna hurt nobody. Just wanted to know who she was.
L86356 +++$+++ u519 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ TEHRONNE +++$+++ See, that girl is in my favor. You heard me, nigga? You fuck with her rough, and you got me to fuck wit.
L86355 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Now, hold up.
L86354 +++$+++ u519 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ TEHRONNE +++$+++ That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
L86353 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ She like it rough? You like beatin' on her?
L86352 +++$+++ u519 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ TEHRONNE +++$+++ She got a spare minute she'll snatch up anyone... but me, I'm different. Sometimes she need the real deal, so she call me up. Girl got an itch. You know... what's a nigga to do?
L86351 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Why you say that?
L86350 +++$+++ u519 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ TEHRONNE +++$+++ Shit. Who hasn't?

L86348 +++$+++ u519 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ TEHRONNE +++$+++ I don't pimp that.  You talkin' about who I think you talkin' about, you mean Rae. Rae Doole. Sexy little split tail, like you say. I can't hook you up with that. I got two girls. One ain't in town, the other one pregnant. So... you on your own.
L86347 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Huh?
L86346 +++$+++ u519 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ TEHRONNE +++$+++ That ain't up to me to hook you up. Naw what I mean? She her own, you know?
L86345 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Been years since I fooled with that.  You know a white girl? Dirty blond hair, split down the middle like?
L86344 +++$+++ u519 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ TEHRONNE +++$+++ You need some weed?
L86343 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Word wit'cha. In private.
L86342 +++$+++ u519 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ TEHRONNE +++$+++ Do you call it a game when only one man win each time? I think you call it a damn shame.
L86932 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ I do.
L86931 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.  Who gives this girl in marriage?
L86792 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ I don't know, but I been told, them Georgia women sweet jelly roll.
L86791 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ Yeah, you know you home, old man. You just walked through the door.

L86674 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ Then what?
L86673 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Not like that.
L86672 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ You believe He wants this? A woman chained to ya radiator?
L86671 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ I'm dealin' with what God put before me.
L86670 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ Gotta get that chain off her, Laz. Somethin' like this gets out, you could land in a heap of trouble.
L86622 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Ask the chef.
L86621 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ Mm. MM. Now these eggs got some kick to it. What'chu got in this?
L86618 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ This all looks wonderful.

L86616 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ Pass them potatoes, Lincoln.
L86573 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ One thing at a time, Laz.
L86572 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ You treat folks special when they company. It's just supper, R.L., shit.
L86571 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?

L86567 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Why don't you go'on and ask her. She need to talk wit somebody with sense. Folks been ruttin' and beatin' on this gal all her days. And this is how I'm handling it.
L86566 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ What's that chain around her for?
L86565 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby.
L86564 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ You say she was beat on. You call the sheriff on that?
L86563 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this.
L86562 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ Laz, I know about that girl.  Good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you know.  Oh, Laz. She's had a mess of crabs and them STD's. What'chu thinking?
L86561 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I found her beat. Left for dead. So I brung her home.
L86560 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ A naked woman, chained in ya house?
L86559 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done.
L86558 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ Are you outta ya GODDAMN MIND?
L86552 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ I told you to TURN BACK!
L86551 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ Or what?
L86550 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say...
L86549 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ Ain't gonna be moved?
L86548 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ You ain't gonna talk me outta shit no more. I got my mind made up and I ain't gonna be moved on this.
L86546 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ You sayin' that gun's for me if I don't?
L86545 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time.
L86544 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ Goin' dove huntin'?
L86543 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ Somethin' wrong with ya phone? Been callin' the last few days.
L86542 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ This ain't got nothin' to do with that woman. Just don't want nobody around me now.
L86541 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ You get a call from Rose?
L86540 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ R.L., you gonna have to get on. I can't have nobody round my place.
L86539 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ Why's his britches round his knees?
L86538 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ He's fine. Just had a bad fall.
L86537 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ Was that Lincoln James I seen run off?
L86300 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ He knows where ya at. Just answer the door if he come knockin'.
L86299 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Don't know if God wanna see me.
L86298 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ I think you did alright by God under the circumstances.  Your people are here for you, Laz. This is your home. No shame in showing your face.
L86297 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ You gonna preach 'bout turnin' the other cheek?
L86296 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ Bojo called. Said you got to see your brother at the long end of a broken bottle.
L86135 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ I didn't start this, R.L.
L86134 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ That kind of talk is between us. Don't you go in there with that shit on your tongue.
L86133 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ I never laid a hand on her in anger. Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'. But this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her.
L86132 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ You ain't gonna make a fuss, are you?  Nothing a man can do when a woman make up her mind.
L86620 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Well, dig in, son. Got plenty to eat.
L86619 +++$+++ u512 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LINCOLN +++$+++ I skipped lunch.
L86583 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ You struck some gold, didn't ya?
L86582 +++$+++ u512 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LINCOLN +++$+++ Yes'sir.
L86581 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ So...  That your first time?
L86580 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ My mouth is shut, boy. And that's how we gonna keep it. Don't go braggin' to ya buddies, ya heard me?
L86579 +++$+++ u512 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LINCOLN +++$+++ Please don't tell my daddy.
L86578 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ That's between her and me. It's private. And I don't want you goin' off and tellin' ya daddy.
L86577 +++$+++ u512 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LINCOLN +++$+++ Why she got a chain on her?
L86576 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ What happened in there... that won't your fault. Ain't a young man alive could keep they britches on with that girl being in heat like she is.
L86199 +++$+++ u512 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LINCOLN +++$+++ Naw... I got it, Mr. Lazarus.  You wanna tip me, best do it in butter beans. Momma say she need a bag 'a yours, none of that store-bought junk. That's what she said.
L86198 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Keep the change on that.
L86197 +++$+++ u512 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LINCOLN +++$+++ Yes'sir.
L86196 +++$+++ u511 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LAZARUS +++$+++ Get me ten bags of mulch.
L86195 +++$+++ u512 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ LINCOLN +++$+++ You won't at the square this mornin'.
L86885 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ Rae, look at Ronnie. And tell him how you feel.
L86884 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ It starts like this... fire... that spreads. Starts in my head. Then moves to my stomach. Then it goes lower. I can stop it sometimes but mostly I just jump on and ride it out... then everything'll go back to normal, you know. Only thing ever took that feeling away was... was... when I met Ronnie.  Cuz I love him so much. He's all I got in my life that's special. And I like taking care of him and helping him when he gets nervous. When I can do that for him... it's like I'm givin' somethin' of myself that I haven't givin' nobody else.
L86596 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ I'm gonna tell you somethin', and it's just gonna be between you and me.  I think folks carry on about heaven too much. Like it's some all-you-can- eat buffet up in the clouds. And folks just gonna do as they're told so they can eat what they want behind some pearly gates. I can go to Shoney's for that.
L86595 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who... do what they want and then... switch.
L86594 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ What's on your mind?
L86593 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
L86592 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ You could put it that way.
L86591 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Can I ask you a question?  People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if you want not to go to hell. That you say sorry for all you done and... and Jesus would let you go on to heaven.
L86590 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ That's right.
L86589 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ You a preacher?
L86588 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ So he got it into his head that the only thing gonna keep you from endin' up bleedin' on the side of the road again, without a stitch of clothing on is...  You think he's crazy for thinkin' that?
L86587 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me.
L86586 +++$+++ u514 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ R.L. +++$+++ I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this?
L86585 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Thank you.
L86851 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Ronnie...
L86850 +++$+++ u516 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Goddamn it, I ask you a question, you better answer it, or I'm gonna blast a hole in ya!
L86849 +++$+++ u516 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Did 'ya have fun with her? Sweet as a peach, I bet. Huh? Huh?
L86848 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Ronnie. Please, baby...
L86847 +++$+++ u516 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Ain't been a week and you already some nigger's whore? Gill told me. Told me how you and he... you and everybody...
L86826 +++$+++ u516 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ Yeah, I do.
L86825 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ I feel better. Do you?
L86821 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ All them people shoutin' your name like they were doing tonight! Shit! That arm you got'll get'chu on a box of cereal...
L86820 +++$+++ u516 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ I'm a what?
L86819 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Holy shit, Ronnie!  You're a fuckin' rock star.
L86818 +++$+++ u516 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ What?
L86817 +++$+++ u515 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RAE +++$+++ Holy shit!
L86816 +++$+++ u516 +++$+++ m32 +++$+++ RONNIE +++$+++ No. I just got a messed up stomach.
