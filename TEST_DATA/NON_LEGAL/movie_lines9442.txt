L587987 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ You don't have a boyfriend or anyone... you know... like that?
L587985 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Oh, well... I guess you... in high school, you were a pretty good first baseman.  And we were on the debate team together.  But... I think you were gonna run the Bijou. You were brought up there, and you loved it so much.  And I think you knew how much the town needed a place like that.
L587984 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ What did... what did I want to be?
L587983 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.
L587982 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Have you always wanted to be a lawyer?
L587981 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Sorry.  You don't know how many times I've heard that.  "A lady lawyer?  Are you crazy?"  Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man.  Or better, in fact.
L587980 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Whoa.
L587979 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ And why not?
L587978 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ So, you're really gonna be a lawyer?
L587977 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ After they commissioned it, no one could ever agree on where to put it.  The Methodists wanted it in front of the Methodist Church, the Presbyterians wanted it in front of the Presbyterian Church, the city council wanted it in the lobby of City Hall.  Everyone finally got tired of the fighting.  So they stuck it down here.
L587976 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ It doesn't seem right, this being down here.  It ought to be where people can see it.
L587975 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Right here.  "Albert Lucas Trumbo." And all the others.  I knew them all.  So did you.  We went to school with most of them.
L587973 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Through the door.  It comes apart.
L587972 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ How'd they get it inside?
L587971 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Of course, there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here.
L587969 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Be a gentleman.  You have to help me down.
L587968 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Why me?
L587967 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ You first.
L587966 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ You must not remember anything. Come on.
L587965 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ City hall?
L587963 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Well... where can we go?
L587962 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Then why do I feel like we're still being shadowed?
L587956 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Go on home, folks.  And thanks for the welcome.
L587955 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ You can all go home, now.  He's not going anywhere.
L587954 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I did?  Huh!
L587953 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Yeah, a little.  I think you grew an inch or so.  And you've lost weight.
L587952 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I do?
L587951 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ You look... different.
L587950 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Me too.
L587949 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time.
L587948 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ What.
L587944 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I've seen you before.  Your picture...
L587943 +++$+++ u3145 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ADELE +++$+++ Do you... remember me?
L588437 +++$+++ u3146 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ Well, then, as what did you go?
L588436 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ That's not a contradiction at all, sir.  I went to the meeting, but I didn't go as a member.
L588435 +++$+++ u3146 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ Yet you're contradicting yourself. You earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party-run organization, yet you just said, under oath, that you were not now -- nor ever -- a member of the communist party.
L588434 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ I'm not refuting anything.
L588433 +++$+++ u3146 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
L588432 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ No, sir.
L588431 +++$+++ u3146 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the communist party?
L588427 +++$+++ u3146 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ Mr. Chairman, the witness is being non-responsive...
L588426 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college.  I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for?
L588425 +++$+++ u3146 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ All right, Mr. Appleton.  That was what you knew then.  What do you know now?
L588422 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Well, if you'd seen Miss Angstrom...
L588421 +++$+++ u3146 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ Are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl?
L588420 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Well, that's what I knew then.  Or who I knew, I should say.  You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom.  I went to the meeting to impress her.
L588419 +++$+++ u3146 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ We see it.  For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom."  What's the point of this?
L588418 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there.
L588417 +++$+++ u3146 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ Start with what you knew then.
L588416 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what I knew then, or do you want to know what I know now?  They're two different things?
L588415 +++$+++ u3146 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ Mr. Appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club?"
L588414 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Yes it does.
L588413 +++$+++ u3146 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there?
L588412 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Yes... yes, I do.
L588411 +++$+++ u3146 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ Good.  Good.  Now, I hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance roster for the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club" of the University of California, Los Angeles, dated October 11, 1935.  A copy of this paper is before you, Mr. Appleton. Do you recognize it?
L588410 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Mr. Clyde, I remember everything.
L588409 +++$+++ u3146 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ I'm interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past, or if they've been conveniently "blotted out" as a result of your "accident."
L588408 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Sir, are you referring to the fact that I was suffering from amnesia, and I've since recovered my memory?
L588405 +++$+++ u3146 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ And what is the state of your memory now?
L588404 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Yes.
L588403 +++$+++ u3146 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ Anyone who reads the newspaper is quite familiar with your... "accident," Mr. Appleton.  An accident which, conveniently, came hard upon your dismissal from United Pictures.  Tell us, this "accident" of yours, are we given to understand that it affected your memory?
L588402 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Yes sir.  But I didn't go to Lawson to run The Bijou, that was... that was something that just happened. You see, I was involved in an accident in Lawson, and I spent some time recovering there.
L588401 +++$+++ u3146 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ Now, I see that you've been running a movie theater in Lawson called "The Bijou," is that also true?
L588400 +++$+++ u3146 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ Well, I'm sure we're all glad to see you came through it all right.
L588399 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L588398 +++$+++ u3146 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ Yes, I see that Private Trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead.  I also see that you were posted stateside during the war.  Fort Dix?
L588397 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Mr. Clyde you're twisting things around.  I wasn't masquerading. Luke Trumbo... Luke was a good man who gave his life for his country. I just... happen to look a little bit like him.  That's all.
L588396 +++$+++ u3146 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ Is that because you were masquerading as Luke Trumbo while you were in Lawson?
L588395 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Luke Trumbo?  We never met.  But I'd like to think I know him.
L588394 +++$+++ u3146 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ CLYDE +++$+++ Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
L588393 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Sir, that is true.
L588458 +++$+++ u3147 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Mr. Appleton, you will...
L588457 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Mr. Chairman... there's... another Amendment... that I'd like to invoke at this time, but it's not the Fifth Amendment.  I wonder if you're familiar with it.
L588456 +++$+++ u3147 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Go ahead, son.
L588455 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ I... I need a drink of water.
L588454 +++$+++ u3147 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton?
L588443 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ I'm sorry, sir, I have no intention of making light of this committee. And I have no intention of incurring your wrath, Mr. Chairman. I have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath. They've sent me letters from jail.
L588442 +++$+++ u3147 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Mr. Appleton, you are making light of a legally constituted committee of the United States Congress. Believe you me, you do not want to incur our wrath.
L588439 +++$+++ u3147 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ The witness need not be hesitant to say anything before this committee, as long as it's the truth.
L588438 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ I'm a little hesitant to say.
L588386 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Um... no.  I don't have a statement at this time.
L588385 +++$+++ u3147 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Yes.  A prepared statement.
L588384 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ A statement?
L588383 +++$+++ u3147 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Now, we're informed that you have a statement you'd like to read, is that correct?
L588382 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.
L588381 +++$+++ u3147 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr. Appleton.  We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee?
L588380 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Peter Kenneth Appleton.  Hollywood, California.
L588379 +++$+++ u3147 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.
L588378 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ I do.
L588377 +++$+++ u3147 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the United States House of Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?
L587810 +++$+++ u3148 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ELDRIDGE +++$+++ Don't mention it.  Welcome home, Luke.
L587809 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Thanks for the lift, Cecil.
L587808 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Well, son, you're home!
L587807 +++$+++ u3148 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ELDRIDGE +++$+++ Here we are.
L587789 +++$+++ u3148 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ELDRIDGE +++$+++ Ben, when's Delly due back?
L587788 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Only one in town.  Get in, son.
L587757 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Listen to me!  The young man in there...
L587756 +++$+++ u3148 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ELDRIDGE +++$+++ Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office?
L587755 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Cecil!  Cecil, there's a young man in there...
L587791 +++$+++ u3148 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ELDRIDGE +++$+++ Exactly.  Break it to her gently.
L587790 +++$+++ u3152 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LARDNER +++$+++ Tomorrow afternoon...  ... oh my god...
L587782 +++$+++ u3148 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ELDRIDGE +++$+++ Give the man a hug, boy!  That's your father!
L587781 +++$+++ u3152 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LARDNER +++$+++ Mother o'god...
L587779 +++$+++ u3148 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ELDRIDGE +++$+++ Shhhhhh.
L587778 +++$+++ u3152 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LARDNER +++$+++ Are you saying that he's...
L587776 +++$+++ u3152 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LARDNER +++$+++ By all means.
L587775 +++$+++ u3148 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ELDRIDGE +++$+++ Doc, with your permission, I want to bring someone in here.  Maybe it'll jar this young man's memory.
L587763 +++$+++ u3148 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ELDRIDGE +++$+++ What I'm thinkin' is we got us one a'two things here.  A mystery or a damn miracle.  And by god I can't tell which.  Boy, you say you have no idea who you are?  That right?
L587762 +++$+++ u3152 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LARDNER +++$+++ No identification at all.  What're you thinkin', Cecil?
L587761 +++$+++ u3148 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ELDRIDGE +++$+++ No wallet, huh?
L588276 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ I don't know what else to tell you. I wasn't hiding out.  I hit my head and I didn't remember anything until a few days ago.
L588275 +++$+++ u3148 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ELDRIDGE +++$+++ Well, no, but these gentlemen would like to get some answers...
L587785 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ The Bijou?
L587784 +++$+++ u3148 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ELDRIDGE +++$+++ C'mon, I'll give you two a lift back to the Bijou.
L587774 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ I remember the picture... but I don't remember where I saw it.
L587773 +++$+++ u3148 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ELDRIDGE +++$+++ Or the Bijou.  Either one.
L587772 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ "It's a Wonderful Life?"
L587771 +++$+++ u3148 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ELDRIDGE +++$+++ The Jimmy Stewart picture?  I remember that one.  Saw it over at the Bijou.  So, you remember that, huh?
L587770 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ "It's a Wonderful Life."
L587769 +++$+++ u3148 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ELDRIDGE +++$+++ What's that?
L587768 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Well, this place sorta reminds me of something.
L587767 +++$+++ u3148 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ELDRIDGE +++$+++ But what?
L587766 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ No.  But...
L587765 +++$+++ u3148 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ ELDRIDGE +++$+++ You ever been in this town before, to your knowledge?
L587764 +++$+++ u3157 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ PETE +++$+++ Yes.
L588185 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Mr. Fitts, with all due respect, I think Lawson needs the Bijou a bit more than it needs a super market. And I think Lawson deserves the Bijou.  There's not a lot that can be done to help us get past the pain we've all felt...
L588184 +++$+++ u3149 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ FITTS +++$+++ So... you do intend to fix the place up after all?
L588153 +++$+++ u3149 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ FITTS +++$+++ You think it over.  No reason to risk financial ruin for the sake of a crumbling old building.
L588152 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ A super market.  Huh.
L588151 +++$+++ u3149 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ FITTS +++$+++ The days of the storefront grocery are numbered.  I plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket.
L588150 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...?
L588149 +++$+++ u3149 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ FITTS +++$+++ Luke, I'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation. I'll come to the point.  I want to buy the property, and I'm prepared to offer six-thousand dollars for it.  And that's just for the property, mind you.  If you want, I'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has, and you keep those proceeds.  I just want the land.
L588148 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Well, he loves the place.  It's his home.
L588147 +++$+++ u3149 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ FITTS +++$+++ I can only imagine.  You know, I spoke with your Dad last year about maybe taking the Bijou off his hands.  I don't think he gave it very much thought.
L588146 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot of work.
L588145 +++$+++ u3149 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ FITTS +++$+++ And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou.
L588144 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Thanks.
L588143 +++$+++ u3149 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ FITTS +++$+++ Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back.
L588142 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Good to meet you.  Again.
L588141 +++$+++ u3149 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ FITTS +++$+++ Luke, you probably don't remember me, Roscoe Fitts, I'm the grocer here in town.
L588247 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Don't tell me, I know about these things.  I've seen it before.  It's all right.  It's... all right. You're here.  Oh, God, I love you, son.
L588246 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ You're not going anywhere, Harry.
L588245 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I'm not happy about this, mind you, but if I have to go, at least I'm going in my own bed, the same bed my Lily died in, and... knowing that my son is alive.  That's not too shabby, is it?
L588244 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Vultures...
L588243 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ A few.
L588242 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Anybody take it?
L588241 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I know.  Everyone went home.  We offered them refunds.
L588240 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Did you fix the damn film?  It broke in the last reel.
L588239 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Did I what?
L588238 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Did you... did you...
L588237 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I'm here.
L588231 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I know, I know... keep still.
L588230 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ The film broke...
L588229 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Jesus...
L588165 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Six-thirty.  I thought we'd get an early start.
L588164 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Luke... what time is it?
L588162 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You know, since you've been back, that's the first time you've called me "Dad."
L588161 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ ... what?
L588160 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Ha!
L588159 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Dad, I...
L588158 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Well, son, I wish I could've shown you more, but this is all that's left.  Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago. Nineteen twenty-five, to be exact...
L588157 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Yes.
L588156 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Beautiful, wasn't it?
L588134 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Oh, no, I...
L588133 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Why don't you two get out there and dance?
L588050 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ They're...
L588049 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ And you have sixty-eight dollars and thirty-seven cents in the bank. Your only source of income are my veteran's death benefit of forty dollars a month, to which you're no longer entitled since I'm alive, and these ten dollar a month cash deposits you make.  What are those?
L588046 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Between a new screen, paint, plumbing for the concession stand, and about a hundred other repairs around the theater... it's going to cost at least nine hundred dollars to get the Bijou into shape to open up.
L588045 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Yes?
L588044 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Well...
L587960 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Goodnight, son.  'Night, Delly.
L587959 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ You bet.
L587958 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
L587957 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ I'll be home in a little while, Harry.  Don't wait up.
L587924 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Oh, hi Cue... Carl.  Sorry.
L587923 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Carl.  Friend of yours from high school.  Everybody calls him "Cueball."
L587911 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ ... Ernie.
L587910 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Ernie.
L587881 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Son, I think you loved the Bijou even more than I did.  You've got to remember that.  You've got to.
L587880 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ But I...
L587870 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I know it's hard to believe, son, but this place, this little place this wasn't a theater then, this was a palace!  Any man, woman, child, you, me, it didn't matter, you bought your ticket and you walked in and you...
L587869 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Yeah, I know, but poultry...?
L587868 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Forty-two was a lean year around here.  The war had just started... you were gone less than a month... and we were coming off a bit of a drought as I recall.  Not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket, and a chicken's as good as money if you ask me.  At that time, it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures.
L587867 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ "one fryer and two-dozen eggs?"
L587866 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Yes?
L587865 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ "Eight p.m. showtime, ninety-six admissions, receipts including concessions, $84.75... plus one fryer and two-dozen eggs."
L587864 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Gary Cooper.  And Barbara Stanwyck. Yowsa.
L587863 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ "February 10, 1942.  Picture 'Ball of Fire.'"
L587862 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Well, I'm the first one to admit that I don't know anything about bookkeeping, but there are some very interesting things in here.
L587861 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ No, your mother did, then I did after she passed.
L587860 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Um... Harry?  Did I ever keep the books here?
L587849 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ You know, I hate to bring this up, but screens and uniforms and paint and repairs are going to take money, which I'm willing to bet none of us has.
L587848 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ I promised him a new uniform when we re-opened.  And you'll get one, too.
L587837 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Six-thirty.  I thought we'd get an early start.
L587836 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Oh.  What... what time is it?
L587835 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ This is the staff of the Bijou.
L587834 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Who... are they?
L587833 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ They couldn't wait to see you.
L587826 +++$+++ u3150 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ HARRY +++$+++ Well, yes, that she was.  She certainly made this place a home.
L587825 +++$+++ u3154 +++$+++ m207 +++$+++ LUKE +++$+++ Mother.  She's beautiful.
