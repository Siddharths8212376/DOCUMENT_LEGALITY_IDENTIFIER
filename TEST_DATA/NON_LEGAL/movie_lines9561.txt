L51686 +++$+++ u3782 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ HEAD WAITER +++$+++ Good evening.
L51378 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ I'll be able to keep my apartment and studio, won't I?...  Just tell me.
L51377 +++$+++ u3783 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Frank loves you. You know that... but I've spoken to him and he feels that --  -- as a businessman, with limited resources...
L51375 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Well, I can't reach them.
L51374 +++$+++ u3783 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ The medical bill are 61 thousand now. I've spoken to your parents and they didn't hang up or anything -- they just said they would feel strange calling you.
L51373 +++$+++ u3783 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ See, he's right. I need the cards.  Simon, you're broke.
L51372 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Terrify me?
L51371 +++$+++ u3783 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ Frank's idea. He thought I should have notes so I did this right... maintained focus, didn't get emotional and tried not to terrify you.
L51370 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Sorry. What are those cards?
L51315 +++$+++ u3783 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ You little stinker. He's given you everything.
L51314 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ No. Please, don't force him.
L51263 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ I haven't looked at myself yet. I figured I could tell from your reaction.
L51262 +++$+++ u3783 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ JACKIE +++$+++ How you doing, great one?
L51447 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Where'd they teach you to talk like this -- some Panama City "Sailor want to hump-hump bar"? Or was today getaway day and your last shot at his whiskey. Sell crazy some place else -- we're all stocked up here.
L51446 +++$+++ u3785 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ NORA +++$+++ You're a wonderful man. Two o'clock is a good time. Here's the key in case he's asleep. Open the curtains for him, so he sees God's beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best.
L51445 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Sure thing.
L51444 +++$+++ u3785 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ NORA +++$+++ Not just today -- Uh, could you do it -- until, until he gets back on his feet?
L51443 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Absolutely.
L51442 +++$+++ u3785 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ NORA +++$+++ No! Would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him?
L51441 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Is he dead yet?
L51245 +++$+++ u3786 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ We will if we can and if we can't, we'll come back and ask you again and again.
L51244 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Ask him.
L51243 +++$+++ u3786 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Oh, is he dead?
L51242 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Just move on. No one here killed him.
L51241 +++$+++ u3786 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ What?
L51240 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ How come you're pretending to do cop work -- 'cause I don't think you could find your ass if you were spotted the hole.
L51239 +++$+++ u3786 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ RAY +++$+++ Okay. So you call 911 and don't leave your name -- even a dumb geezer should know that emergency automatically pulls up your name. How come you make a mistake like that?
L51873 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I forgot to lock the door.
L51872 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ What's wrong?
L51871 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Okay. Thanks a lot. Here I go.
L51870 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Then get in your jammies and I'll read you a story... I think you've got a chance. The only real enemy you have is her ability to think logically -- the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself if it gives you one chance in whatever -- so go catch her off- guard.
L51869 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Hey... I'm charged here. But she might kill me for showing up this late.
L51868 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ You know who you want. I'll take your seat any day. So do something... don't sleep on it... go over there. I don't think anybody should ever sleep on anything -- it's not always good to let things calm down.
L51867 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Absolutely not.
L51866 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ But you know where you're lucky?
L51865 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble.
L51864 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Picking on me won't help.
L51863 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ It was better than this... Look, you, I'm very intelligent. If you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. If you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I'm drowning and you're describing water.
L51862 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Did you like it that much?
L51861 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I don't know... Let me sleep on it and figure it out.  Because I'm stuck! Can't go back to what I had... She's evicted me from my life.
L51860 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Okay... you tell me why --  "You're dying here."
L51859 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.
L51858 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Because...  ... you love her?
L51857 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I'm a great guy -- "extraordinary"...  ... and she doesn't want contact with me.  I'm dying here.
L51856 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ What did she say?
L51855 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ I'm coming.
L51854 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ You going to come talk to me or not?
L51831 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Look, we both want the dog -- and...
L51830 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Sorry, didn't know you were awake. I just thought Verdell shouldn't get too used to sleeping in here 'cause then...
L51826 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ I love you.
L51825 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
L51824 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm me.
L51820 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L51819 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I think you gotta camp it here...
L51818 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Look, I've got to get a hold of Frank and see where I'm hanging my hat 'cause...
L51817 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I told you to go on in.
L51804 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Does it matter?
L51803 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Another place where?
L51802 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Good-bye.  Well, your luck is holding. They sublet your place. You're homeless. Frank's got a line on another place you can use for now.
L51794 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ I know. I'm a little bit nervous. Suddenly everything seems so easy. Carol, a load has been lifted.
L51793 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ What are you talking about? You got real problems.
L51790 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ I'm going back with you.
L51789 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ ... Now he's going to want to stay. And they'll want to take a ride to the lake or whatever. So it's a good five hours back. It gives us a chance to take it easy and...
L51788 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ ... so Mom. Truly no grudges -- truly. A little odd that you didn't come to see me when you heard I was hurt, but the important thing I want you to know is your son is happy. I'm working again. I'll make do -- I don't want a thing. Wouldn't take it if it was offered. I'll drop you a note from wherever I land and then it's up to you. I hope we patch things up but know that if we don't, I wish you both the very best... I can't hear you. You heard me, though, right? Good -- take good care. 'Bye.
L51787 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I get why you're angry. It's no snap to explain why I was like that, but let's not try to do it on the run...
L51674 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I give you that one...  Nice packing.
L51673 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ You consider your life easy.
L51672 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not...
L51671 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Melvin...
L51670 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Do you ever get an erection for a woman?
L51664 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Not at all, huh?!... Let's go to the hotel. And if you're lucky tomorrow Dad will give you another wad of sweaty money.
L51663 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Not it at all, really.
L51652 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ This stuff is pointless.
L51651 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Well, I always painted. Always. And my mother always encouraged it. She was sort of fabulous about it actually... and she used to... I was too young to think there was anything at all wrong with it... and she was very natural. She used to pose nude for me... and I thought or assumed my father was aware of it.
L51633 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Never a break. Never.
L51632 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ That's very thoughtful.
L51627 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Let's do the small talk in the car. Load up.
L51626 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ I, uh... I was... attacked. Walked in on people robbing me. I was hospitalized. I almost died.
L51509 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Yeah...
L51508 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ But sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain.
L51507 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I haven't been sleeping. I haven't been clear or felt like myself. I'm in trouble. Some son of a bitch is burning my bridges behind my back...  But the tiredness -- boy...  Not just sleepy.
L51506 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Got any easier questions?
L51505 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I have never been so tired in my life. Okay, if I sit here?
L51504 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Thanks.
L51503 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I brought you Chinese soup.
L51479 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Stupid dog.  I don't get it.
L51478 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Would you leave now, please?
L51477 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Yo, yo, yo...
L51476 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Come on, sweetheart...
L51475 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Now we'll both call him.
L51474 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Oh, my gosh.
L51473 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I carry bacon in my pocket.
L51472 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Don't piss on a gift, tough guy. You want to know why the dog prefers me...  it's not affection. It's a trick.
L51471 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Get out.
L51470 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Well, I'll do one thing for you that might cheer you up.
L51467 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ No need to stop being a lady... quit worrying -- you'll be back on your knees in no time.
L51466 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Rot in hell, Melvin.
L51465 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Nellie, you're a disgrace to depression.
L51464 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Nothing worse than having to feel this way in front of you?
L51463 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Get out.
L51462 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Where are all your queer party friends?
L51461 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Please, just leave.
L51460 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ That cleaning woman doesn't...
L51459 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Go away.
L51458 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ It smells like shit in here?
L51457 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ If you'll excuse me I'm not feeling so well.
L51456 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Thank you for walking him.
L51455 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Maybe I'll bring him some food by.
L51312 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Verdell?
L51311 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing.
L51310 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Thank you. Verdell...  sweetheart?  By the way, thanks for saving me.
L51309 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Could you take it just a little easy, Mr. Udall?
L51308 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ That's some face they left hanging on you. You look like...
L51132 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Okay, then.
L51131 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making.
L51130 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge-packer you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States... and he's going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone...  don't knock ...  not on this door. Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart?
L51129 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ No...  actually, I even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d...
L51128 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden?
L51127 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ No, I didn't.
L51126 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Do you realize that I work at him?
L51125 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Did you... do something to him?
L51124 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Well, that's a load off.
L51123 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.
L51122 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Maybe this can wait.
L51121 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Yeeeess!!!
L51119 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ 'Love was... '
L51118 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you please.
L51099 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Franks shows my work, Mr. Udall. I think you know that.
L51098 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ How're you doing?
L51097 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall.
L51096 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food...
L51095 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Which color was that?
L51094 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I got it. You're talking about your dog. I thought that was the name of the colored man I've been seeing in the hall.
L51093 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ My dog... you know... I mean my little dog with the adorable face... Don't you know what my dog looks like?
L51092 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ What's he look like?
L51091 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Mr. Udall... excuse me. Hey there!  Have you seen Verdell?
L51391 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ I think of a man and take away reason and accountability.
L51390 +++$+++ u3790 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ How do you write women so well?
L51389 +++$+++ u3790 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ Aw come on, just a couple of questions -- how hard is that?
L51388 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ Oh God, this is like a nightmare.
L51387 +++$+++ u3790 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ That somebody out there knows what it's like to be...  in here.
L51386 +++$+++ u3784 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ MELVIN +++$+++ What's it mean?
L51385 +++$+++ u3790 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ ZOE +++$+++ I can't resist. You usually move through here so quickly and I have so many questions I want to ask you. You have no idea what your work means to me.
L51237 +++$+++ u3789 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ No. No. No. Hey, that painting in there...  I just want to tell you...
L51236 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Why are you doing this?
L51233 +++$+++ u3789 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Please!! NO!!!
L51232 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Just a second -- he has to go.
L51231 +++$+++ u3789 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ Wait -- I want to see the painting.
L51230 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Yes...  well, there's one more stage -- trying to figure out if it's any good.
L51229 +++$+++ u3789 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ So you're practically finished, huh?
L51210 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ No...  Okay. What I do is watch and wait for, um... You ever watch someone who doesn't know you're watching...  an old woman on a bus, kids going to school and you see this flash come over them and you know immediately that it has nothing to do with anything external -- that it's in respond to a private thought they just had? They are just sort of realer and more alive. And when you notice it so are you. If you look at someone long enough, you discover their humanity.
L51209 +++$+++ u3789 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right...  is that correct? I haven't done it right?
L51208 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Nothing. I just watch till something strikes me. Do anything you think of -- try different thing. Until I say, "hold that pose." Then just try and comfortably hold it.
L51207 +++$+++ u3789 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ VINCENT +++$+++ How about that pose?  This is not fun...  Give me some direction.
L51206 +++$+++ u3787 +++$+++ m249 +++$+++ SIMON +++$+++ Exactly what is your previous experience?
L52773 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Bain!
L52772 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ Game over, bitch!
L52743 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Now I'll tell you something.  It wouldn't fucking matter if I offered you one hundred million dollars. You'd still be thinking the same thing, that you're going to take me. And here I am, sitting through this, knowing it's bullshit, looking at you and the only thing going on in my mind, the only thing I can think is that, in just a few minutes I'm going to take you.
L52742 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ I'll tell you this.  After Cleveland, I thought I was lucky to be alive.  But now, here, I just realized that you were the lucky one.
L52741 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Why don't you tell me.
L52740 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ You don't know a fucking thing about me.  You don't have the slightest fucking clue.
L52739 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ You would be.
L52738 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ You think I would be an idiot to pass up five million dollars.
L52737 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ What I just said, no assassin would say.  What I've said, only a mark would say.
L52736 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ Oh, yeah.
L52735 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ You understand what's going on?  It makes sense, right?
L52734 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ What?
L52733 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Did you see how I did that?  Magic wasn't it?
L52732 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ Shit.  That sure is a lot of money.
L52731 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ That's right.
L52730 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ Five million dollars?
L52728 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ All right, Bain.  Pay attention, because this is where everything changes.
L52727 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ If you think you can take me, quit fucking bullshitting and try it.
L52726 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Yeah you are and you hate it.  You hate the fact that your hand is shaking and mine isn't.  That you're sweating your balls off and I'm not. You've got fear and hate in your belly like battery acid, all because of me.
L52725 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ I ain't scared of you.
L52724 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Listen to me, Bain.  Two days ago, you contacted your contractor, who told you that they knew when and where I was going to pick up the transferred money from MicroCell. You don't know how they got the information.  It bothered you, but you didn't care.  How do I know this?  Because ten years ago, I was sitting in that chair, as scared shitless as you are now.
L52720 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ It means that I'm going to tell you things, even though I already know that you're not going to listen to a God damned thing I say.
L52719 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ What does that fucking mean?
L52718 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I knew the same way in ten years you're going to know.
L52717 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ How'd you know?  Just tell me that. How'd you fucking know?
L52141 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ I know you're going to jump.
L52140 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ No, no.  Wait.  You don't want me to jump.  You're going to jump.  I'm stuck back here until it's too late. Wham -- over!
L52136 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ There's a sand barricade up ahead; I'm going to ram this cab into it. The cab has an airbag, odds are good I'll survive.  But with this steel casing and bullet proof glass, odds for you are not so good.
L52135 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ What are you doing?
L52134 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ What?  What's okay?
L52133 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Okay.
L52131 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ Bullshit.
L52130 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ We go around once.
L52129 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ So what happens now?
L52128 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ Who the fuck cares about Cleveland. Cleveland blows.  What kind of marks have they got here?  Greasy mobster, teamster or some hand job politician.  I want the money marks. I want the marks that you get.
L52127 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ After those cops, you'll never be able to come back to Cleveland.
L52126 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ Robert Bain, driving me!  Jesus fucking Christ!
L52124 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ Yeah, that's it.  And he's like a fucking genius.  They said he shaded you over and over.  And in the end, he aced you again.  Shaded and faded.  They say he's living on some Greek island, but I say that's fucking bullshit.  I say you're the best and that you planted his ass. Am I right?
L52123 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ Tachlinkov.
L52122 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ Oh!  I got a question.  Jesus, this has been driving me crazy for years -- shit, listen to me.  I sound like some fucking fanboy.  I'm sorry, but I just got to ask you.  Everybody talks about how you left the Agency and got into the business and then how you went after the Russian, Nicholai Talinkov --
L52119 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ We both know what you were doing.
L52118 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ You don't have to tell me that. It's just, I know my bid was low, but was it too low?  I mean, did I seem like an amateur, like I didn't know what I was doing?
L52110 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ Sounds like chickenshit --
L52109 +++$+++ u3798 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ RATH +++$+++ It's just a shoot-out then.  Sixty- forty, at best.  Not my odds.
L52108 +++$+++ u3791 +++$+++ m250 +++$+++ BAIN +++$+++ Hey.  What I don't get was why didn't you take the shot inside the restaurant?  I mean you had me, a free shot.  That's what I would have done.
