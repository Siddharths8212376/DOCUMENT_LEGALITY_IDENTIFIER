L490310 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Leggo...
L490309 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Nothing for you to see.
L490255 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Easy!  It's forty miles, sonny...Horses can do with some grain and a little rest.
L490254 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Well, come on!
L490243 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Well, fust off...
L490242 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?
L490241 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ What you want me to call you?
L490240 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Don't have to call me 'sir' neither... Nor grampaw neither...Nor Methuselah neither...I can whup you to a frazzle.
L490239 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L490238 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Stop callin' me 'uncle'...I ain't your uncle.
L490237 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Somethin' mighty fishy about this trail, Uncle Ethan...
L490132 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ You've done a lot of growin'...
L490131 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Not quite...Quarter Cherokee. The rest is Welsh...So they tell me.
L490731 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Time's running out...But I'm obliged to you.
L490730 +++$+++ u7538 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ KEEFER +++$+++ That's the breed...Course it might take time.
L490729 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Comancheros...
L490728 +++$+++ u7538 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ KEEFER +++$+++ There's one thing. We recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp... cheap stuff...trade goods...Couldn't help noticing that most of it was Mexican...Maybe if you could talk to some of those Mexican traders along the border...What do they call themselves?
L490727 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Well, we only got the one lead -- Scar...And where we begin to look, I don't know...
L490723 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ They're not white any more -- they're <U>Comanche</U>!...Let's see the bodies...
L490722 +++$+++ u7538 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ KEEFER +++$+++ Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
L490721 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Not far from it...
L490720 +++$+++ u7538 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ KEEFER +++$+++ Was your niece about their age?
L490893 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I've seen her...and she's alive.
L490892 +++$+++ u7544 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MRS. JORGENSEN +++$+++ You've seen her!...She's alive?
L490891 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ She's not a little girl any more.
L490483 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ No...not yet...
L490482 +++$+++ u7544 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MRS. JORGENSEN +++$+++ Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
L490481 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ You ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore?
L490480 +++$+++ u7544 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MRS. JORGENSEN +++$+++ Why it's just a snip of calico...
L490471 +++$+++ u7544 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MRS. JORGENSEN +++$+++ Don't go blamin' yourself...
L490470 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I got your boy killed.
L490469 +++$+++ u7544 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MRS. JORGENSEN +++$+++ Well, you did all a body could, Ethan.
L490323 +++$+++ u7544 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MRS. JORGENSEN +++$+++ I am...I am...It's just that I know Martha'd want you to think of her boys as well as her girls...And if the girls are...dead...Ethan, don't let the boys waste their lives in vengeance!
L490322 +++$+++ u7533 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I'd be obliged if you'd get to the point, ma'am.
L490739 +++$+++ u7539 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Yours truly...  And he even has to write his full name...Martin Pauley...not even just <U>Martie</U>!...  I don't care if he <U>never</U> comes back!
L490738 +++$+++ u7537 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ JORGENSEN +++$+++ They never find that girl.
L490605 +++$+++ u7539 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ A little Comanche squaw - SQUAW!
L490604 +++$+++ u7537 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ JORGENSEN +++$+++ Every young man should at least once...Go on, Laurie! Read!
L490588 +++$+++ u7537 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ JORGENSEN +++$+++ That means Mister Futterman is dead, by golly.
L490587 +++$+++ u7539 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ The <U>late</U> Mister Futterman?
L490586 +++$+++ u7539 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Dear Miss Laury...I take pen in hand to let you know Ethan and me still are trying to catch up with them Com- anches the late Mister Futterman told us about...
L490585 +++$+++ u7537 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ JORGENSEN +++$+++ Who cares what he spells it? Read the letter.
L490584 +++$+++ u7539 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ 'Dear Miss Laury'...He spells it with a Y instead of an I...E...Wouldn't you think he'd know...
L490583 +++$+++ u7537 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ JORGENSEN +++$+++ From the beginning...
L490582 +++$+++ u7539 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Oh, all right! Well...Martin says...
L490982 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Only if I'm dead!
L490981 +++$+++ u7539 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Do you know what Ethan will do if he has a chance?...He'll put a bullet in her brain! And I tell you Martha would want him to!
L490980 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ <U>Laurie</U>! Shut your mouth!
L490979 +++$+++ u7539 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Fetch <U>what</U> home?...The leavin's of Comanche bucks -- sold time an' again to the highest bidder?...With savage brats of her own, most like?...
L490978 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ I got to fetch her home...
L490977 +++$+++ u7539 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ It's too late...She's a woman grown now...
L490976 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ You crazy?
L490975 +++$+++ u7539 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Martie...don't go! Not this time.
L490903 +++$+++ u7539 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ You do and I'll die, Martie...I will! I'll just die!
L490902 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Don't cry, Laurie...I understand how it is...I'll just go 'way...
L490900 +++$+++ u7539 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ It isn't fair...
L490899 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ But I allus loved you...You know that, without my sayin' it...I couldn't bring myself to ask you to wait...the little I had... not knowin' how much longer until we found Debbie...
L490898 +++$+++ u7539 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ No, it wasn't...You mighta said you loved me...You mighta asked me to wait...At least that'd have been something...
L490897 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ It wasn't much of a letter...
L490896 +++$+++ u7539 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ One letter in five years...I read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out...
L490895 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ I...I wrote you a letter...Reckon you didn't get it...
L490519 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ I can't help it, Laurie...I just gotta catch up with Ethan...
L490518 +++$+++ u7539 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Take it and welcome...but don't count on finding me here when you get back...I've been dallying around this god-forsaken wind-scour almost two long years waitin' for you...I ain't cut out to be an old maid!
L490517 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ But that's Sweet-face -- your own good horse.
L490516 +++$+++ u7539 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Go on then! Pa's in the barn saddlin' the Fort Worth stud... an' you can take the light gelding with the blaze...
L490515 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ I gotta catch up with him, Laurie!
L490514 +++$+++ u7539 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Finish your breakfast...
L490513 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Futterman!...He's got a little tradin' post on the South Fork o' the Brazos...Laurie, I just got to get me a good horse! Think yer pa would...
L490486 +++$+++ u7539 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Shush!...Time for bed anyway...  Likely these'll need some takin' in...Oh, Martie, you're that gaunted! ...Ma's havin' a turkey for dinner tomorrow and...
L490485 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Might at least have left me my pants!
L490467 +++$+++ u7539 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Wouldn't bother me...  I wouldn't try it in front of pa, though, was I you...
L490466 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ You talk like a feller might just as leave run around nekkid...
L490465 +++$+++ u7539 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ I'm a woman, Martie...  We wash and mend your dirty clothes all our lives...When you're little we even wash <U>you</U>....How a man can ever make out to get bashful in front of a woman I'll never know...
L490464 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Well I ain't one of 'em!
L490463 +++$+++ u7539 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ What you gettin' red-in-the-face for?...I have brothers, haven't I?
L490462 +++$+++ u7539 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ LAURIE +++$+++ Ain't worth the mendin'...
L490461 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Don't go takin' that stuff...
L490692 +++$+++ u7545 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ Sorry...  Keep the column moving!..Close ranks there!
L490691 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ But couldn't you...?
L490690 +++$+++ u7545 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...
L490689 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Where?
L490688 +++$+++ u7545 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ We got two around that age...
L490687 +++$+++ u7542 +++$+++ m509 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ She'd be about thirteen now...
L496219 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ You don't remember?
L496218 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ For God's sake, what happened to me?
L496212 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ I wouldn't have made it by myself.
L496211 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ How did you get me out of there?
L496209 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ I have a yearning for... smog, cars and many, many people... A real dirty... big city. What do you think?
L496208 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ What?
L496183 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ ...So he's dictating you a new bestseller?  Whatever that is, it's not our son.
L496182 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ You know, Tommi wants me to become the man I used to be.
L496180 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Your book - that's why you were always in the cellar!
L496179 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ It's important - he knows the last chapter.
L496177 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ 'HE'?  Whom do you mean-
L496176 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ I told you, there is no way out. He won't let you go.
L496131 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ We loved each other once.  Have you forgotten that?
L496130 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Oh, Ellen.  My sweet Ellen... Of course I knew.
L496104 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ What are you talking about-
L496103 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Of course you'll give me the blame again.  Like back then.  Just a tiny cut and he could still be alive today - isn't that right, Ellen?
L496102 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Martin, damnit, what are you up to? Let go of me!
L496101 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ You know what I have to do now, and believe me:  I don't enjoy doing this.
L496100 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ It's simply too dangerous here! But no, you always have to have it your way.
L496099 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Martin, what-
L496085 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Damn it, look at you!  Don't you see what's happening with you?  We need to get out of here, don't you understand?  Out of this house!
L496084 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Will you finally cut it out?  Just in case you haven't noticed, I am trying to write a book here.  And maybe - even with your birdbrains - you can figure it's a pretty tough job. So why can't you just leave me alone?
L496082 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Okay, so the house has a history and there might still be a couple of corpses in the moors.  "There is something negative about the place..."  What the hell are you trying to say?  Come on!  Spit it out!
L496081 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.
L496080 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ During the Middle Ages people were executed at every corner.  What's your point?
L496073 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Hi, darling.
L496072 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Let me guess:  Another short circuit?
L496010 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ An animal?  What kind of animal? A goddamned T-Rex, or what?
L496009 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Maybe an animal.
L496008 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Old?!  Come look at this!  She has wounds.  Wounds on her head.  Like thrashes.  Or bites.
L496007 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ She was old.
L496006 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Look at this!  The dog!  She's dead!
L496005 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ What?
L495956 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ I haven't the slightest idea.
L495955 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Who's that?
L495953 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ The house - Tommi - something just doesn't jive here...
L495952 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ What? What am I supposed to sense?
L495951 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ It's just a feeling.  Don't you sense it, too?
L495950 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Ellen, what are you trying to prove, anyway?  That we've created ourselves a ghost?  Come on!
L495949 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ "Events commonly interpreted as haunting apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested traumatic ordeals..."
L495947 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ In the village.  Look what I found.
L495946 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Where have you been?
L495920 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Oh, baloney.  You should just hear yourself talk!
L495919 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ But that's not the point! What if all these things are somehow connected?
L495915 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ I went to see Prof. Roth!  You know, I had another one of those dreams last night.  I saw Tommi!
L495914 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Where have you been all day?
L495913 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Why not?  She can guard the house. By the way, I gave her a name: Clara.
L495912 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Don't tell me you've made friends with that wandering flea circus?
L495888 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ No, thanks.  I have everything I need.  Drive safely, you hear?
L495887 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Hey, you're still here.  I suppose you like it here with us.
L495885 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Yeah... I have to go to town.
L495884 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ So, did you sleep good?
L495868 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Come on, at least try one.  It took me two hours to make these.
L495867 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Now, what did I do to deserve this?
L495864 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Come on, this isn't about honesty. You just need a good night's sleep. The way you toss and turn all night, even I hardly get any sleep.
L495863 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Well, apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you. Don't you remember what we promised to each other?  Honesty - trust!
L495862 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ You know, it's not always easy for me, either.  But at least I try not to give in to each and every neurosis.
L495861 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Martin, it's not funny!
L495858 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Someone from the village.
L495857 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Who was that?
L495840 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ If we stand a chance at all, it's only by sticking together.
L495839 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Maybe different.  I don't know, Ellen.
L495838 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?
L495837 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ So do I, believe me.
L495836 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ I miss Tommi so much.
L495834 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ And two months later, we got married.  And all because of one sentence:  "With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
L495833 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ I was so excited about meeting you. Again and again, I kept getting in the back of the line so I could be the last to talk to you.
L495832 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Not a book fair.  I was signing autographs in a department store.
L495831 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Cherry-red Tears, your first book. I read it at least nine times.  And then I found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair.
L495830 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ What?
L495829 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Cherry-red Tears.
L495828 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ We just have to make a new beginning.
L495827 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ I have a funny feeling.  Do you think we'll get over all that's happened?
L495826 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Hey, take your time.  You know time heals better than any shrink ever can.
L495825 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Maybe I should talk to Dr. Roth about it.
L495822 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ I just had a really strange experience.
L495821 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Is everything alright?  Aren't you feeling well?
L495820 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Making our very own solstice fire.
L495819 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ What are you doing?
L495817 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Well, if you won't let me smoke grass, then at least I'll go get myself some cigarettes.
L495816 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Where are you going?
L495815 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Yes, daddy.
L495814 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Hey, flower child, the sixties are over.  And this stuff is hazardous to your health.
L495812 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ My father was a pilot.  And do I know how to fly?
L495811 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ My father was an electrician. Already forgot that?
L495810 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ You?
L495809 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ I'll do it myself.
L495808 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Do you have a better idea?
L495807 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Are you crazy?  That costs a fortune!
L495806 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ We'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning.
L495805 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Look at this!  We'll have to fix the whole wiring.  This stuff is dangerous as hell.
L495799 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ In the cellar, I think. Wait, I'll take care of it.
L495798 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Do you know where fuse box is?
L495797 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Oh, damnit!
L495796 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Hey... the fuse.
L495795 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ We're probably lucky that we even have running water and electricity! Damned box!
L495794 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Maybe the antenna's broken.
L495792 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Oh, that was upstairs.  A real antiquity!  I think it's great.
L495791 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ I mean the armchair!
L495790 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ It still worked in town.
L495789 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ What kind of a horrible thing is that?
L495781 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Well then, I guess I'd better leave the two of you alone.  But don't forget...
L495780 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Oh, the muse... we're still having our differences.  You know how it is with women.
L495779 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Me and the muse, of course.  How is your book coming along?
L495778 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ They say it's fantastic.  At least that's what I read in a men's magazine.  So who are the two lucky ones?
L495777 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ So, how does it feel to be kissed by two women?
L495776 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ You'll never get away from me!
L495775 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Stop that!
L495762 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Oh God, Tommi...
L495761 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Ellen, move aside...
L495759 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ What else should I do, damn it, he's dying!
L495758 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!
L495757 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ I have to cut his windpipe...
L495751 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ "With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
L495750 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Say it anyway.  Come on, how much do you love me?
L495748 +++$+++ u7546 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Come on, say it.  You know...
L495747 +++$+++ u7548 +++$+++ m510 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Why else?
