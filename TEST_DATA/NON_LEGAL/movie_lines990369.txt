L558146 +++$+++ u8014 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ ZOD +++$+++ Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!
L558145 +++$+++ u8013 +++$+++ m542 +++$+++ URSA +++$+++ Strange. I tore those metal fibers like paper. And what he did . . ..  Was amazing!  Something is happening . . ..

L559283 +++$+++ u8015 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Lacy. . . I . . .
L559282 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ Maybe if you'd have met who I am now, instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago, it would have been different between us.
L559281 +++$+++ u8015 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ You'll find a good man Lacy. You deserve one.
L559280 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ You know: strong, gentle, tall men with bright blue eyes and square. Men who like to dance slow, the old fashioned way, the way their mothers taught them on the night before their prom.
L559279 +++$+++ u8015 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Like me?
L559278 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ Any more like you back home, Clark?
L559277 +++$+++ u8015 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ I'm not so sure you do.
L559276 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ You don't have to be polite, Clark. I've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me.
L559275 +++$+++ u8015 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ I'm sorry to see you go.
L559274 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ Daddy's offered me jobs at some of his other companies. But, I've been thinking maybe I'll take some time off.  I'm going to find a place like Smallville, in the country. Maybe a  farm . . .  see what the slow lane is like.
L559110 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ No mind, it's only antique Irish linen.
L559109 +++$+++ u8015 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Gee, I'm really sorry.
L559107 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ Let's sit down. They walk to the table. LOIS calls out to the balcony.
L559106 +++$+++ u8015 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Hi. Is dinner ready? I'm famished.
L559096 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ Clark. . . !
L559095 +++$+++ u8015 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Oh . . . my . . .
L559093 +++$+++ u8015 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ But they're expecting us. It wouldn't be polite.
L559092 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ I missed you. It wasn't any fun up there with just Lois and Superman. They're so boring. Let's go do something wild!
L559076 +++$+++ u8015 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Oh . . . Right. . . I'll be back in a flash.
L559075 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ Shouldn't you pay the cabbie?
L559066 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ . . . Let me get my purse.
L559065 +++$+++ u8015 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Hello, Lacy. Can anybody break a twenty? The cabbie didn't have any change.
L559024 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ Come early. The view is so romantic from my balcony.
L559023 +++$+++ u8015 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Gee, I don't think . . .
L559022 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ I'll just invite them both to my hotel suite and we'll have high tea. It's very chic.
L559021 +++$+++ u8015 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Yes, I know. I'm sure it will be a great story.
L559020 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ Then prove it. Lois is doing an interview with Superman about his peace mission . . .
L559019 +++$+++ u8015 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ I'm not avoiding you. I've been very busy and . . . I like you . . . I really do.
L559018 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ He's a jerk. I never noticed it before. Seems like a lot of people I know are jerks . . .  . . . Maybe you think the same thing about me. That's why you keep avoiding me.
L559011 +++$+++ u8015 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ If you say so. Here goes.
L559010 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ Now you try, Clark. We'll start you off with 60 pounds.
L559009 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ Don't give up. This is a perfect subject for your series on young Metropolis. Now let's get those knees up!
L559008 +++$+++ u8015 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Maybe I should sit this one out.
L558916 +++$+++ u8015 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Don't worry, I've got you.
L558915 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ I feel kind of light-headed . . .
L558914 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ No, realistic. There's no magic in the world. Girls just don't get swept off their feet anymore.
L558913 +++$+++ u8015 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ That sounds kind of pessimistic.
L558912 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ Don't tell me you're waiting for lightning to strike. Wide-eyed romantics are an endangered species.
L558911 +++$+++ u8015 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Well, my career takes up a lot of my time.
L558910 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ What about here?
L558909 +++$+++ u8015 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Oh . . . no, there's no one back home.
L558908 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ That's not what we were taught. 'Look out for number one' -- that's daddy's golden rule ... he always ends up with the gold.
L558907 +++$+++ u8015 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.
L558906 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ My prom was so boring. We all flew to Paris the next day to recover . . . Sometimes my whole life seems boring. I thing maybe I should just give everything away and go live among the poor people. Then I remember how smashing I look in sable . . . oh, it's all so confusing. You think I'm silly, don't you?
L558905 +++$+++ u8015 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Actually, I had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom.
L558904 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ Don't tell me. You learned to dance at church socials.
L558899 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ This is Metropolis after hours! This is what you'll be writing about. C'mon, let's dance.
L558898 +++$+++ u8015 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ I've never been in a place like this before.
L558893 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ Oh, Clark, you're so delightfully primitive.
L558892 +++$+++ u8015 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.
L558891 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ You're late. Very late.
L558845 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ Don't worry. I won't make you do it alone. I know all the right places. I'm a member at all the right clubs . . . We'll start tonight at the grand opening of the Metro Club! It's a date!
L558844 +++$+++ u8015 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ They make my eyes itch.
L558843 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ That's just it! You don't have to flaunt it. You're no slave to fashion ... although ...
L558842 +++$+++ u8015 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ And I'm usually in bed by ten-thirty.
L558841 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful...
L558840 +++$+++ u8015 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ I really don't think . . .
L558839 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ It's brilliant. Daddy thinks so, too. You'll write a new series -- 'Metropolis After Hours.'
L559290 +++$+++ u8015 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Well, I'm feeling a lot better . . . almost chipper . . .  . . . and all because I had a visit from a very good nurse.
L559289 +++$+++ u8021 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ It must have been a super effort to get out of bed, Clark.
L559191 +++$+++ u8015 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ You know him so well.  But I'm sure he'll manage . . . wherever he is.
L559190 +++$+++ u8021 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Everyone's saying he's . . . dead. But I know that isn't true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help.
L559189 +++$+++ u8015 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Superman? Has something happened to him?
L559187 +++$+++ u8021 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ You haven't been at work . . . you didn't call the office . . .  you didn't even call me. How could you not call back?
L559186 +++$+++ u8015 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ It's just a bad flu, really. How did you know . . .
L559151 +++$+++ u8021 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Clark, it's Lois. This is the fourth message. I've left. . . Where are you ?
L559150 +++$+++ u8015 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ . . . Please leave your message at the beep.
L559070 +++$+++ u8015 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Politely?
L559069 +++$+++ u8021 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ It's her father's grey matter that's weakened if you ask me. How can I ask Superman such a dumb question.
L559068 +++$+++ u8015 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ 'Are you or are you not part of a plot to weaken our national defense?'
L558851 +++$+++ u8021 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ I don't think 'fan mail' fits this letter.  Read it, Clark.
L558850 +++$+++ u8015 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ Oh, probably just a picture request. I'll take care of it if you want, Lois.
L558812 +++$+++ u8021 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ You always overreact, Clark. How terrible can it be?
L558811 +++$+++ u8015 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ The President is about to speak. I don't think it's going to be good news.
L558801 +++$+++ u8021 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Clark . . . wait!
L558800 +++$+++ u8015 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ I don't think we're being treated fairly, Lois. And I'm going to tell Miss Warfield.
L558799 +++$+++ u8021 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ No Paris?
L558777 +++$+++ u8021 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Au contraire, mon ami! He owns all those sleazy tabloids and the Daily Planet!
L558776 +++$+++ u8015 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ CLARK +++$+++ That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?
L558775 +++$+++ u8021 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Regardez.  Voila Monsieur David Warfield.
L559175 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Gee guys, that's swell of you. But  . . . I've got another idea.
L559174 +++$+++ u8016 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ HOWLER +++$+++ Lex, we all appreciate how you've supported us lately and . . . uh . . . in recognition of your hard work we've decided to increase your commission to 12 percent.
L559005 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ If my plan works, gentlemen, I'll just take a tiny commission . . . something . . .appropriate. . . a number with a lot of zeros after it.
L559004 +++$+++ u8016 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ HOWLER +++$+++ And what do we get out of it?
L559001 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Do people die in Italian Operas? Gentlemen, if all goes to plan Nuclear Man will return from the sun with power awesome enough to do what none before him has ever been able to . . . pierce Superman's skin. He'll be mortal, he'll get sick . . . and we'll dance on his grave.
L559000 +++$+++ u8016 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ HOWLER +++$+++ And this so-called . . . Nuclear Man. . . of yours can defeat Superman?
L558999 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Boys, old Lex has a secret recipe in this dish . . . call it a genetic stew. You help me place it on one of your missiles and I promise you . . . if Superman throws it into the sun, he'll get the biggest surprise of his life. I'll be able to introduce Superman to his first nightmare . . . a Nuclear Man!
L558997 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ And what am I? A Shriner? No, If you'll join forces with me, together we can make the world safe for war profits again.
L558996 +++$+++ u8016 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ HOWLER +++$+++ But Superman isn't an average man.
L558995 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Of course it is. Do you know what the sun is? Why it's just one huge nuclear bomb. A bomb with enough radiation to incinerate an average man like . . .  that.
L558994 +++$+++ u8016 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ HOWLER +++$+++ Close the curtains. The sun is hurting my eyes.
L559310 +++$+++ u8023 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ Good. If you can see it, and I can see it, maybe some day everyone will see it.
L559309 +++$+++ u8017 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ But you can't tell where one country begins and another ends. You can't see any borders. It's just . . . one world.
L559308 +++$+++ u8023 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ Go on . . .
L559307 +++$+++ u8017 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ Well . . . I see the ocean currents. . . and the rain . . . and mountains and rivers. . . but . . .
L559306 +++$+++ u8017 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ I'll try. . .
L559305 +++$+++ u8023 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
L559304 +++$+++ u8017 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ Awesome!
L558967 +++$+++ u8017 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ N-no...I mean...you bet.
L558966 +++$+++ u8023 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ Would you mind waiting for me in the visitor's gallery?
L558963 +++$+++ u8017 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ Absolutely!
L558962 +++$+++ u8023 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ Would you mind taking a walk with me?
L558869 +++$+++ u8023 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L558868 +++$+++ u8017 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ Well, I don't understand.
L558866 +++$+++ u8023 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ I'm going to pass this letter on to all the leaders of the world. I promise you. For it is they , and not I, that represent the people of Earth.
L558865 +++$+++ u8017 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away?  What good was my letter?
L558864 +++$+++ u8023 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ SUPERMAN +++$+++ Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
L558863 +++$+++ u8017 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ JEREMY +++$+++ Impossible? Why?
L559208 +++$+++ u8024 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ WARFIELD +++$+++ Don't be over-dramatic, young lady. What kind of disaster could we help bring about?
L559207 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ No, Daddy. Our business is journalism. We can't continue to be so irresponsible . . . or else we'll just lead everyone into a disaster.
L559206 +++$+++ u8024 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ WARFIELD +++$+++ Less sensational papers go broke. I thought I taught you long ago the business of newspapers is business.
L559205 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ I'd just like to have a little less sensationalism.
L559204 +++$+++ u8024 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ WARFIELD +++$+++ Tone down our headlines? Lacy, that's all the common man reads!
L559160 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ Stuff it.
L559159 +++$+++ u8024 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ WARFIELD +++$+++ Yes, darling?
L559158 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ Daddy . . . ?
L559157 +++$+++ u8024 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ WARFIELD +++$+++ Didn't we have our little talk about personal involvement with the help? Now that you're the publisher . . .
L559156 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ I know Daddy. I'm worried about him.
L559155 +++$+++ u8024 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ WARFIELD +++$+++ Darling, it's good riddance. Let her go. And while you're at it, fire that Clark Kent. He hasn't been here in days. He hasn't even called.
L558930 +++$+++ u8024 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ WARFIELD +++$+++ Your grandfather had one iron rule that's stood me well. Never fraternize with the help. Keep too your own station. Am I clear?
L558929 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ Oh . . . no . . . I mean, we just went  dancing . . . for  a story . . .
L558928 +++$+++ u8024 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ WARFIELD +++$+++ Clark Kent! You socialized with him . . . a . . . reporter!
L558927 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ Who does Clark Kent think he is anyway! He never even said good night!
L558798 +++$+++ u8024 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ WARFIELD +++$+++ Mr. White, come with me I want to see
L558797 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ Not so fast!  All trips are canceled. We pay for wire services. And what we don't get from them, we'll invent.
L559105 +++$+++ u8021 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ It always is with Clark.
L559104 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . .  oh, it's a long story.
L559103 +++$+++ u8021 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Where's Clark?
L559079 +++$+++ u8021 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Our other dinner guest.
L559078 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ What's that?
L558974 +++$+++ u8021 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Something . . . wonderful.
L558973 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ What's he going to say?
L558957 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ Why, Lois, I didn't know . . . Who is he?
L558956 +++$+++ u8021 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ But he's never there.
L558955 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ Right . . . you want to tell him how you feel . . .
L558954 +++$+++ u8021 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ And your heart beats faster just thinking about him.
L558953 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ Lois, have you ever fallen for a guy and he's not like other guys . . . he's different. It's like you come from two different worlds.
L558952 +++$+++ u8021 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ That's because there's nothing to figure out. Now will you please pay attention. I'm not through insulting your father.
L558951 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ Clark. He's late again.  I can't figure him out.
L558950 +++$+++ u8021 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Who?
L558949 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ I know I'm not exactly a Girl Scout but . . . maybe if I show him I'm trying . . . he'll like me.
L558856 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ Daddy loves to whip up campaigns! People eat it up. We'll make this kid a celebrity. The whole world will be waiting for Superman's answer.
L558855 +++$+++ u8021 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ An angle?
L558854 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ I think there's an angle.
L558849 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ Superman gets mail here?
L558848 +++$+++ u8021 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ This letter was addressed to Superman care of me.
L558809 +++$+++ u8021 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ . . . And  very naïve!
L558808 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ But all men like me, Lois. I'm very rich.
L558807 +++$+++ u8021 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ Forget it, Princess. Clark is the world's oldest boy scout  Trustworthy, loyal, obedient, helpful... and I don't remember the rest, but he's them too. And I promise, he's not interested in anyone like you.
L558806 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ I think he's kind of cute.
L558804 +++$+++ u8021 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LOIS +++$+++ One hundred percent.  And I like him that way.
L558803 +++$+++ u8018 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LACY +++$+++ Is he for real?
L559260 +++$+++ u8019 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Lucky I brought my drums.
L559259 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
L559258 +++$+++ u8019 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ You think he'll find us.
L559229 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ If you need us we'll, be five hundred feet underground waiting for the Nuclear winter to turn to nuclear spring.
L559228 +++$+++ u8019 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Ready, Uncle Lex?
L559227 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Don't worry honey, I'm sure he'll make a swell husband.
L559218 +++$+++ u8019 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ I think he has his own plan, Uncle Lex.
L559217 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ This wasn't in the plan.
L559216 +++$+++ u8019 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ We'll all fry.
L559132 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ My nephew, Leonard. He worships me.  Let's share a toast to you . . . a nice guy who's about to finish last.
L559131 +++$+++ u8019 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Boy, are you gonna get it.
L559056 +++$+++ u8019 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ What?
L559055 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Of course! That's his one vulnerability. The one way he can be stopped.
L559054 +++$+++ u8019 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Good. Let's hope he stays that way.
L559053 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ He's . . . cold. . .
L559052 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Hmm . . . Nuclear levitation. Now that's a trick that could come in handy.
L559051 +++$+++ u8019 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down.
L559050 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ What was that about?
L559043 +++$+++ u8019 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ You're just an experiment, freako!
L559042 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Hey! Just remember I made you.
L559036 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ He's . . .  beautiful. Perfect.
L559035 +++$+++ u8019 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Hey! He looks . . . normal.
L559034 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ There!
L559033 +++$+++ u8019 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ You're spookin' me out, Uncle Lex.
L559032 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He'll remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He'll find his way back to me.  Did you hear that?
L559031 +++$+++ u8019 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ The one Superman wrecked up?
L559030 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Oh Leonard . . . When I sent the remains of my last experiment . . .
L559029 +++$+++ u8019 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Hey, Uncle Lex, how's the Nuclear Guy goin' to find his way here?
L558990 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Get the box, nephew.
L558989 +++$+++ u8019 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Gee, Uncle Lex, I was just getting to the good part.
L558924 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ I must have miscalculated. How. . .
L558923 +++$+++ u8019 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Superman broke your monster, Uncle Lex.
L558889 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Let's try to keep your I.Q. a family secret, Leonard. Before we launch him against Superman, we have to test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and destruction. Kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the Metro Club gala. And once he proves himself, then . . .
L558888 +++$+++ u8019 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Gee, Uncle Lex, I don't think this guy's much of a dancer.
L558884 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ He has all of Superman's powers. If I've planned it right. . .
L558883 +++$+++ u8019 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ Whoa. . .
L558877 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ Quiet! You'll make him self-conscious.
L558876 +++$+++ u8019 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ He missed the door, Uncle Lex.
L558838 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ That hair contains a sample of Superman's genetic material. The building blocks of his body. With my genius and enough nuclear power to mutate those genes, I will create a being with all his powers . . . but with absolute allegiance to me!
L558837 +++$+++ u8019 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LENNY +++$+++ But why the hair?
L558836 +++$+++ u8020 +++$+++ m543 +++$+++ LEX +++$+++ . . . I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.
