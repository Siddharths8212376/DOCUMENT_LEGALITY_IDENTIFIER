L271195 +++$+++ u5792 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER CHANDLER +++$+++ Yeah, and who wants that on their teeth?
L271194 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness.
L271193 +++$+++ u5792 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER CHANDLER +++$+++ Just imagine somebody like your quasi-fat, goody-good friend Betty Finn doing a Crest commercial. No one would buy Crest.
L271168 +++$+++ u5792 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER CHANDLER +++$+++ Whatever. I don't believe this. We're going to a party at Remington University tonight and we're brushing up our conversation skills with the scum of the school.
L271167 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims.
L271166 +++$+++ u5792 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER CHANDLER +++$+++ Like I give a shit. They all want me, as a friend or a fuck. I'm worshipped at Westerburg and I'm only a Junior.
L271165 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Doesn't it bother you that everyone in the school thinks you're a pirahna?
L271162 +++$+++ u5792 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER CHANDLER +++$+++ Fuck me gently with a chainsaw. Do I look like Mother Theresa? If I did, I probably wouldn't mind talking to the Geek Squad.
L271161 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people?
L271160 +++$+++ u5792 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER CHANDLER +++$+++ If you're going to openly be a bitch....
L271146 +++$+++ u5792 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER CHANDLER +++$+++ Color me impressed. I thought you grew out of Betty Finn.
L271145 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ I was talking with someone!
L271138 +++$+++ u5792 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER CHANDLER +++$+++ Shut up, it is. I told Dennis if he gave me another topic that was political, I'd spew burrito chunks.
L271137 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last......
L271133 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Ouch....the lunchtime poll. So what's the question?
L271132 +++$+++ u5792 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER CHANDLER +++$+++ Sawyer. Guess what today is?
L271120 +++$+++ u5792 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER CHANDLER +++$+++ Don't think.
L271119 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ I'll think about it.
L271118 +++$+++ u5792 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER CHANDLER +++$+++ You don't have anything <u>for</u> her either. Come on, it'll be Very. The note'll give her shower nozzle masturbation material for weeks.
L271117 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Shit, Heather. I don't have anything against Martha Dunnstock.
L271116 +++$+++ u5792 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER CHANDLER +++$+++ Veronica. Finally. Got a paper of Kurt Kelly's. I need you to forge a hot and horny but realistically low-key note in Kurt's handwriting and we'll slip it into Martha Dumptruck's lunch tray.
L271259 +++$+++ u5792 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER CHANDLER +++$+++ I'm giving Veronica her shot. Her first Remington Party. Blow it tonight girl and it's keggers with kids all next year.
L271258 +++$+++ u5794 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER MCNAMARA +++$+++ So tonight's the night. Are you two excited?
L271252 +++$+++ u5792 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER CHANDLER +++$+++ Maybe when you hit maturity you'll understand the diff between a Remington University man like David and a Westerburg boy like Ram "Wham-bam- thank-you-maam" Sweeney.
L271251 +++$+++ u5794 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER MCNAMARA +++$+++ King David.
L271250 +++$+++ u5792 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER CHANDLER +++$+++ Anyway, I can say never to high school. I've got David.
L271241 +++$+++ u5792 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER CHANDLER +++$+++ He used a real gun. They should throw his ass in jail.
L271240 +++$+++ u5794 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER MCNAMARA +++$+++ God, they won't expell him. They'll just suspend him for a week or something.
L271209 +++$+++ u5794 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER MCNAMARA +++$+++ Color me nauseous.
L271208 +++$+++ u5792 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER CHANDLER +++$+++ Grow up, Heather. Bulimia's so '86.
L271204 +++$+++ u5794 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER MCNAMARA +++$+++ Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm.
L271203 +++$+++ u5792 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER CHANDLER +++$+++ Ku-urt, let's pa-arty.
L271854 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Some teenybopper rag says Big Fun wants to play a Prom. It could be Westerburg's if we can get everyone's John Hancock.
L271853 +++$+++ u5793 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER DUKE +++$+++ TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT!
L271723 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Don't worry. I'll ask you to do me a favor. You'll get the negatives and everything back then.
L271722 +++$+++ u5793 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER DUKE +++$+++ Very very. The photographs?
L271721 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ I think you can. In Catcher in the Rye Holden says his ideal job'd be making sure some kids don't fall off a cliff. He doesn't realize if you pay too much attention to the kids, you'll back off the cliff yourself.
L271720 +++$+++ u5793 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER DUKE +++$+++ But she couldn't handle it.
L271719 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Strength. Westerburg doesn't need mushy togetherness, it needs a leader. Heather Chandler was that leader but...
L271718 +++$+++ u5793 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER DUKE +++$+++ What do you want from me?
L271717 +++$+++ u5795 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ J.D. +++$+++ Oh, I just had the <u>nicest</u> chat with Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously! It's scary how everyone's got a story to tell....Would you care to see the canoeing shots?
L271716 +++$+++ u5793 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER DUKE +++$+++ Where did you get these?
L271957 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Heather, my love, there's a new sheriff in town.
L271956 +++$+++ u5793 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER DUKE +++$+++ What are you doing?
L271955 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Yeah, I just got back.
L271954 +++$+++ u5793 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER DUKE +++$+++ Veronica, you look like hell.
L271867 +++$+++ u5793 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER DUKE +++$+++ Because I can be! The same fucking cheek, goddamnit! Why are you pulling my dick? Do you think, do you really think, if Betty Finn's fairy godmother made <u>her</u> Cool, she'd still act nice and hang with her dweebette friends? No way! Uh-Uh!
L271866 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Heather, why can't you just be a friend? Why are you such a MegaBitch?
L271865 +++$+++ u5793 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER DUKE +++$+++ Jealous much?
L271864 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ No.
L271863 +++$+++ u5793 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER DUKE +++$+++ It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it?
L271862 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Don't talk to me like that.
L271861 +++$+++ u5793 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER DUKE +++$+++ So some people need different kinds of "convincing" than others....  Hey, just sign the petition!
L271860 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...
L271859 +++$+++ u5793 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER DUKE +++$+++ Veronica! Color me stoked, girl. I've gotten <u>everyone</u> to sign this petition even the one who think BigFun are tuneless Eurofags. People love me!  My God, you haven't signed!
L271825 +++$+++ u5793 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER DUKE +++$+++ Oh shit, yeah.
L271824 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ Just shut up and turn on the radio. Hot Probs is on.
L271823 +++$+++ u5793 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER DUKE +++$+++ What. A. Martyr. Understand; Martha couldn't take the heat so she got out of the kitchen. Just think what a better place the world would be if every nimrod followed her cue.
L271822 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ You're not funny. Ouch!
L271821 +++$+++ u5793 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ HEATHER DUKE +++$+++ You are out of control. Heather and Kurt were a shock, but Martha Dumptruck, get crucial! She dialed suicide hotlines in her diapers.
L271820 +++$+++ u5800 +++$+++ m383 +++$+++ VERONICA +++$+++ I said I was sorry.
