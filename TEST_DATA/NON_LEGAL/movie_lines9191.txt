L317827 +++$+++ u1639 +++$+++ m107 +++$+++ RIZZO +++$+++ How do you open the damn door?

L317809 +++$+++ u1641 +++$+++ m107 +++$+++ YLLO +++$+++ They can deal with this sort of thing.
L317808 +++$+++ u1639 +++$+++ m107 +++$+++ RIZZO +++$+++ What good will that do?
L317805 +++$+++ u1641 +++$+++ m107 +++$+++ YLLO +++$+++ Are we locked down?

L317652 +++$+++ u1639 +++$+++ m107 +++$+++ RIZZO +++$+++ I didn't say he was alive.
L317651 +++$+++ u1641 +++$+++ m107 +++$+++ YLLO +++$+++ Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could be alive.
L317650 +++$+++ u1639 +++$+++ m107 +++$+++ RIZZO +++$+++ Jason! Can't you see? He did this.
L317633 +++$+++ u1639 +++$+++ m107 +++$+++ RIZZO +++$+++ Are you finished?

L319351 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ On the swing? I told you not to play near there until I sanded it down.  See what your son did?
L319350 +++$+++ u1651 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Cut my hand. Hit by a vampire.
L320050 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ He's taken him!

L320030 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ Have you ever had one do this?
L320029 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ He can't stay down with three barrels on him! Where is he?!
L320024 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ Have to pump her steady, s'all.
L320023 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ What about us?
L320005 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ No! No! No!  Swing around! After him!
L320004 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ Did you get him in the head?
L319995 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ Yeah, Captain, as soon as I make a call.
L319994 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ Shut up! Just pump her out!
L319993 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ That's it! Radio in for help!

L319962 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ Tattoo. Had it taken off.
L319961 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ What's that one, there?
L319960 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ I almost had 'im.
L319959 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ C'mon. Middle appendix --
L319958 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ Look a' that -- Bayonet Iwo Jima.
L319939 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ You hired me, remember? It's my $10,000. It's my shark...
L319938 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ Let's call in -- we can radio and have a big boat here in an hour...
L319937 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ We got a barrel on him. We can't lose him. We stay out here until we find him.
L319936 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ Why don't we go in? Get another crack at him tomorrow.
L319911 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ What do we do? Get some help? Radio in?
L319910 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ I never saw one that big.
L319904 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ What I do is trick him to the surface, got that? Then I can jab him, understand?  Think I'm gonna haul it in as if he's a catfish, like everyone else does?
L319903 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ How -- if they're gonna keep on breaking?
L319902 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ Don't tell me my business!  Quarter-mile, that way. Full throttle.
L319901 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ What's the point with hooks and Lines? --
L319895 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ Unbuckle me -- fast!  Grab the leader. He ain't normal, this one... they never --
L319894 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ The wire's showing!
L319882 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ Get behind me, dummy!  Reverse her and turn -- he's taking too much line!  Wet my reel, quick!
L319881 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ You got it?
L319877 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ ...'cause this is where he lives. You gotta think like they do.
L319876 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ Why are we way out here, when the shark's back there?
L319868 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ Nobody. We're drifting with the current.
L319867 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ Who's driving the boat?
L319866 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ Keep that chum line going -- we've got five good miles. Don't break it.
L319833 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ You got it.
L319832 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ All right, Commissioner. But when we're on my ship, I am Master, Mate and Pilot. And I want him...  ...along for ballast.
L319831 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ It's my charter. My party.
L319830 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ What do you mean 'We...?'
L319829 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ Hey. Knock it off. I don't want to have to listen to this while we're out there...
L319818 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ He's from the Oceanographic Institute.
L319817 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ I know who he is...
L319816 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ This is Matt Hooper...
L319808 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ Try some of this. I made it myself.
L319807 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ Two cases. And dinner when you land.
L319806 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ And, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch.
L319805 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ You got it.
L319804 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ And you get the Mayor off my back with this zoning crap. Nobody tells me how to run my property.
L319803 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ You got it.
L319802 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ And incidental damages, if any...
L319801 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ You got it.
L319800 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ And my regular daily rate -- $200, whether we catch him or not.
L319799 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000.
L319798 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise?
L319797 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ What?
L319796 +++$+++ u1652 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ QUINT +++$+++ Did you bring a check?
L319857 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ Tell 'em I went fishin'!
L319856 +++$+++ u1646 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ What'll I tell the kids?
L319855 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.
L319853 +++$+++ u1646 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ I'll see you back soon. There's an extra pair of glasses in your black socks, and there's some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit.
L319852 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
L319851 +++$+++ u1646 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ You going to be all right?
L319850 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ Colorful, isn't he?
L319781 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ No. Home here.
L319780 +++$+++ u1646 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Home... New York?
L319646 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ I am Chief of Police. I can do anything I want.  You want to come?
L319645 +++$+++ u1646 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Can you do that?
L319644 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ Why don't we have one more drink, you and I, and then we go down and cut open that old shark and see for sure what's inside him, or not.
L319623 +++$+++ u1646 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Thank you.
L319622 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ You too, sweetheart...
L319617 +++$+++ u1646 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Excuse me, but what are you talking about? Didn't they catch the shark this afternoon? It was on the Cape station news.
L319616 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ How come you have to tell them that?
L319502 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ I told him not to go out until he memorized the handbook and the safety safety regulations, until he was sure of himself...
L319501 +++$+++ u1646 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again.
L319500 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ Michael! Come inside!
L319499 +++$+++ u1646 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ It's three feet deep, Martin
L319494 +++$+++ u1646 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ He's sitting in it.
L319493 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ Where is he?
L319492 +++$+++ u1646 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Mikey loves his birthday present.
L319491 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ Love a cup of tea. With lemon.
L319490 +++$+++ u1646 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Can you stand something to eat?
L319456 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ Ow.  He's gotta be more careful in the water...
L319455 +++$+++ u1646 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ You're very tight, y'know?  Right there.
L319366 +++$+++ u1646 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Hey Chief. Bring my cup back.
L319365 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ Love ya.

L319358 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ I don't want to depend on these things, y'know -– sometimes you can weaken your eyes.
L319357 +++$+++ u1646 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Older, sillier.
L319356 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ Sexy, hm? What was I before?
L319355 +++$+++ u1646 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ I think they make you look sexy.
L319354 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ Oh, yeah.  How do I look? Older, huh?
L319353 +++$+++ u1646 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Don't forget these.
L319349 +++$+++ u1646 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Don't be silly -– You're going to make summer better for them...
L319348 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ I used to wear this to the Garden. Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggers.  Ship it.
L319347 +++$+++ u1646 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ You want to go through those?  I'm taking them to the Thrift Shop. It's Marcia Vaughn's pet charity. Pick out what you want to keep -- it's mostly your city clothes.
L319346 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ Feed the dogs.
L319345 +++$+++ u1646 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ I never hear the whistle.
L319344 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ Did you burn another kettle? Y'know you're a fire hazard? This is the third one!
L319343 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ Give me 30 years, I'll get it.
L319342 +++$+++ u1646 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Like you're from N'Yawk. 
L319341 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ The kids are in the yahd, playing near the cah. How's that sound?
L319340 +++$+++ u1646 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ In Amity, you say 'Yahd.' 
L319339 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ Probably out in the back yard.
L319338 +++$+++ u1646 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ Do you see the kids?
L319337 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ Right.
L319336 +++$+++ u1646 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ ELLEN +++$+++ 'cause when we bought the house it was Autumn. This is summer. Feed the dogs.
L319335 +++$+++ u1642 +++$+++ m108 +++$+++ BRODY +++$+++ How come the sun didn't used to shine in here?
