L291602 +++$+++ u5925 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ The opening's still too small, we'll never get through!
L291600 +++$+++ u5925 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ -- was that??
L291599 +++$+++ u5918 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What --
L291571 +++$+++ u5925 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ We're safe?
L291570 +++$+++ u5918 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Don't think it's even an issue.
L291569 +++$+++ u5925 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ He's dead...?
L291568 +++$+++ u5918 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ It's okay, everything's okay now.
L291539 +++$+++ u5925 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ He's gotta still be down here.
L291538 +++$+++ u5918 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Price!!
L291529 +++$+++ u5925 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ It'll have to do.
L291528 +++$+++ u5918 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ This is the best we're gonna do.
L291495 +++$+++ u5925 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ What about that other guy?
L291494 +++$+++ u5918 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ That's crazy!
L291493 +++$+++ u5925 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Or an on-line computer.
L291487 +++$+++ u5925 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Everyone that was invited is related to one of the staff who was here when the place burned. There are five of us...
L291486 +++$+++ u5918 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Wait a minute... What are you saying?
L291485 +++$+++ u5925 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Holy shit! Now we know how the guest list was made up. Look, these names... Head Nurse, Ruth-Ann Stockard... Bjorn Jensen, Electro Therapy... Jasper Marr, Thomas Steven Price... They're all here!
L291484 +++$+++ u5918 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Better living through electricity.
L291483 +++$+++ u5925 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Cheery looking bunch.
L291481 +++$+++ u5925 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Maybe there are notes or drawings of this place, showing how those plates work.
L291480 +++$+++ u5918 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What are you looking for?
L291477 +++$+++ u5925 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Let's try down here...
L291476 +++$+++ u5918 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Good point.
L291475 +++$+++ u5925 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Back where?
L291474 +++$+++ u5918 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I think we should have taken a right back there.
L291452 +++$+++ u5925 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ -- listen to the man --
L291451 +++$+++ u5918 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ -- you lose either way, Price --
L291415 +++$+++ u5925 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ -- where the hell were you?
L291414 +++$+++ u5918 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ -- that's the fact, bud --
L291413 +++$+++ u5925 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ I was upstairs with Eddie --
L291378 +++$+++ u5925 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ You're starting to sound like Pritchett.
L291377 +++$+++ u5918 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ -- not a chance -- there's too much weirdness down there I don't think even bullets are gonna stop.
L291376 +++$+++ u5925 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ -- no. The basement -- the room with all the controls to this thing: big long iron levers just lying there --
L291375 +++$+++ u5918 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ No prob: I'll just hop down the hardware store --
L291374 +++$+++ u5925 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ It's a thousand years old -- we just need a crowbar or something to get leverage -- the sucker'll pop!
L291373 +++$+++ u5918 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Sure, with three days and a blowtorch.
L291372 +++$+++ u5925 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ We can do it...
L291365 +++$+++ u5925 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ No -- keep pulling, it's moving!
L291364 +++$+++ u5918 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You hear somebody?
L291321 +++$+++ u5918 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ And then where are we?
L291320 +++$+++ u5925 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ An answer, I hope: exactly what -- or who -- Melissa was taping.
L291319 +++$+++ u5918 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ What the hell good is fixing that gonna get us?
L291318 +++$+++ u5925 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Hey, if everybody's gonna kill each other, could you do it in another room? I'm trying to get something accomplished here.
L291317 +++$+++ u5918 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ How you gonna manage that with a new blow-hole in your dome?
L291308 +++$+++ u5925 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ No...not air --
L291307 +++$+++ u5918 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Well, she went somewhere! She didn't just up and disappear into thin air!
L291252 +++$+++ u5918 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Not in the movie biz. So, c'mon, gimme the truth.
L291251 +++$+++ u5925 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ There's always exceptions.
L291250 +++$+++ u5918 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close.
L291249 +++$+++ u5925 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Why not?
L291248 +++$+++ u5918 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I don't think so...
L291247 +++$+++ u5925 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ I told you already: Jennifer Jenzen, Executive V.P. of --
L291246 +++$+++ u5918 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Start with the name you were born with, and we'll work forward from there.
L291245 +++$+++ u5925 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ What? Deep down inside?
L291243 +++$+++ u5925 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ You need to get out more.
L291242 +++$+++ u5918 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Most fun I've had all day.
L291241 +++$+++ u5925 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Thanks.
L291238 +++$+++ u5925 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ This whole place can't be wired to just one circuit --
L291237 +++$+++ u5918 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Why?
L291236 +++$+++ u5925 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Three steps forward -- I want to get up there.
L291184 +++$+++ u5925 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Don't push it.
L291183 +++$+++ u5918 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I'm better than that.
L291182 +++$+++ u5925 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ And you're not really as large and useless as you seem.
L291027 +++$+++ u5918 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ I thought she was dead. For sure.
L291026 +++$+++ u5925 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Is she...alright?
L291090 +++$+++ u5922 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ MELISSA +++$+++ How'd you make your guest list, Price: throw darts at a phone book?
L291089 +++$+++ u5918 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Then what the hell are we doing here?
L291085 +++$+++ u5918 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Eddie Moses, Communications Attache -- which translated from ancient bullshit means: I work for a Messenger service.
L291084 +++$+++ u5922 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ MELISSA +++$+++ Melissa Margaret Marr, Celebrity.
L291042 +++$+++ u5922 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ MELISSA +++$+++ I hope not.
L291041 +++$+++ u5918 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ So, what? The thing with the glass? Price did that?
L291020 +++$+++ u5918 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ Cheer up: before the night's through, I'm sure one of us'll get hacked to pieces by somebody or something.
L291019 +++$+++ u5922 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ MELISSA +++$+++ ...birds. Just seagulls or something walking on the glass, goddammit.
L291016 +++$+++ u5922 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ MELISSA +++$+++ The guy whose hair I do has his own TV show. All I've got is a blow-dryer and a dream.
L291015 +++$+++ u5918 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ You've got your own TV show?
L291014 +++$+++ u5922 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ MELISSA +++$+++ I knew this whole place'd be pure gold! Pritchett, point me in the direction of the goddamn ghosts! If I can get something bizarre enough on tape, I think I can parlay it into getting me some kind'a Robert Stack "Unsolved Most- Wacked-Out Home Videos" gig. No more five afternoons a week of sex-change- Nazis-and-the-lesbos-that-love-'em.
L291001 +++$+++ u5922 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ MELISSA +++$+++ So where's the party?
L291000 +++$+++ u5918 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EDDIE +++$+++ ...Jesus H. Christ.
L291593 +++$+++ u5919 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Steven??
L291592 +++$+++ u5923 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Evelyn... Get up... NOW!
L291591 +++$+++ u5919 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ No. OhmyGod, Pritchett was right -- The house <u><b>IS</b></u> haunted.
L291590 +++$+++ u5923 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ No...
L291588 +++$+++ u5923 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ -- witnesses to what? You're already dead, Evelyn! Happy Birthday, baby --
L291587 +++$+++ u5919 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ -- wit...nesses --
L291586 +++$+++ u5923 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ -- just what you wanted everyone here to believe in the first place: I'm going to murder you, Evelyn, with the greatest of pleasure --
L291585 +++$+++ u5919 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ -- what...are...you...going...to --
L291584 +++$+++ u5923 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ -- anything, sweetheart, you need only speak --
L291583 +++$+++ u5919 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Steven --
L291339 +++$+++ u5919 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Funky little house, ain't it?  Friends, your hostess is now going to retire for what's left of the night. If you need me, I'll be in the bedroom upstairs -- but try and fight that need: the door'll be locked, I'll be trying to sleep, and if anyone so much as breathes in the keyhole, I'm gonna empty this thing into their fucking head. Thank you all for the bestest birthday a girl could have.
L291338 +++$+++ u5923 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ They weren't loaded when I put them in there!
L291337 +++$+++ u5919 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Question answered.
L291336 +++$+++ u5923 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Jesus!
L291334 +++$+++ u5919 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ -- thank you! All the cards finally on the goddamn table!
L291333 +++$+++ u5923 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ -- that wasn't my original plan, but it is starting to look more attractive --
L291332 +++$+++ u5919 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ -- oh, for chrissake, that's a given; we all know that knocking me off is the bottom line here --
L291331 +++$+++ u5923 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ If I had one, Evelyn, I think you know who'd be first and last --
L291330 +++$+++ u5919 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ -- and who's next on your list?
L291329 +++$+++ u5923 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ -- I pose you the same question --
L291328 +++$+++ u5919 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ I mean, did she stage it all for you and then go hide -- or did you just flat out kill the little bitch --
L291327 +++$+++ u5923 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Asking the wrong person again.
L291326 +++$+++ u5919 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Game, set and match, Steven. You've outdone yourself. And I know it's not good manners to ask the magician how he did it, but inquiring minds are desperate to know: just what did really happen to Ms. Marr?
L291289 +++$+++ u5919 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Stalking the wild poltergeist.
L291288 +++$+++ u5923 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Where is she?
L291287 +++$+++ u5919 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Fine with me. Just somebody then better go and round up Melissa Marr.
L291177 +++$+++ u5923 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ A simple leak, if it's okay with you.
L291176 +++$+++ u5919 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ And where are we off to, Mr. Price? Check the wiring on the animatronic Mummies?
L291171 +++$+++ u5923 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Only one way I can think of, Sweetheart.
L291170 +++$+++ u5919 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ So how's a girl to know if these things are loaded, baby?
L291163 +++$+++ u5919 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Must be getting old, Stevie -- you're repeating yourself -- this is the exact same set-up you used for the Son-Of-Sam Hunt back in '94.  Girlie, open up that casket there and see what you find.
L291162 +++$+++ u5923 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L291152 +++$+++ u5923 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ -- in the act.
L291151 +++$+++ u5919 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ -- the sadistic prick --
L291150 +++$+++ u5923 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Oh, no-no-no -- much more bang for everyone's buck to nail the bitch --
L291149 +++$+++ u5919 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Really? Well, let it rip.
L291148 +++$+++ u5923 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Huh. And here I had a completely different theory.
L291147 +++$+++ u5919 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Sure it wasn't. Hey, anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies? Don't raise your hands all at once.
L291146 +++$+++ u5923 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ -- asking the wrong guy -- wasn't me who closed it.
L291066 +++$+++ u5919 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ My guests were shredded. It's your sick little scene now, Steven: enjoy. I'm going to go run scalding water on the places you just touched me, and then I'm calling a cab.
L291065 +++$+++ u5923 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Now, there's the simple country gal I married. Let's go back down and greet your guests -- show them the real you: corny as Kansas on the Fourth of July.
L291064 +++$+++ u5923 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ I know.
L291063 +++$+++ u5919 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ You're hurting me.
L291062 +++$+++ u5923 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ -- just not always in the sexual sense.
L291061 +++$+++ u5923 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ You know everything you do gets me hot.
L291060 +++$+++ u5919 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Which part of that fantasy turns you on most: me with other men -- or just the other men?
L291059 +++$+++ u5923 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ You know how happy I'd be if that was really true, Evelyn? And how positively goddamn delirious if you weren't fucking every living thing in our area code at the same goddamn time!
L291058 +++$+++ u5919 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ All accidents until proven otherwise.
L291057 +++$+++ u5923 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Finding ways for me to die at these things is really your deal, isn't it? The "O.J." knife with the not-quite- retractable blade? Your "Jim Jones Kool- Aid" that was exactly that?
L291056 +++$+++ u5919 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ It you really loved me, Steven, you'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds.
L291055 +++$+++ u5923 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Sure know it wasn't me. And if you say it wasn't you -- then who the hell did, Evelyn?
L291054 +++$+++ u5919 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ What are you talking about? You think I invited them?
L291053 +++$+++ u5923 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ You tell me. I don't know how you managed to hack into my Mac, but: bravo.
L291052 +++$+++ u5919 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Then who are they?
L291051 +++$+++ u5923 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Well, not quite. See, those people down there: they aren't the ones I invited.
L291050 +++$+++ u5919 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ I guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you. Well, congratu-fucking-lations, Steven: Round One, you win.
L291049 +++$+++ u5923 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Shredded. Sorry. Decided to whip up one of my own: a group so hungry for money that they'd be willing to do anything. I thought you'd be more comfortable with your peers.
L291048 +++$+++ u5919 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ I gave you a goddamn guest list two pages long -- where the hell are they?
L291039 +++$+++ u5923 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Oh, I think we're going to have several.
L291038 +++$+++ u5919 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Could we have a word?
L291036 +++$+++ u5919 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Haven't they already?
L291035 +++$+++ u5923 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ You shouldn't be -- you were nearly just killed, sweetheart.  And now that our birthday girl is finally here, let the games begin!
L291034 +++$+++ u5919 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ I'm not laughing, Steven.
L291033 +++$+++ u5923 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ I'm impressed: I don't think Evelyn's ever said those words to anything with genitalia.
L291032 +++$+++ u5919 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Don't touch me!
L290945 +++$+++ u5919 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ EVELYN +++$+++ Oh. You think this is a request. Well, think again. I'm telling you: "Haunted Hill" is exactly where we're having my party this year. You'll find the guest list on your desk by the time you get back --
L290944 +++$+++ u5923 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ -- forget it. Last birthday the Manson Family Ranch, the year before that: Jonestown.
L290971 +++$+++ u5920 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ JENZEN +++$+++ Are you still fucking <b>here</b>??
L290970 +++$+++ u5925 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ ...wow....WOW! Hey, Ms. Jenzen -- ?

L290967 +++$+++ u5925 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ What?
L290966 +++$+++ u5920 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ JENZEN +++$+++ -- well, here's a better one: you're fired.
L290965 +++$+++ u5925 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ No, no, it's just --
L290964 +++$+++ u5920 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ JENZEN +++$+++ You think this is fucking funny??
L290957 +++$+++ u5920 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ JENZEN +++$+++ -- being utterly fucking useless, what else is new.
L290956 +++$+++ u5925 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ I was in the middle of --
L290955 +++$+++ u5920 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ JENZEN +++$+++ You didn't think to ask?
L290954 +++$+++ u5925 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ Messenger just dropped it off. No return address.
L290953 +++$+++ u5920 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ JENZEN +++$+++ Well, who's the damn thing <u>from</u>?
L290952 +++$+++ u5925 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ SARA +++$+++ I don't know, Ms. Jenzen.
L290932 +++$+++ u5923 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Maybe if I --
L290931 +++$+++ u5921 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ KIRSTEN +++$+++ Please! Something! Oh-God!
L290929 +++$+++ u5923 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Like what?? This isn't supposed to be happening!!
L290928 +++$+++ u5921 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ KIRSTEN +++$+++ Do something!
L290921 +++$+++ u5923 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ I've designed and built six of these places -- take my word for it, everything's fine.
L290920 +++$+++ u5921 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ KIRSTEN +++$+++ First time for everything.
L290916 +++$+++ u5923 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ I wouldn't be opening this place tomorrow if every single thing down to the beheaded Beanie Babies hadn't tested 100% safe.
L290915 +++$+++ u5921 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ KIRSTEN +++$+++ Sources have told this reporter that the real reason your Park's opening has been delayed was a near-fatal accident on one of the rides here. Comment?
L290913 +++$+++ u5923 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ I think it's something better experienced then described.
L290912 +++$+++ u5921 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ KIRSTEN +++$+++ And then what happens?
L290911 +++$+++ u5923 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Ever seen one that starts at the top? 20 stories worth of top?
L290909 +++$+++ u5923 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ Absolutely. No cheap thrills. A genuine Journey To The Brink Of Madness.
L290908 +++$+++ u5921 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ KIRSTEN +++$+++ Your roller coaster that is, quote: "unlike any that has ever come before it."
L290907 +++$+++ u5923 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ My wife. Where were we?
L290906 +++$+++ u5921 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ KIRSTEN +++$+++ Business or pleasure, Mr. Price?
L291597 +++$+++ u5924 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ PRITCHETT +++$+++ I am.
L291596 +++$+++ u5923 +++$+++ m391 +++$+++ PRICE +++$+++ He was right! Pritchett was right!
