L423083 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...
L423082 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ As far as they're concerned I do.  And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu.
L423081 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ You do?
L423080 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ This is such a mess.  I come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now I'm landed in it all over again.  For God's sake, I've got a boyfriend.
L423077 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Really?  The entire British press just woke up this morning and thought 'Hey -- I know where Anna Scott is.  She's in that house with the blue door in Notting Hill.'  And then you go out in your goddamn underwear.
L423076 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ That's not true.
L423075 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I do.  Your furry friend thought he'd make a buck or two telling the papers where I was.
L423074 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I don't know what happened.
L423073 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ How do you think I'm doing?
L423072 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ How are you doing?
L423064 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Jesus.
L423063 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Undressed like this, yes.
L423062 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Oh my God.  And they got a photo of you dressed like that?
L423060 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Don't ask.
L423059 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ What?
L423056 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Damn, I forgot the jam.
L423055 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Stay forever.
L423054 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Can I stay a bit longer?
L423051 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Oh.
L423050 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.
L423049 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me?
L423048 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Who was Gilda?
L423047 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Rita Hayworth used to say -- 'they go to bed with Gilda -- they wake up with me.' Do you feel that?
L423045 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Actually, I can't think really -- let me just have a quick look...
L423044 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
L423043 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ More than that actually, when you think about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair...
L423042 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ No seriously.  I mean, they're just breasts.  Every second person in the world has got them...
L423041 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Well...
L423040 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them?
L423039 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.
L423038 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ You and every person in this country.
L423037 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ It still strikes me as, well, surreal, that I'm allowed to see you naked.
L423035 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ What?
L423034 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Wow.
L423033 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ No! No.  Wait.  I... thought you were someone else.  I thought you were Spike. I'm delighted you're not.
L423032 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Okay.
L423031 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Oh please sod off.
L423014 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Right.
L423013 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Well, thank you.  Anyway -- time for bed.  Or... sofa-bed.
L423012 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Today has ben a good day.  Which under the circumstances is... unexpected.
L423011 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Both.
L423010 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?
L423009 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious.
L423008 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.
L423007 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
L423006 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own?
L423005 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
L423004 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ You have a stunt bottom?
L423003 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
L423002 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity?
L423001 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ The thing that's so irritating is that now I'm so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses.
L423000 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Big feet -- large shoes.
L422999 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ No.  What's that?
L422998 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ You know what they say about men with big feet?
L422997 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Yes.  Always have had.
L422996 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ You've got big feet.
L422991 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Yes -- happiness wouldn't be happiness without a violin-playing goat.
L422990 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ With a goat playing a violin.
L422989 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I do.  It feels like how being in love should be.  Floating through a dark blue sky.
L422988 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ You like Chagall?
L422986 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ And I think the book is the poorer for it.
L422985 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.'
L422984 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too.
L422983 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ You think I should do Henry James instead?
L422982 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Gripping.  It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping.
L422981 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ What do you think?
L422980 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Brilliant.  Word perfect I'd say.
L422979 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Well, get a message through to him too.
L422978 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Yup.
L422977 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ My son's name is Johnny?
L422976 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ 'Certainly.  And little Johnny?'
L422975 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ 'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever your name is, I promised little Jimmy I'd be home for his birthday -- could you get a message through that I may be a little late.'
L422974 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Cartwright.
L422973 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Damn.  'And Wainwright...'
L422972 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Eleven.
L422971 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ 'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I make?
L422970 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ 'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that on straightaway.'
L422969 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ 'No, turn over 4 TRS's and tell them we need radar feedback before the KFT's return at 19 hundred -- then inform the Pentagon that we'll be needing black star cover from ten hundred through 12.15' -- and don't you dare say one word about how many mistakes I made in that speech or I'll pelt you with olives.
L422968 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ 'Message from command.  Would you like them to send in the HKs?'
L422967 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Well done you.
L422966 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.
L422965 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Hand it over.  Basic plot?
L422964 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.
L422963 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Would you like me to take you through your lines?
L422962 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.
L422961 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I appreciate that absolutely.  Is that the film you're doing?
L422960 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Just anytime I've tried to keep things normal with anyone normal -- it's been a disaster.
L422959 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Oh no no -- no.
L422958 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I have thought about you.
L422957 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
L422956 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?
L422955 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ No, that's fine.  It's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star.  It was a thrill for me.  How is he?
L422954 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I'm really sorry about last time.  He just flew in -- I had no idea -- in fact, I had no idea if he'd ever fly in again.
L422948 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ A bath would be great.
L422947 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?
L422946 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like...
L422945 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Thank you.  I'm just in London for two days -- but, with your papers, it's the worse place to be.
L422944 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ This is the place.
L422943 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I don't know where to go.  The hotel is surrounded.
L422941 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Come in.
L422940 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Hi.  Can I come in?
L422887 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I think goodbye is traditional.
L422886 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I'm sorry... I don't know what to say.
L422885 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ -- this is a fairly strange reality to be faced with.  To be honest, I don't realize...
L422860 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Your boyfriend?
L422859 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room.
L422858 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Why?
L422857 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ You've got to go.
L422856 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ To be able to do that is such a wonderful thing.
L422852 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ There are lots of reasons.  Do you want to come up?
L422851 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.
L422850 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Here we are.  Do you want to come up?
L422849 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I don't know either.
L422848 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I don't know, I'm afraid.
L422847 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you?
L422846 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ No, you were brilliant
L422845 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I shouldn't have done that.  I shouldn't have done that.
L422837 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ No, that's fine.  I love that you tried... time was I'd have done the same.
L422836 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L422820 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Uh-oh.  That's not good.
L422819 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ She saw through me.
L422818 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Why?
L422817 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ She left me.
L422816 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ So who left who?
L422800 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Step aside.
L422799 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ It's a disease I've got -- it's a clinical thing.  I'm taking pills and having injections -- it won't last long.
L422797 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Exactly.  Here we go again.
L422796 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ There's no 'unless.'  No one has said "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets.
L422795 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I don't think so.  No one has said 'whoopsidaisies,' do they -- I mean unless they're...
L422794 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ You said 'whoopsidaisies.'
L422793 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ No, I didn't.
L422792 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Yes, you did.
L422791 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Nothing.
L422790 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ What did you say?
L422789 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Whoopsidaisies.
L422787 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Ahm...
L422786 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ You abide by rules like that?
L422785 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.
L422784 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Let's go in.
L422783 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Gardens.  All these streets round here have these mysterious communal gardens in the middle of them. They're like little villages.
L422781 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I was.
L422780 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I thought you were leaving.
L422779 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Busy tomorrow?
L422778 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ That's fine.
L422777 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Too complicated.
L422775 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ You know, I'm not sure.  I don't think they'd tried for kids before, as fate would have it.
L422774 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?
L422773 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.
L422772 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Why is she in a wheelchair?
L422771 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ It's the hair!  It's to do with the hair.
L422770 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Floppy, huh?
L422751 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Well, I've been on a diet since I was nineteen, which means basically I've been hungry for a decade.  I've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one of whom hit me: and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment. Meantime, it cost millions to get me looking like this...
L422750 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ You'll have to prove it.  This is a great brownie and I'm going to fight for it.  State your claim.
L422665 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Okay.
L422664 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Okay.
L422663 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I'm sure it's all right.  My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.
L422662 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ If that's all right.
L422661 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?
L422660 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.
L422659 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ But no, I'm sure I can get out of it.
L422658 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Okay -- fine.
L422657 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Oh well, great.  Perfect.  Oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be having dinner.
L422656 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Ahm.  That thing I was doing tonight -- I'm not doing it any more.  I told them I had to spend the evening with Britain's premier equestrian journalist.
L422620 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Thank you.  You are 'Horse and Hound's' favorite actress.  You and Black Beauty.  Tied.
L422619 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Well, it was nice to meet you. Surreal but nice.
L422618 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Yes.
L422617 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Are you busy tonight?
L422611 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ And what happens next in the dream?
L422610 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I'm just a complete moron.  Sorry. This is the sort of thing that happens in dreams -- not in real life.  Good dreams, obviously -- it's a dream to see you.
L422606 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Absolutely fine about it.
L422605 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
L422604 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they thrust this thing into my hand -- I didn't know what to do.
L422603 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Obviously.  Very difficult.
L422602 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.
L422601 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Right.  Ahm... the film's great... and I just wondered -- whether you ever thought of having more... horses in it?
L422595 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ No, it's a stupid privacy thing.  I always choose a cartoon character -- last time out, I was Mrs. Bambi.
L422594 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Sorry about not ringing back.  The whole two-names concept was totally too much for my flatman's pea-sized intellect.
L422592 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I brought these, but clearly...
L422591 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Hello.
L422590 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Hi.
L422568 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Right.  Great.  Classic.  Classic.
L422567 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try.  Four o'clock could be good.
L422566 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?
L422565 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Oh -- Okay.
L422564 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life.  Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message.
L422563 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.
L422562 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Oh hi.  It's William Thacker.  We, ahm I work in a bookshop.
L422561 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Hi.
L422560 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Hello.  Hi.  Hi.
L422507 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Bye.
L422506 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.
L422505 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Probably best not tell anyone about this.
L422499 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Don't worry about it.  I thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpoint.
L422498 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I apologize for the 'surreal but nice' comment.  Disaster...
L422497 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ Thanks.  Well...
L422496 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Here we go.
L422495 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Oh right.
L422494 +++$+++ u6896 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ ANNA +++$+++ I forgot my bag.
L422493 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Oh hi.  Forget something?
L422489 +++$+++ u6912 +++$+++ m462 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ Yes.  Well.  My pleasure.
