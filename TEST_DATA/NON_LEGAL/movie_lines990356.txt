L553746 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Wait, Sooze, I, I have to talk to you, 'cause I, there's something I figured out.
L553731 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ Mm.
L553730 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I, yeah.
L553729 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ Oh, yeah?
L553728 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ And I fig- and I figured something out.
L553727 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ Mm-hm.
L553726 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ No, I mean it. No, look, when, when I got out of the car I walked all the way here.
L553725 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ What?
L553724 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ But wait! Sooze, I don't wanna fight. I'm so sorry.
L553723 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ Mm. I enjoyed the ride. Sorry you didn't.
L553722 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ No, no. I just got sick and tired of listening to that demo tape over and over again, you know? I mean, I felt like a fucking groupie, you know.
L553721 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ Gee, Jeff, I thought you were gonna go take a piss, not join some alcoholic nudist colony.
L553715 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ Hey, where did you go? We were worried about you.
L553714 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Oh, hi. I thought you guys got lost.
L553549 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ Why don't you just try? Please. For me. Come on.
L553548 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.
L553547 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.
L553546 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ No. No, no, no.
L553545 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ Come on.
L553521 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ So you sold ninety thousand units. So what? Does that mean you're a genius? You're a great artist? You're higher up the ladder? You got an extra gold star on your fuckin' forehead?
L553520 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ Jeff!
L553519 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ FUCK! Pony, if we wanted to hear you sing, we would've gone to your concert!
L553499 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ No, I don't.
L553498 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ You do.
L553497 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ No, I don't.
L553496 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ Yes, you do.
L553495 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ No, I don't.
L553494 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ Jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.
L553493 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Yeah, but that doesn't mean that your tree is not artistic if no one cuts it down.
L553360 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ Mm.
L553359 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Yeah, uh, that would depend, but yeah. She should.
L553230 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I don't know.
L553229 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ So you and I can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the Sizzler? What are we doing, Jeff? You and me?
L553228 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ No, no.
L553227 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ So I can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist?
L553226 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Mm-mm.
L553225 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield?
L553224 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ So, what, why can't you do that here? What's wrong with here? Why is somewhere else better?
L553223 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ My goal is to make art.
L553222 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?
L553221 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?
L553220 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Mm-hm.
L553219 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ New ground?
L553218 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground.
L553217 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ No one does nothing, Jeff.
L553216 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Nothing.
L553215 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ So what do you wanna do?
L553214 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ No, no, see, that's not what I'm saying. I could go to New York if I wanted to, but what's the point? So I can learn how to order a cappuccino? So I can get mugged by some crackhead? So I can see, see homeless people up close and personal?
L553213 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ Come with me.
L553212 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ And?
L553211 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ Of course.
L553210 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Us.
L553209 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ What feelings?
L553208 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Did it ever occur to you that I might have some feelings about you moving to New York?
L553207 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ What?
L553206 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Sooze.
L553205 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. I could swing that. Six-fifty.
L553204 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ ... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there.
L553203 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ Jeff. Jeff.
L553202 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I don't know. I would've done something. This is kind of hypothetical, isn't it? This place is so stupid. I can't believe we're sitting here in this mosh-pit of consumerism. With all these people eating their chunks of dead flesh...
L553201 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ How?
L553200 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I would've stopped it.
L553199 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ Okay, what would you have done.
L553198 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Yeah.
L553197 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ Oh, yeah?
L553196 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Okay, but nothing happened. Believe me, if I thought something really bad was going to happen, I would've done something.
L553195 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ It got that close.
L553194 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ It was just something that got out of hand. Did anyone get hurt?
L553193 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ It was a racial incident.
L553156 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Tim!
L553155 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ This is ridiculous!
L553128 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ Okay. Well, you know, he's always been a nice guy and I like him.
L553127 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start.
L553126 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ Um, because you didn't want to go.
L553125 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Well, if you love him so much, why didn't you go see him play?
L553124 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ I can't wait till Pony gets here, you know? Have a conversation with a human being?
L553116 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ Typical male.
L553115 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Can I talk?
L553114 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ You know, all you know is what's good for you.
L553113 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Can I talk here? Let me talk.
L553112 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.
L553111 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I stand for honesty! I stand for some level of truth!
L553110 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ What? What do you stand for?
L553109 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Yes, I stand for -
L553108 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ But do you stand for anything?
L553107 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ No, no, no. I'm not being cynical, I'm being honest.
L553106 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.
L553105 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ No, idealism is guilty, middle class bullshit.
L553102 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ I'm talking about idealism.
L553101 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Hey!
L553100 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ Your completely missing the point.
L553099 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ One!
L553098 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ God, KAREN JOHNSON.
L553097 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Name one.
L553096 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ Of course I do!
L553093 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ Sexual politics, racism, the environment, the military industrial...
L553092 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Like what?
L553091 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ About things that are important to me.
L553090 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ About what?
L553089 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ Yes, you asshole.
L553086 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ I'm trying to communicate how I feel, Jeff. You know raise consciousness. Make people think for a change.
L553085 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ No, no. It's an honest question. What are you trying to communicate?
L553084 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ So you can give me more shit?
L553083 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ What are you trying to communicate? Tell us.
L553078 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ Well, fuck! Might as well not do anything! Let's just stick out thumbs up our asses and twirl.
L553077 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Oh, well, then you better listen to him.
L553076 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ Mister Brooks has had shows in New York, Jeff. He's been reviewed in Art Forum. I think he knows.
L553075 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ No, no, no. Y-you know what? Y-your packing your bags, you're jumping into the unknown because some conceptual artist who teaches at a community college is having a mid-life crisis and he wants to sleep with some girl half his age, so he tells you you have talent.
L553074 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ I don't want to hear it anymore.
L553073 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ "The worst I can do is starve to death." Listen to you.
L553070 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ I'm not doing it anywhere, Jeff. It's just part of my application to the School of Visual Arts in New York.
L553069 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Your sure as hell right about that.
L553068 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ It's a piece.
L553067 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Yeah, man, male, significant other, whatever the fuck I am.
L553066 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ Man?
L553065 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ No, not, not everything. This. I am the man in your life.
L553062 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Yes.
L553061 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ No.
L553060 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Was that supposed to be me?
L553050 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Okay, so maybe later.
L553049 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ No. I'm not going to the van, it's so gross. Come on. I'm doing my performance right now.
L553048 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Sorry. Let's go back to the van right now.
L553047 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ I hate that.
L553046 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Oh! Trim it!
L553045 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I know, I know, I know.
L553044 +++$+++ u7940 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ SOOZE +++$+++ You could've come over.
L553043 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ God, I haven't seen you all day.
L553743 +++$+++ u7938 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ PONY +++$+++ I'm gonna go to the car for a 'sec. I'll be right back.
L553742 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I don't know.
L553720 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I don't know.
L553719 +++$+++ u7938 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ PONY +++$+++ Hey, where's Erica?
L553646 +++$+++ u7938 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ PONY +++$+++ Burnfield. No place like it.
L553645 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Fuck 'em. Fucking assholes.
L553644 +++$+++ u7938 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ PONY +++$+++ Oh, no, no. Uh, uh, George, pull over.
L553643 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I'm sorry. I, I gotta...
L553642 +++$+++ u7938 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ PONY +++$+++ Oh, yeah.
L553641 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I gotta take a piss. Do you mind if we pull over really quickly?
L553541 +++$+++ u7938 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ PONY +++$+++ Why don't you come with us, man? I mean, I want to hear about those songs you've been working on. You too, Buff.
L553540 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.
L553539 +++$+++ u7938 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ PONY +++$+++ George can drive us. There's plenty of room in the car. Jeff?
L553536 +++$+++ u7938 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ PONY +++$+++ Look, man, it... Shit. Why don't we get something to eat? I mean food?
L553535 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey.
L553534 +++$+++ u7938 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ PONY +++$+++ Oh, no, man, look. Look, you know, it's me, okay? I come out here and I'm, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and I think I'm a fucking star, man, and I'm really sorry if I'm full of attitude. I, I really...
L553533 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ No, man. Hey. No, you know what? Hey, it's you, man. It's, you know what, you know what it is? It's this tarpit of stupidity that we're all stuck in. It's this cell. It's this void, you know.
L553490 +++$+++ u7938 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ PONY +++$+++ You know what I'm saying?
L553489 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ W-wait a minute, wait a minute.
L553486 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Of course it does.
L553485 +++$+++ u7938 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ PONY +++$+++ Well, I, I didn't say I was special, but it's one thing, you know, and it's another thing to actually communicate it to people. You know what I mean? If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does that make a sound?
L553484 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special?
L553483 +++$+++ u7938 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ PONY +++$+++ What?
L553482 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Yeah, well, that's what I do too.
L553481 +++$+++ u7938 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ PONY +++$+++ I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.
L553480 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
L553479 +++$+++ u7938 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ PONY +++$+++ What do you mean?
L553478 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ So who are you?
L553424 +++$+++ u7938 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ PONY +++$+++ No, no, they, uh, you know, that can be kind of a hassle, so , uh, you know, I just stay at the Four Seasons. It's easier.
L553423 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ So, um, Pony, where are you staying? Are you staying at your mother's house?
L553388 +++$+++ u7938 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ PONY +++$+++ Well, I mean, we jammed a couple of times. You know, I mean, you play harmonica, but that was before we were really a band, you know, before Danny signed us.
L553387 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ For a while.
L553386 +++$+++ u7938 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ PONY +++$+++ Well, not exactly.
L553385 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Well, I helped start it, but, you know, uh...
L553332 +++$+++ u7938 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ PONY +++$+++ Yeah, maybe later.  Hey! Hey!
L553331 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Great.
L553330 +++$+++ u7938 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ PONY +++$+++ Yeah.
L553329 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Now?
L553328 +++$+++ u7938 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ PONY +++$+++ Yeah, really.
L553327 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Really?
L553326 +++$+++ u7938 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ PONY +++$+++ Yeah. You should show 'em to me.
L553325 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Yeah, they could be songs.
L553324 +++$+++ u7938 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ PONY +++$+++ Like songs?
L553323 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Write. 'Cause I, I have written some things.
L553322 +++$+++ u7938 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ PONY +++$+++ What?
L553321 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ So you think I should?
L553316 +++$+++ u7938 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ PONY +++$+++ No, man, I mean it. You're a good writer. I remember those things you'd write during honors English. Funny shit.
L553315 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ You know, I've thought about that, actually.
L553312 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ I dropped out. I mean, uh, you know, this semester I'm taking a, a class, you know, three nights a week. But I'm just try-trying to think and work on stuff., you know? I've been doing some writing, though. Short pieces, you know.
L553311 +++$+++ u7938 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ PONY +++$+++ So how's college?
L553310 +++$+++ u7936 +++$+++ m537 +++$+++ JEFF +++$+++ Sorry.
