L656823 +++$+++ u8925 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ PEMBERTON +++$+++ Yes, me!
L656822 +++$+++ u8919 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ ARTEMUS +++$+++ Terribly sorry.  I'm always sticking this where it doesn't belong.  Federal agents, ma'am.  We're rescuing a kidnap victim...
L657095 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ Well, let's help them with that. Take the legs.
L657094 +++$+++ u8920 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ They don't even realize they should be frightened.
L657093 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ I could get used to this, looking down on people.
L656762 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ Wonderful!  Our new friend from the wild west.  Please...
L656761 +++$+++ u8920 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ Here.  Mr. Tyler.  He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.
L656760 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ Anyone?
L656749 +++$+++ u8920 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ We'll see.
L656748 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ A new friend?
L657128 +++$+++ u8920 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ Fine, I'll stop.
L657127 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You know, I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me.
L656910 +++$+++ u8920 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ I try.  Please, if you promise to protect me, I'll testify against him. I'll give you an ironclad case.
L656909 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You bring the best out in a man.
L656908 +++$+++ u8920 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ My.  It's gotten longer.
L656905 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Really?  Like General Garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting?
L656904 +++$+++ u8920 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ She's perfectly safe.
L656789 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I've had some practice.
L656788 +++$+++ u8920 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ You've... done... this... before.
L656787 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Oh, I would hope not.
L656786 +++$+++ u8920 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ Would that include me?
L656785 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Just a little insurance... against the unexpected.
L656782 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I suppose so.  But life can be hard for a man, too.
L656781 +++$+++ u8920 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ Thank you.  But the truth is, I'm a single woman in a man's world. That leaves me very few choices, doesn't it?
L656780 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Forgive me, but you don't strike me as the social secretary type.
L656779 +++$+++ u8920 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ I'm not so sure Dr. Loveless would like to find his social secretary dancing in the dark with an uninvited stranger.
L656778 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You tell me.
L656777 +++$+++ u8920 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler?
L656774 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I don't like to lose, either.
L656773 +++$+++ u8920 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ You must excuse the Doctor.  No one has ever beaten him at his little game.
L656743 +++$+++ u8920 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ You most certainly do.
L656742 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Well, I owe you one, don't I?
L656741 +++$+++ u8920 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ Oh, don't worry.  I've already overlooked the fact your name's not actually on our guest list.
L656740 +++$+++ u8920 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ Yes, in a way.  I'm the Doctor's social secretary.  I handle his correspondence, send out the invitations, you know.
L656739 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Your guests, ma'am?
L656738 +++$+++ u8920 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ Well, sir, you are proving to be one of my more interesting guests.
L656735 +++$+++ u8920 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ My... the wild west.
L656734 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory.  Texas.
L656733 +++$+++ u8920 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ Really?
L656732 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Please do.  I'm a man who appreciates a good firearm.
L656731 +++$+++ u8920 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ I don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before.
L656730 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.
L656729 +++$+++ u8920 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ CASSANDRA +++$+++ I get that feeling.  You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.
L656728 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ My name's Tyler.  Frank Tyler. Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
L657105 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I would, Mr. Doyle!  Are you game?
L657104 +++$+++ u8921 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?
L656618 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ My friend?
L656617 +++$+++ u8921 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Doyle's the name, sir.  Of the Connemara Doyles.  And there's not a man riding the rails who holds a candle to meself.  That having been said, sir, you're five minutes late so let's be on our way!  Your friend's already aboard.
L656616 +++$+++ u8921 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ That would be correct.  Orders from the President himself.  Trans- portation at your beck and call. No delays.  Although, the government's generosity takes me a tad by surprise, as well.
L656615 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Private train?
L656614 +++$+++ u8921 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Your private train, sir.
L656613 +++$+++ u8921 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ DOYLE +++$+++ Well, Captain, then the answer is your train is still here.
L656612 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Look, I'm Captain James West...
L656594 +++$+++ u8922 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ A mistake?  To assign this case to the man who blew up all the bridges on the Chattanooga River and single- handedly trapped Jackson's entire cavalry?  How is that a mistake?
L656593 +++$+++ u8926 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ RICHARDS +++$+++ Why surely, Mr. President, there must be some mistake.  I mean...
L656584 +++$+++ u8922 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ French?  Damn it, I want my own man on this case.  Somebody I trust. Somebody who doesn't mind breaking up the furniture!
L656583 +++$+++ u8926 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ RICHARDS +++$+++ Yes sir.
L656582 +++$+++ u8922 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ French?
L656581 +++$+++ u8926 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ RICHARDS +++$+++ Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man.  And he's no ordinary Marshal.  He's quite sophisticated.  Three college degrees.  A master of disguise. Speaks French...
L656580 +++$+++ u8922 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Listen, in two days I'm embarking on a tour of the western territories.  And I want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence.
L656579 +++$+++ u8926 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ RICHARDS +++$+++ Well, yes sir.  A Professor Morton, but with just a little more time, sir, I can assure you a breakthrough on this case...
L656578 +++$+++ u8922 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Don't try to bamboozle me, Colonel. Has another scientist been kidnapped or not?
L656963 +++$+++ u8922 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ He didn't.  That's your job.  I'm taking you off that other case until you've nabbed this lunatic. Good luck.  Nice train.  But mine's nicer.
L656962 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Where'd he say he was going to do this?
L656958 +++$+++ u8922 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ On my way to Denver...
L656957 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ ... well, of course you can.  Mr. President, what a surprise.  What brings you here?
L656607 +++$+++ u8922 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ And now the job's yours.
L656606 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ And?
L656605 +++$+++ u8922 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Goddamnit!  What am I doing?  What's happened to all my cigars?  Colonel Richards here has had a dozen agents on these cases for over a year.  No arrests, no leads, no clues...
L656604 +++$+++ u8922 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Part of some speech they wrote for this trip I'm taking.
L656603 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Nicely said, sir.
L656602 +++$+++ u8922 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ We find ourselves at the dawn of the Golden Age of Science.  And it is the God-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way!
L656601 +++$+++ u8922 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ Exactly.  Any number of nations would love to cripple our scientific growth.  And what better way to tip the scales in their favor than by killing off the greatest minds this country has produced.
L656600 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ But what would anyone have to gain from all this...?  Unless it were a foreign power.
L656592 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Nice to finally meet you, sir.
L656591 +++$+++ u8922 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ This is Colonel Richards.
L656590 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Good work.  Really.
L656589 +++$+++ u8922 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ GRANT +++$+++ That'll be all, boys.
L656588 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Mr. President, good to see you again, sir.  Sorry about all that.
L657140 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ Easy?  Easy?  On just what grounds should I take it easy!?
L657139 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Easy now.
L657027 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ So, I'm the only one here who can tell the difference between an Emperor and a murderer?
L657026 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ Because I am holding all the western territories hostage, Mr. West!  A town a day will disappear!  Willard was merely a test run, a stroll in the park.  Next, I level all of Albuquerque!  Yes, that's right.  Only yesterday I learned what you undoubtedly already know: your own President will be there.  What an added bonus! The gods are shining on me!  After tomorrow every American citizen will rise up and demand I be given back my humble little empire!
L657025 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?
L657024 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ The first.
L657023 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ "Emperor Miguelito...?"
L657022 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ I've even printed my own currency.
L657019 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ Call it what you like.  The point is, I was heir to that land, Mr. West.  It belonged to my beloved grandmother!  Now I intend to have it back.  My own country!
L657018 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ That would be... the Mexican War?
L657017 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ These lands were taken by force from Mexico in the illegal War of American Aggression.
L657016 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ Exactly!  You are on foreign soil. You are a representative of the occupying forces.  Or haven't you checked a map lately?!
L657015 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ The U.S. is my jurisdiction.
L657013 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Has it penetrated yours that I'm holding a gun on their leader?
L657012 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers?  You are in my domain!
L657011 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You got that right.  Now get up. We're walking out of here.
L657010 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ Philistine.
L657009 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ He had a pressing engagement.
L657008 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ Still alive.  Hmm.  I suppose that doesn't bode well for poor Bruno.
L657006 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ Restrain yourself, Voltaire.  He's just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant.
L657005 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You're not that big.
L656940 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Dr. Loveless?
L656939 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ ... And do give me some room, Voltaire.  You're breathing on my head!  I hate it when you breath on my head!
L656927 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ Talk?  About what...?  Oh!  About who you are and all that?
L656926 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Why don't we just cut this routine short?  Whatever you do to us, we're not going to talk.
L656769 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ How embarrassing.  Did I hold up three fingers?
L656768 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ Sir... I believe you have only two barrels.
L656766 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I deal with some tough customers.
L656765 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ Really?  Must be a dangerous business.
L656764 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ No, sir... just a businessman.
L656763 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ Very good, sir!  I think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade.
L656757 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ Thank you.  I confess to a preoccupation with acquiring precisely that which the world says I cannot have.
L656756 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I must compliment you on Miss Thompson... an exceptionally charming assistant.
L656754 +++$+++ u8924 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ MIGUELITO +++$+++ When you're three and a half feet tall, sir, life turns you into a comedian whether you like it or not.... Come with me, won't you?
L656753 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I admire a man with a sense of humor.
L657076 +++$+++ u8925 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ PEMBERTON +++$+++ You don't know what he's built?! Surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this.
L657075 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I beg your pardon?
L657042 +++$+++ u8925 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ PEMBERTON +++$+++ It is?
L657041 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Now it's a bomb.
L657040 +++$+++ u8925 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ PEMBERTON +++$+++ It's a smelting retort.
L657039 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ This is something.
L657038 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ He's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out.
L657037 +++$+++ u8925 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ PEMBERTON +++$+++ He... he's planning to kill us, isn't he?
L657034 +++$+++ u8925 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ PEMBERTON +++$+++ For the moment.  But I fear not for long.  I'm of no use to him now.
L657033 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Are you all right?
L656843 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ A glass eye?  That's who it was! One-Eyed Jack Garrison.  Otherwise known as General Garrison, Confederate Third Army.  I saw him at Dr. Loveless' party, but I couldn't place him.  He used to wear an eye-patch.
L656842 +++$+++ u8925 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ PEMBERTON +++$+++ A Southern gentlemen.  I don't recall his name.  I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.
L656841 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Who was this partner of his?
L656840 +++$+++ u8925 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ PEMBERTON +++$+++ I only met him once, but that was enough.  For such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself.  He offered me the "rare and unparalleled opportunity" to develop a new steam engine for him.  He claims to have some sort of factory in Texas, I believe. Said I could have the run of the place.  He had all sorts of specifications.  But when I questioned him closely, it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman.  Both he and his partner had no real love of steam.  It's sad.  So few men do.
L656831 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ We'll explain on the way.
L656830 +++$+++ u8925 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ PEMBERTON +++$+++ Who were they?  What do they want with me?
L656829 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.
L656819 +++$+++ u8925 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ PEMBERTON +++$+++ Yes!
L656818 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Dr. Pemberton?
L656549 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Right.
L656548 +++$+++ u8927 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ WALTERS +++$+++ Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...
L656547 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You're not going to use it, are you?
L656546 +++$+++ u8927 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ WALTERS +++$+++ Hey...!
L656545 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ In an hour they're gone!
L656544 +++$+++ u8927 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ WALTERS +++$+++ They're rounding up a posse.  Figure an hour?
L656543 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ When are they coming?
L656542 +++$+++ u8927 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ WALTERS +++$+++ They're coming.
L656541 +++$+++ u8923 +++$+++ m607 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Well?
L657837 +++$+++ u8928 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ AIRK +++$+++ Let's go.
L657836 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Thank you, friend.
L657835 +++$+++ u8928 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ AIRK +++$+++ Thought you might get lonely, Mad- martigan!
L657834 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Out for a little ride in the coun- try, Airk?
L657782 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Just get me some horses.
L657781 +++$+++ u8928 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ AIRK +++$+++ You're chasing a dream.
L657779 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Then come with us.
L657778 +++$+++ u8928 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ AIRK +++$+++ You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan? I've lost half my men fighting Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock- maar army.  Now you and this Peck, and that magpie up in the rafters, are gonna take 'em on alone?
L657769 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ They're not after me.  They want the baby.
L657768 +++$+++ u8928 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ AIRK +++$+++ It's you they're after, Madmarti- gan.  What did you do this time?
L657763 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Is this what's left of your army?
L657762 +++$+++ u8928 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ AIRK +++$+++ You managed alright.
L657761 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ You left me to die, friend.
L657369 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Gimme a sword, Airk.  I'll win your war for you.
L657368 +++$+++ u8928 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ AIRK +++$+++ Hey, remember?  You don't need my help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit trap like this?  Come on!  I could open it for you, but I wouldn't wanna insult you!
L657367 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Airk!  Come on, Airk.  Lemme outa here.
L657365 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Least I'm not down there herding sheep!
L657364 +++$+++ u8928 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ AIRK +++$+++ I always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage.
L657363 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Nothing you wouldn't have done it my place!
L657362 +++$+++ u8928 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ AIRK +++$+++ Madmartigan!  What did you do this time?
L657361 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ He thought you were a woman, Airk!
L657360 +++$+++ u8928 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ AIRK +++$+++ We're going into battle, little one.  Find a woman to take care of it.
L657457 +++$+++ u8929 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ CHERLINDREA +++$+++ Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone.
L657456 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ They look like acorns.
L657454 +++$+++ u8929 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ CHERLINDREA +++$+++ My prsence cannot extend beyond this forest.  But I can give you these...
L657453 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Why can't you do it?  You have mag- ical powers.
L657452 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ No I'm not.  Have you really looked at me?  I'm short!  Even for a Nelwyn!
L657451 +++$+++ u8929 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ CHERLINDREA +++$+++ You are very important, Willow.
L657450 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.
L657449 +++$+++ u8929 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ CHERLINDREA +++$+++ The way has been lost in time. But there is one person, a druid sor- ceress, who might guide you there. She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda many years ago.  Her name is Fin Raziel.
L657446 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ What is Tir Asleen?
L657445 +++$+++ u8929 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ CHERLINDREA +++$+++ You are the guardian, Willow.  You must take her to Tir Asleen.
L657444 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Me?
L657443 +++$+++ u8929 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ CHERLINDREA +++$+++ No, Willow.  Your journey has just begun.  It has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose evil powers have darkened our world.  Upon you depends this princess's life.
L657441 +++$+++ u8929 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ CHERLINDREA +++$+++ She belongs to all of us.  She is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth.
L657440 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ You mean, you know who this baby belongs to?
L657434 +++$+++ u8929 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ CHERLINDREA +++$+++ I hope you are comfortable here, inside my kingdom...
L657433 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Yes...?
L657432 +++$+++ u8929 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ CHERLINDREA +++$+++ Willow Ufgood.
L657291 +++$+++ u8930 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ HIGH ALDWIN +++$+++ Waste magic on revenge?  You have much to learn, Willow...
L657290 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad!
L657289 +++$+++ u8930 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ HIGH ALDWIN +++$+++ Go in the direction the bird is flying.
L657288 +++$+++ u8930 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ HIGH ALDWIN +++$+++ Real magic, Willow, is simply the art of controlling the reality of others.  You lack faith in your- self.  You must learn to trust your intuition.
L657287 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ I don't want courage.  I don't want to be a warrior.  All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!
L657286 +++$+++ u8930 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ HIGH ALDWIN +++$+++ You're strong enough.  But you're going to need courage, Willow.
L657285 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this?
L657284 +++$+++ u8930 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ HIGH ALDWIN +++$+++ Now, you know where you're going?  Down there, through those trees, follow the river.  You'll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc- ture.  Willow, this is serious business.  Don't waste any time, the outer world is no place for a Nelwyn.  Give the baby to the first daikini you see, then hurry home as fast as you can.
L657256 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ My family found this baby in the river, High Aldwin.
L657255 +++$+++ u8930 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ HIGH ALDWIN +++$+++ Earlier today you tried to tell me something, Willow.
L657238 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ It's a matter of great importance to me!
L657237 +++$+++ u8930 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ HIGH ALDWIN +++$+++ Not today, Willow.
L657236 +++$+++ u8937 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ WILLOW +++$+++ Sir!  I have to talk to you.
L657890 +++$+++ u8935 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ SORSHA +++$+++ I have no family.
L657889 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ We'll probably die here, Sorsha.
L657824 +++$+++ u8935 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ SORSHA +++$+++ Madmartigan.
L657823 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Sorsha.
L657743 +++$+++ u8935 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ SORSHA +++$+++ I don't believe you.
L657742 +++$+++ u8931 +++$+++ m608 +++$+++ MADMARTIGAN +++$+++ Because it's true.
