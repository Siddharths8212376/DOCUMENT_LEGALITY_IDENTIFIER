L100128 +++$+++ u4180 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.
L100127 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ We're not doing it! I'm not even sure it's Christian.
L100126 +++$+++ u4180 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Not to mention people driving over her and doggies doing their business --
L100115 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Well, no one in my family did! Dad bought cemetery plots at Oak Ridge. One for him, one for mom.
L100114 +++$+++ u4180 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ My Jewish friend's grandmother did.
L100094 +++$+++ u4180 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I simply can not stand that tone!
L100093 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Oh Jesus.
L100092 +++$+++ u4180 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!
L100091 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ SO!
L100090 +++$+++ u4180 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Well, why don't I just say black so you can say white!  Don't be surprised to find your brother hasn't changed an iota. He hardly ever talks and when he does it's in that tone! You should have heard him at lunch -- not two words until the bill came and then he says, "Worth every penny."
L100089 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ It's not that long.
L100088 +++$+++ u4180 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Well, that's a long time.
L100087 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ We were here two Christmases ago.
L100086 +++$+++ u4180 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Boy. It sure has been a long time.
L100085 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Then we should have had lunch at the bank.
L100084 +++$+++ u4180 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Michael doesn't understand. People who make the kind of money my brother makes don't carry money on them. They keep it all in various accounts.
L100083 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I nearly died when we split the bill.
L100082 +++$+++ u4180 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No, we just had lunch at the hotel with my brother and his new wife. She told me all the dirt. I forgot how interesting things can get around here. It was so good to see them. The last time we visited they were in Europe. He is doing so well. He ordered champagne. For lunch! I nearly died.
L100158 +++$+++ u4181 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ No. You can have them.
L100157 +++$+++ u4180 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Carolyn -- you want these candlesticks?
L100156 +++$+++ u4181 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ Aw, Betty.
L100155 +++$+++ u4180 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I do not need instructions from you to bathe!  I knew you'd do this! I knew I'd come all the way here and be shut out as usual! I came to be here for you! I didn't have to come!  Lord knows I was never much welcome in this house before. Apparently dead or alive, nothing's changed.
L100141 +++$+++ u4181 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ No.
L100140 +++$+++ u4180 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ No treasure maps, huh?
L100139 +++$+++ u4181 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ Oh, just a old letter from a friend.
L100121 +++$+++ u4181 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ Mr. Peterson, are you sure mama wrote all this?
L100120 +++$+++ u4180 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ How bizarre!
L100110 +++$+++ u4181 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ I know. I don't understand it either.
L100109 +++$+++ u4180 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ Eeeww!
L100097 +++$+++ u4181 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ I'm sure you haven't done anything. Have some iced tea. How are the kids?
L100096 +++$+++ u4180 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ BETTY +++$+++ I am so sick and tired of apologizing and not knowing what I've done!
L100623 +++$+++ u4181 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ You're right -- that is sick.
L100622 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ What about me! I feel really weird. Like she cheated on me, not dad. Isn't that sick? I don't mean I wanted to sleep with her or anything but -- ya know -- being the only son. You're sort of made to feel like you're the prince of the kingdom, ya know? And in the back of your mind, you kind of think your mother doesn't need sex anymore because she has you.
L100621 +++$+++ u4181 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ -- for over twenty years because that's what I was taught -- you stick with it! Normal people don't get divorced. I can't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to Europe, for Christ's sake -- quite frankly, I don't think he ever did! And now I find out in between bake sales, my mother was Anais Nin!
L100620 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Carolyn!
L100619 +++$+++ u4181 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ What gets me is I'm 46 years old. I've been in this crummy fucking marriage -
L100618 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Only about a thousand times. What do I do now? "What's good enough for mom is good enough for me?"
L100617 +++$+++ u4181 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ Did we want to?
L100616 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Everything was during Betty. God we were so young. Why did we think we had to do it all so fast? I've never cheated on Betty. Not once we were married, I mean.
L100615 +++$+++ u4181 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ Was this during Betty?
L100614 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Nobody did.
L100613 +++$+++ u4181 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ I never knew that.
L100612 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Not officially. Her and Steve Kendall were pinned at birth. But I was crazy about her. And for about three months, I managed to catch her during her "exploring" stage.
L100611 +++$+++ u4181 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ You never dated Kathy Reynolds!
L100610 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I used to love this place. I used to take Kathy Reynolds down here.
L100609 +++$+++ u4181 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ I think I better. Between the book and the coffee, I'm this close to raping the busboy.
L100608 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Not yet. You want to go?
L100607 +++$+++ u4181 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ Boy. All these years I've resented not living the wild life in some place like Paris and all the time I could've moved back to Iowa... Are you drunk?
L100606 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I bet mom could've helped her.
L100605 +++$+++ u4181 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ You mean -- she didn't like sex?
L100604 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ He remarried. Apparently they were having an affair for years. Apparently the first Mrs. Delaney was a bit of a stiff.
L100603 +++$+++ u4181 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ Yeah. But I thought she died.
L100602 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I found out who Lucy Delaney is.  Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road?
L100601 +++$+++ u4181 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ Have you called Betty?  Maybe you should.
L100600 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Bar across the street.
L100460 +++$+++ u4181 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ And do what? Live alone? Go back to school? Find someone else? Start a magazine for confused woman? ... What if I can't do any of those things?
L100459 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Then why do you?
L100458 +++$+++ u4181 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay.
L100457 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I had no idea it's gotten that bad, sis.
L100456 +++$+++ u4181 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ I don't think so. Not yet anyway. And besides, something like that doesn't make you a bad person. He reminds me of Steve in a way. Steve's weak, immoral and a liar but he's still a real nice guy. He just shouldn't be married.  At least not to me. You getting hungry? I'm hungry.
L100455 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Nice? He's trying to sleep with somebody's wife.
L100454 +++$+++ u4181 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ Oh, he did not. He's such a nice guy.
L100453 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ He's getting her drunk. That's what happened. Jesus, maybe he forced himself. That's why she couldn't tell us.
L100191 +++$+++ u4181 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ STOP IT!  I want to read them! If you don't want to, then just leave. But don't you push me around like I'm some mule you paid for -- I already GOT A HUSBAND!
L100190 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ No. We're going to lock this up and --
L100189 +++$+++ u4181 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ Well, I'd like to read them.
L100188 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ This is crazy. She waits till she's dead to tell us all this. Well, I got news for you. She was my mother. That's enough for me. I don't have to know who she was.
L100187 +++$+++ u4181 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ What are you doing?
L100186 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ That's it!
L100185 +++$+++ u4181 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ "... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It's just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience..."
L100184 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Grateful!?
L100183 +++$+++ u4181 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ Sshhh. "After going through the safety deposit box, I'm sure you'll find you're way to this letter. It's hard to write this to my own children. I could let this die with the rest of me, I suppose.  But as one gets older, one fears subside. What becomes more and more important is to be known -- known for all that you were during this brief stay. Row said it seems to me to leave this earth without hose you love the most ever really knowing who you were. It's easy for a mother to love her children no matter what -- it's something that just happens. I don't know if it's as simple for children. You're all so busy being angry at us for raising you wrong. But I thought it was important to give you that chance. To give you the opportunity to love me for all that I was..."
L100182 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I can't believe she's making jokes.
L100179 +++$+++ u4181 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ No, I don't think so. I --
L100178 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ How did she meet him? Did Dad know? Anything else in that envelope?
L100177 +++$+++ u4181 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ I can't believe she never told me? We spoke at least once a week. How could she do that?
L100176 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Well, what am I supposed to think?
L100175 +++$+++ u4181 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ Don't say that!
L100174 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Don't talk to me like that. She was my mother for Christsakes. And now I find out she was... She was a --!
L100173 +++$+++ u4181 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ My Lord. It must feel real nice living inside your head with Peter Pan and the Easter Bunny.
L100172 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ This happened way before we both got married. I... I can't believe it.  You think she had sex with him?
L100171 +++$+++ u4181 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.
L100170 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?
L100169 +++$+++ u4181 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ '82.
L100168 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ DAMN HIM! I knew mama wouldn't have thought of that herself. It was some damn perverted... photographic mind influencing her! When did the bastard die?
L100167 +++$+++ u4181 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ That he be cremated and his ashes thrown on Roseman Bridge.
L100166 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ What?
L100165 +++$+++ u4181 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is.  From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested... 
L100164 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.
L100163 +++$+++ u4181 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ Well, he just gets on about how if mama ever needed him, she could find him through the National Geographic magazine. He as a photographer. He promises not to write again. Then all it says is...  I love you... Robert.
L100162 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ What's he saying now?
L100161 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Goddamn sonofabitch! I don't want to hear anymore! Sonofabitch! Burn the damn thing! I don't want to hear it! Throw it away!
L100160 +++$+++ u4181 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ "-- going over and over in my mind every detail, every moment of our time together and I ask myself, "What happened to me in Madison County?" I struggle to put it together in a way that allows me to continue knowing we're on separate roads. But then I look through the lens of my camera, and you're there. I start to write an article and I find myself writing it to you. It's clear to me now we have been moving towards each other, towards those four days, all our lives --
L100145 +++$+++ u4181 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ Come here a minute.
L100144 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ What?!
L100143 +++$+++ u4181 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ Michael.
L100142 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Yeah.
L100125 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Well, I don't care if it's legal or not, we're not cremating her and throwing her all over some bridge where we can't even go visit her because she's going to be blown all over the place like an ashtray.
L100124 +++$+++ u4181 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ I remember a Mrs. Delaney but Mama told me years ago she died.
L100106 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ What problem?
L100105 +++$+++ u4181 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ Well, there's a problem.
L100104 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ I thought everything WAS arranged.
L100099 +++$+++ u4181 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ He's not coming.
L100098 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ He dropped them off at Betty's mom. Where's Steve?
L100081 +++$+++ u4181 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ I have some sandwich fixings if you're hungry.
L100080 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Lawyer here?
L100079 +++$+++ u4181 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ CAROLYN +++$+++ Mom's orders.
L100078 +++$+++ u4188 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MICHAEL +++$+++ Explain to me again why we didn't do this in Des Moines in an air conditioned office?
L100261 +++$+++ u4184 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ GLADYS +++$+++ She changed.
L100260 +++$+++ u4182 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ ELEANOR +++$+++ No. What a tragedy. What happened?
L100259 +++$+++ u4184 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ GLADYS +++$+++ My niece had "the changes" when she was thirty-one.
L100254 +++$+++ u4182 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ ELEANOR +++$+++ She used to be so friendly.
L100253 +++$+++ u4184 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ GLADYS +++$+++ Oh, yes.
L100252 +++$+++ u4182 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ ELEANOR +++$+++ She's changed.
L100247 +++$+++ u4184 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ GLADYS +++$+++ I'd laugh first then I'd kill them. Make sure they heard me laughing.
L100246 +++$+++ u4182 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ ELEANOR +++$+++ I'd kill him. Him and that Redfield woman. Together. First one then the other. And then I'd laugh.
L100245 +++$+++ u4184 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ GLADYS +++$+++ See. Money don't buy happiness. I must say, she's taking it well.
L100238 +++$+++ u4182 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ ELEANOR +++$+++ No, what?
L100237 +++$+++ u4184 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ GLADYS +++$+++ Mrs. Delaney.  Did you hear the latest?
L100258 +++$+++ u4182 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ ELEANOR +++$+++ Don't talk about what you don't know. Besides, she's too young for "the changes."
L100257 +++$+++ u4185 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Well, I didn't know they was a secret club.
L100256 +++$+++ u4182 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ ELEANOR +++$+++ What do you know about "the changes"?
L100243 +++$+++ u4182 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ ELEANOR +++$+++ Oh, shut up! It's the woman who's in control of these situations. Men don't know which end is up till a woman points.
L100242 +++$+++ u4185 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Well, nobody put a gun to his head.
L100236 +++$+++ u4185 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ I'll get right on it.
L100235 +++$+++ u4182 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ ELEANOR +++$+++ Heat is not heat! There's different kinds! And this heat is much hotter than what they got in Michigan. You go and call your brother and see if he don't say the same thing.
L100234 +++$+++ u4185 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ Heat is heat.
L100233 +++$+++ u4182 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ ELEANOR +++$+++ Not this kind of heat.
L100232 +++$+++ u4185 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ HENRY +++$+++ They got heat in Michigan.
L100231 +++$+++ u4182 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ ELEANOR +++$+++ Oh, this heat! Times like this I wish we took that offer from your brother and moved on up to Michigan.
L100721 +++$+++ u4187 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MADGE +++$+++ Oh, that'll be nice.
L100720 +++$+++ u4183 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ FRANCESCA +++$+++ No, leave it. I'll do it later. Listen, maybe you and Floyd can come for dinner on Saturday. I'm sure Richard'll have so many stories to tell you both about the fair and all.
L100719 +++$+++ u4187 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MADGE +++$+++ No, of course not. I'll just clean up.
L100718 +++$+++ u4183 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ FRANCESCA +++$+++ No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?
L100717 +++$+++ u4187 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MADGE +++$+++ You want me to call the doctor?
L100716 +++$+++ u4183 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ FRANCESCA +++$+++ I don't know. I woke up a little dizzy. I didn't sleep well. I think I need to lay down.
L100714 +++$+++ u4187 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MADGE +++$+++ Oh, honey. I'm so sorry. But you've got to be grateful for even feeling the little you've be given. Believe me. Go to him. Don't let him leave without these new precious hours you've got left. And if you need anyone to cry on, you know where I am.
L100713 +++$+++ u4183 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ FRANCESCA +++$+++ Madge. Please. Something's happened. I've met someone. I've fallen in love in a way I've never thought could happen my entire life. It's our last day together. I feel like I'm going to die when he leaves. Please. Help me.
L100711 +++$+++ u4187 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ MADGE +++$+++ Hi. I made some brown betty. I sent Floyd off to town with the boy. I said -  "Floyd, I'm going to visit my girlfriend and spend the afternoon and that's all there is to it. He said who's going to make lunch? I said I'm taking a sick day. Eat at the dinner." Isn't that hilarious?  He didn't dare raise an eyebrow -- I don't even want to tell you how late he was out last night with those good for nothings from the Sandford ranch. I am so sorry, honey, I let two days pass before I came by, but with the boy home the time just escapes me. Have you heard from Richard? How's the fair? God, it's hot.
L100710 +++$+++ u4183 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ FRANCESCA +++$+++ Madge?
L100754 +++$+++ u4183 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ FRANCESCA +++$+++ Robert, if that happens, you'll have to decide. I won't be able to.
L100753 +++$+++ u4192 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ I CAN'T SAY GOODBYE YET! We'll leave it for now. We're not saying goodbye. We're not making any decision. Maybe you'll change your mind. Maybe we'll accidentally run into each other and ... and you'll change your mind.
L100752 +++$+++ u4183 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ FRANCESCA +++$+++ No. Don't do this.
L100751 +++$+++ u4192 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ I'm going to be here a few more days. I'll be at the Inn. We have some time. Let's not say any more now.
L100750 +++$+++ u4183 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ FRANCESCA +++$+++ I don't know. Please...
L100748 +++$+++ u4183 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ FRANCESCA +++$+++ I want to keep it forever. I want to love you the way I do now the rest of my life. Don't you understand -- we'll lose it if we leave. I can't make an entire life disappear to start a new one. All I can do is try to hold onto to both. Help me. Help me not lose loving you.
L100747 +++$+++ u4192 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ But now that you have it -
L100746 +++$+++ u4183 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ FRANCESCA +++$+++ Robert. Please.  You don't understand -- no one does. When a woman makes the choice to marry, to have children -- in one way her life begins but in another way it stops. You build a life of details. You become a mother, a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move. And when they leave they take your life of details with them. And then you're expected move again only you don't remember what moves you because no one has asked in so long. Not even yourself. You never in your life think that love like this can happen to you.
L100745 +++$+++ u4192 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ TO HELL WITH YOU!
L100744 +++$+++ u4183 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ FRANCESCA +++$+++ We are the choices we've made, Robert.
L100743 +++$+++ u4192 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Francesca, listen to me. You think what's happened to us happens to just anybody? What we feel for each other? How much we feel? We're not even two separate people anymore. Some people search their whole lives for it and wind up alone -- most people don't even think it exists and you're going to tell me that giving it up is the right thing to do? That staying here alone in a marriage, alone in a town you hate, in a house you don't feel apart of anymore -- you're telling me that's the right thing to do!?
L100742 +++$+++ u4183 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ FRANCESCA +++$+++ No matter how much distance we put between us and this house, I bring with it with me. And I'll feel it every minute we're together. And I'll blame loving you for how much it hurts. And then even these four days won't be anything more than something sordid and... a mistake.
L100741 +++$+++ u4192 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Yeah. It could get better.
L100740 +++$+++ u4183 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ FRANCESCA +++$+++ You've got to know deep down that the minute we leave here. It'll all change.
L100739 +++$+++ u4192 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ What about us? What about me?
L100738 +++$+++ u4183 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ FRANCESCA +++$+++ No, they don't say much. But Carolyn's 16. She's just about to find out about all this for herself -- she's going to fall in love, she's going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone. If I leave what does that say to her?
L100737 +++$+++ u4192 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ The kids are grown! They don't need you anymore. You told me that. They hardly talk to you.
L100736 +++$+++ u4183 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ FRANCESCA +++$+++ His family's lived for almost a hundred years. Richard doesn't know how to live anywhere else. And the kids...
L100735 +++$+++ u4192 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Then he can move! People move!
L100734 +++$+++ u4183 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ FRANCESCA +++$+++ For anyone. They'll never be able to live through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn't deserve that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his life.
L100733 +++$+++ u4192 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ For who?
L100732 +++$+++ u4183 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ FRANCESCA +++$+++ No matter how I keep turning it around in my mind -- it doesn't seem like the right thing.
L100706 +++$+++ u4183 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ FRANCESCA +++$+++ What makes it different, Robert?
L100705 +++$+++ u4192 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ If I've done anything to make you think that what's happened between us is nothing new for me -- is some routine -- then I do apologize.
L100704 +++$+++ u4183 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ FRANCESCA +++$+++ WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH IT?
L100703 +++$+++ u4192 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
L100702 +++$+++ u4183 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ FRANCESCA +++$+++ WHY?
L100701 +++$+++ u4192 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ I DON'T WANT TO NEED YOU!
L100700 +++$+++ u4183 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ FRANCESCA +++$+++ You won't be made to feel! Period. You've carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur, a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time you've touched our lives! Well, go to hell! It isn't human not to feel lonely -- it isn't human not to afraid! You're a hypocrite and you're a phony!
L100699 +++$+++ u4192 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ I won't be made to feel like I've done something wrong.
L100698 +++$+++ u4183 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ FRANCESCA +++$+++ No one's asking you to!
L100697 +++$+++ u4192 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ I told you! I won't apologize for who I am.
L100696 +++$+++ u4183 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ FRANCESCA +++$+++ Fine. More eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time?
L100695 +++$+++ u4192 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ STOP IT!
L100694 +++$+++ u4183 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ FRANCESCA +++$+++ I don't want you to say anything. I don't need you to say anything.
L100693 +++$+++ u4192 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ What do you want me to say?
L100692 +++$+++ u4183 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ FRANCESCA +++$+++ You have no idea what you've done to me, do you? And after you leave, I'm going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here. If anything happened at all! And I'll have to wonder if you find yourself in some... housewife's kitchen in Romania if you'll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and secretly include me in that group.
L100691 +++$+++ u4192 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Stop it!
L100690 +++$+++ u4183 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ FRANCESCA +++$+++ I know you! What can this possibly mean to anyone who doesn't "need" meaning -  "Who goes with the Mystery" -- who pretends he isn't scared to death.
L100689 +++$+++ u4192 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ How do you know what I experience?
L100688 +++$+++ u4183 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ FRANCESCA +++$+++ Gee, I don't know. I guess I'm not cut out to be a World Citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time.
L100687 +++$+++ u4192 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ What are you doing?
L100686 +++$+++ u4183 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ FRANCESCA +++$+++ Yes. Absolutely. You have this habit of not needing and that it's hard to break. I understand.  Of course, in that case, why sleep -- you don't need rest or for that matter eat, you don't need food.
L100685 +++$+++ u4192 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ I was honest with you. I told you who I was.
L100684 +++$+++ u4183 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ FRANCESCA +++$+++ To do what? Be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular? I mean, what would be the point. Would you pass the butter?
L100683 +++$+++ u4192 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Well, why is that up to me? You're the one who's married. You told me you have no intention of leaving your husband.
L100682 +++$+++ u4183 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ FRANCESCA +++$+++ Well, what is this?
L100681 +++$+++ u4192 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Routine! I don't have a routine. And if you think that's what this is -
L100680 +++$+++ u4183 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ FRANCESCA +++$+++ Well, I just want to know the procedure. I don't want to upset your routine. Do you want any jam?
L100679 +++$+++ u4192 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ I... What do you want?
L100678 +++$+++ u4183 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ FRANCESCA +++$+++ Well, these... women friends of yours... all over the world. How does it work? Do you see some of them again? Do you forget others? Do you write them now and then? How do you manage it?
L100677 +++$+++ u4192 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ What?
L100676 +++$+++ u4183 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ FRANCESCA +++$+++ Good. More coffee?  Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should.
L100675 +++$+++ u4192 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Yes, thanks.
L100674 +++$+++ u4183 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ FRANCESCA +++$+++ Sleep all right?
L100673 +++$+++ u4183 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ FRANCESCA +++$+++ No.
L100672 +++$+++ u4192 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Am I too heavy for you?
L100671 +++$+++ u4183 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ FRANCESCA +++$+++ Long day. Go to sleep.
L100670 +++$+++ u4192 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ I don't know why I'm so tired all of a sudden.
L100665 +++$+++ u4192 +++$+++ m279 +++$+++ ROBERT +++$+++ Across the street. She went into the park and got turned around and didn't know her way out.
