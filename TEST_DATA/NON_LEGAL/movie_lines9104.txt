L253666 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ Yes.
L253665 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ Grusinskaya --
L253648 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ Yes -- yes -- yes.
L253647 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ Do you understand?
L253646 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ I couldn't go through with it.  Remarkable.
L253645 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ And now?
L253644 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ I wanted money desperately -- Can you understand? -- That's why I wanted the pearls. I was threatened -- I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money. I've been following you -- I've admired you. But I have forced myself not to think about you -- Last night, at last, I managed to came into your room and -- and now.
L253643 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---
L253642 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --
L253641 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ So --
L253640 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ I know.
L253639 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ I'll not denounce you.
L253638 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ I don't want them now.
L253637 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ You may keep the pearls -- I don't want them any more -- I'll make you a present of them.
L253635 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ Oh -- 
L253634 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ There.
L253632 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ What is the matter?
L253631 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night. 
L253630 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ That's a silly joke.
L253629 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief. 
L253628 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ Oh! What a picture -- and what else?
L253627 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ I'm a gambler -- I'm running at large like a happy pig, devouring anything of life that pleases me, I really belong in jail
L253626 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ And what do you do -- now?
L253625 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ And then, in the war, to kill and hide. That's all.
L253624 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ And?
L253623 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ When I was a little boy I was taught to ride and be a gentleman -- at school, it was a monastery, I learned to pray and lie -- and ---
L253622 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ No?
L253621 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ Really, I haven't a bit of character. None at all.
L253620 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ Really?
L253619 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock -- I shall die on the gallows.
L253618 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
L253617 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My mother called me Flix.
L253616 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ Oh -- I was ambitious then -- ambition was in my blood -- no rest, no stopping. We were drilled like little soldiers -- We danced in the school of the Imperial Ballet, in St. Petersburg. I was little and slim but hard as diamond -- a duty machine -- No rest, no stopping. And then -- I became famous and whoever is famous is alone... But why should I be telling you this? Last night I did not know you at all -- who are you, really? -- I do not even know your name.
L253539 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ That is not the truth.  You do not want to be alone -- you're afraid of being alone -- I know you're afraid. I know you. You were desperate, just now, if I go away you'll be more desperate than ever. Say I am to stay with you... say it. 
L253538 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ I want to be alone.
L253537 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ The veronal -- you. I'm going to stay here with you.
L253536 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ What?
L253535 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ I'm not going... You know that I'm not going... Do you think I could leave you alone here? After that --?
L253533 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ Beautiful but so sad. I did not know it was so dangerous to look into a woman's bedroom.
L253532 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ No.
L253531 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ You are beautiful!
L253530 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ What can you see?
L253529 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ Because I can see something in the mirror that you cannot. My dear -- 
L253528 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ Why do you smile?
L253527 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ I should like to smoke.
L253526 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ I see -- you do only what you take pleasure in doing. You take pleasure in coming into a woman's bedroom and you come. You take pleasure in a dangerous climb onto a balcony, so you do it... And what is your pleasure now?
L253525 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ I? -- Oh, no. I do only what I take pleasure in doing.
L253524 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ The stage frays one's nerves... the discipline -- it's so exacting. Discipline means doing what you don't want to do and take no pleasure in doing. Do you know what I mean? Have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline?
L253520 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ Just for a minute then.
L253519 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me.
L253518 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ I want to be alone --
L253517 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ That is not so -- you don't want to be alone. 
L253516 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ I want to be alone.
L253515 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
L253514 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
L253513 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ Yes -- I do understand.
L253512 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand.
L253511 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ I saw you just now -- then I saw you cry -- and now I see you in the mirror -- Grusinskaya...
L253510 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ You could love me. It is so long since I have heard that word. Nobody has loved me for a long time. It is so icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How is it that you -- Let me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love me?
L253509 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ A man who could love -- that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you.
L253508 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ Go away. Who are you --?
L253507 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone. 
L253506 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ He disappeared. Later he was found dead.
L253505 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ And...?
L253504 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --
L253503 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ Am I quite strange to you?
L253502 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ Strange man...
L253501 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ You mustn't talk Russian to me.
L253500 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ Alone. All alone.  Oh, you strange -- strange creature.
L253499 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ So alone.
L253498 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ Yes -- tired...
L253497 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ How tired you are!
L253496 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ And -- and --
L253495 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ No irony. You're so appealing -- so soft -- so tired. I feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you -- ever.
L253494 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ And then --?
L253493 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ I did not know you were so beautiful... and --
L253492 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ Why do you look at me like that?
L253491 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ Certainly.
L253490 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ I'd like to smoke a cigarette.
L253489 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ So you feel like coming into a lady's room -- and you come... What now?
L253488 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ I'm afraid not -- I usually do just what I feel like doing at the moment.
L253487 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ Nerves -- just nerves. You must forgive me. I have had a bad evening. I am very tired. Do you know what it is to be tired -- tired of a routine existence?
L253486 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ Don't cry -- it tears my heart to see you sob like that.
L253485 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that.  No. I am not afraid. It is strange.
L253484 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ Poor little Grusinskaya! Does it do you good to cry? Are you afraid? Shall I go?
L253483 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ Because you love me -- you love me?
L253482 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ But surely you must know -- because I love you.
L253481 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ Why do you hide in my room?
L253480 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ Nothing -- only to be here.
L253479 +++$+++ u1190 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ GRUSINSKAYA +++$+++ What do you want here?
L253478 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ Please do not be frightened, Madam.
L254048 +++$+++ u1191 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ KRINGELEIN +++$+++ Oh, no, stay here, Baron -- stay.
L254047 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ You're all right now -- it's very late -- goodnight, Kringelein.
L254043 +++$+++ u1191 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ KRINGELEIN +++$+++ No -- no please -- oh, don't go -- don't go -- don't leave me alone, Baron.
L254042 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ Goodnight, Kringelein. 
L254041 +++$+++ u1191 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ KRINGELEIN +++$+++ Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me, Baron.
L254040 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ Here -- here it is. Here's your pocketbook, Kringelein.
L253992 +++$+++ u1191 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ KRINGELEIN +++$+++ All of that at once, Baron?
L253991 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ I take five hundred.
L253990 +++$+++ u1191 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ KRINGELEIN +++$+++ I do drink, Baron -- I drink to you, Baron and to win.  It's good, -- come along, Baron.
L253989 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ Drink to me, Kringelein -- it's my last chance.
L253988 +++$+++ u1191 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ KRINGELEIN +++$+++ Pardon me, Baron. Permit me again... 
L253987 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ I've no luck.
L253986 +++$+++ u1191 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ KRINGELEIN +++$+++ You've lost everything?
L253985 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ That was my last.
L253974 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ All right then.
L253973 +++$+++ u1191 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ KRINGELEIN +++$+++ All right then.
L253972 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ No -- not at all.
L253971 +++$+++ u1191 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ KRINGELEIN +++$+++ Is that too much, Baron?
L253967 +++$+++ u1191 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ KRINGELEIN +++$+++ Ready, Baron.
L253966 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ Ready, Kringelein?
L253963 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ Good!
L253962 +++$+++ u1191 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ KRINGELEIN +++$+++ We could come to my room.
L253961 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ If we could scare up some men to play.
L253960 +++$+++ u1191 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ KRINGELEIN +++$+++ Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
L253959 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ If I could get into a game I might win some.
L253958 +++$+++ u1191 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ KRINGELEIN +++$+++ I would be awfully glad to oblige, you've been so decent to me. Three hundred?
L253957 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ What?
L253956 +++$+++ u1191 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ KRINGELEIN +++$+++ If the Baron -- if you would permit me --
L253955 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ Absolutely true, Kringelein and I have to raise some money immediately.
L253954 +++$+++ u1191 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ KRINGELEIN +++$+++ Was the Baron joking, or is it really true that the Baron is -- in financial straits.
L253924 +++$+++ u1191 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ KRINGELEIN +++$+++ Broke -- A Baron? But, Baron --
L253923 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ I'd like to Kringelein, but I can't -- I am broke!
L253922 +++$+++ u1191 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ KRINGELEIN +++$+++ Perhaps this evening, Baron, we could go to the Casino -- the place we passed with the marvelous bright lights?
L253921 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --  Well -- well --
L253920 +++$+++ u1191 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ KRINGELEIN +++$+++ The Baron is tired?
L253807 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ No thanks -- keeping my head clear.
L253806 +++$+++ u1191 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ KRINGELEIN +++$+++ A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?
L253803 +++$+++ u1191 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ KRINGELEIN +++$+++ A little strange, Baron.
L253802 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you feel now?
L253801 +++$+++ u1191 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ KRINGELEIN +++$+++ Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink -- A Louisiana flip?
L253800 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ Hello -- sorry I'm late.
L253720 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ Where the music's playing and the ladies are...
L253719 +++$+++ u1191 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ KRINGELEIN +++$+++ In the Yellow Room, where the music's playing and the ladies are?
L253718 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ I'm going to change and we'll meet for a drink in the Yellow Room.
L253715 +++$+++ u1191 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ KRINGELEIN +++$+++ We've been together all day... and in an aeroplane.
L253714 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ Yes, quite.
L253713 +++$+++ u1191 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ KRINGELEIN +++$+++ Baron, we must have gone a hundred miles an hour, at least...
L253340 +++$+++ u1191 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ KRINGELEIN +++$+++ Do I know him -- I know him through and through.
L253339 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ Then you know him?
L253338 +++$+++ u1191 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ KRINGELEIN +++$+++ General Director Preysing!  Baron, when I was sixteen years old, I started as an office boy in that man's factory --
L253337 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ What's the matter, Mr. Kringelein?
L253203 +++$+++ u1191 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ KRINGELEIN +++$+++ Oh -- Doctor -- you are a Doctor -- I am --
L253202 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ And this is Doctor Otternschlag.
L253201 +++$+++ u1191 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ KRINGELEIN +++$+++ Oh, a Baron! 
L253200 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ I'm Baron von Gaigern.
L253199 +++$+++ u1191 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ KRINGELEIN +++$+++ Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf.
L253198 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ Not at all, sir. 
L253197 +++$+++ u1191 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ KRINGELEIN +++$+++ Thank you, sir.
L253345 +++$+++ u1194 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PIMENOV +++$+++ Please, Baron -- forgive me -- not now -- here she is.
L253344 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ Perhaps you could present me now, Mr. Pimenov.
L253172 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ Yes, I was in the war.
L253171 +++$+++ u1194 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PIMENOV +++$+++ The war dropped him here and forgot him.
L253170 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ Yes -- He always seems to be waiting for something -- and nothing ever comes.
L253169 +++$+++ u1194 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PIMENOV +++$+++ That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You know him?
L253168 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ The war.
L253145 +++$+++ u1194 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PIMENOV +++$+++ No doubt you would, Baron. But do you know, I'm quite indispensable to her. I'm her ballet master and her nurse. I hardly belong to myself anymore. But, there you are, it's Grusinskaya -- you can't help adoring her.
L253144 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ My dear sir, I would gladly change rooms with you.
L253143 +++$+++ u1194 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PIMENOV +++$+++ If you occupied the room next to Madam Grusinskaya, you would appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby.
L253142 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ It's always so quiet here.
L253138 +++$+++ u1194 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PIMENOV +++$+++ Yes -- but the audience.
L253137 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ I thought she was splendid!
L253136 +++$+++ u1194 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PIMENOV +++$+++ Well -- last night was not so good.
L253135 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya dances.
L253134 +++$+++ u1194 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PIMENOV +++$+++ Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the truth, Baron -- tonight we are a little bit nervous. Were you at the theatre last night?
L253133 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ How's the beautiful lady?
L253132 +++$+++ u1194 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PIMENOV +++$+++ Oh -- good evening, Baron.
L253131 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
L253130 +++$+++ u1194 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PIMENOV +++$+++ Good evening -- my key -- one sixty- eight.
L254086 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ Don't do that. 
L254085 +++$+++ u1195 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PREYSING +++$+++ Hello! Hello! --
L254083 +++$+++ u1195 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PREYSING +++$+++ I'm going to call the police. I'm going to watch you play the great Baron with the police. Aristocrat! Aristocrat! 
L254082 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ Be quiet.
L254081 +++$+++ u1195 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PREYSING +++$+++ Indeed you must, Baron -- you must. Humm -- humm, but you must go to jail, Baron, you're a thief.
L254080 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ Look here, sir -- I'm completely at your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's a matter of life or death -- I had to get some money -- tonight.
L254079 +++$+++ u1195 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PREYSING +++$+++ So that's how we stand, Baron.
L254078 +++$+++ u1195 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PREYSING +++$+++ Made a mistake -- remarkable. We shall soon see if you made a mistake.   Stay here... Give me that money.
L254077 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ I must have made a mistake.
L254076 +++$+++ u1195 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PREYSING +++$+++ Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want here?
L253863 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ As you will.
L253862 +++$+++ u1195 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PREYSING +++$+++ We shall see who remains here the longer.
L253861 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ I think it would be much better if you went away.
L253860 +++$+++ u1195 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PREYSING +++$+++ I did not ask your advice.
L253859 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ Oh, let the poor devil alone.
L253845 +++$+++ u1195 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ PREYSING +++$+++ Insolent -- Berlin manners.
L253844 +++$+++ u1184 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ BARON +++$+++ Pardon me, the lady has urgent business here with me.
L254141 +++$+++ u1186 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ Most imposters are --
L254140 +++$+++ u1198 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ SENF +++$+++ I don't believe it -- he was a real gentleman. I know people... I'm so tired I can hardly see out of my eyes. No sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel -- that means a lot of work. But it's too bad about the Baron, you always felt better when he came along -- always friendly -- such an agreeable fellow.
L254139 +++$+++ u1186 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ It seems that he was a thief and an imposter.
L254138 +++$+++ u1198 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ SENF +++$+++ Man -- that's terrible. He was a nice fellow -- I am sorry about him.
L254137 +++$+++ u1186 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ I don't know.
L254136 +++$+++ u1198 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ SENF +++$+++ Good heavens. What for?
L254135 +++$+++ u1186 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ The big manufacturer killed Baron von Gaigern.
L254134 +++$+++ u1198 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ SENF +++$+++ What? -- Who? -- Whom?
L254133 +++$+++ u1186 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ News? Yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four.
L254132 +++$+++ u1198 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ SENF +++$+++ No -- no -- not yet. Well, I mustn't let it interfere with my duty. Any news here?
L254131 +++$+++ u1186 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ And the child isn't coming?
L254130 +++$+++ u1198 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ SENF +++$+++ Man -- I was at the clinic the whole night -- there are no words to describe what my wife suffered.
L254129 +++$+++ u1186 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ CLERK +++$+++ The night clerk has already gone -- you are late.
L253711 +++$+++ u1198 +++$+++ m78 +++$+++ SENF +++$+++ Your chauffeur's been waiting, Baron.
