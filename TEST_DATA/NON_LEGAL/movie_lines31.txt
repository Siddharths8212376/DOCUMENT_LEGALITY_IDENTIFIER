L26733 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ Why do they tell little kids that?
L26732 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Yes, there are, aren't there.
L26731 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ My mommy always said there were no monsters.  No real ones.  But there are.
L26730 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
L26729 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.
L26726 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ I don't want to...I have scary dreams.
L26725 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Now you just lie here and have a nap.  You're exhausted.
L26697 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ You don't have to be sorry.  It wasn't your fault.
L26696 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ I'm sorry, Newt.
L26695 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ I guess we're not leaving, right?
L26580 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ You're really something, ace.
L26579 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.
L26578 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ The 'maze'?  You mean the air ducts?
L26577 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ I was the best at the game. I knew the whole maze.
L26569 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ And hope to die?
L26568 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Cross my heart.
L26567 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ You promise?
L26566 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise.
L26565 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ They're dead.
L26564 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ They'd be here if they could, honey.  I know they would.
L26562 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ Because you'll be gone soon, like the others.  Like everybody.  You'll be dead and you'll leave me alone.
L26561 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Why not?
L26560 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ I don't want you for a friend.
L26559 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ What about me?
L26558 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ Casey.  She's my only friend.
L26555 +++$+++ u236 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ NEWT +++$+++ Newt.  My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.
L26554 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ What did you say?
L26318 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Sweet Jesus.
L26317 +++$+++ u239 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ VAN LEUWEN +++$+++ Sixty, maybe seventy families.
L26316 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ How many colonists?
L26314 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ What are you talking about. What people?
L26313 +++$+++ u239 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ VAN LEUWEN +++$+++ Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way, they call it Acheron now.
L26312 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Why won't you check out LV-426?
L26304 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ ...because just one of those things managed to kill my entire crew, within twelve hours of hatching...
L26303 +++$+++ u239 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ VAN LEUWEN +++$+++ Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be...
L26302 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Look, I can see where this is going.  But I'm telling you those things exist.  Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  Thousands. Do you understand?  I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise...
L26297 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ That's because I blew it out the Goddamn airlock!  Like I said.
L26296 +++$+++ u239 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ VAN LEUWEN +++$+++ The analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe...
L26293 +++$+++ u239 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ VAN LEUWEN +++$+++ It did not, however, contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up.
L26292 +++$+++ u237 +++$+++ m15 +++$+++ RIPLEY +++$+++ Look, I told you...
L31167 +++$+++ u241 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ALLEGRO +++$+++ At present the girls only peck me. Their cruelty surely will wreck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown!

L31166 +++$+++ u242 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ANDANTE +++$+++ A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.

L30091 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ What do you mean?
L30090 +++$+++ u243 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ARCO +++$+++ His Grace is very angry with you.
L30089 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.
L30088 +++$+++ u243 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ARCO +++$+++ Indeed.
L30087 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Well, I think that went off remarkably well, don't you?
L30086 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Certainly!
L30085 +++$+++ u243 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ ARCO +++$+++ Follow me, please. The Archbishop would like a word.
L30321 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ Meaning you didn't like it.
L30320 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Extremely clever.
L30319 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ What did you think of the music?
L30318 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ You were sublime.
L30317 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ How was I? Tell me honestly.
L30316 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ Nothing! He can marry who he pleases. I don't give a damn.
L30315 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Well, what does it matter to you?
L30314 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ The marriage!
L30313 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ What?
L30312 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ Did you know? Had you heard?
L30251 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ Looks don't concern me, Maestro. Only talent interests a woman of taste.
L30250 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
L30249 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ Why?
L30248 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ You might be disappointed.
L30247 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ What does he look like?
L30246 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Perhaps.
L30245 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ Oh. Well perhaps you could introduce us anyway.
L30244 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ My dear, it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout Vienna as a singing prostitute for a Turk.
L30243 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it.
L30242 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ A Turkish brothel.
L30241 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ Oh!
L30240 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ A brothel.
L30239 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ What's that?
L30238 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ In a harem.
L30237 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ Where?
L30236 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
L30235 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ Why not?
L30234 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one.
L30233 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ How do you know?
L30232 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ No.
L30231 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ Is there a part for me?
L30230 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Yes.
L30229 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
L30228 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
L30227 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.
L30226 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.
L30225 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
L30224 +++$+++ u260 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SALIERI +++$+++ Good morning.
L30223 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ Maestro.
L30337 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Excuse us, Fraulein. Good night, Signore.
L30336 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ No, no, no, no. You can't take him away now. This is his night. Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?
L30332 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ I assume she's the virtuoso in that department. There can't be any other reason you'd marry someone like that.
L30331 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ What??
L30330 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ Is she a good fuck?
L30325 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ I'm so relieved.
L30324 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ No, she's fine.
L30323 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ Is her mother still lying on the floor?
L30322 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Oh - excuse me!
L30305 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I'll be right back.
L30304 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ Don't bother.
L30303 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ What?
L30302 +++$+++ u244 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CAVALIERI +++$+++ Don't bother!
L30301 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Katherina! I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to write another aria for you. Something even more amazing for the second act. I have to get some water. Her mother is lying on the stage.
L30356 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace! I thank you!
L30355 +++$+++ u245 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ COLLOREDO +++$+++ You have leave to try.
L30354 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.
L30353 +++$+++ u245 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ COLLOREDO +++$+++ And how will you make him keep it?
L30352 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
L30351 +++$+++ u245 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ COLLOREDO +++$+++ Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
L30350 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ Sir -
L30349 +++$+++ u245 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ COLLOREDO +++$+++ I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.
L30348 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
L30347 +++$+++ u245 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ COLLOREDO +++$+++ Hardly.
L30346 +++$+++ u252 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ LEOPOLD +++$+++ But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding.
L30345 +++$+++ u245 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ COLLOREDO +++$+++ No! I won't have him back.
L30102 +++$+++ u245 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ COLLOREDO +++$+++ Then try harder, Mozart. I have no intention of dismissing you. You will remain in my service and learn your place. Go now.
L30101 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy.
L30100 +++$+++ u245 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ COLLOREDO +++$+++ I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg. Your father is waiting for you there patiently. I will speak to you further when I come.
L30099 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ If His Grace is not satisfied with me, he can dismiss me.
L30098 +++$+++ u245 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ COLLOREDO +++$+++ How much provocation am I to endure from you? The more license I allow you, the more you take.
L30097 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Humiliated?
L30096 +++$+++ u245 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ COLLOREDO +++$+++ Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?
L30095 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Why what, sir?
L30983 +++$+++ u246 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ COMMENDATORE +++$+++ Oh shut up. I'm sick to death of that tune.
L30982 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ In the pot, I have got a good dinner. Not a sausage or stew, but a singer. Not a sausage or stew but a singer. Is the treat that I'll eat for my meat!
L30954 +++$+++ u246 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ COMMENDATORE +++$+++ Are you drunk? You invited me. And my horse. Here he is. Ottavio!
L30953 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height.
L30952 +++$+++ u246 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ COMMENDATORE +++$+++ I've come to dinnnnnner!
L30951 +++$+++ u261 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ SCHIKANEDER +++$+++ Who the devil are you? What do you want?
L30950 +++$+++ u246 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ COMMENDATORE +++$+++ Don Giovannnnnnnni!
L31247 +++$+++ u256 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L31246 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.
L31245 +++$+++ u256 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ Why?
L31244 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Yes!
L31243 +++$+++ u256 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ Now?
L31242 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ I want to go back to Vienna.
L31241 +++$+++ u256 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ Where?
L31240 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ I want to go!
L31239 +++$+++ u256 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ OFFICER +++$+++ What is it?
L31147 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Please! Let me sit here. Let me stay here with you. I promise I won't say all word. I'll just be here, so you know no one's going to hurt you. Please, please!
L31146 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Go back to bed.
L31143 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ It's killing me.
L31142 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Why not?
L31141 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I can't write it!
L31140 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Give me one reason I can understand.
L31137 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Give me two more weeks. Please.
L31136 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.
L31135 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ This is my wife, Stanzi. I've been sick, but I'm all right now. Aren't I?
L31079 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Why?
L31078 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ No. Don't answer it!
L31071 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ You'd think I was mad.
L31070 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Why not?
L31069 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ I'm not telling you.
L31068 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ What's that? Oh!  Who gave you this? How much is it? Wolfi, who gave you this?
L31066 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ I heard voices.
L31065 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ No one.
L31064 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Who was that?
L31030 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Shut up! I'll not let you put anything in my hand until I see some money.
L31029 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!
L31028 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
L31027 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.
L31026 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.
L31025 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Oh, Stanzi.
L31024 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it.
L31023 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Why not? Half the house!
L31022 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ You're not going to do this?
L31019 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ I'm talking about now. How much will you give him now? Down payment?
L31018 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Half the receipts! Stanzi!
L30938 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Your father is dead.
L30937 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ What?
L30936 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Wolfi! Your father is dead.
L30935 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!
L30934 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
L30933 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Yes, my love?
L30932 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Wolfi.
L30931 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ We'll have a little party. Come in. Come in. You know Herr Schikaneder?  This is! a very nice girl.
L30730 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ No, it's right he should hear. I'm sick to death of it. We can't do anything right for you, can we?
L30729 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Stanzi!
L30728 +++$+++ u247 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ CONSTANZE +++$+++ Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think you can -
L30702 +++$+++ u255 +++$+++ m16 +++$+++ MOZART +++$+++ Oh, damn!
