L43336 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, neat... oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot.
L43335 +++$+++ u3699 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ I though it was... very musical, and I liked it a lot.
L43334 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh, yeah, really, oh!
L43333 +++$+++ u3699 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Uh, we just wanted to stop by and say that we really enjoyed your sets.
L43332 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Well, hi!
L43331 +++$+++ u3699 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ TONY +++$+++ Hi, I'm-I'm Tony Lacey.
L43330 +++$+++ u3686 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ANNIE +++$+++ Oh.
L43306 +++$+++ u3698 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ TESSIE +++$+++ Oh, I was quite a lively dancer.
L43305 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ There were many men interested in you?
L43304 +++$+++ u3698 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ TESSIE +++$+++ I was very charming.
L43303 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Uh, how did this personality come about?
L43302 +++$+++ u3698 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ TESSIE +++$+++ I was a great beauty.
L43301 +++$+++ u3695 +++$+++ m243 +++$+++ ROB +++$+++ Tessie, they say you were the sister with personality.
L44533 +++$+++ u3700 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ AMERICA +++$+++ You should talk to Mr. Joe.
L44532 +++$+++ u3712 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ Did you see permits?  Did he have a license?
L44531 +++$+++ u3712 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ To code?
L44530 +++$+++ u3700 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ AMERICA +++$+++ It's the way they do things.
L44529 +++$+++ u3712 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ Was it a contractor?
L44528 +++$+++ u3700 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ AMERICA +++$+++ Very well.
L44527 +++$+++ u3712 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ Did you know the contractor?
L44526 +++$+++ u3700 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ AMERICA +++$+++ Oh yes.
L44525 +++$+++ u3712 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?
L44524 +++$+++ u3700 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ AMERICA +++$+++ A long time.
L44523 +++$+++ u3712 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ RYAN +++$+++ How long have you worked for the Therrians?
L44301 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ One guess.
L44300 +++$+++ u3701 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ ASTRID +++$+++ Like you didn't know.  Who invited the bimbo?
L44299 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ You're fucking desperate.
L44298 +++$+++ u3701 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ ASTRID +++$+++ Oh I think he's cute.  How's the marriage part working out?
L44297 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ You don't want that.  It's married and it's the neighbor.
L44296 +++$+++ u3701 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ ASTRID +++$+++ Anouk isn't like a dog, really.  More like a small person.  So is there anyone here for me?  No one looks new.  Who's that?
L44295 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Would it make a difference?
L44294 +++$+++ u3701 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ ASTRID +++$+++ You're not upset that I brought the dog?
L44262 +++$+++ u3701 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ ASTRID +++$+++ I hate the sight of blood.  You guys don't take prisoners.
L44261 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Why didn't you come in?
L44260 +++$+++ u3701 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ ASTRID +++$+++ Ten, fifteen minutes ago.
L44259 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ A triumph.  When did you get here?
L44258 +++$+++ u3701 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ ASTRID +++$+++ So who won?
L44441 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Five years ago, I was at the party, remember?
L44440 +++$+++ u3702 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ You've got a lot of fucking gall.  Thirty nine.
L44439 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Scratch the two, write in a four.
L44438 +++$+++ u3702 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ Scratch the two, write in a four.
L44437 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Leo.  Leo's twenty-eight, Cal.
L44436 +++$+++ u3702 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ I have a small window of time.
L44435 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ October-ish.
L44434 +++$+++ u3702 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ Well, I can't make any promises, and of course I haven't read the script but I loved the novel...when are you shooting?
L44433 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Leo?  It was out to Jude Law.  Jude passed.
L44432 +++$+++ u3702 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ Any thoughts on casting yet?
L44431 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Leo?
L44430 +++$+++ u3702 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ Hey, listen, I love her.  She's Sophia's best friend.  I never said any of this, alright.  I'll deny it on the stand...  You guys are gonna have kids.  That is so great.  Maybe that's what this is all about.  Maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore.  You know adults don't do this for a living.  You guys are gonna have your kids, you'll be directing -- one asshole in the family is enough.  Sophia knew that intuitively.  Look at Clair. Clair's a mess.  Make sure she gets the epidural.  Forget that natural childbirth shit. Everything's going to be what it's supposed to be.  "Life is but a walking shadow.  A poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more..." And speaking of me, the role of Leo in your film?
L44429 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ What?
L44428 +++$+++ u3702 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ Mac's a pretty great director, Joe.  He's a woman's director.  And nothing's happening.  Course he won't fire her, because of the friendship... But it was discussed.  He had to battle his studio to get her in the first place.
L44427 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I still think she sails above the rest. I mean not like her early films.  But those were all such great directors.
L44426 +++$+++ u3702 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ And, you know it isn't rocket science, this script.  She can barely get the lines out.  There was a scene last week - she sobbed, through every take.  I know crying's easy for her but it's a fucking comedy, Joe.  Something's gone.  You know, that thing that was Sally - that always surprised you.  It's gone.  I think she's scared.  And that's death.
L44425 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Who, Sally?
L44424 +++$+++ u3702 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ I don't know what's going on.  I don't care to guess.  Mac's really unhappy. She isn't there, that's all.  She's no idea what she's playing, not a clue.
L44423 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Oh, she's really enjoying it.  I think. Is Mac okay?
L44422 +++$+++ u3702 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ The movie.
L44421 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ No, what?
L44420 +++$+++ u3702 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ Poor Mac.  It's been a bit of a struggle. I'm sure Sally's told you.
L44416 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ With great tits.  I'm going to ask her if I can touch them.
L44415 +++$+++ u3702 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ The camera loves her.  A great actress.
L44414 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yeah, God she really does have great tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work with her.
L44413 +++$+++ u3702 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ Absolutely.  And she's got great tits.
L44412 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty seven and...  The wisdom.  She's an old soul.  She knew that Shostakovich thing.  Did you notice?
L44411 +++$+++ u3702 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ And you've only just met.
L44410 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ She's a constant surprise.
L44409 +++$+++ u3702 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ She's got great tits.
L44408 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Isn't Skye amazing?
L44353 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ And how's the diva doing?
L44352 +++$+++ u3702 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ It's going.  It's going.
L44182 +++$+++ u3702 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ Why last?
L44181 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Can we... one at a time?  Hold it down, and one at a time.  You're last, Cal.
L43845 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ The neighbors from hell.  The kind that lay in wait.  I'd rather move actually. Wouldn't I?  Wouldn't I?
L43844 +++$+++ u3702 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ What's that?
L43819 +++$+++ u3702 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ I'm not that good.
L43818 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ It has your ring.
L43817 +++$+++ u3702 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ Absolutely not.
L43816 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Had a little help?
L43815 +++$+++ u3702 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CAL +++$+++ Absolutely.
L43814 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Jack.  Did you compose that yourself?
L44646 +++$+++ u3709 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ I'll be fine.  Really babe.  Give me a minute.
L44645 +++$+++ u3703 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CLAIR +++$+++ Honey?
L44464 +++$+++ u3703 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CLAIR +++$+++ I...wait, what are you talking about?
L44463 +++$+++ u3709 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ What what's about?
L44462 +++$+++ u3703 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CLAIR +++$+++ You're coming swimming in the pool, and in a few minutes you won't even remember what it's about.  You won't care who's in your damn movie.
L44461 +++$+++ u3709 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ I don't know how to make her funny.
L44460 +++$+++ u3703 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CLAIR +++$+++ Things always look much worse in the morning.
L44459 +++$+++ u3709 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Or I won't.  I can't help her.  I'm out of my depth.
L44458 +++$+++ u3703 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CLAIR +++$+++ How nice for everybody.  Come swimming. The water's glorious.  You'll fix it.  You'll come up with one of your brilliant ideas.
L44457 +++$+++ u3709 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ You don't have any clothes on.
L44456 +++$+++ u3703 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CLAIR +++$+++ It's always not this time.  If you can do it around me, you can do it around anyone.
L44455 +++$+++ u3709 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Not this time.
L44454 +++$+++ u3703 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CLAIR +++$+++ You can cut around it, whatever it is. You always do.
L44453 +++$+++ u3709 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ I'm in mourning.
L44452 +++$+++ u3703 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CLAIR +++$+++ Mac?  Oh there you are.  What are you doing, honey?  No more work.  Don't you feel breezy.
L43925 +++$+++ u3709 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ It's an object lesson in grace.  Wow!  Look who's here before me!  My leading man is on time for once.
L43924 +++$+++ u3703 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CLAIR +++$+++ So they tell me.  Not soon enough, of course.  How are you, Sal?  You look fantastic. It changes your life, you know.  A baby. It puts everything in perspective, doesn't it.  Doesn't it, Mac?  You can't be the center of your own world, anymore.
L43903 +++$+++ u3703 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CLAIR +++$+++ It's alright, isn't it?
L43902 +++$+++ u3709 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ She already has.
L44070 +++$+++ u3703 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CLAIR +++$+++ My God, your wardrobe is incredible.  It took me forever to decide.  Oh, and I found Dr. X, thank you.  You saved my life.
L44069 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Thank you, thank you, thank you.
L44000 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ It's not going to come up.
L43999 +++$+++ u3703 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CLAIR +++$+++ Just don't fucking tell her.
L43998 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ You need to knock off the pills, Clair.
L43997 +++$+++ u3703 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CLAIR +++$+++ You know Sophia.  She's so damned judgemental.  And she's so damned... perfect.  And so fucking... serene.  Just fucking don't tell her.  Because you know Mac thinks she's God.  And I can feel him comparing.
L43996 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Why would she care?
L43995 +++$+++ u3703 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CLAIR +++$+++ I'd love a Xanex.  Sally, please don't tell Sophia that I'm not breast feeding.
L43994 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ You want a Tylenol, or something?
L43993 +++$+++ u3703 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CLAIR +++$+++ And the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy.  I've got a ghastly headache, actually.
L43992 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ I'd say it was down.
L43991 +++$+++ u3703 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CLAIR +++$+++ I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Well, I'm a little stressed.  And I've been taking pills to get my weight down since the baby.
L43990 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Whatever you like.  I'm afraid it'll all be too big for you.  Are you alright, Clair?
L43989 +++$+++ u3703 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CLAIR +++$+++ I'll change back before we leave.
L43988 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Borrow whatever you like.
L43987 +++$+++ u3703 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CLAIR +++$+++ It sounds hysterical, but Otis just rubbed up against me and I'd kind of like to change into something of yours.  You know it could be disaster.  He's so allergic.  It's terrifying.
L43923 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Oh.
L43922 +++$+++ u3703 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CLAIR +++$+++ They can tell from the eyelashes, you know?  He's got eyelashes yay long.  They must be a foot long.  The older you are when you have a baby, the more likely this stuff is to crop up.
L43921 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Well, probably.
L43920 +++$+++ u3703 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CLAIR +++$+++ Didn't I say?
L43919 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Oh.
L43918 +++$+++ u3703 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CLAIR +++$+++ To dander.  Otis.
L43917 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Oh.
L43916 +++$+++ u3703 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CLAIR +++$+++ He's allergic.
L43915 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Why didn't you bring him?
L43914 +++$+++ u3703 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CLAIR +++$+++ What?
L43913 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Why didn't you bring him?
L43907 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ This is Monica and Ryan.  Mac and Clair.
L43906 +++$+++ u3703 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CLAIR +++$+++ I'm not.
L43901 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Of course.
L43900 +++$+++ u3703 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CLAIR +++$+++ What a fucking day!  We only just got a sitter.  I don't know her from fucking Adam.  She could be a serial killer.  I'm going to have to call every ten minutes. You have to let me give out the number.
L44710 +++$+++ u3703 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CLAIR +++$+++ Oh my God, the sitter.
L44709 +++$+++ u3715 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SOPHIA +++$+++ Let's get the kids.
L43985 +++$+++ u3703 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CLAIR +++$+++ I can't think how you gave it all up, Soph.
L43984 +++$+++ u3715 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SOPHIA +++$+++ Are you the funniest person I know, or what?
L43983 +++$+++ u3703 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CLAIR +++$+++ Pictures.  They're always in my tote.  I left my tote in the damn trailer.  But! He's Mac all over again.  Imagine Mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  The fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth.
L43982 +++$+++ u3715 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SOPHIA +++$+++ Oh.  Do you have any pictures?
L43981 +++$+++ u3703 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CLAIR +++$+++ Dander.  He's allergic.  Otis.
L43980 +++$+++ u3715 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SOPHIA +++$+++ You should have brought him.
L43979 +++$+++ u3703 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CLAIR +++$+++ So this sitter can always reach me.  I'm still not used to leaving him.
L43978 +++$+++ u3715 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SOPHIA +++$+++ What is that thing?
L43977 +++$+++ u3703 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CLAIR +++$+++ With a sitter.  We have a sensational sitter.  Jonah's really comfortable with her.  You know, a second mom sort of. Like part of the family.  Amazing with kids.
L43976 +++$+++ u3715 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SOPHIA +++$+++ So where is young Jonah?
L43975 +++$+++ u3703 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CLAIR +++$+++ Really?
L43974 +++$+++ u3715 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SOPHIA +++$+++ Not for a second.  Cal can have all that.
L43973 +++$+++ u3703 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CLAIR +++$+++ Really.
L43972 +++$+++ u3715 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SOPHIA +++$+++ Never.
L43971 +++$+++ u3703 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CLAIR +++$+++ Don't you miss it?
L43970 +++$+++ u3715 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SOPHIA +++$+++ I'm glad that's all over for me.
L43969 +++$+++ u3703 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ CLAIR +++$+++ You think so!?  I've been working out a lot since the baby. And I've been working.  And that takes it's toll, you know.
L43968 +++$+++ u3715 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SOPHIA +++$+++ You look so well, Clair.  A wraith.
L44726 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Count on it.
L44725 +++$+++ u3704 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ GINA +++$+++ Take good care of it.
L44703 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Damn straight.
L44702 +++$+++ u3704 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ GINA +++$+++ It's not a contest.
L44701 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ And you're not the wife.
L44700 +++$+++ u3704 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ GINA +++$+++ Jesus, Sally.  I'm not the enemy.
L44699 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Well you could tell him otherwise.  It was good of you to be all this help.  But he doesn't want to go tonight.
L44698 +++$+++ u3704 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ GINA +++$+++ I told his father he'd be on that flight.
L44697 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ He's not going tonight.
L44696 +++$+++ u3704 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ GINA +++$+++ Is he not going?  I booked a flight.
L44695 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Yeah.
L44694 +++$+++ u3704 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ GINA +++$+++ He's gonna miss his flight.
L44682 +++$+++ u3704 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ GINA +++$+++ I love her too, Joe.
L44681 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Would you leave us alone right now?
L43959 +++$+++ u3704 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ GINA +++$+++ Happy anniversary.  You're a good match, you two.  Can you help me with this stuff?
L43958 +++$+++ u3713 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ SALLY +++$+++ Thanks for coming.
L44680 +++$+++ u3704 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ GINA +++$+++ I've booked you a flight and packed you a bag.  You just need to get into a car and go.
L44679 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Leave us alone right now.
L44678 +++$+++ u3704 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ GINA +++$+++ You need to call your dad.
L44677 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Fuck you.
L44676 +++$+++ u3704 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ GINA +++$+++ She left a note.
L44675 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ Stupid tart.
L44674 +++$+++ u3704 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ GINA +++$+++ She's in ICU.
L44673 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ But she's alright.
L44672 +++$+++ u3704 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ GINA +++$+++ Lucy overdosed.
L44671 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ And?
L44670 +++$+++ u3704 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ GINA +++$+++ Harry called.
L44669 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ The suspense is killing me.
L44665 +++$+++ u3704 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ GINA +++$+++ Let's go upstairs, okay?

L44086 +++$+++ u3707 +++$+++ m244 +++$+++ JOE +++$+++ I should have damn well bought it.  Well, we can't afford it.  The movie's going to eat up a year of my life and I'm getting paid next to nothing.  Do you know how much Skye Davidson's getting?  Four million.
