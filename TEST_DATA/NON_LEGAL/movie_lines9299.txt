L419637 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ He won another blue ribbon and bit the judge. Ha! ha! ha! I bought him the cutest sweater as a reward. You should see him strut down the street in it. He looks like a little boulevardier.  You see, Count d'Algout gave me Punchy for my birthday.  You must have searched weeks before you found anything as divine as Punchy, didn't you, Leon?
L419633 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ No... please...
L419632 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ I've some wonderful news for you, Leon. It's about Punchy... do you mind if I sit down?
L419627 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ How do you do?
L419626 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Not at all. Your Highness, may I present Madame Yakushova?
L419625 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Am I interrupting?
L419624 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Yes, Swana.
L419623 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?
L419622 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Yes, Swana, you did.
L419621 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Didn't I tell you Benson and Benson were the tailors for you?
L419620 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Yes, Swana.
L419619 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Is this your new dress suit?
L419618 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Thank you.
L419362 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Now, darling, soak in your beautiful pine bath and let Gaston shave you.
L419361 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open! 
L419360 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ You saw all that in one glimpse?
L419359 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Timeless. When she comes into a room you'd think that the Bolsheviks had taken over Paris. She wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by Schiaparelli. What a woman! What a woman! There is a Russian snowstorm in each of her eyes.
L419358 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ That bad?  Old or young?
L419357 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ You can't imagine.
L419356 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Imagine the carpets of a self- respecting Parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik! What does she look like?
L419355 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Well... er... I caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby.
L419354 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ You just told me you hadn't seen her.
L419353 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ That wouldn't have done any good. Not with her.  She's the most incredible creature I've ever seen.
L419352 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ That proletarian! In the old days we'd have had her flogged.
L419351 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ No, and believe me I've tried everything! I must have telephoned her a hundred times. I've sent her telegrams, I've sent her flowers... I asked her to dinner... I offered her seats for the Opera...
L419350 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ You haven't seen her yet?
L419349 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Oh, please, Swana! I don't know whether I'm standing on my head or my heels. Here you are blaming me for neglecting you when I'm trying to concentrate on another woman and can't get near her.
L419348 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Now... here we have two very handsome soft-boiled eggs. Do you suppose hens mind what happens to their eggs? Probably not. They have such unfeeling eyes. We'll put in a great nugget of butter, plenty of pepper and salt... Darling, I haven't seen you for three livelong days... seventy-two hours!
L419344 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Not in your condition.  Make it tepid, Gaston... tepid and tender. And lay out his gray suit.  Afterwards I'll drive you through the Bois. Slowly... in Waltz time.
L419343 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Make it ice cold.
L419337 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Darling, you're taking my business affairs far too seriously. Much as I'd love to rob the Bolsheviks of their filthy money, I won't do it at the expense of your health. Particularly as we know we won't get much.  You look so pale... pale but interesting.
L419336 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I just couldn't sleep. I got up and went back... and then got up again. These last few days... whew!
L419335 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Don't tell me the bed has lost its best friend.
L419334 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ No.
L419333 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Is anything wrong? Are you ill?
L419332 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Huh?
L419331 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Leon! What in heaven's name...!
L418974 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Darling, calm down. Why do you need a lawyer? Haven't you your little Volga boatman?
L418973 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ It looks pretty hopeless... there may be a chance... that's all... The French Government has recognized Soviet Russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake. He might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money, money, money!... That's all they are interested in -- those lawyers!
L418972 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ What did he say?
L418971 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Shhh!  ...But how can there be a question?... Are you my lawyer or theirs?... All right, I'll let you know!
L418970 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ What does he say?
L418969 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ This is the Duchess Swana... I want to speak to Monsieur Cornillon... it's very important... please get him right away... Hello, Monsieur Cornillon? The most incredible thing has happened! My jewels are here in Paris! Three Bolshevik swine are trying to sell them! Yes... yes... we must act immediately!... Call the police... Have them arrested!... Well, then, get an injunction!... But do something, Monsieur Cornillon!  ...But they are my jewels! There must be some way of getting them back!
L418965 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Rakonin, bless him, has given me the most amazing news!
L418964 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Did I hear something about jewels?
L418951 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Tell him I won't be able to see him for a half an hour.
L418950 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Oh, yes.
L418949 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ He's a waiter at the Clarence, poor devil. You know him.
L418945 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Too bad! Brings our price down ten thousand francs!
L418944 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
L418943 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
L418942 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
L418941 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I've got one chapter Guizot thinks is terrific. "Caviar and Blood." Swana escapes over the ice!
L418940 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Well... two million readers... I know exactly what they want. Chapter One: "A Childhood behind Golden Bars. Lovely Little Princess Plays with Rasputin's Beard."
L418939 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Yes, I'm your little Volga boatman.
L418938 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman?
L418937 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Now, Swana...
L418936 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ My little Volga boatman! Stop threatening! I don't deserve this.  Are you my little Volga boatman?
L418934 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Imagine two million clerks and shop girls peeking into my life for a sou! Think of my lovely life being wrapped around cheese and blood sausages! I can see a big grease spot in the midst of my most intimate moments!
L418933 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ I understand how you feel, but there is a limit to everything, particularly pride and dignity. They are willing to pay any price! They have a circulation of two million!
L418932 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Was it for this that I refused to endorse Dr. Bertrand's Mouthwash? I could have made a little fortune by saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the Romanoffs... and now you want them to smear my life's secrets over the front page of a tabloid?
L418931 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Sweetheart, we won't have to bother about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past!
L418930 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Oh, Leon!
L418929 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Now listen, Swana... I sold Monsieur Guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne. "The Life and Loves of the Grand Duchess Swana of Russia"!
L418928 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
L418927 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the Guizots.
L418926 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Those newspaper people?
L418925 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ We can be rich if you say the word. I had dinner with the Guizots last night.
L418924 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Oh, Leon, you are so good to me. 
L418923 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ We can forget horse racing, roulette, the stock market... our worries are over! You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers? You will be in a position to give it to me.
L418922 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Did you win?
L418921 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Darling, I was busy looking out for your interests.
L418920 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Don't you find that restful?... Why didn't you come last night?
L418919 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Your conversation has one marvelous advantage, Swana. However many questions you ask you never expect an answer.
L418918 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ It's really a wretched morning... wretched. I can't get myself right. I wanted to look mellow and I look brittle. My face doesn't compose well... all highlights... how can I dim myself down, Leon? Suggest something. I am so bored with this face. I wish I had someone else's face. Whose face would you have if you had your choice? Oh, well, I guess one gets the face one deserves.
L418917 +++$+++ u2312 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ LEON +++$+++ Good morning, Swana.
L418916 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Hello, Leon!
L419804 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ I think I know Leon quite as well as you... possibly a little better. Leave that worry to me. Five-forty leaves you time enough to close the deal with Monsieur Mercier, but naturally you'll be too busy for any farewells. I'll see to it that everything is done in the most expeditious manner and I will also see you to the airport. That's my proposition, Comrade Yakushova.
L419803 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ That's not the way to win him back... not Leon.
L419802 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ I am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that five-forty plane to Moscow.
L419801 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Go on.
L419800 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ No, I just wanted to be absolutely impartial. Both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years. We can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition. Ninotchka now realizes what she is after.
L419799 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ I see. You have calculated in terms of hunger.
L419798 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait.
L419797 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Won't those two years in court be expensive for you? I know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now...
L419796 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ My lawyer agrees with you. He says France will uphold it in every court, but I will drag you through every court, don't forget that. And when I say it will take two years I am, as always, conservative.
L419795 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Under Soviet law the jewels belong to the State. France is going to uphold that ownership.
L419794 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Unfortunately.
L419793 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet.
L419792 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Now, let's free ourselves from emotionalism and try to solve the problem in a practical way. Our situation has changed considerably. Before I had only a claim to the jewels. Now I have the jewels.
L419791 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ I told you we had plenty to talk about. Shall we sit down?
L419790 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ They always belonged to the Russian people. They were paid for with their sweat, their blood, their lives and you will give them back!
L419789 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ That's very simple to answer. They were given to me by my mother. They were given to her by her mother, in fact they're mine, you cannot steal what belongs to you!
L419788 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ I will have to face the consequences, but so will you. Don't forget they will ask how you got them.
L419787 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?
L419786 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ You leave me no choice.
L419785 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian.  I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police...
L419784 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Where are they?
L419783 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with.
L419782 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Where are they?
L419781 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Believe me, Leon can't help you. He doesn't know anything about the jewels... I give you my word... I swear it.
L419780 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ I told you to go, madame.
L419779 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ I wouldn't waken Leon. After last night I would say not before three o'clock at the earliest.
L419777 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ In that case I can only say good-by.
L419776 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Not before you agree to use those reservations to Moscow.
L419775 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ I must insist that you leave.
L419774 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ You can't deny we gave the people their money's worth -- almost -- eight tumbling Romanoffs -- eight!
L419773 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ My dear, you don't know how impressive I could be. Did you ever see me in my regalia with my diadem and all my jewels?
L419772 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ It is not enough to be witty, madame. People grow tired of being entertained. You made that mistake before. Problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony.
L419771 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Very interesting, my dear, but couldn't you write all that from Moscow? A dissertation on love on Soviet stationery -- would be an amusing paradox.
L419770 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ People cannot be taken away, madame, neither a hundred and sixty million nor one. Not if you have their love. You hadn't. That's why you're not in Russia any longer, and that's why you came here this morning.
L419769 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ My palace in Petrograd... yes, you took that away from me. You took away my czar, my country, my people, everything I had...  but nothing more -- I warn you.
L419768 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ If this is meant to be a joke it is not funny. Or do you still think you're issuing orders from your palace in Petrograd?
L419767 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Don't worry. I have already made reservations. It's perfect flying weather. They assure me there's a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to Moscow in no time.
L419766 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Madame, if you...
L419765 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Leave? That's exactly what I came here to ask you to do. Leave! I don't mean this hotel and I don't mean Paris... I mean France. There's a plane for Moscow at five-forty.
L419764 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ I must ask you to leave.
L419763 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ That's all right... I grow on people.
L419762 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Madame, what is it you people always say, regardless of what you mean... "I am delighted to have you here"? I have not reached that stage of civilization.
L419761 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Now there you are completely wrong. If we sit down for a little chat, I'm sure we won't run out of conversation and what's more it won't be dull.
L419760 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ We have nothing to discuss.
L419759 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ I just dropped in to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you.
L419758 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Please come to the point. What is it you want?
L419757 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Don't worry, you were quite rude enough.  Do you mind if I let in a little fresh air and sunshine? I'm sure it will make you feel better and I want you to be at your very best. In full possession of your faculties, at least.
L419756 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ If you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night I am afraid you misunderstood my attitude.
L419755 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ How stale last night's gaiety looks! It has the taste of a dead cigarette.
L419754 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Of course not, my dear! I didn't come here with any such suspicion. How ridiculous!  Nor did I come here to pick up his hat.
L419753 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ I think we can cut your visit short. Leon is not here.
L419751 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ It is tomorrow morning... tomorrow noon, to be exact. I hope you will forgive me. I know it's extremely cruel to waken anyone at such an hour. Don't you recognize me? I am the Duchess Swana.
L419750 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ What?
L419749 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Good morning.
L419651 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ It is unfortunate that you have so few more days in Paris.  Be sure and redouble your efforts so that madame can take some pleasant memories when she returns to Moscow.  Good night.  Good night, Leon.
L419650 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ You're right, madame, it will all be over by Thursday.
L419647 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ You're absolutely right about the Cossacks. We made an unpardonable mistake when we let them use their knouts. They had such reliable guns.
L419646 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Exactly. You see, it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear low-cut gowns in the old Russia. The lashes of the Cossacks across our backs were not very becoming, and you know how vain women are.
L419645 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Isn't it amazing! One gets a wrong impression of the new Russia.  It must be charming. I'm glad conditions are so improved. I assume this is what the factory workers wear at their dances?
L419641 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Dear me... I must be losing my finesse. If I'm not careful I'll be understood by everybody.
L419640 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Not at all.... I understand perfectly, Count d'Algout gave you a dog. You made it very clear, madame.
L419116 +++$+++ u2316 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ PORTER +++$+++ That depends on the tip.
L419115 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ That's no business... that's a social injustice.
L419114 +++$+++ u2316 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ PORTER +++$+++ Well... that's my business, madame.
L419111 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Why?
L419110 +++$+++ u2316 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ PORTER +++$+++ May I have your bags, madame?
L419109 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ What do you want?
L419108 +++$+++ u2316 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ PORTER +++$+++ Here, please...
L420054 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ I will do my best.
L420053 +++$+++ u2319 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ RAZININ +++$+++ Please don't waste my time, Comrade. Do your duty. Good-by.
L420052 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ How can I make myself clear... It is difficult to express but I'd rather not go to foreign countries any more. Please, Comrade... let me stay here... let me finish my work... I am in the rhythm of it now... I don't want to go away. I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again. It throws one out of gear.... Let me finish my work... I have concentrated everything in it... Please... don't make me go.
L420051 +++$+++ u2319 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ RAZININ +++$+++ I don't understand.
L420050 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ I am sorry, I don't want to overstep my position -- but please... don't send me.
L420049 +++$+++ u2319 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ RAZININ +++$+++ That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova.
L420048 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.
L420047 +++$+++ u2319 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ RAZININ +++$+++ Yes... leaving immediately.
L420046 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ You want me to go to Constantinople?
L420045 +++$+++ u2319 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ RAZININ +++$+++ It gives details which couldn't be invented. Naturally I want to verify it and that's why I need you.
L420044 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Oh, they shouldn't do such things. Are you sure this report is correct?
L420043 +++$+++ u2319 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ RAZININ +++$+++ As soon as our representatives go to a foreign country they seem to lose all sense of balance. If I told you what's going on in Constantinople right now you wouldn't believe it. Those three have been sitting there for six weeks and haven't sold a piece of fur.  This anonymous report was sent me. They are dragging the good name of our country through every café and night club. Here...  "How can the Bolshevik cause gain respect among the Moslems if your three representatives, Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski, get so drunk that they throw a carpet out of their hotel window and complain to the management that it didn't fly?"
L420042 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ May I ask what has happened?
L420041 +++$+++ u2319 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ RAZININ +++$+++ I haven't either, but I've heard about them. You must realize it was only on the strength of your Paris report that I sent them to Constantinople; without that I never would have trusted them on a mission as important as the fur deal.
L420040 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ No.
L420039 +++$+++ u2319 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ RAZININ +++$+++ Well, Comrade, have you heard from your friends Kopalski, Buljanoff, and Iranoff?
L420038 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Thank you.
L420037 +++$+++ u2319 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ RAZININ +++$+++ Cigarette?
L420036 +++$+++ u2319 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ RAZININ +++$+++ Please... sit down.
L420035 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ May I ask why?
L420034 +++$+++ u2319 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ RAZININ +++$+++ Well, Comrade, I am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else.
L420033 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ I need very little sleep. We must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange. I have already started a survey of our most urgent needs.
L420032 +++$+++ u2319 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ RAZININ +++$+++ That's marvelous.... You must have worked day and night.... Don't you ever sleep?
L420031 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Yes.
L420030 +++$+++ u2319 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ RAZININ +++$+++ You mean you have finished the whole investigation?
L420029 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Yes, it does.
L420028 +++$+++ u2319 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ RAZININ +++$+++ Does this include the products of the Far Eastern provinces?
L420027 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Good morning, Comrade Commissar. Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months.
L420026 +++$+++ u2319 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ RAZININ +++$+++ Good morning, Comrade.
L419438 +++$+++ u2317 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ PÈRE MATHIEU +++$+++ That also is a question of food, madame. I'll bring you a nice little lunch à la Père Mathieu. 
L419437 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ The future of the common people.
L419436 +++$+++ u2317 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ PÈRE MATHIEU +++$+++ But, madame! If you don't think about food what do you think about?
L419435 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Bring me something simple. I never think about food.
L419429 +++$+++ u2317 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ PÈRE MATHIEU +++$+++ Oh, madame! This is a restaurant, not a meadow.
L419428 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Raw carrots and beets.
L419427 +++$+++ u2317 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ PÈRE MATHIEU +++$+++ I think this is the first time you have been to my little place. Your face is new to me. Now, what shall it be?
L419426 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ This will do. 
L419425 +++$+++ u2317 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ PÈRE MATHIEU +++$+++ This way, madame. Are you alone? By the window perhaps?  Or a nice little corner table?
L419423 +++$+++ u2321 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ TAXI DRIVER +++$+++ Eight blocks down in the Rue de Poivrel.
L419422 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Where is it?
L419421 +++$+++ u2321 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ TAXI DRIVER +++$+++ It's just a place for workmen.
L419420 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Where is that?
L419419 +++$+++ u2321 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ TAXI DRIVER +++$+++ At Père Mathieu's.
L419418 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Where do you eat?
L419417 +++$+++ u2321 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ TAXI DRIVER +++$+++ Well, there's Pruniers if you care for seafood. If you want to lunch in the Bois, there's...
L419416 +++$+++ u2314 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ NINOTCHKA +++$+++ Can you recommend a restaurant?
L419415 +++$+++ u2321 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ TAXI DRIVER +++$+++ Where to, madame?
L418968 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Thank you so much, my friend. I will get in touch with you.
L418967 +++$+++ u2318 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ RAKONIN +++$+++ I am sorry... I have to leave.
L418963 +++$+++ u2318 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ RAKONIN +++$+++ This morning three Soviet agents arrived. I overheard a telephone conversation with Mercier, the jeweler. Your Highness, they are going to sell them!
L418962 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Alexis! Do you know what you are saying?
L418961 +++$+++ u2318 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ RAKONIN +++$+++ They are here!... Your jewels!... Here in Paris!
L418960 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ Why do you bring this up after so many years?
L418959 +++$+++ u2318 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ RAKONIN +++$+++ I remember one birthday of His Majesty, our beloved Czar... I had the honor of being on guard at the summer palace... I still see you bending before His Majesty... You wore your diadem and a necklace... your face seemed to be lighted by the jewels.
L418958 +++$+++ u2320 +++$+++ m149 +++$+++ SWANA +++$+++ My jewels?!
