L487118 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ We haven't ruled out that possibil...
L487117 +++$+++ u7506 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ He's not a suspect, is he?
L487116 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ No, not yet.
L487115 +++$+++ u7506 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Really? You small town guys are good. And have you located Sidney's father?
L487114 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ We're tracking the cellular phone bill.
L487113 +++$+++ u7506 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Well, we can hope, can't we? We certainly don't have any leads. A ghost mask, a cellular phone -- not much there.
L487112 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Serial killer is not really accurate, ma'am. The killer has yet to strike twice.
L487111 +++$+++ u7506 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Boy, you people sure do make fuss over a serial killer.
L487108 +++$+++ u7506 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Twenty-five, huh? In a demographic study I proved to be most popular amongst males, 11-24. I just missed you. Of course, you don't look a day over twelve, except in the upper torso area. Does the force require that you work out?
L487107 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ I'm twenty-five years old, ma'am.
L487106 +++$+++ u7506 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ I know, I should be in New York covering the Sharon Stone stalker but who knew? Please, call me Gale. You look awfully young to be a police officer.
L487105 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.
L487104 +++$+++ u7506 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ And why is that? Has something happened?
L487103 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
L487102 +++$+++ u7506 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Productive. So they're closing down the school?
L487101 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
L487100 +++$+++ u7506 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent, INSIDE STORY.
L487274 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ She's with me. I just wanted to check on things.
L487273 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ What is she doing here?
L487242 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ Shit.
L487241 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the way, I promise.
L487240 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ No, Dewey. You'll ruin the whole night.
L487193 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ Don't be so self-righteous. It's just a little blow out -- we'll be perfectly safe.
L487192 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ A party? Mom's gonna kill you. Then me.
L486932 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy but we're ready to go.
L486931 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ What did Mama tell you? When I wear this badge you treat me like a man of the law.
L486927 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Hold up a sec...
L486926 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ Hey... Dewey. Can we go now?
L486888 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ Yes, you doofus.
L486887 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Does mom know?
L486884 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ You can't be here, Tatum. This is an official crime scene.
L486883 +++$+++ u7517 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ TATUM +++$+++ Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
L486882 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L487289 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Not yet.
L487288 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Should I be worried?
L487287 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Afraid not.
L487286 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Have they found my father?
L487239 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Looks like I'm your personal bodyguard tonight, Sid.
L487238 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Yeah.
L487237 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ You girls ready.
L487199 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Thanks, Dewey. But with my luck they'd cast Tori Spelling.
L487198 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself.
L487195 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Hey, I saw that movie. True story, 'bout some killer in Texas.
L487194 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN.
L486985 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ And my Dad? Any word on him?
L486984 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross-referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him.
L486983 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up.
L486982 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Billy was released. His cellular bill was clean. He didn't make those calls.
L486949 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Not yet, but we're looking. If you need anything...
L486948 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Any word on my Dad?
L486905 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry.
L486904 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I don't know. I guess.
L486903 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?
L486902 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ At the airport.
L486901 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ You're sure it was the Hilton?
L486900 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Did you reach my Dad?
L486880 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ ...yeah...
L486879 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ You gonna be able to come down to the station and talk to us a bit?
L487218 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Yes, sir.
L487217 +++$+++ u7514 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SHERIFF BURKE +++$+++ Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.
L487216 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.
L487215 +++$+++ u7514 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SHERIFF BURKE +++$+++ Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.
L487214 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ She's with my sister. Should I bring her in?
L487213 +++$+++ u7514 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SHERIFF BURKE +++$+++ He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney?
L487212 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ You think he could still be in town?
L487211 +++$+++ u7514 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SHERIFF BURKE +++$+++ They believe he's out of state by now. We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night. If he's not picked up by morning -- we'll do a house to house.
L487210 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Have you contacted the bureau?
L487209 +++$+++ u7514 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SHERIFF BURKE +++$+++ There's more. Guess what tomorrow is? The anniversary of his wife's death. It all fits. He's our man.
L487208 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Couldn't his cellular number have been cloned?
L487207 +++$+++ u7514 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SHERIFF BURKE +++$+++ Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls were listed to Neil Prescott -- Sidney's father. He made the calls with his cellular phone. It's confirmed.
L487206 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Keeping my eye on Sidney.
L487205 +++$+++ u7514 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SHERIFF BURKE +++$+++ Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?
L487099 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Yes, sir, sheriff.
L487098 +++$+++ u7514 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SHERIFF BURKE +++$+++ She's okay. Looks like some boys were teasing her. Himbry's shutting down the school though. I want you to take look around.
L486929 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ We haven't located her Dad yet.
L486928 +++$+++ u7514 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SHERIFF BURKE +++$+++ She staying with you?
L486925 +++$+++ u7514 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SHERIFF BURKE +++$+++ Twenty years ago I woulda said not a chance. But these kids today... damn if I know.
L486924 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ They're pulling Loomis' account. But it'll be morning before we see something. You think he did it?
L486923 +++$+++ u7514 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SHERIFF BURKE +++$+++ What about the cellular phone bill?
L486922 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ That ghost mask is sold at both Kroger's and WalMart. Neither of which keep purchase records.
L486877 +++$+++ u7514 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SHERIFF BURKE +++$+++ Have to be. The shit she's gone through.
L486876 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ She's tough.
L486875 +++$+++ u7514 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SHERIFF BURKE +++$+++ How is she?
L486874 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ Drive by patrol.
L486873 +++$+++ u7514 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SHERIFF BURKE +++$+++ What were you doing out here?
L486872 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ I was first to respond.
L486870 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ He's her boyfriend.
L486869 +++$+++ u7514 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SHERIFF BURKE +++$+++ Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...
L486868 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ We got him, Sheriff. Billy Loomis.
L486768 +++$+++ u7514 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SHERIFF BURKE +++$+++ How is everything?
L486767 +++$+++ u7504 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ DEWEY +++$+++ It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.
L486704 +++$+++ u7511 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Not my daughter... not my...
L486703 +++$+++ u7505 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Casey! Casey!
L486702 +++$+++ u7511 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I can hear her. Oh Mother of God, I can hear her.
L486701 +++$+++ u7505 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Where is she?
L486698 +++$+++ u7511 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ The phone's dead.
L486697 +++$+++ u7505 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Casey? Where are you honey? Call the police, goddamnit.
L486696 +++$+++ u7505 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Call the police.
L486695 +++$+++ u7511 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ Where is she?
L486694 +++$+++ u7505 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Casey? Casey?
L486693 +++$+++ u7511 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ What is it? Where's Casey?
L486692 +++$+++ u7505 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ Jesus...
L486691 +++$+++ u7511 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ MOTHER +++$+++ I told you to send it back.
L486690 +++$+++ u7505 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ FATHER +++$+++ That fish smelled strong.
L487251 +++$+++ u7506 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ As long as it records I don't give a shit. We're not doing a remote.
L487250 +++$+++ u7509 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ About thirty seconds.
L487249 +++$+++ u7506 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ What's the delay?
L487248 +++$+++ u7509 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ The control board's glitched. You know we can't carry a live picture.
L487247 +++$+++ u7506 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Prep the compact, we'll hide it in a window and tape all of tonight's festivities.
L487246 +++$+++ u7509 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ What's the plan?
L487030 +++$+++ u7506 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Not this time. I owe Cotton that much. Hell, even I thought that man was guilty.
L487029 +++$+++ u7509 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ But it's so much easier when we make it up.
L487028 +++$+++ u7506 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof.
L487027 +++$+++ u7509 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge.
L487026 +++$+++ u7506 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ No, not so fast. We have nothing concrete.
L487025 +++$+++ u7509 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ You want to go live?
L487024 +++$+++ u7506 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Jesus Christ! An innocent man on death row. A killer still on the loose. Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.
L486892 +++$+++ u7506 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Jesus! The camera-hurry!
L486891 +++$+++ u7509 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ KENNY +++$+++ What? What?
L487015 +++$+++ u7506 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ But couldn't it have been someone else you saw wearing that coat? The same person who planted it in Cotton's car, framing him? The same person who really killed your mother?
L487014 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I saw him leaving wearing it.
L487013 +++$+++ u7506 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ He was drunk that night. He left his coat at your house, after your mother seduced him...
L487012 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ He's lying. She wouldn't have touched him. He raped her, then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat.
L487011 +++$+++ u7506 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.
L487010 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Has his story changed?
L487009 +++$+++ u7506 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Many times.
L487008 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Have you talked to Cotton?
L487007 +++$+++ u7506 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ I think you falsely identified him. Yes.
L487006 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
L487005 +++$+++ u7506 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ He was convicted in a court of law. Your testimony put him away. It doesn't matter what I think.
L487004 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Do you still think he's innocent?
L487003 +++$+++ u7506 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that.
L487002 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories.
L487001 +++$+++ u7506 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. Somebody was gonna write a book about it.
L487000 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ You owe my mother.
L486999 +++$+++ u7506 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ I owe you shit.
L486998 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Please. You owe me.
L486997 +++$+++ u7506 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Forget it.
L486996 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Off the record. No cameras.
L486995 +++$+++ u7506 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Kenny. Camera. Now.
L486994 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I want to talk to you.
L486993 +++$+++ u7506 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Just stay back.
L486992 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I'm not here to fight.
L486944 +++$+++ u7506 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ I'll send you a copy.
L486943 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I'll look for it.
L486942 +++$+++ u7506 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ It'll be out later this year.
L486941 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ How's the book?
L486940 +++$+++ u7506 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GALE +++$+++ Yes, that's right.
L486939 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ It's okay, Tatum. She's just doing her job. Right, GALE?
L487085 +++$+++ u7507 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GIRL #1 +++$+++ Ricki Lake.
L487084 +++$+++ u7508 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GIRL #2 +++$+++ Where do you get this shit?
L487083 +++$+++ u7507 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GIRL #1 +++$+++ And it fucked her up royally. Think about it. It makes perfect sense. Her mom's death leaves her distraught and hostile at a cruel and inhumane world, she's disillusioned, where's God, etc. Completely suicidal. And one day she snaps. She wants to kill herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year. And homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression.
L487082 +++$+++ u7508 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GIRL #2 +++$+++ Cut some slack. She watched her mom get butchered.
L487081 +++$+++ u7507 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GIRL #1 +++$+++ Please, it's common knowledge. Her mother was a trollop.
L487080 +++$+++ u7508 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GIRL #2 +++$+++ You're evil.
L487079 +++$+++ u7507 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GIRL #1 +++$+++ Maybe she's a slut just like her mom.
L487078 +++$+++ u7508 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GIRL #2 +++$+++ Why would Sidney want to be with Steve? She has her own bubble-butt boyfriend Billy.
L487077 +++$+++ u7507 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GIRL #1 +++$+++ Maybe she was hot for Steve and killed them both in a jealous rage.
L487076 +++$+++ u7508 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GIRL #2 +++$+++ And why would she do that?
L487075 +++$+++ u7507 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GIRL #1 +++$+++ What if she did it? What if Sidney killed Casey and Steve?
L487074 +++$+++ u7507 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GIRL #1 +++$+++ For attention. The girl has some serious issues.
L487073 +++$+++ u7508 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GIRL #2 +++$+++ Why would she lie about it?
L487072 +++$+++ u7507 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ GIRL #1 +++$+++ She was never attacked. I think she made it all up.
L486970 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Who are you?
L486969 +++$+++ u7510 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.
L486968 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ LEAVEMEALONE!
L486967 +++$+++ u7510 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ Poor Billy-boyfriend. An innocent guy doesn't stand a chance with you.
L486965 +++$+++ u7510 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ Hello Sidney.
L486964 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Hello?
L486858 +++$+++ u7510 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ If you hang up, you'll die just like your mother.
L486857 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry. Bye now.
L486856 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ What am I doing?
L486855 +++$+++ u7510 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L486854 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Can you see me right now?
L486853 +++$+++ u7510 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ Right here.
L486852 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ So where are you?
L486850 +++$+++ u7510 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ That's the original part.
L486849 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Why would you call me from my front porch?
L486848 +++$+++ u7510 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ Your front porch.
L486847 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ So where are you?
L486846 +++$+++ u7510 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ The question is not who am I. The question is where am I?
L486845 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ So who are you?
L486844 +++$+++ u7510 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
L486843 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
L486842 +++$+++ u7510 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ Are you alone in the house?
L486841 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Because they're all the same. It's always some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl -- who can't act -- who always runs up the stairs when she should be going out the front door. They're ridiculous.
L486840 +++$+++ u7510 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ And why is that?
L486839 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
L486838 +++$+++ u7510 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ What's your favorite scary movie?
L486837 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
L486836 +++$+++ u7510 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ Do you like scary movies, Sidney?
L486835 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over.
L486834 +++$+++ u7510 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ MAN +++$+++ Scary night, isn't it? With the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something.
L486833 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ I have no idea.
L486724 +++$+++ u7512 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ MR. PRESCOTT +++$+++ Sleep tight, sweetie.
L486723 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Have a good trip.
L486721 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ Got it.
L486720 +++$+++ u7512 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ MR. PRESCOTT +++$+++ ...so call if you need me.
L486719 +++$+++ u7515 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ SIDNEY +++$+++ ...out at the airport...
L486718 +++$+++ u7512 +++$+++ m507 +++$+++ MR. PRESCOTT +++$+++ No? Oh, well... I'm hitting the sack. My flight leaves first thing in the morning. Now the expo runs all weekend so I won't be back til Sunday. There's cash on the table and I'll be staying at the Raleigh Hilton...
