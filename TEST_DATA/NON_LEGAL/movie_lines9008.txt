L107917 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ I do remember something good. All the time. I remember you.
L107916 +++$+++ u619 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ We write them down because sooner or later you're going to remember something good.
L107915 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ -- it's always bad and it's never anything but bits and pieces anyway!  You ever think that maybe it's just making it worse? You don't wonder that?
L107914 +++$+++ u619 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ -- it hasn't been two years --
L107913 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --
L107912 +++$+++ u619 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ You're sure?  We should still -- we should write it down.
L107911 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ No. There's nothing new.
L107910 +++$+++ u619 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ I'll get the book.
L107909 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Conklin up front.
L107908 +++$+++ u619 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ MARIE +++$+++ Where were you, Jason? In the car.
L108312 +++$+++ u622 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ ...it's not in the file... I swear... I know your file... your first job was Geneva!... I swear to God you never worked here!...
L108311 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ I was here!
L108310 +++$+++ u622 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ No... Jason... please...
L108309 +++$+++ u622 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You never worked Berlin...
L108308 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ That's a lie!
L108307 +++$+++ u622 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Your first assignment was Geneva.
L108306 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ My first job.
L108305 +++$+++ u622 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ No. You never worked Berlin.
L108304 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
L108303 +++$+++ u622 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What do you mean?
L108302 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ So when was I here?
L108301 +++$+++ u622 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...
L108300 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Abbott?
L108299 +++$+++ u622 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Please -- I'm only here because of Paris -- because they can't figure out what you're doing -- I'm here because of Abbott --
L108298 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Why are you here, then?
L108296 +++$+++ u622 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Conklin! Stuff on Conklin! 
L108295 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ What was Landy buying? What kind of files?  WHAT WAS SHE BUYING?
L108293 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ I left a fingerprint! You fucking people.
L108292 +++$+++ u622 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!
L108291 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ I killed him???
L108290 +++$+++ u622 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ And you got to him before we could.
L108289 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Last week? When?
L108288 +++$+++ u622 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.
L108287 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ A Russian?
L108286 +++$+++ u622 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Last week an Agency field officer went to make a buy from a Russian national.
L108285 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Say it.
L108284 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ I want to hear it from you.
L108283 +++$+++ u622 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What is this, a game?
L108282 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ How do they know that? How can they know any of that?
L108280 +++$+++ u622 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ They know!  They know you were here. They know you killed these two guys. They know you and Conklin had something on the side. They don't know what it is, but they know!
L108279 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Why is she trying to kill me?
L108275 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ IS SHE RUNNING TREADSTONE?
L108274 +++$+++ u622 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You hear me? I believed you.
L108273 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Who is Pamela Landy?
L108272 +++$+++ u622 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I did... Jason, I swear, I did... I told them... I told them I believed you...
L108265 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Get on it.
L108264 +++$+++ u622 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Yes.
L108263 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ See that tram coming around the corner?
L108531 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ Why you're alive?  You're alive because you're special. Because she kept you alive.  Because we want you back on our side.
L108530 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ You didn't answer my question.
L108529 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ Sounds like a threat.
L108528 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Don't need it. I remember everything.
L108526 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ Do you think you can read? Are you well enough?
L108525 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ What's that?
L108524 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ Thank you for your gift. I'm sorry about Marie.
L108522 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ Are you disappointed?
L108521 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Why am I alive?
L108520 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ Careful...
L108519 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Oh, shit...
L108518 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ Ramstein Air Base, Germany.  Before the wall fell you would have woken up in a Russian prison hospital.
L108517 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Where am I?
L108246 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ Alexanderplatz. 30 minutes. Under the World Clock. Alone. Give her your phone.
L108245 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ Okay, Jason, your move.
L108242 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ There was a girl in Paris. Part of the program. She used to handle the medication.
L108241 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ Who?
L108240 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ I want someone I know to take me in.
L108239 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ Okay, how do you want to do it?
L108238 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ I want to come in.
L108237 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ What do you want?
L108236 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ Bourne?
L108235 +++$+++ u613 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ BOURNE +++$+++ It's me.
L108441 +++$+++ u614 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ CRONIN +++$+++ Hold on...  Yep. And Abbott just direct dialed Moscow from his room...
L108440 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ What? The tapes?
L108439 +++$+++ u614 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ CRONIN +++$+++ You're sure?
L108431 +++$+++ u614 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ CRONIN +++$+++ But we can relax. We tracked him. He's on a train to Moscow.
L108430 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ We'll know for sure when we get the security tapes.
L108370 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ This stays between you and I.  We finally have an edge. I don't want to lose it.
L108369 +++$+++ u614 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ CRONIN +++$+++ What?
L108368 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ Alright... take it down.
L108357 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ I want to look at the room.  Check it out.
L108356 +++$+++ u614 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ CRONIN +++$+++ Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?
L108348 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ -- the hotel -- how far? --
L108347 +++$+++ u614 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ CRONIN +++$+++ -- go -- take the van! --
L108102 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ -- uplink all relevant files to Kim --  -- and I want them to contact anyone who had anything to do with Treadstone --
L108101 +++$+++ u614 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ CRONIN +++$+++ -- Kurt's reopening all the wyfi and sat links --
L108072 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ Then get a number, they need to know who they're dealing with.
L108071 +++$+++ u614 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ CRONIN +++$+++ There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --
L108070 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ Who's going? Us?
L108069 +++$+++ u614 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ CRONIN +++$+++ Looks like he's been detained.
L108012 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ And the Germans can't match it?
L108011 +++$+++ u614 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ CRONIN +++$+++ -- so there were two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines. One of them failed. The fingerprint...  That's from the one that didn't go off.
L108010 +++$+++ u614 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ CRONIN +++$+++ I'm working on it.
L108009 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ We need to get in there.
L107999 +++$+++ u626 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ VIC +++$+++ -- shut up! -- just shut the --
L107998 +++$+++ u617 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ IVAN +++$+++ -- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
L107997 +++$+++ u626 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ VIC +++$+++ -- who? -- who else is here? --
L107995 +++$+++ u617 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ IVAN +++$+++ Is there. Is all there.
L107994 +++$+++ u626 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ VIC +++$+++ This is everything? Is there.
L107993 +++$+++ u617 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ IVAN +++$+++ Now. Show now.
L107992 +++$+++ u626 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ VIC +++$+++ Here?
L107991 +++$+++ u617 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ IVAN +++$+++ Show me.
L108066 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ I think that Bourne and Conklin were in business. That Bourne is still involved. And that whatever information I was going to buy in Berlin, it was big enough to make Bourne come out from wherever he's been hiding to kill again.  How's that scan?
L108065 +++$+++ u620 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Okay, cut to the chase, Pam. What are you selling?
L107985 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ For a thief. A mole. I vetted the source, Marty. He's real. If it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects, it's a bargain at ten times the price.
L107984 +++$+++ u620 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ Still...
L107983 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop.
L107982 +++$+++ u620 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ It's a lot of money, Pam.
L107981 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ That's where we came out.
L107980 +++$+++ u620 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ MARSHALL +++$+++ I'm here. So is Donnie and Jack Weller. We understand you're using the full allocation for this buy?
L108095 +++$+++ u624 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA/PHONE +++$+++ I'm getting on a plane to Berlin in 45 minutes, which means you are going to call me back in 30, and when I ask you where we stand, I had better be impressed. My mobile number is...
L108094 +++$+++ u621 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ NEVINS/PHONE +++$+++ Yes, sir -- ma'am...
L108093 +++$+++ u624 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA/PHONE +++$+++ I want that area secured, I want any evidence secured and I want it done now. Is that clear??
L108092 +++$+++ u624 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA/PHONE +++$+++ If you ever want to make it to five, you're gonna listen to me real close. Jason Bourne is armed and extremely dangerous. A week ago, he assassinated two men in Berlin, one of whom was a highly-experienced field officer... 
L108091 +++$+++ u621 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ NEVINS/PHONE +++$+++ Me? Four years.
L108090 +++$+++ u624 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA/PHONE +++$+++ How long have you worked for the agency?
L108086 +++$+++ u624 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA/PHONE +++$+++ Pamela Landy, again. Where do we stand?
L108085 +++$+++ u621 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ NEVINS/PHONE +++$+++ Who's this?
L108084 +++$+++ u624 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA/PHONE +++$+++ Mr. Nevins?
L108535 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ Felt promising. It's a start.
L108534 +++$+++ u622 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ So?
L108533 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ Let's give him half an hour.
L108256 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ Alright...
L108255 +++$+++ u622 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
L108254 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ What do you think? Is he coming in?
L108231 +++$+++ u622 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ It's got caffeine in it. That's all I know.
L108230 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ Is it fresh?
L108204 +++$+++ u622 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Because he's doing just what he said he'd do. He's coming for us.
L108203 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ And why is that?
L108202 +++$+++ u622 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway.
L108136 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ See, that's a problem for me, Nicky. Whatever he's doing, we need to end it. This isn't the kind of mess you walk away from.
L108135 +++$+++ u622 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.
L108134 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ Some women like Dobermans --
L108133 +++$+++ u622 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
L108132 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ Did you?
L108131 +++$+++ u622 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You mean, did I want a date?
L108130 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
L108129 +++$+++ u622 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice.
L108128 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ Not good enough. You're the person who floated this amnesia story.  Ever feel sorry for him? For what he'd been through?
L108127 +++$+++ u622 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ If you say so.
L108126 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ So he fooled you.
L108125 +++$+++ u622 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
L108124 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ Believed what?
L108123 +++$+++ u622 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him.
L108122 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ Are you an expert in amnesia?
L108121 +++$+++ u622 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Am I a doctor, no, but...
L108120 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ I'm curious about Bourne. Your interpretation of his condition. You have specific training in the identification and diagnosis of psychological conditions?
L108119 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ You were his local contact. You were with him the night Conklin died. You're coming with us.
L108118 +++$+++ u622 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Good luck.
L108114 +++$+++ u622 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Before this? Before Bourne? No.
L108113 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ Amnesia?
L108112 +++$+++ u622 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ NICKY +++$+++ Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --
L108111 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ What kind of problems?
L108393 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ And what about you, anything?
L108392 +++$+++ u625 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ TEDDY +++$+++ Yes. In that order.
L108391 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ Are we hacking or asking?
L108390 +++$+++ u625 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ TEDDY +++$+++ We're looking at all Berlin outbound. Good news is, every train station in Berlin has thirty to forty fixed, digital security cameras. Common feed.
L108387 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ Alright... I want you, Kurt and Kim to stay on Bourne, track everything that's out there...
L108386 +++$+++ u625 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ TEDDY +++$+++ His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself. 
L108385 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ By who?
L108384 +++$+++ u625 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ TEDDY +++$+++ Here's what I've got.  Remember Vladimir Neski? Russian politician? Seven years ago, he was due to speak to a group of European Oil ministers here at the hotel. He never did. He was murdered.
L108355 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ Yeah, that'll work...What the hell was he doing here?
L108354 +++$+++ u625 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ TEDDY +++$+++ Black coat, possibly leather. Dark slacks. Dark t-shirt.  He says they're gonna try and corral the guests on the street over there, and then check them out, but...
L108224 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ Are we locked up?
L108223 +++$+++ u625 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ TEDDY +++$+++ No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
L108222 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ Anything?
L108018 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ What the hell is a "Treadstone?"
L108017 +++$+++ u625 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ TEDDY +++$+++ Yup...  The main word there, the file heading, translates as: Treadstone.
L108016 +++$+++ u623 +++$+++ m39 +++$+++ PAMELA +++$+++ Do we know what this says?
L109843 +++$+++ u628 +++$+++ m40 +++$+++ ARGYLE +++$+++ They've been sanctified and buried in the holy rites of God's church, and any hand that disturbs them now takes on eternal damnation. So please -- do it.
L109842 +++$+++ u632 +++$+++ m40 +++$+++ LEADER +++$+++ Then we'll just have a peek at the wounds.  Dig 'em up!
L109841 +++$+++ u628 +++$+++ m40 +++$+++ ARGYLE +++$+++ My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
L109840 +++$+++ u632 +++$+++ m40 +++$+++ LEADER +++$+++ What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
L109839 +++$+++ u628 +++$+++ m40 +++$+++ ARGYLE +++$+++ We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?
L109838 +++$+++ u632 +++$+++ m40 +++$+++ LEADER +++$+++ Someone dead from this household?
L109855 +++$+++ u628 +++$+++ m40 +++$+++ ARGYLE +++$+++ Saying goodbye in their own way -- in outlawed tartans, with outlawed pipes, playing outlawed tunes.
L109854 +++$+++ u642 +++$+++ m40 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ What are they doing?
L109851 +++$+++ u628 +++$+++ m40 +++$+++ ARGYLE +++$+++ Non loquis Latinum? You don't speak Latin? We have to fix that, won't we?  Did he give the poetic benediction? The Lord bless thee and keep thee? Patris Benefactum et --  ...It was Malcolm's favorite.
L109850 +++$+++ u642 +++$+++ m40 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ It was in Latin, sir.
L109849 +++$+++ u628 +++$+++ m40 +++$+++ ARGYLE +++$+++ Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection? Or was it all about Judgment?
L109848 +++$+++ u628 +++$+++ m40 +++$+++ ARGYLE +++$+++ Didn't want your father to die either, did ya? But it happened.
L109847 +++$+++ u642 +++$+++ m40 +++$+++ WILLIAM +++$+++ I don't want to leave.
L109846 +++$+++ u628 +++$+++ m40 +++$+++ ARGYLE +++$+++ We'll sleep here tonight. You'll come home with me. We'll let the house, and the lands too; plenty of willing neighbors.
L110416 +++$+++ u629 +++$+++ m40 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ He has already agreed to come.
L110415 +++$+++ u641 +++$+++ m40 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ I will meet you, but only one way -- if Robert the Bruce is there, and puts his hand on my Bible, and swears his loyalty to Scotland.
L110414 +++$+++ u629 +++$+++ m40 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ We cannot. Some scarcely believe you are alive. Other think you'll pay them Mornay's wages. We bid you to Edinburgh.

L110413 +++$+++ u641 +++$+++ m40 +++$+++ WALLACE +++$+++ So let the council swear publicly.
L110412 +++$+++ u629 +++$+++ m40 +++$+++ CRAIG +++$+++ An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.
