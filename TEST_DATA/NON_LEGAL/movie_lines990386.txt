L573273 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ There were no children.  Rene died, and <u>then</u> Hugh Crain built all of this, and then he died. His heart was broken.
L573272 +++$+++ u8120 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ What happened?
L573121 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ Yes.  It's perfect, isn't it?
L573120 +++$+++ u8120 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ This is where we're going?
L573119 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ That?  That's Hill House.
L573118 +++$+++ u8120 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ What's this?  What's this... this picture?
L573113 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ Good.
L573112 +++$+++ u8120 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Here's how they're organized. Groups of five, very different personalities: scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.  And they all score high on the insomnia charts.
L573111 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ Because it's my phone.  Yes... Mrs. Dudley, just leave the boxes inside, thank you.  See you soon.  Thank you.
L573110 +++$+++ u8120 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ How'd I know it was for you?
L573109 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ Yes, this is Doctor Marrow.
L573108 +++$+++ u8120 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Test it.
L573107 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ You hear the vibrations in the wire.  There's a magnetic pulse in the wires, you feel it.  I could test it.
L573105 +++$+++ u8120 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You're going to publish, he's going to perish... And why did you hire me for this?
L573104 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ What?
L573103 +++$+++ u8120 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You know what he's really upset about?
L573627 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ But the experiment was a failure.
L573626 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ I'm a scientist.  I just conducted an experiment.  Now I have to write it up.
L573625 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I'm not going back to New York City.  I'm going to find an apartment with a little flower garden, where you can just see the ocean and at night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the sound of the harbor.  What about you?
L573614 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ Nell, what do we do?
L573613 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Oh God, we can't get out!
L573554 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ No.  If he's lost somewhere in the house... he'll have to stay lost until tomorrow, until the night is over.  What we have to do now is be together, with Nell.
L573553 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ He's wandering around the house, and Nell heard him.  She thought it was ghosts.  Let's go look for him again.
L573548 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ I'll take her with me to the University tomorrow.  I can't believe I read the test wrong.  I didn't see anything that looked like she was suicidal.
L573547 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ She needs help.
L573520 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Yes.  But I promised I wouldn't let her alone the whole night.
L573519 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ Is she asleep?
L573497 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ How could you do this to people?
L573496 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ Your fear of him was real.  That's all the ghost anyone needs.
L573480 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ It's okay... we're all here...
L573479 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ Get a blanket!
L573342 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ Mary came with me.
L573341 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Maybe they're Mary's.
L573329 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ Good morning, Theo.  Luke.
L573328 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Well this is a cozy breakfast.
L573267 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ Every day.  Basically we'll be hanging out together like we have so far this evening.
L573266 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ When do we take the tests?
L573233 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ No, but Nell's been here longer than I have.
L573232 +++$+++ u8119 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MARROW +++$+++ Have either of you seen David Watts?
L573425 +++$+++ u8121 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MR. DUDLEY +++$+++ Can't say.  Haven't been here that long.  Well, it's Labor Day, gotta get to work.
L573424 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ Why?
L573423 +++$+++ u8121 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MR. DUDLEY +++$+++ She was unhappy.
L573422 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ Yes.
L573421 +++$+++ u8121 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MR. DUDLEY +++$+++ Why'd she kill herself?
L573420 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ Why?
L573415 +++$+++ u8121 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MR. DUDLEY +++$+++ Rene Crain.  Up there.  Rope. Ship's hawser.  Hard to tie. Don't know how she got it.
L573414 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ Who?
L573413 +++$+++ u8121 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MR. DUDLEY +++$+++ That's where she hanged herself.
L573149 +++$+++ u8121 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MR. DUDLEY +++$+++ Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you.
L573148 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ Is there something about the house?
L573147 +++$+++ u8121 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MR. DUDLEY +++$+++ That's a good question.  What is it about fences?  Sometimes a locked chain makes people on both sides of the fence just a little more comfortable.  Why would that be?
L573146 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ Why do you need a chain like that?
L573144 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ I'm with Dr. Marrow's group.  I'm supposed to check in with Mrs. Dudley up at the house.  Is she here?
L573143 +++$+++ u8121 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MR. DUDLEY +++$+++ Yeah, I'm Mister Dudley, the caretaker.  What are you doing here?
L573142 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?
L573141 +++$+++ u8121 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MR. DUDLEY +++$+++ Me?  No.  What are you doing here?
L573140 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ Oh!  You scared me.
L573139 +++$+++ u8121 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MR. DUDLEY +++$+++ What do you want?
L573185 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ No one will come any nearer than that.
L573184 +++$+++ u8122 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MRS. DUDLEY +++$+++ No one could.  No one lives any nearer than town.
L573166 +++$+++ u8122 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MRS. DUDLEY +++$+++ -- no one could.  No one lives any nearer than town.  No one will come any nearer than that.  In the night.  In the dark.
L573165 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ Why would we --
L573164 +++$+++ u8122 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MRS. DUDLEY +++$+++ It's a job.  I keep banker's hours.  I set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six.  You can serve yourselves.  Breakfast is ready at nine.  I don't wait on people.  I don't stay after dinner.  Not after it begins to get dark.  I leave before dark comes.  We live in town.  Nine miles.  So there won't be anyone around if you need help.  We couldn't even hear you, in the night.
L573163 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ Well, I've never lived with beauty.  You must love working here.
L573162 +++$+++ u8122 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MRS. DUDLEY +++$+++ I've seen 'em.  Lot to dust.
L573161 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ They're so beautiful.  Aren't they?
L573156 +++$+++ u8122 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MRS. DUDLEY +++$+++ So far.
L573155 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ Mrs. Dudley.
L573154 +++$+++ u8122 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ MRS. DUDLEY +++$+++ It's make the soup or answer the door.  Can't do both.
L573590 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Then let's go get you one.
L573589 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ Oh, Theo.  You know I don't have an apartment.
L573586 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ Just had to be sure.
L573585 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ What'd you come back for, babe?
L573561 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Come on!  Why are we waiting?
L573560 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ They're all in here.  All the ones he killed.  They're just children! We have to help them!
L573511 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I do.
L573510 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ I don't think I want any.
L573509 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I'm going to stay with you until you fall asleep.  And then I'm going to get some brandy.
L573500 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ -- but the painting!
L573499 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Nell, it makes sense.  It all makes sense.  You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up.
L573498 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ This is real, I'm not making it up!  Theo, you saw it!  You were there -- the banging and last night.  You, you all saw the painting!
L573484 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ Carolyn showed me where she hid him, hid him with all the ones he killed --
L573483 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Nell, what happened?
L573472 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ Because I don't want to ruin things.  Because home is where the heart is.
L573471 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Then who is?  Come on, Nell.  Deep down, if you really thought it wasn't Jim, why wouldn't you be leaving right this second?  Why wouldn't you be afraid?  Really afraid.
L573466 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ -- What do you think?
L573465 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Marrow said the same thing as last night, he <u>says</u> --  -- that he checked with Mrs. Dudley.  And he says that she told him that all the fireplaces in the West Wing connect to the main chimney.  He says that he thinks that the flue was open, and with the windstorm, he says that what probably happened was some kind of freak air current --
L573458 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Okay.
L573457 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ I think so.
L573456 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Are you sure?
L573454 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ I'm trying.  Have you ever kept something to yourself because you were afraid it'd ruin things.
L573453 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ My place isn't like yours, Nell, it doesn't have a view of sea.  It doesn't have a view of anything. What's interesting about the way I live is what goes on inside the walls.  Living with me... My boundaries aren't very well defined, Nell.  Do you know what I mean?
L573452 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ I don't know, you know...
L573451 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You want to move to New York, you want to move in with me?
L573449 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I have a loft.
L573448 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ I'll take that as a compliment.  In the city, what kind of place do you live in?
L573447 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Me too.  Although I learned one thing about you, that you don't know about yourself.  You can be a pretty decent bitch.
L573446 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ I'm sorry I was mad at you, Theo.
L573445 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ Red.  What else?
L573444 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Well?
L573443 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ I've never had a pedicure before.
L573442 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Just think about one thing right now: What color?
L573441 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ I don't know what to think anymore.
L573440 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Well, it wasn't me.  Mister Dudley had to clean it and he knows that he's in charge of all the messes so why would he make more work for himself and...  You said the Good Doctor was with you.
L573438 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Before he painted your name over Mister Crain.
L573437 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ There's hundreds of them.  This must be a record of the children who died at the mills, like Luke said.
L573436 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ That's so sad.
L573400 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I don't know.  You've been alone for a long time, maybe you want attention.  Maybe he did it...
L573399 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ Why?
L573398 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Maybe you did it yourself.
L573397 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ Theo... Did you?
L573369 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ No, it's getting worse.
L573368 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Is it over?
L573367 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Maybe he never came in.  If he'd come in, he would have left his bags at the door, right?  Or maybe he got here early, and went for a walk, and fell.  Maybe he's outside.
L573366 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ David?
L573358 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ David?  David Watts?  Can you hear us?  David!  Daviiiiid!
L573357 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ David.
L573356 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ What's his first name?
L573355 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Watts?
L573350 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Two sets.  I don't know.  Maybe they're not even his.
L573349 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ How could he have left without his keys?
L573332 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ I guess.  Oh, your hair!  It looks good.
L573331 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ Yes.  I feel realy rested, too. Theo?
L573315 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ You know it wasn't a joke, Theo.
L573314 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ If this was some sort of joke, I'm going to kill him.
L573303 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You, too.  Happy tossing and turning.
L573302 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ Good night, Theo.
L573301 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ No.  The world has missed you.
L573300 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ Yes.  I've missed it.
L573299 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you?
L573293 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ The Taj Mahal wasn't a palace, it was a tomb.  Why didn't he tell us?
L573292 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ A monster?  But he built this for the woman he loved, like the Taj Mahal.
L573209 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ You're okay.
L573208 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ I love this house.  I really love this house.
L573203 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ I know.
L573202 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Jeez.
L573198 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ I don't have anyone.  But I do have a little apartment of my own.  It has a little flower garden.  You can just see the ocean.  At night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the buoys in the harbor.
L573197 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ A blank canvas!  I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not.  So, you?  Husbands? Boyfriends?  Girlfriends?  Where do you live?
L573196 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ No.
L573195 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ My boyfriend thinks so, my girlfriend doesn't.  If we could all live together... but... they hate each other.  It's hard to be Miss Perversity when you're the only one at the party.  D'you know what I mean?
L573194 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ Ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment.
L573193 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Don't tell me Boston is different from New York.
L573192 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ Not really.
L573191 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ That depends.
L573190 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ I'm between jobs right now.  My last job... it... the person I was working for... the job ended. Over.  So... And you?
L573189 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ What do you do?
L573188 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ That's why we're here.
L573187 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Don't worry, I probably won't be in here much.  Light sleeper.
L573178 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ I don't know what you mean.
L573177 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ Wait.  You're not wearing that ironically?  This is really you?
L573176 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ It's all I could afford.
L573175 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!
L573174 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ Fifteen dollars.
L573173 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ What did it cost?
L573172 +++$+++ u8123 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ NELL +++$+++ This?  It's from a thrift shop.
L573171 +++$+++ u8124 +++$+++ m551 +++$+++ THEO +++$+++ And what you're wearing, that's great, too.
L575334 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ Because --
L575333 +++$+++ u8126 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ADHARA +++$+++ Why not?
L575332 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ No.
L575329 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ We can't find ...  ... two of our guys.
L575328 +++$+++ u8126 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ADHARA +++$+++ We think?
L575327 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ We think someone is here.
L575105 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ I sure hope so.
L575104 +++$+++ u8126 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ADHARA +++$+++ Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
L575103 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
L575102 +++$+++ u8126 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ADHARA +++$+++ Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
L575101 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ What's the matter?
L575100 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ All your life.  That happened while I swam the length of my pool.
L575099 +++$+++ u8126 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ADHARA +++$+++ I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've never done this drive.
L574964 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ I'm a gracious host.
L574963 +++$+++ u8126 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ADHARA +++$+++ Hey, I thought you weren't a buffet person.
L574955 +++$+++ u8126 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ADHARA +++$+++ It must've been a time.  A golden moment.
L574954 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ We all did.
L574953 +++$+++ u8126 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ADHARA +++$+++ I like the colors.
L574797 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ Sure.
L574796 +++$+++ u8126 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ADHARA +++$+++ Not who, food.  Should we get Italian.
L574795 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ Who?
L574794 +++$+++ u8126 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ADHARA +++$+++ Italian.
L574793 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ I'm sorry.
L574792 +++$+++ u8126 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ADHARA +++$+++ Italian?
L574778 +++$+++ u8126 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ADHARA +++$+++ Oh, god.
L574777 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ That's what Gordon's always saying.
L574776 +++$+++ u8126 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ADHARA +++$+++ For some, eating is a sensual experience. <u>The</u> sensual experience.
L574775 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ It's just fuel to me.  I'm not there for distractions.
L574774 +++$+++ u8126 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ADHARA +++$+++ You demand to be served.  A fork fetishist.
L574773 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine. Buffets.  Salad bars.
L574772 +++$+++ u8126 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ADHARA +++$+++ Like you.
L574771 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ I'm not into finger foods.  Too fussy.
L574770 +++$+++ u8126 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ADHARA +++$+++ Why?
L574769 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ Anything but Japanese.
L574768 +++$+++ u8126 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ADHARA +++$+++ What kind of food?
L574767 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ As soon as you get dressed.
L574766 +++$+++ u8126 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ADHARA +++$+++ It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry. When are we eating?
L574765 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ It's not a compliment.
L574764 +++$+++ u8126 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ADHARA +++$+++ It's not a knock.
L574763 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ I'm so glad we're having this chat.
L574762 +++$+++ u8126 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ADHARA +++$+++ No.  You're not specific enough to be a person.  You're more like a vibe.
L574761 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ I'm not.
L574760 +++$+++ u8126 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ ADHARA +++$+++ Well, you're certainly not a person.
L574759 +++$+++ u8141 +++$+++ m552 +++$+++ VALENTINE +++$+++ Am I a thing?
