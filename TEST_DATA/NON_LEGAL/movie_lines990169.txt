L417051 +++$+++ u6886 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ It's okay, I'm not tired.  Really.
L417050 +++$+++ u6883 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel.
L417049 +++$+++ u6886 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ I thought I'd wait for you.
L417048 +++$+++ u6883 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Don't "hi Mom" me.  What are you still doing up?  It's past one!
L417047 +++$+++ u6886 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ Hi Mom.
L417046 +++$+++ u6883 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ ELAINE +++$+++ Are you crazy?  You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
L417082 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Don't hold your breath.
L417081 +++$+++ u6884 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I've been good.  When do I get cigarette priveleges back?
L417080 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ They're healing up nicely.
L417079 +++$+++ u6884 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Menthol, regular, ultra-light.
L417078 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ How's your hand?
L417077 +++$+++ u6884 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Morning, Doctor Goldman.
L417076 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Good morning, Jennifer.
L417325 +++$+++ u6884 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Deal.  Thanks.
L417324 +++$+++ u6888 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ If you get caught, I never saw you. Deal?
L417323 +++$+++ u6884 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Just tonight, please?  I can't handle the nightmare.  Not tonight.  Not after Phillip.
L417322 +++$+++ u6888 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Jennifer --
L417321 +++$+++ u6884 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ I gotta stay up, Max.
L417320 +++$+++ u6888 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ If Simms catches you in here after lights out, she'll chew my ass ragged.
L417319 +++$+++ u6884 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Wait and see.
L417318 +++$+++ u6888 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Oh, right.  You're gonna be a TV star.
L417317 +++$+++ u6884 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Research.
L417316 +++$+++ u6888 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I can see that. You watch too damn much TV.
L417315 +++$+++ u6884 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ JENNIFER +++$+++ Watching TV.
L417314 +++$+++ u6888 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Girl, what are you doing?
L417587 +++$+++ u6885 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ KINCAID +++$+++ YOU'RE HOT STIT WITH A LITTLE MUTE KID -- LET'S SEE YOU TAKE A PIECE OF ME!  KRUEGER!
L417586 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Kincaid -- we should find the others first...
L417540 +++$+++ u6885 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ KINCAID +++$+++ No fuckin' way.  We're a team.
L417539 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ You didn't think we'd let you go alone?
L417377 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Last time, it was me against him.  I wasn't strong enough...alone.
L417376 +++$+++ u6885 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ KINCAID +++$+++ So what do we do about this creep?
L417368 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ He wears a dirty brown hat.  He's horribly burned.  He has razors on his right hand.
L417367 +++$+++ u6885 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ KINCAID +++$+++ Don't fucking humor us.  We're not in the mood.
L417366 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ I know who's trying to kill you.
L417262 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ No, she's right.
L417261 +++$+++ u6885 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ KINCAID +++$+++ Horseshit.
L417646 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Yes.  I'm going to see her tonight.
L417645 +++$+++ u6886 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ Do you still...see each other?
L417644 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ It was great seeing you again.  I'm glad you dropped by.
L417643 +++$+++ u6886 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ To old friends.
L417642 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ To old friends.  And your new dreams.
L417641 +++$+++ u6886 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ I don't know.  I'm busy with school. New friends.  But I'll never forget the old ones.
L417640 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ The city that never sleeps.  So what will you do now?
L417639 +++$+++ u6886 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ I think new York was just what I needed.  So many people.  I never feel alone.
L417638 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ I'm glad things have worked out for you.
L417415 +++$+++ u6886 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ He's close...
L417414 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ What's happening?
L417634 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ I'm so proud of you all.  Tell Neil I...
L417633 +++$+++ u6886 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ He's gone.  It's over.  Please don't die, Nancy.  Please.
L417621 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ I think so.
L417620 +++$+++ u6886 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ Are you okay?
L417611 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Let's try this way.
L417610 +++$+++ u6886 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ They sedated me.  We're stuck here till it wears off.
L417609 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Kristen, can you pull us out?
L417596 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ He's too strong!  He was never this strong!
L417595 +++$+++ u6886 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ Nancy!
L417579 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ I don't know.
L417578 +++$+++ u6886 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ What's that?
L417542 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ How do we find him, Kristen?
L417541 +++$+++ u6886 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ Joey needs us.  I can feel him.
L417417 +++$+++ u6886 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ He's heavy in the halls...
L417416 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Freddy?
L417383 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ You never lose a gift like that.  You just forget how to use it.  How about it?  Will you try?
L417382 +++$+++ u6886 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ That was different.
L417381 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ You did it the other night.
L417380 +++$+++ u6886 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ I haven't been able to do that since I was a little girl.
L417329 +++$+++ u6886 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ Yeah, but I was really not good.
L417328 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ We're not always as good at things as we'd like.
L417327 +++$+++ u6886 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ I was on the team at school.  I was never very good, though.
L417326 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ You like gymnastics?
L417297 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Sure.
L417296 +++$+++ u6886 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ Nancy?  Would you sit with me awhile?
L417179 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ He's real.
L417178 +++$+++ u6886 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ That man in my dreams.  He's real isn't he?
L417177 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ It's an amazing gift.
L417176 +++$+++ u6886 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ When I was still a kid.  My folks got divorced.  After a while, I thought I'd imagined the whole thing.  I guess I didn't.
L417175 +++$+++ u6886 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ When I was a little girl.  Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better.  He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?
L417174 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Have you ever done that before?  Pulled someone into your dream?
L417173 +++$+++ u6886 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ But...it's just a house I've dreamed about.  I dream about it all the time.  Thank you for what you did last night.
L417172 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ I used to live in this house.
L417164 +++$+++ u6886 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ I -- I think so!
L417163 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ You pulled me in somehow, didn't you?
L417313 +++$+++ u6893 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ TARYN +++$+++ Fuck off.
L417312 +++$+++ u6887 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ LORENZO +++$+++ Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?
L417311 +++$+++ u6893 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ TARYN +++$+++ Stay out of my face or I'll go straight to Max.
L417310 +++$+++ u6887 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ LORENZO +++$+++ Oh yeah?  Well, if you're ever in the mood for a history lesson, I'm your teacher, understand?
L417309 +++$+++ u6893 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ TARYN +++$+++ Those are ancient history.
L417308 +++$+++ u6887 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ LORENZO +++$+++ What are these, beauty marks?
L417307 +++$+++ u6893 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ TARYN +++$+++ I don't do that shit.
L417306 +++$+++ u6887 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ LORENZO +++$+++ The dispensary.  I'm talking clean pharmaceutical high.  A night at Club meth.
L417305 +++$+++ u6893 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ TARYN +++$+++ What?
L417304 +++$+++ u6887 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ LORENZO +++$+++ So...got the keys to heaven, baby.
L417303 +++$+++ u6893 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ TARYN +++$+++ So?
L417302 +++$+++ u6887 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ LORENZO +++$+++ Pulled night duty.  Trimble's sick.
L417301 +++$+++ u6893 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ TARYN +++$+++ Can't be good news coming from you.
L417300 +++$+++ u6887 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ LORENZO +++$+++ Hi, sweet stuff.  Good news.
L417510 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Thank you.
L417509 +++$+++ u6888 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You got five minutes.
L417508 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ It'll be my last chance.  Pleese?
L417507 +++$+++ u6888 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I don't know...
L417504 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ But Max, she needs me.  It could mean life or death.
L417503 +++$+++ u6888 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Save your breath, Ms. Thompson.  Dr. Simms gave me specific instructions. Nobody gets to see Kristen -- especially you.  She made that real clear.
L417299 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Thanks, Max.
L417298 +++$+++ u6888 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ You need me, I'll be here all night.
L417295 +++$+++ u6888 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Restless.  Very restless.
L417294 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ I just wanted to be here for the kids. how are they?
L417293 +++$+++ u6888 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Puttin' in soem late hours, I see.  If you're trying for O.T., you're in the wrong place.
L417171 +++$+++ u6888 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ She's been waiting outside your office since breakfast.
L417170 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Max, where's Kristen?
L417130 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Why is that?
L417129 +++$+++ u6888 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ This is Phillip.  We call him The Walker.
L417128 +++$+++ u6888 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ I'll have a file cabinet in there before tomorrow.  The patient's rooms are down here.
L417127 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ A little basic, but nice.
L417126 +++$+++ u6888 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ The whole wing's devoted ot this program.  That's your office.
L417075 +++$+++ u6888 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Shit, that's what keeps people alive.
L417074 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ It beats Dr. Simm's theory.  She thinks it's nothing but sex, drugs, and rock & roll.
L417073 +++$+++ u6888 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Fucked up chromosomes, man.  Think about it.  Their parents all dropped acid in the Sixties.
L417072 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Don't hold back on us, Max.  We need all the help we can get.
L417071 +++$+++ u6888 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Say listen, Doc.  I got a new theory about all these suicides.
L417070 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Nothing like a little cheery news to start the day.
L417626 +++$+++ u6894 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ But I couldn't go until I told you how sorry I am for all the things I've done.
L417625 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Crossed over?
L417623 +++$+++ u6894 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ Nancy...
L417622 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ It's over.  It's over.
L417480 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ People are still dying.  After all this time.  Stop running away from it.  Daddy, please...don't make me beg.  You owe me.
L417479 +++$+++ u6894 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ I lost too much over this already.  I'm through with it.
L417478 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ I think we can stop him this time. Stop him for good.  But we need to know where the bones were hidden.
L417475 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ You know what he did.  He's doing it again.
L417474 +++$+++ u6894 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ Fred Krueger's dead.  You always had a little trouble understanding that, Princess.
L417473 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ That's not true.  You're the one who's trying to forget.
L417472 +++$+++ u6894 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ Yeah, but here you are.  How'd I get so lucky?  I thought you were trying to forget I was alive.
L417471 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ It's been a long time.
L417470 +++$+++ u6894 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ THOMPSON +++$+++ Well, if it isn't my little girl... come to visit her Daddy.
L417493 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Just go.  Kristen needs you.  Keep her awake somehow.  Do it.
L417492 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Neil, it's no use.  You saw how he is.
L417487 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ No...
L417486 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Oh Christ.  Simms put Kristen in the Quiet Room for the night.  They sedated her.
L417482 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ I'll be okay.  Just give me a minute.
L417481 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Nancy...
L417464 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ There's only one man...and its time for him to talk.
L417463 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Who would know where they were hidden?
L417462 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ They burned him to death in his boiler room, but they were smart enough to hide the remains.
L417461 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ The question is, what happened to Freddy's body?
L417460 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ All right.  Whoever she is, I'll admit she seems to know more about Krueger than I do.
L417459 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ I've heard crazier things this week.
L417458 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Assuming your mysterious nun in right.
L417457 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Bullshit.  Getting yourself killed won't do the kids any good.  Besides, we do have a choice.
L417456 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Don't you think I know that?  I don't have any choice.
L417455 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ You're not going in.  That's exactly what he wants.  As long as you're on Hypnocyl, it's the only way he can get to you.
L417437 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ There's nothing we can do.  It's out of our hands.
L417436 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ What are we going to do?
L417408 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Anything?
L417407 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Take it slowly.  Remember, this is a dream. Anything is possible.
L417400 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ This isn't possible.  And even if it is...what the hell am I doing here?  Did you drag me in here too?
L417399 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ We made it.  Neil, we made it!
L417391 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Everybody take five.
L417390 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ We can try again.
L417388 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Breathe deeply and relax...starting with your toes, relax everything until there's no tension left in your bodies.  None at all.  Keep following the pendulum...
L417387 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Take us there, Kristen.
L417386 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Okay, we're going to try a little group hypnosis.
L417385 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Remember -- open mind.
L417384 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ You sound like Peter Pan.
L417360 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ I can do that.
L417359 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Only if you're willing to put aside everything you've learned and trust me. Can you do that?
L417358 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Try me.
L417357 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ The truth.
L417356 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ For what?
L417355 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Then maybe you're ready.
L417354 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ I'm running out of answers. A patient sleepwalks out of a security ward up to a tower with no access.  A girl, alone in a room, dies by jumping six feet straight up into a television set. Nothing makes sense anymore.
L417353 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Stop blaming yourself.
L417351 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ C'mon.  Let's get out of this rain.
L417350 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ Doesn't matter.
L417349 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ To who?
L417291 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ We're gonna try.
L417290 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
L417289 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ I can't believe I just did that.
L417244 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ I'm sorry, Nancy.  The answer is no.
L417243 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ Do you?  You told me they're survivors...and they are.  But how much longer they survive is up to us.
L417242 +++$+++ u6890 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NEIL +++$+++ So do I.
L417241 +++$+++ u6889 +++$+++ m461 +++$+++ NANCY +++$+++ I used to be like them, Neil.  I know what they're going through.
