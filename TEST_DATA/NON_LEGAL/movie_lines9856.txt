You don't know.  You never heard of a streak.  You never heard of "marshaling your sales force..." What are you, you're a secretary, John.  Fuck you.  That's my message for you.  Fuck you and kiss my ass. You don't like it, I'll go talk to Jerry Graff.  Period.  Fuck you. Put me on the board.  And I want three worthwhile leads today and I don't want any bullshit about them and I want 'em close together 'cause I'm going to hit them all today.  That's all I have to say to you.
L244501 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ That's right, Shel.
L244500 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ ...and you don't remember. 'Cause you weren't around.  That's cold calling.  Walk up to the door.  I don't even know their name.  I'm selling something they don't even want.  You talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it.
L244499 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ ...yes...
L244498 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Yes.  I did.  This morning.  What I'm saying to you: things can change.  You see?  This is where you fuck up, because this is something you don't know.  You can't look down the road.  And see what's coming.  Might be someone else, John.  It might be someone new, eh?  Someone new.  And you can't look back. 'Cause you don't know history.  You ask them.  When we were at Rio Rancho, who was top man?  A month...?  Two months...? Eight months in twelve for three years in a row.  You know what that means?  You know what that means? Is that luck?  Is that some, some, some purloined leads?  That's skill. That's talent, that's, that's...
L244497 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ You closed 'em today?
L244477 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Bullshit, you're...No.  That's raw... well, if I did, then I'm glad I did.  I, well.  I locked on them.  All on them, nothing on me. All my thoughts are on them.  I'm holding the last thought that I spoke: "Now is the time."  They signed, Ricky.  It was great. It was fucking great.  It was like they wilted all at once.  No gesture...nothing.  Like together. 
L244476 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ Like you taught me...
L244475 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ The only arrangement I'll accept is full investment.  Period.  The whole eight units.  I know that you're saying 'be safe,' I know what you're saying.  I know if I left you to yourselves, you'd say 'come back tomorrow,' and when I walked out that door, you'd make a cup of coffee...you'd sit down...and you'd think 'let's be safe...' and not to disappoint me you'd go one unit or maybe two, because you'd become scared because you'd met possibility.  But this won't do, and that's not the subject..." Listen to this, I actually said this. "That's not the subject of our evening together." Now I handed them the pen.  I held it in my hand. I turned the contract, eight units eighty-two grand. "Now I want you to sign."  I sat there.  Five minutes.  Then, I sat there, Ricky, twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock.  Twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock.  Not a word, not a motion. What am I thinking? "My arm's getting tired?" No.  I did it.  I did it.  Like in the old says, Ricky.  Like I was taught... Like, like, like I used to do...I did it.
L244474 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ Bruce..."I don't want to fuck around with you.  I don't want to go round this, and pussyfoot around the thing, you have to look back on this.  I do, too.  I came here to do good for you and me.  For both of us.  Why take an interim position? 
L244473 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ Harriett...
L244472 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ That's what I'm saying.  The old ways.  The old ways...convert the motherfucker...sell him...sell him... make him sign the check.  The...Bruce, Harriet...the kitchen, blah: they got their money in government bonds...I say fuck it, we're going to go the whole route. I plat it out eight units.  Eighty- two grand.  I tell them. "This is now.  This is that thing that you've been dreaming of, you're going to find that suitcase on the train, the guy comes in the door, the bag that's full of money.  This is it, Harriett..."
L244471 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ "Always be closing..."
L244470 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ "What we have to do is admit to ourself that we see that opportunity...and take it.  And that's it." And we sit there.  I got the pen out...
L244469 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ Fuck her...
L244468 +++$+++ u5524 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LEVENE +++$+++ From the store.

L244430 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ Fuck you care...?

L244219 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ James.  I'm glad to meet you.  I'm glad to meet you, James.  I want to show you something.  It might mean nothing to you...and it might not. 
L244218 +++$+++ u5525 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LINGK +++$+++ Lingk.  James Lingk.
L244217 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ Well, let's have a couple more.  My name is Richard Roma, what's yours?
L244216 +++$+++ u5525 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LINGK +++$+++ Gimlet.
L244215 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ Money?  If that's what it signifies to you. Security?  Comfort?  All it is is THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO YOU.  That's all it is.  How are they different?  Some poor newly married guy gets run down by a cab.  Some busboy wins the lottery.  All it is, it's a carnival.  What's special...what draws us?  We're all different.  We're not the same.  We are not the same.  Hmmm.  It's been a long day.  What are you drinking?
L244213 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ I don't know.  For me, I'm saying, what is is, it's probably not the orgasm.  Some broads, forearms on your neck, something her eyes did. There was a sound she made...or, me, lying, in the, I'll tell you: me lying in bed; the next day she brought me café au lait.  She gives me a cigarette, my balls feel like concrete.  Eh?  What I'm saying, what is our life?  It's looking forward or it's looking back.  And that's our life. That's it.  Where is the moment?  And what is it that we're afraid of? Loss.  What else?  The bank closes.  We get sick, my wife died on a plane, the stock market collapsed...the house burnt down...what of these happen...? None on 'em.  We worry anyway. What does this mean?  I'm not secure.  How can I be secure?  Through amassing wealth beyond all measure?  No.  And what's beyond all measure?  That's a sickness. That's a trap.  There is no measure. Only greed.  How can we act? 
L244212 +++$+++ u5525 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LINGK +++$+++ Mmmm...
L244211 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ Yes.
L244210 +++$+++ u5525 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LINGK +++$+++ What do I...?
L244209 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ Or a piss...?  A great meal fades in reflection.  Everything else gains.  You know why? 'Cause it's only food.  This shit we eat, it keeps us going.  But it's only food. The great fucks that you may have had.  What do you remember about them?
L244208 +++$+++ u5525 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LINGK +++$+++ I don't know.
L244207 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ Yes.
L244206 +++$+++ u5525 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ LINGK +++$+++ Did I...?
L244205 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ ...all train compartments smell vaguely of shit.  It gets so you don't mind it.  That's the worst thing that I can confess.  You know how long it took me to get there? A long time.  When you die you're going to regret the things you don't do.  You think you're queer...? I'm going to tell you something: we're all queer.  You think that you're a thief?  So what?  You get befuddled by a middle-class morality...?  Get shut of it.  Shut it out.  You cheated on your wife...?  You did it, live with it.  You fuck little girls, so be it. There's an absolute morality?  May be.  And then what?  If you think there is, then be that thing.  Bad people go to hell?  I don't think so.  If you think that, act that way.  A hell exists on earth?  Yes. I won't live in it.  That's me. You ever take a dump made you feel you'd just slept for twelve hours...?
L244464 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ And fuck you.  Fuck the lot of you. Fuck you all.
L244463 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ Have a good trip.
L244462 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ I'm not going home.  I'm going to Wisconsin.
L244461 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ Your farewell to the troops?
L244460 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ I'm going home.
L244459 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ What is this, your farewell speech?
L244458 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ Who's my pal...?  And what are you, Ricky, huh, what are you, Bishop Sheean?  Who the fuck are you, Mr. Slick...?  What are you, friend to the workingman?  Big deal.  Fuck you, you got the memory a fuckin' fly.  I never liked you.
L244457 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ I'll show you how to chew it." Your pal closes, all that comes out of your mouth is bile, how fucked up you are...
L244456 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ Oh, and I don't get a moment to spare for a bust-out humanitarian down on his luck lately.  Fuck you, Dave, you know you got a big mouth, and you make a close the whole place stinks with your farts for a week. "How much you just ingested," what a big man you are, "Hey, let me buy you a pack of gum. 
L244455 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ Sittin' on top of the world, sittin' on top of the world, everything's fucking peachfuzz...
L244454 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ Is that what I did?  Dave?  I humiliated you?  My God...I'm sorry...
L244451 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ "Fuck the Machine"? "Fuck the Machine"?  What is this.  Courtesy class...?  You're fucked, Rick--are you fucking nuts?  You're hot, so you think you're the ruler of this place...?!  You want to...
L244450 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ Who said "Fuck the Machine"?
L244449 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ Bring that shit up.  Of my volume. You were on a bad one and I brought it up to you you'd harbor it.  You'd harbor it a long long while. And you'd be right.
L244446 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ You have a mean streak in you, Ricky, you know that...?
L244445 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ It means, Dave, you haven't closed a good one in a month, none of my business, you want to push me to answer you.  And so you haven't got a contract to get stolen or so forth.
L244424 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ They took 'em...
L244423 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ Why not?
L244422 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ We haven't got a lead...
L244410 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ Harriet and blah blah Nyborg.
L244409 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ You just this morning...
L244406 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ When...
L244405 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ Guess who?
L244404 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ Fuck you.
L244402 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ You did that?
L244401 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ Eight units.  Mountain View.
L244400 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ Yeah.  He closed a deal.
L244399 +++$+++ u5527 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ ROMA +++$+++ You hear what I said?
L244398 +++$+++ u5526 +++$+++ m368 +++$+++ MOSS +++$+++ Fuckin' cop's got no right talk to me that way.  I didn't rob the place...
