L388756 +++$+++ u6642 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ PHELPS +++$+++ Abort.  Thatís an order.
L388753 +++$+++ u6642 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ PHELPS +++$+++ No.  Abort.
L388752 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Can you lose him?
L388751 +++$+++ u6642 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ PHELPS +++$+++ Iíve got a shadow.
L388711 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ We were forced to tie him to my best stallion and drag him around the barn a few times.
L388710 +++$+++ u6642 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ PHELPS +++$+++ Jack's pinned down Sarah.  Should be a second.  Keep dancing.
L388680 +++$+++ u6642 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ PHELPS +++$+++ If you were me, Ethan, who would <u>you</u> trust to make him believable?
L388679 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Sure.  If the main character does.
L388678 +++$+++ u6642 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ PHELPS +++$+++ No, not in a hurry.  What do you think? You think the plot'll work?
L388677 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ He won't be back in a hurry?
L388676 +++$+++ u6642 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ PHELPS +++$+++ Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides.
L388675 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing?
L388674 +++$+++ u6642 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ PHELPS +++$+++ He's our guy.
L388673 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ You're going to use Walter?
L388669 +++$+++ u6642 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ PHELPS +++$+++ Wonderful.  Ran into a convention of auto dealers at the Drake Hotel.  You hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to Mars after two years?  His wife's got a year old kid.  So he says "All right.  Who was it?  My friend Harry?"  She says no. "Oh, it was my friend Sammy."  She says it wasn't Sammy.  "Oh, I suppose it was my friend Lou."  "No, what's the matter, don't you think I have any friends of my own?!"
L388668 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ How was Chicago?
L388667 +++$+++ u6642 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ PHELPS +++$+++ Because I can't afford it. And because you'd burn up before you'd burn out.
L388666 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Why not?
L388665 +++$+++ u6642 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ PHELPS +++$+++ Ethan, you <u>can't</u> burn out.
L388664 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I guess.
L388663 +++$+++ u6642 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ PHELPS +++$+++ Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking burnout here?
L388662 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ What problem?
L388661 +++$+++ u6642 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ PHELPS +++$+++ When you started noticing your short term memory loss.  What <u>the problem was</u> you and Claire had in Kiev?
L388660 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Tell you what?
L388659 +++$+++ u6642 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ PHELPS +++$+++ I don't know, I had to go to Chicago again.  You were in Kiev.  You tell me.
L388658 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Oh?  What's the problem?
L388657 +++$+++ u6642 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ PHELPS +++$+++ What the hell's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time? Claire's in a weird mood too.
L388656 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ I thought I'd take some now.
L388655 +++$+++ u6642 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ PHELPS +++$+++ A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. Take it all, if you want.  <u>After</u> this one.
L388654 +++$+++ u6633 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ ETHAN +++$+++ Yeah, well, Jim, fact is I've got more than ninety days leave coming.
L388732 +++$+++ u6635 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ And a lonely ass.
L388731 +++$+++ u6643 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Such a nice ass.
L388653 +++$+++ u6643 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ I think I might just take that look.
L388652 +++$+++ u6635 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Too wicked to have a drink later?
L388651 +++$+++ u6643 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Jack you're so wicked.
L388650 +++$+++ u6635 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ That's what we do isn't it?
L388649 +++$+++ u6643 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Jack...that's spying.
L388648 +++$+++ u6635 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Why don't you take a look?
L388647 +++$+++ u6643 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ I don't know.
L388646 +++$+++ u6635 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ What's going on?
L388645 +++$+++ u6643 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Loud and clear.
L388644 +++$+++ u6635 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ No, in your...ear piece. You have a lovely smile . Can you hear me now?
L388643 +++$+++ u6643 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ SARAH +++$+++ Of course I can hear you.
L388642 +++$+++ u6635 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ JACK +++$+++ Look to your right, then back to me. There's a camera built right into the bridge.  Whatever you see it sees and transmits it back here.  Can you hear me?
L389163 +++$+++ u6641 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Phew!  Weíve got five minutes...
L389162 +++$+++ u6640 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ MATTHIAS +++$+++ Itís working.

L389155 +++$+++ u6640 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ MATTHIAS +++$+++ I always check the batteries.
L389154 +++$+++ u6641 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Is something wrong with the phone?  Well is something wrong with the batteries?
L389153 +++$+++ u6640 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ MATTHIAS +++$+++ Itís not working.
L389152 +++$+++ u6641 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Try it again.
L389151 +++$+++ u6640 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ MATTHIAS +++$+++ Connection denied.
L389150 +++$+++ u6641 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Whatís the problem.
L389129 +++$+++ u6641 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ This wasnít what we discussed.
L389128 +++$+++ u6640 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ MATTHIAS +++$+++ Yes...  Itís him.
L389127 +++$+++ u6640 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ MATTHIAS +++$+++ Twenty minutes.
L389126 +++$+++ u6641 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ How long until we reach the Chunnel?
L388898 +++$+++ u6641 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ Doesn't mean it's a signal.  Could just be the hard drive heating up.
L388897 +++$+++ u6640 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ MATTHIAS +++$+++ Thirty-two and change.
L388896 +++$+++ u6641 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ MAX +++$+++ That's not so good for you, my friend.
L388895 +++$+++ u6640 +++$+++ m443 +++$+++ MATTHIAS +++$+++ Twenty-six, twenty-seven.  So far so good.
L390876 +++$+++ u6648 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ I know, I am so sorry for so many things. I love you, Moira. I love you. I love you.
L390875 +++$+++ u6644 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ AVA +++$+++ Then, I suppose the time has come say it's been nice Dwight Lionel. It's been everything. Oh, Dwight, I'm frightened.
L390874 +++$+++ u6648 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ Just across the bay, at the fuel depot. The men wanted to try to get home. I can't explain.
L390873 +++$+++ u6644 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ AVA +++$+++ The Shawfish?
L390872 +++$+++ u6648 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ GREGORY +++$+++ No, I'm going.

L390776 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ We will both have the Salad Ticino.
L390775 +++$+++ u6645 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ BOBO +++$+++ Very good, Mr. Johnny.
L390774 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?
L390773 +++$+++ u6645 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ BOBO +++$+++ Are you ready?

L391526 +++$+++ u6646 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ COSMO +++$+++ Thank you, Rose.
L391525 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I just want you to know. No matter what you do. You are going to die, just like everybody else.
L391524 +++$+++ u6646 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ COSMO +++$+++ What?
L391523 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Cosmo?
L391516 +++$+++ u6646 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ COSMO +++$+++ I don't know, Rose. I don't know where I've been, and I don't know where I'm going.  You should have your eyes opened for you, my friend.
L391515 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Where you been?
L391167 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Why you drinking so much?

L391165 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Well, what do you wanna talk about!
L391164 +++$+++ u6646 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ COSMO +++$+++ I don't wanna talk about it.
L390967 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ He didn't used to be cheap. He thinks if he holds on to his money, he will never die.
L390966 +++$+++ u6646 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ COSMO +++$+++ I won't pay for nothing.
L390965 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You're rich as Roosevelt. You're just cheap, Cosmo.
L390964 +++$+++ u6646 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ COSMO +++$+++ I have no money!
L390956 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo. Do you love him, Loretta?
L390955 +++$+++ u6646 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ COSMO +++$+++ I don't like him.
L390954 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Again? Johnny Cammareri.
L390953 +++$+++ u6646 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ COSMO +++$+++ Nobody. Loretta is getting married.
L390952 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Who's dead?
L391163 +++$+++ u6657 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ No. You were there.
L391162 +++$+++ u6646 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ COSMO +++$+++ You were altogether asleep. You were dreaming.
L391161 +++$+++ u6657 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ I never seen anybody so in love like Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. I never told you this cause it's not really a story. But one time I woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't think a what it was. I looked out the window, and it was the moon! Big as a house! I never seen the moon so big before or since. I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. And I looked down, and standing there in the street was Cosmo, looking up at the windows. This is the funny part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess and didn't know no better.
L391160 +++$+++ u6646 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ COSMO +++$+++ Rose, pass the wine.
L391156 +++$+++ u6646 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ COSMO +++$+++ I don't wanna talk about it.
L391155 +++$+++ u6657 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Johnny Cammareri. I think it's great and about time. What's she gonna do with the rest of her life she don't get married?
L391154 +++$+++ u6646 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ COSMO +++$+++ I don't wanna talk about it.
L391522 +++$+++ u6646 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ COSMO +++$+++ And that's how much I'm saying.
L391521 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ You haven't said anything.
L391520 +++$+++ u6646 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ COSMO +++$+++ I know you don't. That's the point. I'll say no more.
L391519 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ I don't know what you mean.
L391518 +++$+++ u6646 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ COSMO +++$+++ You do, huh? Stick around. Don't go on any long trips.
L391517 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ I have my eyes open.
L391514 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ Hello, Mr. Castorini.
L391513 +++$+++ u6646 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ COSMO +++$+++ Hi.  Hi.
L391415 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ I don't know whether I saw you or not.
L391414 +++$+++ u6646 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ COSMO +++$+++ Alright. I didn't see you here.
L391413 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ You're my father.
L391412 +++$+++ u6646 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ COSMO +++$+++ You're my daughter. I won't have you acting like a tramp!
L391411 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ You're married.
L391410 +++$+++ u6646 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ COSMO +++$+++ Who is this man? You're engaged!
L391409 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L391408 +++$+++ u6646 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ COSMO +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L391407 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ I got it done.
L391406 +++$+++ u6646 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ COSMO +++$+++ What'd you do to your hair?
L391405 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Mona?
L390950 +++$+++ u6646 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ COSMO +++$+++ Let's go tell your Mother.
L390949 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ So you'll come to the wedding, right?
L390948 +++$+++ u6646 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ COSMO +++$+++ Everything is temporary. That don't excuse nothing.
L390947 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ It's temporary.
L390946 +++$+++ u6646 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ COSMO +++$+++ It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring. It's a man's ring.
L390945 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Here.
L390944 +++$+++ u6646 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ COSMO +++$+++ That don't sound like Johnny. Where's the ring?
L390943 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Yeah.
L390942 +++$+++ u6646 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ COSMO +++$+++ He did?
L390941 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ I didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino.
L390940 +++$+++ u6646 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ COSMO +++$+++ Maybe.
L390939 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ And maybe that's why I had the Bad Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and I got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the City Hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then I wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had.
L390938 +++$+++ u6646 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ COSMO +++$+++ I didn't give you away the first time.
L390937 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ You've got to come. You've got to give me away.
L390936 +++$+++ u6646 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ COSMO +++$+++ I won't come.
L390935 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ In a month.
L390934 +++$+++ u6646 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ COSMO +++$+++ More Bad Luck! I don't like his face, Loretta. I don't like his lips. When he smiles I can't see his teeth. When will you do it?
L390933 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying.
L390932 +++$+++ u6646 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ COSMO +++$+++ Him? He's a big baby. Why isn't he here with you telling me?
L390931 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Johnny Cammareri.
L390930 +++$+++ u6646 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ COSMO +++$+++ No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been married fifty-two years an nobody died. You were married, what, two years, and somebody is dead. Don't get married again, Loretta. It don't work out for you. Who's the man?
L390929 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ He got hit by a bus.
L390928 +++$+++ u6646 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ COSMO +++$+++ What killed him?
L390927 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ The guy died.
L390926 +++$+++ u6646 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ COSMO +++$+++ You did this once it didn't work out.
L390925 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Yeah.
L390924 +++$+++ u6646 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ COSMO +++$+++ Again?
L390923 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ I'm getting married.
L390922 +++$+++ u6646 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ COSMO +++$+++ What's your news?
L390921 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ You look tired.
L390920 +++$+++ u6646 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ COSMO +++$+++ Ti amo.
L390919 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Here.  Ti amo. 
L390917 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ Pop, I got news.
L390916 +++$+++ u6646 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ COSMO +++$+++ I can't sleep anymore. It's too much like death.
L390915 +++$+++ u6649 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ LORETTA +++$+++ You're not sleepy?
L390914 +++$+++ u6646 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ COSMO +++$+++ Bed.

L391388 +++$+++ u6646 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ COSMO +++$+++ I don't know. I got a feeling.
L391387 +++$+++ u6651 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MONA +++$+++ Why you looking around so much?
L391386 +++$+++ u6646 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ COSMO +++$+++ I like your dress.  It's very bright.
L391385 +++$+++ u6651 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MONA +++$+++ You haven't once said you like my dress.
L391076 +++$+++ u6646 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ COSMO +++$+++ They are little stars and birds. Birds fly to the stars, I guess.
L391075 +++$+++ u6651 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MONA +++$+++ Oh, Cosmo!
L391073 +++$+++ u6646 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ COSMO +++$+++ I brought you something.
L391072 +++$+++ u6651 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MONA +++$+++ You have such a head for knowing. You know everything.
L391071 +++$+++ u6646 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ COSMO +++$+++ The man understood me. The woman wanted to be cheap, but the man saw that I was right.
L391070 +++$+++ u6651 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MONA +++$+++ And what did they say?
