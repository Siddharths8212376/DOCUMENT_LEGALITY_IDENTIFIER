L638797 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Somewhere in here I was born... and here I died and it was only a moment for you... you took no notice...
L638796 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ No, thank you.
L638795 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Would you like a drink of water?
L638794 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ No.
L638793 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ No birds live here.
L638792 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ And no birds sing.
L638791 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Only silence. It's always like this.
L638790 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Do you hear anything?
L638787 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Knowing I have to die...
L638786 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Why?
L638785 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I don't like them.
L638784 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Their true name is Sequoia Sempervirens: always green, ever- living.
L638783 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Of all the people who have been born... and have died... while the trees went on living.
L638782 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ What are you thinking?
L638780 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ The oldest living things?
L638779 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Oh... some, two thousand years, or more.
L638778 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ How old?
L638777 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ If I've been there? That's silly! Either you've been to a place or you haven't.
L638776 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ How can you be sure?
L638775 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Of course not! I'm a wanderer!  I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!
L638774 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Do you know where you're going?
L638771 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ No... no, I don't think that's necessarily true.
L638770 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Wander separately? Ah, but only one is a wanderer. Two, together, are always going somewhere.
L638769 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Don't you think it's sort of a waste for the two of us to...
L638768 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Oh, yes, I forgot: It's your occupation, isn't it?
L638767 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Ah.  That's what I was going to do.
L638766 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ No, I Just thought I'd wander.
L638765 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Well... anywhere in particular?
L638764 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ No.
L638763 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Shopping?
L638762 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I don't know.
L638760 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Good-bye.
L638759 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Good-bye.
L638758 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ We have.
L638757 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Meet again, sometime.
L638756 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ What?
L638755 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I hope we will, too.
L638754 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ The first time I've been grateful for Coit Tower.
L638753 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I couldn't mail it; I didn't know your address. But I had a landmark. I remembered Coit Tower and it led me straight to you.
L638752 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ No! No, thank you!
L638751 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Would you like some coffee?
L638749 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I enjoyed talking to you.
L638748 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ -- talking to you...
L638747 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Not at all, I enjoyed --
L638746 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Oh, yes! The whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you!
L638745 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ You've nothing to apologize for.
L638744 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects.  But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it?  What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind...  It's a formal thank-you letter. And a great big apology.
L638743 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?
L638742 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I... suddenly felt such a fool.
L638741 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.
L638740 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Oh! Yes. Hello.
L638726 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ No... this is the first time for me, too.
L638725 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ No, never before. I've fallen into lakes, out of rowboats, when I was a little girl. And I fell into a river, once, trying to leap from one stone to another. But I've never fallen into San Francisco Bay. Have you? Ever before?
L638724 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ ...Falling... into San Francisco Bay?
L638723 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ What?
L638722 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Will you tell me something? Has this ever happened to you before?
L638720 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ No... it's wrong.
L638719 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Some people prefer it.
L638718 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ One shouldn't live alone.
L638717 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ That's a good occupation. And live here... alone?
L638716 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Wander about.
L638715 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I prefer John. There, that's done.  And what do you do, John?
L638714 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ No, I wouldn't like that. And after what happened today I should think you could call me Scottie. Or even John.
L638713 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
L638712 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
L638711 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ That's a good, strong name. Do your friends call you John? Or Jack.
L638710 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ My name is John Ferguson.
L638709 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ No, you are right,  I'm glad you didn't take me home... I wouldn't have known you, to thank you...  Oh, but I don't know you! And you don't know me! My name is Madeleine Elster.
L638708 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Yes, I knew which one it was. It's out there, now. But I didn't think you'd want to be brought home that way.
L638707 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ You could have looked in my car. Oh, but you didn't know my car, did you?
L638706 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I... didn't know where you lived.
L638705 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ You shouldn't have brought me here, you know.
L638703 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Oh! Yes! Here!
L638702 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ When you...  There were pins in my hair...
L638701 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ No.
L638700 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Lucky for me you were wandering about. Thank you again. I've been terrible bother to you.
L638699 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Oh, that's a lovely spot, isn't it? I've never been inside. But it looks so lovely, driving past.
L638698 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ The Palace of the Legion of honor. The Art Gallery.
L638696 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ You like it, too.
L638695 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Wandering about.
L638694 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?
L638693 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
L638692 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
L638691 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Please drink your coffee.
L638689 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Before?  Where?  Where had you been?
L638688 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Oh... wandering about.
L638687 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ This afternoon.
L638686 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ When?
L638685 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Where had you been before?
L638684 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.
L638683 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Why?
L638682 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ ...Old Port Point!  Out at the Presidio! Of course I remember! I often go there!
L638681 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ At...
L638680 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Where were you?
L638679 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
L638678 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Do you remember where you were?
L638677 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ No...
L638676 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ You don't remember.
L638668 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ You...  ...fell into the Bay.
L638667 +++$+++ u8762 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MADELEINE +++$+++ Why am I here? What happened?
L638585 +++$+++ u8763 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MANAGERESS +++$+++ What car?
L638584 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Her car is gone.
L638582 +++$+++ u8763 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MANAGERESS +++$+++ In her room? Well, yes, of course if you ask. But it does seem silly...
L638581 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Would you please go and look?
L638580 +++$+++ u8763 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MANAGERESS +++$+++ And there! There you see? Her key is on the rack!
L638579 +++$+++ u8763 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MANAGERESS +++$+++ Oh, no! She hasn't been here at all! I would have seen her, you know. I've been right here all the time, putting olive oil on my rubber plant leaves!
L638578 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
L638577 +++$+++ u8763 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MANAGERESS +++$+++ Oh, but she hasn't been here today. Scottie whirls back on her.
L638576 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ When she comes down, don't say that I've been here.
L638575 +++$+++ u8763 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MANAGERESS +++$+++ No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered --
L638574 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Does she sleep here? Ever?
L638573 +++$+++ u8763 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MANAGERESS +++$+++ Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow.
L638572 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ How long has she had the room?
L638571 +++$+++ u8763 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MANAGERESS +++$+++ Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it?  Foreign. But sweet.
L638570 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Carlotta Valdes?
L638569 +++$+++ u8763 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MANAGERESS +++$+++ Valdes. Miss Valdes.  It's Spanish, you know.
L638568 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ What is her name?
L638567 +++$+++ u8763 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MANAGERESS +++$+++ I can't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face --
L638566 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Please answer my question.
L638565 +++$+++ u8763 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MANAGERESS +++$+++ Oh, dear! Has she done something wrong?
L638564 +++$+++ u8763 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MANAGERESS +++$+++ Oh, I'm afraid we couldn't give out information of that sort. Our clients are entitled to their privacy, you know. And I do believe it's against the law! Of course, I don't think any of them would mind, really, but still I would have to know who you are, and ask --
L638563 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Would you tell me, who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?
L638562 +++$+++ u8763 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MANAGERESS +++$+++ Oh, yes!
L638561 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Yes... you run this hotel.
L638560 +++$+++ u8763 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MANAGERESS +++$+++ Is there something I can do for you?
L638894 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Oh?
L638893 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ As a matter of fact, I thought I might give it to you.
L638892 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ No, not exactly. Want to see?
L638891 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ What is it, a still life?
L638890 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
L638889 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.
L638888 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Oh, I'm having a wonderful time! I've gone back to my first love... painting.
L638886 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Wandering.
L638885 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ What have you been doing?
L638884 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Naturally.
L638883 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ If you want to. Naturally, we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.
L638882 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ What I've been doing?
L638881 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Oh... this and that.
L638880 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?
L638879 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ I just thought if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner, you'd be so grateful you'd take me to a movie.
L638878 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Well, I detected an undercurrent.
L638877 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ All I said in the note was: "Where are you?" That doesn't sound desperate to me.
L638876 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ What was this desperate urge to see me?
L638875 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Oh?
L638874 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Yeah.
L638873 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Did you need it?
L638872 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Mm. Better.
L638871 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Oh?
L638870 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Around.
L638869 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Where?
L638868 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Just wander.
L638867 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Since I stopped being able to get them on the phone. For a man who has nothing to do, you're certainly a busy little bee. Where do you go, these days?
L638866 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I did. Since when do you go about slipping notes under men's doors?
L638639 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Bye-bye!
L638638 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Midge!
L638636 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Mmm, yeah, I guess...
L638635 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ No, not Carlotta. Elster's wife.
L638634 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Carlotta?
L638633 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Is she pretty?
L638632 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Think?  Well, what do you think?
L638631 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I'm not telling you what I think! I'm telling you what he thinks!
L638630 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ And the idea is that the Beautiful Mad Carlotta has come back from the dead, to take possession of Elster's wife?  Ah, Johnny! Come on!
L638629 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Out!
L638628 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ I know. The one who phoned. Your old college chum, Elster.
L638627 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Out. I've got things to do.
L638626 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Who's the guy, who's the wife?
L638625 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I've told you enough.
L638624 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ You haven't told me everything.
L638623 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Here you are.
L638621 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ I'll take you home.
L638620 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ You'll tell, or you'll be back in that corset! Come on!
L638619 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Nothing to tell.
L638618 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ For bringing you here. Come on, tell!
L638617 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ For what?
L638616 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Now then, Johnny-O; pay me.
L638610 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ And she died...
L638609 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ The poor thing....
L638600 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ All right, come on. Introduce me. Where is your hat?
L638599 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Pop Leibel? Sure.
L638598 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Do you know him well?
L638597 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Wait a minute! You're not a detective any more. What's going on?
L638596 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Who shot who in the Embarcadero in August, 1879.
L638595 +++$+++ u8764 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ MIDGE +++$+++ Pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop. What do you want to know?
L638594 +++$+++ u8767 +++$+++ m594 +++$+++ SCOTTIE +++$+++ Who?
