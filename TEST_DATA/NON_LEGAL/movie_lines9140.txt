L284954 +++$+++ u1366 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ LOUIE +++$+++ All right, Judge.
L284953 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Nobody's going to rush me into anything!  You keep away from me! 
L284600 +++$+++ u1366 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ LOUIE +++$+++ Was I? The driver got knocked cold.
L284599 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ -- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?
L284598 +++$+++ u1366 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ LOUIE +++$+++ Search me! When I come to I was running down Thirty-fifth Street.
L284597 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ What did you do with her?
L284596 +++$+++ u1366 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ LOUIE +++$+++ I'm telling you. Can you imagine bumping into a load of cops?! They come rollin' out like oranges!
L284593 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Oh-h-h... was she hurt?
L284592 +++$+++ u1366 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ LOUIE +++$+++ We run smack into a police patrol. You know what I mean? We broke it in half!
L284591 +++$+++ u1366 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ LOUIE +++$+++ I'm telling you!
L284590 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Where's the old lady?
L284417 +++$+++ u1366 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ LOUIE +++$+++ My name is Louis Peluso.
L284416 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Wait a minute, Walter. You can't do that!
L283379 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Editorials?
L283378 +++$+++ u1366 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ LOUIE +++$+++ Oh, I ain't doing that any more. I'm retired. I'm one of you fellas now -- a newspaper man.
L284059 +++$+++ u1376 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ I'll go right after it.
L284058 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ There goes another scrub lady.
L283920 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Give me that!
L283919 +++$+++ u1376 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
L283918 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Who is it?
L283917 +++$+++ u1376 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ WILSON +++$+++ Phone for you, Hildy.
L283916 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Gentlemen of the Press! Always picking on somebody who can't defend himself -- the littler the better.
L284340 +++$+++ u1374 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ Yeah. I was never so tired in my life.
L284339 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Any news?
L283992 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ I'll take it.  What's the matter, Mr. Burns -- don't you understand English? -- Why, your language is shocking, Mr. Burns -- positively shocking! I don't mind because I was married to you and know what to expect, but suppose Central is listening in... Oh, did you hear that, Central? We ought to report him, don't you think?... Oh, fooey on you!
L283991 +++$+++ u1374 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ Hello, Mr. Burns. Yes, she's still here.
L283985 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ This is Hildy Johnson...  Oh, I can give it up all right. Without a single quiver. I'm going to live like a human being -- not like you rats.  Oh, is that you, Walter dear? Oh, I didn't mean "dear." That was just habit, I guess. Oh, be yourself, Walter. I've got some news for you... Yes, I got the interview, but I've got some news that's more important.
L283984 +++$+++ u1374 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ Well, Hildy, we were only saying that a swell reporter like you wouldn't give this up so easily.
L283983 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ It's getting so a girl can't step out of the room without being discussed by a bunch of old ladies.  Hello, Post... Mr. Walter Burns, please.
L283796 +++$+++ u1374 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ SCHWARTZ +++$+++ What's the matter? Getting yellow?
L283795 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Well, anyhow, I won't be covering stuff like this any more.
L284692 +++$+++ u1369 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MCCUE +++$+++ What's the use of fighting, Hildy?
L284691 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Look out, you --
L284352 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ What's the matter with you boys? Afraid it might rain? If you want to go, I'll cover this end.
L284351 +++$+++ u1369 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MCCUE +++$+++ Okay.  Forget it. 
L284095 +++$+++ u1369 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MCCUE +++$+++ Okay, Hildy.  Well, we can't get any official statement --
L284094 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ If Walter Burns calls, hold the wire for me, will you? I'll be right back. 
L284092 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ No -- what?
L284091 +++$+++ u1369 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MCCUE +++$+++ Did you get that, Hildy?
L284089 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ I thought so, too.
L284088 +++$+++ u1369 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MCCUE +++$+++ Hello, Hildy. I thought you were gone.
L283803 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ I made it up just now, and who's asking you?  I know it's silly, honey, but do it for me, won't you?... Yes, right now.
L283802 +++$+++ u1369 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MCCUE +++$+++ Say, I've been a reporter twenty years and never heard any hooey like that. Where'd you get it?
L283801 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see --  -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years.
L283800 +++$+++ u1369 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MCCUE +++$+++ Certified, eh? Who is it -- your milkman?
L283793 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Nothing doing. I'm playing for keeps.
L283792 +++$+++ u1369 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MCCUE +++$+++ Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
L283791 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ I don't know why you boys are so good to me.
L283727 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ And up a dime.
L283726 +++$+++ u1369 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MCCUE +++$+++ You fight it cut.
L284251 +++$+++ u1367 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ What -- already? Why, the dame left only a minute before I did!
L284250 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again -- do you?
L284249 +++$+++ u1367 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was.
L284248 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ You know it is!
L284247 +++$+++ u1367 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Now don't get excited, Hildy! I don't know what you're talking about -- but is this Mr. Baldwin's wallet?
L284246 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ None of that innocent stuff, you double-crossing hyena! You stuck Bruce Baldwin in jail this afternoon on a phony charge that he swiped your watch, and you frisked his wallet! Now, give me that wallet or I'll stick you in jail and it won't be on any phony charge either! It'll be for life!
L284245 +++$+++ u1367 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Huh?
L284244 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ So long, nothing! Where's Bruce Baldwin's wallet?
L284243 +++$+++ u1367 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Thanks. So long, Hildy!
L284242 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Here!
L284241 +++$+++ u1367 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Keep your shirt on. I got it -- right here.  One hundred -- two hundred -- three hundred -- four hundred -- and fifty. Now sign.
L284240 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Where's the money?
L284239 +++$+++ u1367 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ First you got to sign a receipt. 
L284238 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Come on with that money!
L284237 +++$+++ u1367 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ All right, all right. You can't blame a guy for tryin', can you?
L284236 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut your throat if you try any tricks!
L284235 +++$+++ u1367 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ LOUIS +++$+++ Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?
L284234 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Have you got my dough?
L284757 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Mother!
L284756 +++$+++ u1372 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Hiding him where?
L284334 +++$+++ u1372 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Some Hallowe'en goin' on outside. The whole police force standing on it's ear.
L284333 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Well -- I was going, but Mollie fainted away and I thought I ought to do what I could.
L284332 +++$+++ u1372 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Hildy, I thought you were gone --
L284061 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ From all I can get the Sheriff let him out so's he could vote for him.
L284060 +++$+++ u1372 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Any dope yet on how he got out?
L283763 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ 'Kings and sixes The pot affixes'... Poetry. I learned that at my grandma's knee.
L283762 +++$+++ u1372 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ That's good.
L283761 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Kings and sixes.
L284735 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Mother! Oh, I'm so glad to see you! Are you all right? Tell me.
L284734 +++$+++ u1371 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MRS. BALDWIN +++$+++ That man there!
L284733 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Mother!
L284371 +++$+++ u1371 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MRS. BALDWIN +++$+++ I'm quoting my son, and he has never lied to me.
L284370 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ I don't know what she's talking about. I never said any such thing.
L284365 +++$+++ u1371 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MRS. BALDWIN +++$+++ You don't have to go with me at all! Just give me my son's money and you can stay here forever as far as I'm concerned. Stay with that murderer you caught!
L284364 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Mother, I can explain everything. I'll go with you in five minutes and --
L284363 +++$+++ u1371 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MRS. BALDWIN +++$+++ Don't you mother me! Playing cat-and- mouse with my poor boy! Keeping him looked up -- making us miss two trains -- and supposed to be married tomorrow!
L284362 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Mother!
L284308 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ We'll get you out in ten minutes.
L284307 +++$+++ u1375 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ WILLIAMS +++$+++ What good'll it do?
L284299 +++$+++ u1375 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ WILLIAMS +++$+++ Let 'em take me. It's better that way.
L284298 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Stop screaming, Mollie or we're sunk. I'm trying to think of something before those reporters get back.
L284294 +++$+++ u1375 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ WILLIAMS +++$+++ Down the drainpipe. I didn't mean to shoot him. You believe me, don't you, Mollie?
L284293 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ How'd you get here, Earl?
L284292 +++$+++ u1375 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ WILLIAMS +++$+++ Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about.
L284291 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Quiet, Mollie, quiet!
L284274 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Sure I do, Earl.
L284273 +++$+++ u1375 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ WILLIAMS +++$+++ Wakin' me up in the middle of the night -- talkin' to me about things they don't understand. Callin' me a Bolshevik. I'm an anarchist. It's got nothin' to do with bombs. It's the philosophy that guarantees every man freedom. You see that, don't you?
L284272 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Don't talk too loud.
L284270 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Well, maybe you think I could!
L284269 +++$+++ u1375 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ WILLIAMS +++$+++ Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.
L284268 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Earl, you must never do that again.
L284266 +++$+++ u1375 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ WILLIAMS +++$+++ Keep away!
L284265 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ I don't blame you, Earl.  If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either.
L284264 +++$+++ u1375 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ WILLIAMS +++$+++ What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
L284263 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.
L284262 +++$+++ u1375 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ WILLIAMS +++$+++ No, no, you're right. I don't want to kill anybody. All I want to do is be let alone.
L284261 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody.
L284260 +++$+++ u1375 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ WILLIAMS +++$+++ Maybe you're my friend and maybe you're not -- but don't come any nearer. You can't trust anybody in this crazy world. Say, I'll bet I could shoot you from here.
L284259 +++$+++ u1375 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ WILLIAMS +++$+++ Don't move!
L284258 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Earl, you don't want to hurt your friends, do you?
L284257 +++$+++ u1375 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ WILLIAMS +++$+++ Yes -- that's right. Production for use.
L284256 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ You're not going to shoot me, Earl. I'm your friend, remember? I've got to write that story about your "Production for Use".
L284255 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Put down that gun, Earl.
L284254 +++$+++ u1375 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ WILLIAMS +++$+++ You're not going to phone anybody where I am.
L283867 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ I won't, Earl. 
L283866 +++$+++ u1375 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ WILLIAMS +++$+++ Don't forget about production for use.
L283849 +++$+++ u1375 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ WILLIAMS +++$+++ Yes. Isn't she beautiful?
L283848 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Isn't that her picture?
L283847 +++$+++ u1375 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ WILLIAMS +++$+++ Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person.
L283846 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ No, Earl, not at all.  Who sent you the flowers, Earl?
L283845 +++$+++ u1375 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ WILLIAMS +++$+++ There's nothing crazy about that, is there?
L283844 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Very simple, Earl.
L283843 +++$+++ u1375 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ WILLIAMS +++$+++ Sure. You see, I'd never had a gun in my hand before and I didn't know what to do with it. Well, when I get stuck, I know that there's an answer for everything in production for use. So it came to me in a flash: what's a gun for? To shoot! So I shot. Simple isn't it?
L283842 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
L283841 +++$+++ u1375 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ WILLIAMS +++$+++ A gun?  Why -- to shoot, of course.
L283838 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl.
L283837 +++$+++ u1375 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ WILLIAMS +++$+++ It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense?
L283836 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ "Production for use only." Well, maybe that's the answer.
L283835 +++$+++ u1375 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ WILLIAMS +++$+++ I'd do away with the profit system and have production for use only. There's enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if we'd use some sense.
L283834 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ How would you go about applying the Golden Rule, Earl?
L283833 +++$+++ u1375 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ WILLIAMS +++$+++ They're very simple. I believe in the Golden Rule. I'm not the first man to die for preaching it. But if they would only listen to it -- we could have a fine, decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things.
L283832 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ What are your beliefs, Earl?
L283831 +++$+++ u1375 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ WILLIAMS +++$+++ Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody -- it's against everything I've ever stood for. They know it was an accident. They're not hanging me for that -- they're hanging me for my beliefs.
L283830 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ You didn't mean to kill that policeman?
L283829 +++$+++ u1375 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ WILLIAMS +++$+++ I couldn't plead insanity, because you see I'm just as sane as anybody else.
L284344 +++$+++ u1370 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MOLLIE +++$+++ Yeah, I'm feelin' fine.
L284343 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Are you all right, now?
L284320 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Shut up, you!
L284319 +++$+++ u1370 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MOLLIE +++$+++ Hey --
L284318 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Never mind! Just play dead.
L284317 +++$+++ u1370 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MOLLIE +++$+++ What's the idea?
L284314 +++$+++ u1370 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MOLLIE +++$+++ I'll be right here. I won't leave you.
L284313 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ I'm coming!  Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe.
L284302 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Ssh!
L284301 +++$+++ u1370 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MOLLIE +++$+++ They'll get him! They'll get him!
L284289 +++$+++ u1370 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MOLLIE +++$+++ There's somethin' funny going on around here.
L284288 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Quiet, Mollie!
L284287 +++$+++ u1370 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MOLLIE +++$+++ What's that?
L284286 +++$+++ u1370 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MOLLIE +++$+++ What do you mean?
L284285 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Mollie, they haven't got him. You gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to do something!
L284284 +++$+++ u1370 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MOLLIE +++$+++ They got him surrounded some place -- gonna shoot him like a dog!
L284283 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Wait a minute, Mollie.
L284282 +++$+++ u1370 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MOLLIE +++$+++ Where are they gone? You know where they are?
L283909 +++$+++ u1370 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MOLLIE +++$+++ It wasn't the Lord! It was the devil!
L283908 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ They're newspaper men, Mollie. They can't help themselves. The Lord made them that way.
L283907 +++$+++ u1370 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MOLLIE +++$+++ They're not human!
L283906 +++$+++ u1364 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ HILDY +++$+++ Come on, Mollie. This is no place for you. 
L284879 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ I understand perfectly, Mr. Pinkus, and as long as I am Mayor --
L284878 +++$+++ u1373 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ PINKUS +++$+++ She's good enough for me! And if I was to go home and tell my wife --
L284877 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ A very fine-looking women.
L284876 +++$+++ u1373 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ PINKUS +++$+++ Here's the picture of my wife.
L284844 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ You're insane!
L284843 +++$+++ u1373 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ PINKUS +++$+++ They wouldn't take it.
L284834 +++$+++ u1373 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ PINKUS +++$+++ You can't bribe me!
L284833 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ Get out of here!
L284218 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ No! It's easy -- it's very easy!
L284217 +++$+++ u1373 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ PINKUS +++$+++ Is it hard?
L284216 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ I'll explain it tomorrow!
L284215 +++$+++ u1373 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ PINKUS +++$+++ You forgot to tell me what a City Sealer has to do.
L284213 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ All right, Mr. Pinkus, all you've got to do is lay low and keep your mouth shut. Here!  Go to this address. It's a nice, homey little place, and they'll take care of you for the night. Just tell 'em Fred sent you. And here's fifty dollars on account.
L284212 +++$+++ u1373 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ PINKUS +++$+++ Pinkus.
L284211 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ Come in and see me in my office tomorrow. What's your name?
L284210 +++$+++ u1373 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ PINKUS +++$+++ But how do I know...?
L284209 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ No, it doesn't.  Now, remember: you never delivered this.  You got caught in the traffic, or something.  Now, get out of here and don't let anybody see you.
L284208 +++$+++ u1373 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ PINKUS +++$+++ This puts me in a peculiar hole.
L284205 +++$+++ u1373 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ PINKUS +++$+++ Yeah?
L284204 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ No, they wouldn't -- they'd gain one! And I guarantee that they'll graduate with highest honors!
L284203 +++$+++ u1373 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ PINKUS +++$+++ I got two kids going to school there, and if I changed them from one town to another, they'd lose a grade.
L284202 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ For heaven's sake, why not?
L284201 +++$+++ u1373 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ PINKUS +++$+++ No, I don't think so.
L284200 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ But you could bring 'em in here! We'll pay all your expenses.
L284199 +++$+++ u1373 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ PINKUS +++$+++ I couldn't work in the city. You see, I've got my family in the country.
L284198 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ Why not?
L284195 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ Yes, yes!
L284194 +++$+++ u1373 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ PINKUS +++$+++ You mean here in the city?
L284193 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ The City Sealer's office!
L284192 +++$+++ u1373 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ PINKUS +++$+++ The what?
L284191 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ Now, listen. There's a fine opening for a fellow like you in the City Sealer's office.
L284190 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ Who do you think!
L284189 +++$+++ u1373 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ PINKUS +++$+++ Who? Me?
L284186 +++$+++ u1373 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ PINKUS +++$+++ Forty dollars.
L284185 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ How much do you make a week? What's your salary?
L284184 +++$+++ u1373 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ PINKUS +++$+++ Huh?
L284183 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ How much do you make a week?
L284182 +++$+++ u1373 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ PINKUS +++$+++ Yes, I did, just now. Don't you remember?
L284181 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ Now, listen! You never arrived here with this -- reprieve. Get it?
L284165 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ Fishing! Duckshooting! How do you like that. A guy does nothing more strenuous for forty years than play pinochle -- he gets elected Governor and right away he thinks he's Tarzan!
L284164 +++$+++ u1373 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ PINKUS +++$+++ You can't get him on the phone. He's out duckshooting now.
L284163 +++$+++ u1368 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ MAYOR +++$+++ Get the Governor on the phone!
L284162 +++$+++ u1373 +++$+++ m90 +++$+++ PINKUS +++$+++ They were all standing around when he wrote it. It was after they got back from fishing.
