L391503 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ Yes.
L391502 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ That's incredible.
L391501 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ The breath had almost totally left her body. She was as white as snow. And then she completely pulled back from death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook for everyone in the house. The mourners. And me. And herself! She ate a meal that would choke a pig!
L391500 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You're kidding?
L391499 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ My mother's recovered.
L391498 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ A miracle. Well, that's news.
L391497 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ That's what I came to tell Loretta. There's been a miracle.
L391496 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Palermo.
L391495 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ Maybe I should go?
L391494 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yes.
L391493 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ It's late.
L391492 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
L391491 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ Where is she?
L391490 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ So.
L391488 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ She's not home yet. Take off your coat and come in the living room. I'll make you a drink. I wanna talk to you.
L391487 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ Can you wake up Loretta? I need to talk to her.
L391486 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Come on in.
L391485 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ I came right from the airport.
L391484 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Moving in?
L391635 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ And you are a son who doesn't love his mother!
L391634 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ You're forty-two years old, Johnny, and Mama is still running your life.
L391633 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ Because my mother was dying! But now she's not.
L391623 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ It was a miracle!
L391622 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ I'm sure she did.
L391617 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ Of course I want to.
L391616 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ Well. Yeah. You may not want to.
L391615 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ Have you come to make peace with me?
L391614 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ Good.
L391613 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ Ronny! Our mother has recovered from death!
L391612 +++$+++ u6659 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RONNY +++$+++ Johnny...
L391611 +++$+++ u6652 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ MR. JOHNNY +++$+++ Loretta...
L391357 +++$+++ u6662 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ SHY WAITER +++$+++ It's nothing!
L391356 +++$+++ u6654 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ Thanks, comrade.
L391351 +++$+++ u6662 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ SHY WAITER +++$+++ Absolutely!
L391350 +++$+++ u6654 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ Don't mind about me. But could you do me a favor and clear her place and take away all evidence of her, and bring me a big glass of vodka?
L390852 +++$+++ u6662 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ SHY WAITER +++$+++ She didn't hear me. She asked me to repeat, so she could understand what I said. But I wouldn't repeat it. Outta shyness. So I'm a bachelor.
L390851 +++$+++ u6654 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ What happened?
L390850 +++$+++ u6662 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ SHY WAITER +++$+++ When I was twenty-seven years old, in Jersey City, I asked a woman to marry me. She had red hair. She smelled a jasmine. She wore black shoes with pointy white tips.
L390807 +++$+++ u6662 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ SHY WAITER +++$+++ I am alone in the world.
L390806 +++$+++ u6654 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ Do you have a girlfriend?
L390805 +++$+++ u6662 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ SHY WAITER +++$+++ Sure!
L390804 +++$+++ u6654 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ May I presume to ask you a question?
L390803 +++$+++ u6662 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ SHY WAITER +++$+++ Definitely!
L390802 +++$+++ u6654 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ Can I get another one of these?
L390794 +++$+++ u6662 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ SHY WAITER +++$+++ But absolutely!
L390793 +++$+++ u6654 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ Could you do away with her dinner, and any evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka?
L390792 +++$+++ u6662 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ SHY WAITER +++$+++ Yes?
L391441 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Good night.
L391440 +++$+++ u6654 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ I'm freezing
L391439 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Sure.
L391438 +++$+++ u6654 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ Good night. Can I kiss you on the cheek, too?
L391437 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Good night.
L391436 +++$+++ u6654 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ I'm too old for me. That's my predicament.
L391435 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I'm too old for you.
L391434 +++$+++ u6654 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.
L391433 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You're a little boy and you like to be bad.
L391432 +++$+++ u6654 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ I'm a little cold.
L391431 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking.
L391430 +++$+++ u6654 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ People home.
L391429 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ No.
L391428 +++$+++ u6654 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ I guess you can't invite me in?
L391427 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yes.
L391426 +++$+++ u6654 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ Temperature's dropping.
L391393 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yes.
L391392 +++$+++ u6654 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ You knew that man?
L391391 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Sure.
L391390 +++$+++ u6654 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ May I walk with you a ways?
L391381 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ What you don't know about women is a lot.
L391380 +++$+++ u6654 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ I teach these classes I've taught for a million years. The spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago. I started off, I was excited about something and I wanted to share it. Now it's rote, it's the multiplication table. Except sometimes. Sometimes I'm droning along and I look up, and there's this fresh young beautiful face, and it's all new to her and I'm this great guy who's just brilliant and thinks out loud. And when that happens, when I look out among those chairs and look at a young woman's face, and see me there in her eyes, me the way I always wanted to be and maybe once was, then I ask her out on a date. It doesn't last. It can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months, but then she catches on that I'm just a burnt out old gasbag and that she's as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini. And at that moment, she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face, or some action to that effect.
L391379 +++$+++ u6654 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ Maybe. Listen. You wanna know why I chase women? I find women charming.
L391378 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I think it's because they fear death.
L391377 +++$+++ u6654 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ Nerves.
L391376 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Why do men chase women?
L391375 +++$+++ u6654 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ Go ahead.
L391374 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you a question?
L391373 +++$+++ u6654 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ Then why are you eating alone?
L391372 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I'm a housewife.
L391371 +++$+++ u6654 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ I'll remember that. What do you do?
L391370 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Don't shit where you eat.
L391369 +++$+++ u6654 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ Yes.
L391368 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ There's old saying my mother told me. Would you like to hear it?
L391367 +++$+++ u6654 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.
L391366 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ That woman was a student of yours?
L391365 +++$+++ u6654 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ I'm a professor. I teach communications at N.Y.U.
L391364 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ What do you do?
L391363 +++$+++ u6654 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ Then I'd be delighted. I hate eating alone, and it's amazing how often I end up doing just that.
L391362 +++$+++ u6654 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ Are you sure?
L391361 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Will you join me for dinner?
L391360 +++$+++ u6654 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ Sorry. That was rude.
L391359 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ None of your business.
L391358 +++$+++ u6654 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ Ouch. Too young! I just got that. You know how to hurt guy. How old are you?
L391355 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ She was just too young for you.
L391354 +++$+++ u6654 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ My lady friend has a personality disorder.
L391353 +++$+++ u6660 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I'm not disturbed. By you.
L391352 +++$+++ u6654 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ PERRY +++$+++ I'm sorry if we disturbed you.
L391425 +++$+++ u6655 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ PERRY'S VOICE +++$+++ Well. That explains it.
L391424 +++$+++ u6661 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE'S VOICE +++$+++ He's a plumber.
L391423 +++$+++ u6655 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ PERRY'S VOICE +++$+++ I live in a one-bedroom apartment. What exactly does your husband do?
L391422 +++$+++ u6661 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE'S VOICE +++$+++ It's a house.
L391421 +++$+++ u6655 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ PERRY'S VOICE +++$+++ My God, it's a mansion!
L391420 +++$+++ u6661 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE'S VOICE +++$+++ Yes.
L391419 +++$+++ u6655 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ PERRY'S VOICE +++$+++ You mean the whole house?
L391418 +++$+++ u6661 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ ROSE'S VOICE +++$+++ That's my house.
L391597 +++$+++ u6657 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ WE NEVER SUSPECTED YOU!
L391596 +++$+++ u6658 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ We didn't know what to think. You were so weird yesterday, and then this morning, we go to the bank and no bag.
L391595 +++$+++ u6657 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ I knew she had it.
L391594 +++$+++ u6658 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ She's got it.
L391285 +++$+++ u6657 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Oh. Right.
L391284 +++$+++ u6658 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ What are you talking about, you fool? Her fiancé's in Palermo.
L391277 +++$+++ u6657 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ You see that moon last night?
L391276 +++$+++ u6658 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ You got me.
L391272 +++$+++ u6657 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ I don't know! That moon! That crazy moon Cosmo sent over!
L391271 +++$+++ u6658 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ Raymond, Raymond, lower your voice! What's got into you?
L391270 +++$+++ u6657 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ So what? The pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman and then you don't worry about nothing. Hey, how about a date tonight, Rita. Let's eat pasta and roll around.
L391269 +++$+++ u6658 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ Shut up. They'll hear you in the back.
L391268 +++$+++ u6657 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
L391267 +++$+++ u6658 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ You were a tiger last night.
L391266 +++$+++ u6657 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ I feel great I got no sleep but I feel like Orlando Furioso!
L391191 +++$+++ u6658 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ You know, in this light, and with that expression on your face, you look about twenty-five years old.
L391190 +++$+++ u6657 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ I don't know.
L391189 +++$+++ u6658 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ What would he be doing down there?
L391188 +++$+++ u6657 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Cosmo.
L391187 +++$+++ u6658 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ Is who down there?
L391186 +++$+++ u6657 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner.  Is he down there? No.
L391185 +++$+++ u6658 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ What are you talking about, Raymond? Cosmo can't own the moon.
L391184 +++$+++ u6657 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ It's Cosmo's moon.
L391183 +++$+++ u6658 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ Oh.
L391182 +++$+++ u6657 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Look.
L391181 +++$+++ u6658 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ What? What?
L391180 +++$+++ u6657 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Rita. Rita.
L391159 +++$+++ u6658 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RITA +++$+++ Marriage is happy news.
L391158 +++$+++ u6657 +++$+++ m444 +++$+++ RAYMOND +++$+++ Cosmo. Many years ago, when they told me you were marrying my sister, I was happy. When I told Rose I was marrying Rita, she was happy.
L392086 +++$+++ u6663 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ ALL +++$+++ Bread?  No, no, no.  Apples .... gravy ... very small rocks ...
L392085 +++$+++ u6665 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ BEDEVERE +++$+++ Wait.  Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?
L392084 +++$+++ u6663 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ ALL +++$+++ No, no,  It floats.   Throw her in the pond Tie weights on her.  To the pond.
L392083 +++$+++ u6665 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ BEDEVERE +++$+++ Does wood sink in water?
L392082 +++$+++ u6663 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ ALL +++$+++ Ah.  Yes, of course ... um ... err ...
L392079 +++$+++ u6665 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ BEDEVERE +++$+++ So how can we tell if she is made of wood?
L392078 +++$+++ u6663 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ ALL +++$+++ I see.  Yes, of course.
L392073 +++$+++ u6665 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ BEDEVERE +++$+++ And what do you burn, apart from witches?
L392072 +++$+++ u6663 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ ALL +++$+++ Burn them.
L392071 +++$+++ u6665 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ BEDEVERE +++$+++ Tell me ...  what do you do with witches?
L392070 +++$+++ u6663 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ ALL +++$+++ There are?  Tell up.  What are they, wise Sir Bedevere?
L392069 +++$+++ u6665 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ BEDEVERE +++$+++ Quiet! Quiet!  There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.
L392068 +++$+++ u6663 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ ALL +++$+++ Burn her anyway.
L392062 +++$+++ u6665 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ BEDEVERE +++$+++ Did you dress her up like this?
L392061 +++$+++ u6663 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ ALL +++$+++ A witch,  a witch,  burn her!
L392051 +++$+++ u6665 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ BEDEVERE +++$+++ Bring her forward.
L392050 +++$+++ u6663 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ ALL +++$+++ She looks like one. Yes, she does.
L392049 +++$+++ u6665 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ BEDEVERE +++$+++ How do you know she is a witch?
L391905 +++$+++ u6664 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ I'm not interested.
L391904 +++$+++ u6686 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ SOLDIER +++$+++ Am I right?
L391903 +++$+++ u6664 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ Please!
L391902 +++$+++ u6686 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ SOLDIER +++$+++ Look! To maintain Velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings four hundred and ninety three times every second.   right?
L391901 +++$+++ u6664 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ Well, it doesn't matter.   Go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.
L391900 +++$+++ u6686 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ SOLDIER +++$+++ It's not a question of where he grips it,  It's a simple matter of weight - ratios ...  A five-ounce bird could not hold a a one pound coconut.
L391897 +++$+++ u6686 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ SOLDIER +++$+++ What? A swallow carrying a coconut?
L391896 +++$+++ u6664 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ Not at all.  They could be carried.
L391895 +++$+++ u6686 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ SOLDIER +++$+++ Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
L391894 +++$+++ u6664 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ The swallow may fly south with the sun, or the house martin or the plover seek warmer hot lands in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.
L391893 +++$+++ u6686 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ SOLDIER +++$+++ Well, this is a temperate zone.
L391892 +++$+++ u6664 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ What do you mean?
L391891 +++$+++ u6686 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ SOLDIER +++$+++ Found them?  In Mercea.  The coconut's tropical!
L391890 +++$+++ u6664 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ Through ... We found them.
L391889 +++$+++ u6686 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ SOLDIER +++$+++ Where did you get the coconuts?
L391888 +++$+++ u6664 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ So?  We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land, through the kingdom of Mercea.
L391887 +++$+++ u6686 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ SOLDIER +++$+++ You've got two empty halves of coconuts and you're banging them together.
L391886 +++$+++ u6664 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ ...What?
L391885 +++$+++ u6686 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ SOLDIER +++$+++ You're using coconuts!
L391884 +++$+++ u6664 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ Yes!
L391883 +++$+++ u6686 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ SOLDIER +++$+++ What?  Ridden on a horse?
L391882 +++$+++ u6664 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ I am...  And this my trusty servant, Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join our court at Camelot..  I must speak with your lord and master.
L391881 +++$+++ u6686 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ SOLDIER +++$+++ Get away!
L391880 +++$+++ u6664 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot.  King of all Britons, defeator of the Saxons, sovereign of all England!
L391879 +++$+++ u6686 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ SOLDIER +++$+++ Halt!  Who goes there?
L392283 +++$+++ u6664 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ The Bridge of Death? ... which leads to the Grail?
L392282 +++$+++ u6687 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ SOOTHSAYER +++$+++ Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
L392281 +++$+++ u6664 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
L392280 +++$+++ u6687 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ SOOTHSAYER +++$+++ There is much danger ... for beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril which no man has ever crossed.
L392279 +++$+++ u6664 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ And ... the Grail ... The Grail is there?
L392278 +++$+++ u6687 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ SOOTHSAYER +++$+++ He knows of a cave ... a cave which no man has entered.
L392277 +++$+++ u6664 +++$+++ m445 +++$+++ ARTHUR +++$+++ Where does he live?  Old man ... where does he live ...
