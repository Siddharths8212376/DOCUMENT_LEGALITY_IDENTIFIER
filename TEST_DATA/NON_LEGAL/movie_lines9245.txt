L360552 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Can I borrow a piece of --
L361054 +++$+++ u1953 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RUIZ +++$+++ That's none of your fucking business.
L361053 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ When all this is over and we're not working for Maxie, I'd love to run into you on the street.  Why aren't you coming?
L361052 +++$+++ u1953 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RUIZ +++$+++ What?
L361051 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Yeah.
L361045 +++$+++ u1953 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RUIZ +++$+++ Will you tell Peter Jennings to shut up and fucking listen. The shit's as routine as you get. I coulda turned it over offshore in a week, but Maxie likes to do it all his way. Safe. I coulda dropped the bag alone. It's only two hundred G's. But he sent you all. So I can either send you home and tell Maxie, or we can flush the toilet one more time and hope it all goes down.
L361044 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ So, we're talking money laundering...
L361043 +++$+++ u1953 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RUIZ +++$+++ Shut it, man. Shut it. Tom is a square. He don't but dabble in shit. Maxie had me hook up a loan-back with him, through an Austrian passbook account.
L361042 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ The Red Dragon.
L361035 +++$+++ u1953 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RUIZ +++$+++ Outfit? What's he talking about?
L361034 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Who's gonna outfit us?
L361031 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ He has a cute what...?
L361030 +++$+++ u1953 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RUIZ +++$+++ Four mimosas.  You'll love them. So here's the plan. I didn't say shit to Maxie, cause the man has acute angina, and I don't want to get him all worked up.
L361029 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ No...
L360903 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Unless spoken to, ain't that right, Horrace. Didn't you say that?
L360902 +++$+++ u1953 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RUIZ +++$+++ What the fuck was you told? Don't talk, right?
L360874 +++$+++ u1953 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RUIZ +++$+++ Far as she knows you're John Gotti. Now put the shit down and act like you got some ass.
L360873 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ She poured it for --
L360872 +++$+++ u1953 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RUIZ +++$+++ What the fuck you think, I wanna 'hang' with you motherfuckers? Yeah you're working. And put down the champagne.
L360869 +++$+++ u1953 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RUIZ +++$+++ Maxie told you to keep your mouth shut while you're working, right?
L360868 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ We don't know any drill. Nobody told us anything.
L360787 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ It's a digestif.
L360786 +++$+++ u1953 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RUIZ +++$+++ Some fuckin guineas he sent me. It's midnight and the motherfucker's ordering an apertif.
L360785 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Yeah. That fernet tastes like tar. My grandfather tried to give me that.
L360784 +++$+++ u1953 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RUIZ +++$+++ What, motherfucker? You drinking 'the witch' after dinner?
L360783 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ No. I'll take a strega.

I just fucking love the fact that you have kids driving around in pickup trucks with a mouthful of this shit, speeding their brains out. I gotta bring a case of it home to my mates. It's illegal back home, you know.
L361139 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ Dip?
L360899 +++$+++ u1952 +++$+++ m127 +++$+++ RICKY +++$+++ A rose by any other name would --

L364234 +++$+++ u1957 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ ARCHIE +++$+++ Don't never write nothing down. File it up here, like I do.  'Cause if they can't find no paper they ain't got no proof. Ya dig?
L364233 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Lemme write it down for you.
L364232 +++$+++ u1957 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ ARCHIE +++$+++ YOU can't. I'll get a hold of you.
L364231 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Where can I get a hold of you?
L364226 +++$+++ u1957 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ ARCHIE +++$+++ I like you, country.

L364223 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ My papa taught me one thing: don't never bullshit a West Indian bullshit artist.
L364222 +++$+++ u1957 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ ARCHIE +++$+++ You ain't bullshitting me, is you, boy?
L364221 +++$+++ u1957 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ ARCHIE +++$+++ How 'bout that?
L364220 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Man's rep travels.
L364219 +++$+++ u1957 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ ARCHIE +++$+++ Sombitch and I ain't never been to Beantown.
L364218 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Where I come from. Boston.

L364216 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Not this boy... I ain't fighting their war. I got my own. Right chere. Heard tell you're a good man to know.
L364215 +++$+++ u1957 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ ARCHIE +++$+++ When they want your ass, won't nothing keep you out.
L364214 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Keeps me out of the army.
L364213 +++$+++ u1957 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ ARCHIE +++$+++ Bet you like that shit.
L364212 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I'm working trains. Selling.
L364209 +++$+++ u1957 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ ARCHIE +++$+++ You better not be. Cause if a cat toe you down in this town, you better stand up or make tracks.
L364208 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Red, and I ain't no punk.
L364207 +++$+++ u1957 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ ARCHIE +++$+++ What they call you?
L364206 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ He had it coming.
L364205 +++$+++ u1957 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ ARCHIE +++$+++ Sit down. We ain't fixing to eat you. You look brand new in town. Pretty handy with a bottle.
L364339 +++$+++ u1977 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ SAMMY +++$+++ He gave it to you, Archie. He did.
L364338 +++$+++ u1957 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ ARCHIE +++$+++ What you say?
L364337 +++$+++ u1977 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ SAMMY +++$+++ Don't push it. You way ahead. You back on top. That boy loves you, man.
L364336 +++$+++ u1957 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ ARCHIE +++$+++ The dirty yellow rat bastard.
L364230 +++$+++ u1977 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ SAMMY +++$+++ You putting a hurtin' on my vision.
L364229 +++$+++ u1957 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ ARCHIE +++$+++ Yeah, got to do something about you.
L364211 +++$+++ u1957 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ ARCHIE +++$+++ That's a fact. What you do, boy?
L364210 +++$+++ u1977 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ SAMMY +++$+++ Man live by his rep.
L364946 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ You want a new car? You want a new house? Is that it? It's the money, right?
L364945 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ "I'm telling you God's words, not to hustle."
L364944 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ Now about our coming up in the world a little. You're not naive. You're a man of the world. The Movement's grown; we've grown with it. You know folks. They want their leaders to be prosperous. One hand washes the other.
L364685 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ I'm sure we can. This is a new sister, Sister Betty.
L364684 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Brother Bembry, can we fix it so our loudspeaker is heard on the street?
L364590 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I want to. God knows I want to.
L364589 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it.
L364588 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I don't know how.
L364587 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ Tell Him that.
L364586 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Yeah. When I was picking a lock to rob somebody's house.
L364585 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm?
L364584 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I don't know what to say to Allah.
L364583 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ -- the hardest and the greatest.
L364582 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
L364581 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
L364580 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I can't.
L364579 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ -- the hardest and the greatest.
L364578 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
L364577 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
L364576 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I can't.
L364575 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ But the key to Islam is submission. That is why twice daily we turn to Mecca, to the Holy of Holies, to pray. We bend our knees in submission.
L364574 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I will do it.
L364573 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ A Muslim must be strikingly upright. Outstanding. So those in the darkness can see the power of the light.
L364572 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I will not touch the white man's poison: his drugs, his liquor, his carrion, his women.
L364571 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ The body is a holy repository.
L364569 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ No. Elijah Muhammad does not say "that white man is a devil." He teaches us that the white man is the devil. All white men.
L364568 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I sure met some.
L364567 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ I knew you'd hear me. The white man is the devil. All white men are devils.
L364566 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Then the devil is white.
L364565 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ Allah has sent us a prophet, a black man named Elijah Muhammad. For if God is black, Malcolm --
L364563 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ Who are you?
L364562 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I'm not Malcolm Little and I'm not Satan.
L364561 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ No. That's the name of the slave- master who owned your family. You don't even know who you are. You're nothing. Less than nothing. A zero. Who are you?
L364560 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Little.
L364557 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ I told you to go behind the words and dig out the truth. They let us sing and dance and smile -- and now they let one black man in the majors. That don't cancel out the greatest crime in history. When that blue- eyed devil locked us in chains -- 100,000,000 of us -- broke up our families, tortured us, cut us off from our language, our religion, our history.
L364556 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ A black man playing big league ball is something.
L364555 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ Sure, white man throw us a bone and that's supposed to make us forget 400 years.
L364547 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ The first men on earth were black. They ruled and there was not one white face anywhere. But they teach us that we lived in caves and swung from trees. Black men were never like that.
L364546 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ You pitch, baby; I'll ketch.
L364545 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ Lemme tell you about history: black history. You listening?
L364544 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Ole Pete ain't much in the head, but he can lay in there with the wood.
L364535 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ Read it and keep on reading.
L364534 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Aardvark, noun. An earth pig; an ant- eating African mammal. Man, that sounds like the dozens.
L364533 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ Start at the beginning. Page one, the first one. Here --
L364532 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Where am I gonna start?
L364531 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ Look 'em up and and out what they mean.
L364530 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Man, I'm studying in the man's book. I don't dig half the words.
L364528 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Man, how'm I gonna know the ones worth looking at?
L364527 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ You got to learn everything the white man says and use it against him. The truth is laying there if you smart and read behind their words. It's buried there. You got to dig it out.
L364526 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Then what you telling me to study in them for?
L364525 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
L364524 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ That's bullshit. That's a white man's book. Ain't all these white man's books?
L364518 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ Soiled with dirt, foul; sullen, hostile, forbidding -- as a black day. Foully or outrageously wicked, as black cruelty. Indicating disgrace, dishonor or culpability.
L364517 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ I can't make out that shit.
L364513 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Okay, okay. Show me, man.
L364512 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ Go on, fool; the marble shooters are waiting for you.
L364511 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ What the hell for, man?
L364510 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ Did you ever study anything wasn't part of some con?
L364509 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ What for?
L364508 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ But everything the white man taught you, you learned. He told you you were a black heathen and you believed him. He told you how he took you out of darkness and brought you to the light. And you believed him. He taught you to worship a blond, blue-eyed God with white skin -- and you believed him. He told you black was a curse, you believed him. Did you ever look up the word black in the dictionary?
L364507 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ What? Everybody knows God is White.
L364506 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ I'm telling you God's words, not no hustle. I'm talking the words of Elijah, the black man's God. I'm telling you, boy, that God is black.
L364505 +++$+++ u1971 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ MALCOLM +++$+++ Come on, daddy, pull my coat. What happens if you give all that up? You get sick or somethin'? I pulled a hustle once and got out of the draft.
L364504 +++$+++ u1958 +++$+++ m128 +++$+++ BEMBRY +++$+++ Your mama had sense because the pig is a filthy beast: part rat, part cat, and the rest is dog.
