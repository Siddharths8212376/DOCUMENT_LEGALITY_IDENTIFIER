L401376 +++$+++ u6737 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ BRUCE +++$+++ Let's just see if he can make it into round two....
L401375 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ I didn't think he'd make it past Scraps.
L401433 +++$+++ u6738 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ FRED THOMISON +++$+++ We will start work on it now sir.
L401432 +++$+++ u6739 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHN C. MCCAY +++$+++ If you want, I can fire you and have someone else who has the balls terminate these worthless people. Which will it be ?
L401431 +++$+++ u6738 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ FRED THOMISON +++$+++ Sir, I came from the Chicago offices myself, and if I may say, sir, there are still some very good....
L401430 +++$+++ u6739 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHN C. MCCAY +++$+++ Fire the whole division. We're moving more of the operations division into Manhattan anyway. Whoever is left over from the conversion is no longer needed. We already have all the key people here. Anyone else is expendable.
L401429 +++$+++ u6738 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ FRED THOMISON +++$+++ Excuse me, sir ?
L401428 +++$+++ u6739 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHN C. MCCAY +++$+++ Fire the whole division.
L401427 +++$+++ u6738 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ FRED THOMISON +++$+++ Well ?
L401820 +++$+++ u6739 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHN C. MCCAY +++$+++ Have that tape on my desk tomorrow morning.  First.... thing...
L401819 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ Sir ? We're moving them right along as fast as we can.
L401818 +++$+++ u6739 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHN C. MCCAY +++$+++ Fantastic ! A little faster sweetheart.
L401817 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ Yes sir. It will be the best of your collection, I assure you.
L401816 +++$+++ u6739 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHN C. MCCAY +++$+++ Not you Zach.  Remember, my wife is asleep upstairs, dear.  Zach, am I gonna like what I see on this tape ? Is it the grandest of all the Park's tapes ?
L401815 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ Sir ?
L401814 +++$+++ u6739 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHN C. MCCAY +++$+++ One moment dear... 
L401813 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ Better, sir.
L401812 +++$+++ u6739 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHN C. MCCAY +++$+++ Is it as good as I hope it is ?
L401811 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ Good, sir.
L401810 +++$+++ u6739 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHN C. MCCAY +++$+++ Zach, my boy ! How is tonights adventure going ?
L401809 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ Zachary.
L401484 +++$+++ u6739 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHN C. MCCAY +++$+++ That my boy, is the best part. Life on top of the world is boring... predictable. If I wanted life without chances, I never would have paid for Murderland. Now go. Make a formal proposal and see about the assistant. Find out if it's viable.
L401483 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ Sir, this is not like firing any employee. We can't predict what will happen.
L401482 +++$+++ u6739 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHN C. MCCAY +++$+++ Yes, do you think he would like a raise and a new position ?
L401481 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ John, sir.
L401480 +++$+++ u6739 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHN C. MCCAY +++$+++ Do you think the assistant, what's his name...
L401479 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ What then sir ? What would we do with the park with out Bruce ?
L401478 +++$+++ u6739 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHN C. MCCAY +++$+++ I'm willing to bet that even the creator can't out wit his creation.
L401477 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ Sir, he created the Park. He would know how to circumvent any of the traps.
L401476 +++$+++ u6739 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHN C. MCCAY +++$+++ I'll bet that would be the Park run of the century !
L401475 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ Sir ?
L401474 +++$+++ u6739 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHN C. MCCAY +++$+++ What if we were to put Bruce into the Park as a Guest ?
L401473 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ What do you mean sir ?
L401472 +++$+++ u6739 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHN C. MCCAY +++$+++ I propose we consider a hostile take over. Perhaps Ol' Bruce is in need of a new job opportunity.
L401471 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ Bruce may still refuse. It is my belief that he is becoming more belligerent.
L401470 +++$+++ u6739 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHN C. MCCAY +++$+++ That mail room kid was the longest lasting "guest" yet ! Maybe we can alter the computer records and make another "guest" from the more athletic of our staff.
L401469 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ Yes sir. It turns out we put an innocent man into the "park" and he was not the one who stole from the stamp machine. That is also about the time when Bruce began refusing.
L401468 +++$+++ u6739 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHN C. MCCAY +++$+++ What about that time when the mail room kid was accused of stealing and we put him in the "Park" ? Wasn't that a computer glitch ?
L401467 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ That's right, sir. He does a thorough background check and if he finds them to be criminal or guilty of embezzlement, then he will put them in the park. He has refused the last three suggested "guests".
L401466 +++$+++ u6739 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHN C. MCCAY +++$+++ I don't believe Ol' Bruce is having as much fun with this as he once did. He still insists on the "guests" being of the more nefarious type.
L401465 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ But sir, most of the people we are putting into the "Park" are accountants that embezzle or investment bankers. They are not known for their physical or intellectual prowess.
L401464 +++$+++ u6739 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHN C. MCCAY +++$+++ I want more action. I want to see more ingenuity than that. I want to see the injured man out wit the machines !
L401463 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ I had suggested that they tone down the program so that the "guests" might take longer to expire.
L401462 +++$+++ u6739 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHN C. MCCAY +++$+++ That was rather.... disappointing.
L401461 +++$+++ u6739 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHN C. MCCAY +++$+++ Son, let's watch the tape.
L401460 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ Thank you, sir. I was really hoping for shares, or possibly cash... but this, this is really personal.
L401459 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ Thank you, sir.
L401458 +++$+++ u6739 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHN C. MCCAY +++$+++ I have entrusted you with a great many things. In your tenure with this company you have seen and heard things that could upset the very economic world in which we live. I think this kind of loyalty should be rewarded.
L401457 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ Yes sir.
L401456 +++$+++ u6739 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHN C. MCCAY +++$+++ Zach my boy, I can spend your yearly salary in a blink. I have had that kind of money all of my life. If I wanted to, I could fly to Paris for the afternoon.  My father formed this company over seventy years ago. When my brother became mentally challenged, it was put in my charge. Now running a bank of this size is very stressful. I need to relax on what little down time I have. A yacht club will not quite make my blood pressure decline. Understand ?
L401455 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ I make roughly four hundred thousand a year.
L401454 +++$+++ u6739 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHN C. MCCAY +++$+++ And how much do we pay you annually ?
L401453 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ I am thirty two.
L401452 +++$+++ u6739 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHN C. MCCAY +++$+++ Zach, how old are you, son ?
L401451 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ While I am not morally against these little, shall we say "hobbies", as long as I am on the payroll, but why not something like a yacht club ?
L401450 +++$+++ u6739 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHN C. MCCAY +++$+++ Of course.
L401449 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ Thank you , sir. Sir, may I ask you a question ?
L401448 +++$+++ u6739 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHN C. MCCAY +++$+++ I have to say, that I am glad you are such an amazing kiss ass.
L401447 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ Yes sir, I do. Last night's, fresh from the Park.
L401446 +++$+++ u6739 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHN C. MCCAY +++$+++ Perhaps it was. I was in boarding school for so many years, it's hard to remember. Do you have the tape of the latest exploits from my favorite hobby ?
L401445 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ I thought that was Darwin, sir. Or perhaps Nietzsche ?
L401444 +++$+++ u6739 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHN C. MCCAY +++$+++ Relax, son. They'll learn in time that you don't fuck with First Bank. This is the real deal and we aim to keep it strong. My Daddy always told me that Only The Strong Survive.
L401443 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ Not that well sir. I believe we have a few too many soft hearts in the building. Did we aquire a bank from Chicago or a charity ?
L401442 +++$+++ u6739 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHN C. MCCAY +++$+++ Zachory ! My boy, how goes the carnage down on 44 ?
L401944 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Yeah, right. He's stuck all the way over here
L401943 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ Go in there ? What if Bruce finds you ?
L401942 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ I don't know. I think that a power grid just needs reset. Don't get your panties in a bunch. I'll go down and reset it.
L401941 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ How can this happen ?
L401940 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ The power went out in half the park.
L401939 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ What happened ?
L401938 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ What the ... ?
L401916 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ He's got two chices.either it's the Bowling Alley from Hell or Alice in Murderland. See this ? Even Bruce knows that no one can make it out of here in one piece.
L401915 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ So what's next ? No one's ever made it this far before.
L401906 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ I think I'll see hat action.
L401905 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ Okay, I have five that says THIS is it for them.
L401892 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Goddamn it Bruce, you've cost me about thirty dollars so far.
L401891 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ Thank you very much.
L401885 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ The room will fill to the top, then if they wind up in the next room, they lived, if not, they're dead.
L401884 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ Ach ! How will you know if they've made it ?
L401883 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ <<belch>>
L401882 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ That is repugnant. You have the habits of a goat.
L401824 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ I can see that but where ?
L401823 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ There ! There ! Did you see ! They're still alive !
L401822 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ Yes. I think he's feeling sick or something.
L401821 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Was that the Old Man ?
L401783 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ You're paying the bills.
L401782 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ I don't know. Maybe we should watch the tape to be sure.
L401781 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Shit, I forgot about them. Well, I guess the boss man wasn't as tough as I thought.
L401780 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ Look ! Look !
L401773 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ I can see your small business ! Look at it it's so small.
L401772 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Look he figured it out !
L401757 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ Well, Mr. Parker it seems that your is not the wardrobe of choice tonight. I'm quite confident that my tie is looking better than yours.
L401756 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Maybe you should get over fears.
L401706 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Why ? The crocks are all going for the dead crock. There's no fun in it. Besides we've got plenty more for them. The night is young....
L401705 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ Aren't you going to switch exits on him again ?
L401695 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ I'll see that bet.
L401694 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ I've got five bucks that says someone dies here and now.
L401655 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ I do believe Mr. McCray will be most pleased with the tape of this one.
L401654 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ I have a turn for the worse for the team !
L401653 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ What's next ?
L401638 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Of course, this one's a gimme. Just be patient, even Ol' Bruce can't outwit some of these traps.
L401637 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ Will he make it out ?
L401618 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ He'll never make it out of the park alive. I promise you that....
L401617 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ We can't afford too many surprises.
L401616 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ He must have had a gun stashed. God damn it !
L401615 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ What was that ?
L401614 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ I don't know.....
L401613 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ What is Bruce doing ?
L401596 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ What ?????
L401595 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ Bruce has just awaken.
L401594 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ We should have another fifteen minutes at least.
L401593 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ How long till the drug wears off ?
L401592 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Aren't you the bitter one.
L401591 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ Just a temp who pissed me off and a girl who turned me down for the night of her life.
L401590 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ So who are these people with the Boss ?
L401538 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ I'm listening.
L401537 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ I had hoped you would say that. I have a proposal for you.....
L401536 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ No I am not.
L401535 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ Are you happy with your salary and position ?
L401534 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ We can't.
L401533 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ I didn't think even this company could afford to write off enough to build a new "Park".
L401532 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ Have you ever considered running your own "Park" ? I mean, since you will not be returning to your former profession.
L401531 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Then what do you want ?
L401530 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ No. I am not a homosexual.
L401529 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ What are you looking for ? A blow job ?
L401528 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you trying to play both sides ?
L401527 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ There was a bit of confusion on one of my last jobs.
L401526 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ Might I ask why you no longer work for the mob ?
L401525 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ I was.
L401524 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ Only that you were one of the finest hit men in the mob. That if you wanted a good clean kill, that Johnny Tortelli was the man for the job.
L401523 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ What did you hear ?
L401522 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ No. I was just curious if what I heard about you is true ?
L401521 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ He's been expecting you.
L401520 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ We have new "guests" for the park. I have a file on them. May I see Bruce ?
L401519 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Hey, Mr. Executive. Buy you a drink sailor ?
L401398 +++$+++ u6743 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ ZACH +++$+++ I'm just looking for our best interests. May I have the tapes, Bruce ?
L401397 +++$+++ u6740 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ He has a phone pole sticking in his chest, I think we don't need an autopsy.
L402044 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ I'm going to go ahead and go now.
L402043 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ Why don't you shut up now.
L402042 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ No sir. I was just getting , well you know. Water. We weren't talking about sex or anything else except Star Wars. Just saying hello. I think I'm gonna go now.
L402040 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Well, I think if you take several lines out of context, Star Wars becomes a very sexual movie. I mean listen to this.  "Luke, at that speed will you be able to pull out in time ?" or "You came in that thing ? You're braver than I thought".
L402039 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ No.
L402038 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Ow. Son of a .....  Did I ever tell you my theory on Star Wars as Porn ?
L402037 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Of course I am. I feel the testosterone coursing through my veins.  Now that I've gotten the stitches removed from my arm and the chiropractor fixed my back.
L402036 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ Hey buddy. You okay ?
L402035 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Hey good lookin' ! What'cha got cookin' ?
L402027 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Who was that guy anyway ?
L402026 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ He was right behind me !
L402023 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ Come to the rescue again I see.
L402022 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Thanks a lot. I always wanted to know what it was like to see my life flash before my eyes for the one hundredth time tonight.
L402006 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Where are we ?
L402005 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ No, idiot. Where do we go now ?
L402004 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ I want to go to sleep for about a month.
L402003 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ What now ?
L402002 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ We made it !
L402001 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Sweet Jesus I never dreamed I'd be glad to see Central Park at night.
L402000 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ I was thinking maybe we should try this dinner thing again, but maybe the Epcot version will be open by then....
L401999 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ Hey Matty, don't wait for me or anything.
L401994 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ I'm fine.
L401993 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Are you okay ? Any holes ? I mean aside from the one's that nature gave you ?
L401979 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ Zach from work ?
L401978 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ It's that asshole Zach isn't it ?
L401967 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Nothing.
L401966 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ What ?
L401965 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ I think I'm very quickly getting over my phobia of public urination.
L401964 +++$+++ u6742 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ SAUNDRA +++$+++ Shut up ! It's me.
L401963 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ Jesus Christ ! I'm just a temp for Christ sakes !
L401721 +++$+++ u6741 +++$+++ m449 +++$+++ MATTHEW +++$+++ "How's your foot" ? This guy tried to kill us and he put us in this place, and you want to know how his foot is ?
