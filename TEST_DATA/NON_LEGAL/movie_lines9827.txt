L218855 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Do you think you could discreetly move across the hall now?
L218854 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Yes.
L218853 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Is he?
L218852 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Carl restored my confidence. He really did. He's much more substantial than you give him credit for.
L218851 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I'm fine.
L218850 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ As a matter of fact, he's the one who introduced me to Carl...  How are you?
L218849 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Something witty and devastating like that.
L218848 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ That's what you said?
L218847 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I married him when I was 17. He was a cellist, and I thought he was the most brilliant man I'd ever met... And I'm sure he was, because at that age, I hadn't met that many... But he was insidious, you know. He had me convinced that I was a mediocrity, musically, as a woman, as an intellect. But in this completely imperceptible, pleasant way, so that you weren't even sure he was doing it. Anyway, I just woke up one morning and I said, you know something Joseph, you're full of beans, and I left him...
L218846 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I don't believe vou.
L218845 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ That's right.
L218844 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ No inner feeling.
L218843 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Shut up...
L218842 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ No, don't do that...
L218840 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Yes, that's what's important to me...
L218839 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Serious, that's what's important to you?
L218837 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I'd like you to leave now. Is that direct enough?
L218836 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ It's direct, anyway, which seems to be difficult for you.
L218835 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I don't find your language that charming.
L218831 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Some bath oil?
L218830 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...
L218829 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ It's convenient to fake looking for something right now, isn't it?
L218828 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I'm not conscious of having given you any meaningful looks. And as for the day after tomorrow, this is the day after tomorrow, and I am, unfortunately, seeing you... Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like to take a bath.
L218827 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Up to now, what I've been getting from you are meaningful looks over the dinner table and a lot of vague suggestions about the day after tomorrow...
L218826 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I don't think that's accurate...
L218825 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Yes, it was. You've made it clear that if I can cut a little piano, I might get a little response.
L218824 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Look... You made a very calculated move, and then made me feel embarrassed for responding to you. That wasn't necessary.
L218823 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ No, it isn't what I think.
L218822 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I think it's what you think.
L218821 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You think I'm a fake.
L218819 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ No, you're very good at it. I'm really impressed.
L218818 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Catherine...
L218817 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ At being a fake.
L218816 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What?
L218815 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Well, at least you're accomplished at something...
L218814 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Wait...
L218813 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Then I must have been supplying it.
L218812 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ None.
L218811 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ You had no inner feeling?
L218810 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I didn't have any.
L218809 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ It doesn't matter. It was the feeling I was affected by.
L218808 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Nothing. It's just that... I picked the easiest piece I could remember. I think I first played it when I was 8 years old and I played it better then.
L218807 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Why?
L218806 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ It wasn't supposed to be, it just struck me that way.
L218805 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Is that funny?
L218804 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I was really very moved by the way you...
L218803 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Thank you.
L218802 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ That was beautiful, Robert. I'm surprised...
L218754 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Of course I do. It's music. You know...
L218753 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ You don't call that music, though.
L218752 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I have played a few times. Here and there. As a matter of fact, I was once a rehearsal pianist for a Las Vegas musical revue.
L218751 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I mean, how could you not play anymore? That's so strange to me...
L218749 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I gave it a second thought.
L218748 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ One thing that's hard to understand is how you could have this incredible background in music, and then just walk away from it, without a second thought...
L218744 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Yeah, I'll probably be free.
L218743 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ If you're free.
L218742 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ The day after tomorrow.
L218741 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Carl has hydrotherapy on Tuesdays.
L218740 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Tomorrow's a full practice day...  But the day after is kind of open.
L218739 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Tomorrow, then.
L218738 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ After that, I plan to read some music and rest for awhile.
L218737 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Then after that?
L218736 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Right now I'm going to run a hot tub and soak myself.
L218734 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I don't know. Let me give it some thought.
L218733 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
L218732 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Nothing? Then it must be very boring for you here.
L218731 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Nothing.
L218730 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Well, there's fishing and boating. There's concerts on the mainland and... but I feel silly telling you. This is really your home. You probably know better than I what there is to do.
L218729 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Besides piano and swimming, what else do you do?
L218728 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What would I do with it? Run amok?
L218727 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Why?
L218726 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Well, I wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself.
L218725 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I love to swim, and I don't mind the cold at all. It's invigorating.
L218724 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Playing piano all day and then jumping into cold water. You could get a cramp.
L218723 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Swimming?
L218722 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ That's dangerous, you know.
L218721 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Yes, intentionally.
L218720 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I guess you fell in the water.
L218719 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ Hello...
L218667 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ And you no longer play at all?
L218666 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What have I been doing? Different things, different jobs, here and there. Nothing that interesting.
L218665 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ What have you been doing since then?
L218944 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You're all full of shit!
L218943 +++$+++ u5318 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Robert, I think you better just...
L218884 +++$+++ u5318 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Robert, let's not be rude, okay?
L218883 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Oh, for chrissakes...
L218794 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ I thought you had to go to the mainland today. Aren't you going to miss the ferry?
L218793 +++$+++ u5318 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ All right, let's have a rematch.
L218792 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ That's three games to none, Carl.
L218791 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ At game, Carl.
L218790 +++$+++ u5318 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ See? There's nothing wrong with the way I walk. Now where are we?
L218776 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ That's what I mean...
L218775 +++$+++ u5318 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ I've walked across a stage a number of times, without exciting any particular response...
L218772 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Your serve. Two -- Eighteen.
L218771 +++$+++ u5318 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ I'm not aware of it. Like what?
L218769 +++$+++ u5318 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ What do you mean? Aside from my neck, I'm in superb shape.
L218768 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ You sure you should be playing, Carl?
L218757 +++$+++ u5318 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Nothing. Will you excuse us for a while?
L218756 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What?
L218755 +++$+++ u5318 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Robert, do you mind?
L218687 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Thanks, Carl...
L218686 +++$+++ u5318 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ I hope you feel at home, Robert.  I'm really glad you're here.
L218684 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Is she?
L218683 +++$+++ u5318 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ She's tremendously gifted, this girl.
L218680 +++$+++ u5318 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ It's still nearly impossible for me to turn my neck. If I wanted to turn toward Catherine, for instance, I'd first have to twist the whole base of my body around...  ... like this...
L218679 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ What?
L218678 +++$+++ u5318 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Did you hear about my misfortune, Robert?
L218659 +++$+++ u5318 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ No, the last time was three years ago.
L218658 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Four or five years.
L219024 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ It's all right. I'm fine.
L219023 +++$+++ u5320 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ DRIVER +++$+++ Suit yourself. But I'll tell you, where we're headed is gonna get colder'n hell.
L219022 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ No, it's okay.
L219021 +++$+++ u5320 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ DRIVER +++$+++ I've got an extra jacket behind the seat, if you want to put it on.
L219020 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ No, I don't, I uh... it got burned up. Everything in the car got the shit burned out of it. All I got left is what I have on...
L219019 +++$+++ u5320 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ DRIVER +++$+++ Haven't you got a jacket or anything with you?
L218896 +++$+++ u5317 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ BOBBY +++$+++ Will you shut up for a minute!!  Pull your car out of line.
L218895 +++$+++ u5320 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ DRIVER +++$+++ Come on, get moving, dammit!!
L218930 +++$+++ u5323 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ RAYETTE +++$+++ Oh, uh huh. I had a little kittycat once, that Bobby give me...
L218929 +++$+++ u5318 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ It's a Borzoi.
L218928 +++$+++ u5323 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ RAYETTE +++$+++ What kind of doggy is that?
L218882 +++$+++ u5323 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ RAYETTE +++$+++ I do eat slow as a bird, whereas Bobby can put it away like a speed swing...  Is there any ketchup around?
L218881 +++$+++ u5318 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ No, you're not. Go ahead and take your time.
L218873 +++$+++ u5318 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Not at all.
L218872 +++$+++ u5323 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ RAYETTE +++$+++ Well, thank you, that's a very nice thing for you to say.
L218871 +++$+++ u5318 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Oh, no. You're more than welcome.
L218870 +++$+++ u5323 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ RAYETTE +++$+++ Well, I was goin' to, but Bobby said he hadda kind of feel things up here first, which I can understand, but then it went an' took so long, I ran flat outa money...  I didn't have no number to call, you know.  So I hadda clear outa there an' come on up here, in the hopes that I wouldn't be intrudin' myself...
L218869 +++$+++ u5318 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ I don't understand why you had to stay in a motel. There's more than enough room here.
L218868 +++$+++ u5323 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ RAYETTE +++$+++ For two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away...
L218867 +++$+++ u5318 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ You've been staying in a motel all this time?
L218747 +++$+++ u5318 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ I took some aspirin and it really upset my stomach.
L218746 +++$+++ u5327 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ TITA +++$+++ What's wrong, Carl, you hardly ate anything...
L218672 +++$+++ u5318 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ At any rate, Dad wanted to hire a private detective to ferret you out, and I said, "What for?" Whatever the hell he's doing, even if it's a completely wasteful escapade, it's entirely his business. Simple as that...
L218671 +++$+++ u5327 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ TITA +++$+++ I hope I didn't hear that.
L218670 +++$+++ u5318 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ I don't know where you were, penis envy.
L218669 +++$+++ u5327 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ TITA +++$+++ Oh, my, "a summit conference." I wonder where I was, polishing silver behind the coal bin.
L218668 +++$+++ u5318 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ You know, just after I came back off tour with the Betenthaller Quartet, Dad, myself and Herbert had a summit conference about you...
L218664 +++$+++ u5327 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ TITA +++$+++ Besides being very rude.
L218663 +++$+++ u5318 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ It is true.
L218662 +++$+++ u5327 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ TITA +++$+++ I don't think that's true.
L218661 +++$+++ u5318 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CARL +++$+++ Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all.
L218660 +++$+++ u5327 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ TITA +++$+++ Oh no, it's been much more than that.
L218926 +++$+++ u5324 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ SAMIA +++$+++ Well, I should hope not...
L218925 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ You haven't dampened my spirit, Samia... Excuse me.
L218924 +++$+++ u5324 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ SAMIA +++$+++ But I'd like to say, so that I don't dampen the spirit of your adventure...
L218923 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ I think these cold, "objective" discussions are aggressive, Samia...
L218922 +++$+++ u5324 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ SAMIA +++$+++ ... which should exclude you from any objective discussion. But keep in mind, even the arts aren't free of aggressive content, nor the institution of marriage.
L218921 +++$+++ u5324 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ SAMIA +++$+++ Well, you're a romantic, Catherine, as are most musicians, and what's more, about to be married...
L218920 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ No, I wouldn't.
L218919 +++$+++ u5324 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ SAMIA +++$+++ What about it? Wouldn't you agree that a great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love?
L218918 +++$+++ u5319 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ CATHERINE +++$+++ And what about love?
L218588 +++$+++ u5322 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ PALM +++$+++ Hold onto this.
L218587 +++$+++ u5323 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ RAYETTE +++$+++ You better hold onto your tongue!
L218586 +++$+++ u5322 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ PALM +++$+++ I wouldn't be a waitress. They're nasty and full of crap.
L218585 +++$+++ u5323 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ RAYETTE +++$+++ Don't call me "mack," honey.
L218584 +++$+++ u5322 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ PALM +++$+++ Don't call me "honey," mack.
L218583 +++$+++ u5323 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ RAYETTE +++$+++ Salesmen and cops are the ones. If you'd ever waitressed, honey, you'd know.
L218582 +++$+++ u5322 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ PALM +++$+++ Bullshit! Truck drivers know the best eating places on the road.
L218581 +++$+++ u5323 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ RAYETTE +++$+++ That's an old maid's tale.
L218580 +++$+++ u5322 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ PALM +++$+++ Hey, follow that truck. They know the best places to stop.
L218579 +++$+++ u5322 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ PALM +++$+++ Not dirt. See, dirt isn't bad. It's filth. Filth is bad. That's what starts maggots and riots...
L218578 +++$+++ u5323 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ RAYETTE +++$+++ Well...
L218566 +++$+++ u5322 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ PALM +++$+++ A dispose-all, what's that but more crap? I've never seen such crap. Oofh, I don't know how people get up in the morning.
L218565 +++$+++ u5323 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ RAYETTE +++$+++ There'd never be a hole big enough. Now took at me, for instance, when I was just one person, before Bobby, I had so much garbage collectin' onto me every day, I was thinkin' about gettin a dispose all...
L218542 +++$+++ u5323 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ RAYETTE +++$+++ Jesus, what a rude person...
L218541 +++$+++ u5322 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ PALM +++$+++ Come on, Terry, we got a ride!
L218624 +++$+++ u5322 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ PALM +++$+++ Right, steam. A car you could ride around in and not cause a stink. But do you know, they will not even let us have it. Can you believe it? Why?! Man! He likes to create a stink. I wrote them a note once, and told them to clean it... I mean, don't you see that? It's just filthy! I mean, I've seen filth you wouldn't believe! Oofh, what a stink! I don't even want to talk about it...
L218623 +++$+++ u5326 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Steam.
L218622 +++$+++ u5322 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ PALM +++$+++ And you know, I read where they invented this car that runs on... that runs on... when you boil water...
L218574 +++$+++ u5322 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ PALM +++$+++ And they picked up! I mean, it wouldn't be filthy, with Coke bottles and whiskey, and those signs everywhere...
L218573 +++$+++ u5326 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Yeah, it could be adorable...
L218572 +++$+++ u5322 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ PALM +++$+++ In my personal thing, I don't see that. I'm seeing more filth. A lot of filth. What they need to do every day, no, once in a while, is a cockroach thing, where they spray the homes. And uh... can you imagine, if their doors were painted a pretty color, and they had a pot outside, with...
L218571 +++$+++ u5326 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ In my personal observation, I think that more people are neat than are clean...
L218570 +++$+++ u5322 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ PALM +++$+++ Well, you're not that bad, but some people... I mean, people's homes, just filth. I've been in people's homes...
L218569 +++$+++ u5326 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Wait a minute. I'm not that neat, maybe, but I am clean.
L218568 +++$+++ u5322 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ PALM +++$+++ What do you mean "mass"... I have to come out and tell you, you're not that clean, either.
L218567 +++$+++ u5326 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ TERRY +++$+++ Mass production is what does it.
L218936 +++$+++ u5324 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ SAMIA +++$+++ Perhaps...
L218935 +++$+++ u5323 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ RAYETTE +++$+++ Well, she was.
L218934 +++$+++ u5324 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ SAMIA +++$+++ The choice of words, "squashed flat," juxtaposed against the image of a fluffy kitten...
L218915 +++$+++ u5324 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ SAMIA +++$+++ I strongly doubt it, but I wasn't really discussing media...
L218914 +++$+++ u5323 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ RAYETTE +++$+++ The TV. There's some good things on it, sometimes.
L218913 +++$+++ u5324 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ SAMIA +++$+++ Pardon me?
L218912 +++$+++ u5323 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ RAYETTE +++$+++ There's some good things on it, though.
L218911 +++$+++ u5324 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ SAMIA +++$+++ John believes in the basic goodness of man, and that's fine, but gaze into the pit like I have and that view seems a little soporific. And not unlike television, it hardly represents the real world...
L218444 +++$+++ u5327 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ TITA +++$+++ Oh, for pity's sake...
L218443 +++$+++ u5325 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ SECOND ENGINEER +++$+++ I have a suggestion. Why don't we take a break.
L218442 +++$+++ u5327 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ TITA +++$+++ Do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first? This is tiring me.
L218441 +++$+++ u5325 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ SECOND ENGINEER +++$+++ That's exactly what I am doing, again.
L218440 +++$+++ u5327 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ TITA +++$+++ Well, you have to simply tell me, that's all.
L218439 +++$+++ u5325 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ SECOND ENGINEER +++$+++ If you want to call it that.
L218438 +++$+++ u5327 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ TITA +++$+++ Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?
L218437 +++$+++ u5325 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ SECOND ENGINEER +++$+++ I'd like to remind you again, this isn't an opera or a musical comedy.
L218436 +++$+++ u5327 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ TITA +++$+++ Yes.
L218435 +++$+++ u5325 +++$+++ m353 +++$+++ SECOND ENGINEER +++$+++ Miss Dupea.
L219215 +++$+++ u5330 +++$+++ m354 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ Alright.
L219214 +++$+++ u5334 +++$+++ m354 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Then I want you to go to whoever's sayin' that and tell them to stop.
L219213 +++$+++ u5330 +++$+++ m354 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ I told you, no. I'm not that type.
L219212 +++$+++ u5334 +++$+++ m354 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ Is it true?
L219211 +++$+++ u5330 +++$+++ m354 +++$+++ AARON +++$+++ What chu listening to rumors for? I'm not like dat.
L219210 +++$+++ u5334 +++$+++ m354 +++$+++ DONNA +++$+++ There's a rumor that you were tryin' to get somebody to beat me up.
