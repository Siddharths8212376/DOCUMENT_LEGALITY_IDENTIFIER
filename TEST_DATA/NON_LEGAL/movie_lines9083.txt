L236058 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ What?!
L236057 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ You smashed it!
L236056 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Take it easy, willya? What about the radio?!
L236055 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.
L236054 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ The radio!
L236053 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Maybe you can tell me then.
L236052 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ I think you know.
L236051 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about?
L236050 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!
L236048 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ With all due respect, skipper.  Part of that up there's mine. I'd kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it.
L236047 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ There's no way we're gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be safer where it is.
L236046 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ For starters, getting that gold off the ship. What they don't know about isn't gonna bother them.
L236045 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ What do you propose?
L236044 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Yeah, well. The truth is one thing. When there's more than a few hundred million dollars involved, that's a whole new deal.
L236043 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ I guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth.
L236042 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. About us. About those bodies. About the gold. Seems like we oughta be prepared is all.
L236041 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ How do you mean?
L236040 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ So. I got a question. Just from a, you know, purely technical standpoint. We call the Coastguard.  Coastguard shows up. What exactly is the plan?
L236035 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ If they knew what they were carrying.
L236034 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ On a passenger ship in 1953?
L236023 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Not me.
L236022 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ It was a man's voice. Repeating some sort of children's rhyme. I don't know, it didn't make any sense. You didn't hear it?
L236008 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ I think you better see this for yourself.
L236007 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ What is it?
L236006 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ You better get down here quick, skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.
L236005 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Murphy.
L236004 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Dodge to Murphy.
L235989 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Right.
L235988 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.
L235987 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time.
L235986 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Can't you use something else?
L235978 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ So whoever did this might still be around.
L235977 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ That'd be my guess.
L235974 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Could be meant as a warning.
L235973 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Damn barbaric is what it is.
L235970 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Fresh ain't the first word that comes to mind.
L235969 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Bodies're too fresh.
L235950 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Yeah, reconsider fucking his shit up.
L235949 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ If he's reasonable, maybe we can make some kind of deal. If not. We'll have to re-consider our options.
L235943 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ We'll stand a watch. Four on, eight off. Low man first.
L235942 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ What if that fucker finds it before we're ready to go?
L235931 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Why not? Why the fuck not?
L235930 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ And what do you propose? That we knock this guy off?
L235929 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a professional salvage crew going about our business. What's some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway?
L235926 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Not in the eyes of the law.
L235925 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.
L235924 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ If somebody's aboard her already, she ain't ours. She's theirs.
L235900 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Warm water current maybe, making the metal expand.
L235899 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Sounds like the hull.
L235895 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Yeah, yeah.
L235894 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be doing if we don't get this boat running.
L235882 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ How about you Epps?
L235881 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ I'm buyin' me a nice outrigger. Spend my time hauling rich Seattle business men through the Puget.
L235855 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ The sooner we get under way, the sooner we are to spending what's ours.
L235854 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Yeah, yeah. I'm on it.
L235845 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ So we get a little more for the boat. Besides, the gold'll be safer where it is.
L235844 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ You gotta be kidding? What the hell we need that tub for, we got fifty million bucks?
L235841 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ It looks like it.
L235840 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich.
L235839 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself. It's ours.
L235838 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ So what're we gonna do. That's the big question, right?
L235836 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Either way, they must've had a pretty good reason.
L235835 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Or somebody stopped them.
L235829 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Then it happened before they scuttled her.
L235828 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell you that. Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat.
L235821 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ A ship with fifty million dollars in gold aboard, adrift? And nobody seems to care enough to come looking for it?
L235820 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ What, you think there's something funny about it?
L235819 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ It's a hell of a lot of money.
L235810 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ She take a radio?
L235809 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Went aboard.
L235796 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Man, it gives me the creeps. We got no business towing a ship that size anyway. I say we fix the turbines and hit the highway.
L235795 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Obviously it's some kind of screw up. The shipping records aren't a hundred percent accurate.
L235782 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ What do you want me to tell you, that we can throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened? Can't do it, skipper.
L235781 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Goddamit, Dodge.
L235780 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Three, four days.
L235779 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ How long?
L235778 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ I gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- .
L235777 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ How long, then?
L235776 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ It's a full 2500 horses down. We couldn't drag that boat down hill on ice with it.
L235775 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ What about running number two by itself?
L235774 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ I'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is.
L235773 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history.
L235772 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Hard to say.
L235771 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ But how long?
L235770 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ The right way and the wrong way.
L235769 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ I know I know, two ways to do anything --
L235768 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Like I always say --
L235767 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ How much longer's that gonna take?
L235766 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
L235765 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ I thought you said it was just a blade.
L235764 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Turbine rotor's shot.
L235763 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ What's this?
L235728 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Hard to say. I gotta get in there and have a look. At least a couple days. Depending.
L235727 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ How long to fix?
L235726 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ The number one turbine's pretty well trashed. Number two runs, but it's way underpowered.
L235724 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Threw a turbine blade.
L235723 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ What is it?
L235722 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Mother fucker!
L235711 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Sounds reasonable.
L235710 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ With a little extra fuel, weather permitting, we should make Sitka in five days without another stop.
L235677 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ The damn thing's been floating around for God knows how long and it hasn't hit anything yet. So we take it easy. A little of the old push pull.
L235676 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ It's a bloody navigation hazard. One boat can't control a ship that size.
L235673 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ It's a risk I'm willing to take.
L235672 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ If you get it back in one piece.
L235671 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ You have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage? The fittings alone could go for a few million.
L235670 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Yeah, from one side of the harbor to the other. But we got half the Bering Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to drag her over.
L235637 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Smugglers maybe.
L235636 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ What the hell would a freighter be doing up here? It's way out of the lanes. There's not a port for 800 miles.
L235577 +++$+++ u1086 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ DODGE +++$+++ Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps? Gimme a break.
L235576 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ You aren't jealous, are you Dodge?
L236263 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ I didn't sign up to go home empty handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this.
L236262 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ I can't believe you. Dodge's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share.
L236251 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Nothing. Let's get outa here.
L236250 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ What?
L236249 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
L236248 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ You okay?
L236231 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Better than starving to death.
L236230 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ I don't even want to know what that's gonna taste like now.
L236078 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ I feel fine.
L236077 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Sudden flashes of light.
L236076 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Lights?
L236075 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Headache, nausea, lights?
L236074 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ No.
L236073 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Any dizziness?
L235976 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Because of the gold.
L235975 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Stay away. Or else.
L235956 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ You're a pal.
L235955 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Coffee.
L235919 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get a good look. He was far away. But I saw him. I saw him as sure as you're standing there.
L235918 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ What'd he look like?
L235891 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Hell, yeah. I like it cold. Colder the better.
L235890 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ That's a good thing?
L235859 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Hell yeah.
L235858 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ That's what I call a payday.
L235857 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Two hundred twenty two kilograms of solid gold.
L235834 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Probably didn't have time.
L235833 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Then why didn't they take it.
L235831 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Cargo like this could make a crew think twice.
L235830 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ You mean, before she sank.
L235740 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ He'd let you off at the nearest port, that's for sure.
L235739 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Looks like one hell of a stick up his ass.
L235635 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Too big. More like a freighter.
L235634 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Could be a fishing boat.
L235603 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ I bet you did.
L235602 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
L235601 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
L235600 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Morning everybody.
L235545 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Maybe twenty gallons an hour.
L235544 +++$+++ u1088 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ GREER +++$+++ What's slow?
L236333 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ I wish I could believe that. Either way, you know what I've done. I've got no choice.
L236332 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ I don't give a damn about the gold.
L236331 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ I think maybe you been on this boat a little too long, with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's nothing supernatural about greed. And that's what it comes down to, pure and simple.
L236330 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ It's a trap. There was no way we were gonna get away with that gold. Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. This ship sucks people in and it never lets them out.
L236329 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ I know a little bit about human nature and what I've seen only confirms that.
L236328 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way.
L236327 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ I think I see it pretty well.
L236326 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
L236325 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ I didn't want it to turn out this way.
L236324 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
L236323 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ The way I figure it, it was them or me. I thought putting Dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a little time. Made it look like whoever killed those Greeks was still around. But it's just us on this ship. Us and your... spirit friends.
L236322 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ So you killed them?
L236321 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ It was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody.  You saw it coming as well as I did. Dodge had his plans, starting with scuttling the boat. And Greer too, except he went nuts. Couldn't take it, I guess. Could've happened in the middle of downtown Anchorage. But did it make him any less dangerous? I don't think so.
L236320 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ You killed them.
L236313 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Greer's gone. He broke out of the tank.
L236312 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one.
L236311 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ What?
L236310 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ We hit land.
L236309 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ What happened?
L236283 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ It's not the weather I'm worried about. The wrong current could drag us as far as the Aleutians before we come across another boat.
L236282 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ If the weather holds it might not be so bad.
L236281 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Hard to say which is worse, staying here or taking our chances in open water.
L236279 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not like him.
L236278 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ They went crazy.
L236277 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Maybe it was more than that.
L236276 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Over the gold.
L236275 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Could be a stroke. Who knows?  The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. "Like wild dogs."
L236274 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ What do you think?
L236256 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Leave him till we can get some help.  From now on, nobody comes down here.
L236255 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ What do we do with him?
L236243 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Right here.
L236242 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ Epps? You there?
L236236 +++$+++ u1089 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ MURPHY +++$+++ He's not on deck and I can't raise him on the radio.
L236235 +++$+++ u1087 +++$+++ m71 +++$+++ EPPS +++$+++ Nope.
