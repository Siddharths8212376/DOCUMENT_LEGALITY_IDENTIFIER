L641194 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Now?
L641193 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.
L641192 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Hear what?
L641191 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal.
L641190 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Yeah.
L641189 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ I'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety. Only deal is...you still got Micheal there?
L641188 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ What does that mean?
L641187 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Okay. Here's the deal and it's a good one. Lois is cool. It's a pacified situation.
L641153 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ You got a nasty side to your thought process.
L641152 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I don't know...
L641151 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ And what does that mean?  Are you insane?!  You think I would hurt Lois?! She's the mother of those kids! What is wrong with you?
L641150 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ What does that mean?
L641149 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Take care of business.
L641148 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ What are you going to do?
L641147 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Just do it.
L641146 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I don't think that's such a good idea.
L641145 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ After you drop the kids off, take Micheal home. Put a few drinks in him so he'll sleep.
L641117 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Suck my ass.
L641116 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Jesus Boyd you're going to O.D. him.
L641100 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ No, but she's definitely pissed and hostile. And she's clearly starting to think that's something's not right.
L641099 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile? Did she mention the police?
L641098 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Regarding what?
L641082 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ You want to know what you are doing here?! You are love pumping. You are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies. You are walking the walk. This is it Fisher, the real stuff. You love this woman. Love is second to nothing. I love you. I love Moore. I love Micheal. This car is full of love, and nothing - absolutely nothing - supersedes love, man. Nothing. We will do what it takes. Whatever it takes.
L641081 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ What's your point?
L641078 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Exactly! Exactly my point.
L641077 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I just want to get married.
L641076 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ What you just said. Say it again.
L641075 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ What?
L641074 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Say it again.
L641073 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I don't know! I just want to get married.
L641072 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Yes, you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done?
L641071 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I said, what have we done?
L641070 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ What is the question you asked me?
L641069 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ What?
L641068 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ What did you ask me?
L641067 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Boyd...What have we done?
L641066 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ He is not cracking up.
L641065 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ He's cracked up.
L641047 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ No easy Boyd! I got a best friend in there in pieces. How about a little sensitivity?
L641046 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Easy Boyd.
L640977 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ He's having a problem here.
L640976 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.
L640975 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Shut up Boyd.
L640974 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ OK. Definitely not cool! Definitely inappropriate behavior here.
L640972 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ No, the problem, as I recall, was the lack of blocking...
L640971 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ The problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left...
L640968 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ You always were a jealous man.
L640967 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Fisher had a less than normal relationship with that Donkey.
L640861 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? ...Right?
L640860 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ It goes; "Today is the first day of the rest of our lives."
L640830 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ No, this is the perfect time. This is real time. Adam. Your brother and I, as well as several others present, have always suspected that you...  ...are a fully repressed, living in major denial, locked down, fly-boy butt-fucker.
L640829 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Micheal, now is probably not the best time for this.
L640814 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Go ahead.
L640813 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I'm talking about prayer.
L640812 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ What kind of words?
L640811 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I think we should say some words over the grave.
L640810 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ That is a load of shit. Personal power has nothing to do with any of this. Tony Robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly, yes, but to give him credit for this, for all of this...Well that's just more than the man deserves.
L640774 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ So help me God you touch that phone and I bury you with them.  Surrender is no longer an option. I repeat - It is not an option. Is there anyone who does not understand that?
L640773 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I'm calling the police.
L640772 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ All right people. New plan. Not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan.
L640730 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Good God...Good God...
L640729 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Nobody knows she's here.
L640714 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ What's insane is the fact that Micheal here put a fucking girl's head through a toilet. That's insane.
L640713 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Oh God. This is insane.
L640710 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Nobody knows.
L640709 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Oh for Christsake Boyd. Somebody must know she's here.
L640692 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Well we can definitely call the police. That's an easy call. If we call the police...What happens?  They find a dead prostitute in the bathroom...They ask us...What happened? We say, ah...our friend, Micheal...  Your brother...got a little out of control...they were making love...and he got a little excited...and he, ah, sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet, while he choked her to death with a rubber hose...
L640691 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Fuck! Fuck you fucking guys!
L640671 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Shut up.
L640670 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Call 911.
L640669 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Shut up.
L640668 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ She's dead. Call somebody!
L640667 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ No.
L640666 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Oh, Jesus...call the police.
L640624 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I can't.
L640623 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ She's all your's Fish. Anything you want. Happy bachelor party.
L640534 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English...
L640533 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ We need padded chairs.
L640532 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars.
L640531 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ No, I'm holding for Tony. In chairs. Keith Fisher. Okay.
L640530 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Prison Communication Systems.  An acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in Denver that I just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large, exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in Colorado. Yes sir.
L640529 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Not really.  Yes, the Fisher wedding chairs...
L640522 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Who's up for making some real money?
L640521 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Tony? This is Keith Fisher. You're doing my wedding and I'm calling about the chair situation. Yeah, I'll hold.
L640511 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Well, I didn't mean it.
L640510 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ You said that Boyd.
L641202 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ I love you.
L641201 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Come on tough guy. Listen to me.  You are going to tell Lois that it was all an accident. Okay cowboy? You got me?
L641200 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ How about my Fatburger?
L641199 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Okay Micheal, let's go.  Upsy daisy big guy.
L641112 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Give me the Valium.
L641111 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ Goosed!
L641110 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Stop.
L641109 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ Goosed!
L641108 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Stop it!
L641102 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Micheal get a grip.  What did you tell her?
L641101 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ We're goosed! Goosed by God!
L641095 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ We're not goosed.
L641094 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ We're goosed.
L641055 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ He must take an open-field run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share. Before the clock runs out.
L641054 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Easy Micheal.
L641053 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ Franco Harris has a flare for the dramatic. The former Pittsburgh Steeler running back, beat known for "The Immaculate Reception," his improbable sixty yard Ricochet Reception. I say Ricochet Reception has made a bold move on corporate America.  Harris has lead a group of investors in the purchase of the Park Sausage Company. By taking on the challenge of resurrecting Park's, Harris is engaged in the equivalent of a sudden death overtime.
L641052 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ You want some breakfast meat. Micheal. Is that what you want?
L641051 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ Ball park sausages.
L641050 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ The need to know is clear. What did Adam tell Lois? That's the name of the game. What did Adam tell Lois? What does Lois know?
L641025 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ You will not screw this up.
L641024 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ This is going to stop right now. Right now!
L640902 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ No. I said nobody knew she was coming to the hotel.
L640901 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ You said nobody would miss her.
L640900 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Oh that's just nothing. That's just a missing persons thing, that's all.
L640777 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Not a problem. Understand not my words, but follow my orders. Follow my orders.
L640776 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ Not really, no.
L640775 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ A little gut check time fellas. A time for some serious self-exploration. How do I function? For real? No more bullshit. Can I keep my cool when they bounce my bananas? When they won't play my fucking song? etc, etc. Do you get me? Do you get me?
L640612 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ That's what I'm saying. Let the Israelis straighten it up. They got plenty of room down there, number one. Plus, and this is just a plus, they kind of look alike - the Jews and the Mexicans. So I think on a whole your average Joe Mexican is gonna have less of a problem getting his head around the whole assimilation thing. Am I right?
L640611 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ They need leadership.
L640610 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ The Mexicans would love it. They're dying for a little order down there. They need direction.
L640605 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Lock up the chickens, dig up the holy dirt, pack up the wailing crying wall thing they bang their heads on all day long, stick it all on a big fucking tug boat. The whole country picks up and takes Mexico.
L640604 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ What?
L640603 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Take Mexico.
L640602 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ What? What's your point?
L640601 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ There's my point exactly.
L640600 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ The Israelis can protect themselves. They got the Mossad thing happening. Mossad's for real, man. They scalp babies.
L640599 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time ...right? Am I right?
L640598 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ What's your point?
L640597 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot.
L640596 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something.
L640595 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Then what do they have?
L640594 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ Israel doesn't have a King.
L640593 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ If I'm the king of Israel, I say to myself, King, I say to myself, King... Take a good look around. What do I see?
L640587 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ New king.
L640586 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ And what happens when you can't?
L640585 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night.
L640584 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ You have a King fantasy.
L640583 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Not true.
L640582 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ True.
L640581 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ False.
L640580 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ You hate women.
L640579 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ I don't hate women.
L640540 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Oh really? Starbucks?
L640539 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ Your ideas never work out.
L640526 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ Moore?
L640525 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ Nope.
L640509 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ I never heard that.
L640508 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
L640507 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ The hell I did!
L640506 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ The hell you didn't!
L640505 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ The hell I did!
L640500 +++$+++ u8776 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ MICHEAL +++$+++ It's my fucking opinion.
L640499 +++$+++ u8770 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ BOYD +++$+++ You're a fucking moron.
L641296 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I do.
L641295 +++$+++ u8772 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ JUDGE TOWER +++$+++ These rings represent the commitment Fisher and Liz make to each other on the day. Fisher do you take Liz to be your beloved wife, to respect, honor and cherish till death do you part?
L641293 +++$+++ u8772 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ JUDGE TOWER +++$+++ The rings?
L641292 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ What?
L641291 +++$+++ u8772 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ JUDGE TOWER +++$+++ May we have the rings please?
L640876 +++$+++ u8772 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ JUDGE TOWER +++$+++ It's not a question of supposed to, it's an entirely personal decision... Some do some don't.
L640875 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Are we supposed to?
L640874 +++$+++ u8772 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ JUDGE TOWER +++$+++ All right then. It's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment. Will you have friends or family saying words - singing or anything?
L640873 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Yea...It's great...seems like...I don't know you've got all the important stuff in there.
L641324 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Do you love me? DO YOU LOVE ME?!
L641323 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ But...
L641322 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ You put him down or don't bother coming back.
L641321 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ No...
L641320 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ If you don't tie up all the loose ends it'll never be over.
L641319 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ What?
L641318 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ You and Moore move the bodies and bury Boyd with them. In fact, put Moore in the ground too.
L641317 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I...Liz...all I ever wanted, was for you to be happy. I just wanted to give you the wedding, the life you always dreamed of...  ...I just love you so much...So much...
L641313 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Move the bodies?
L641312 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Move the bodies.
L641311 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ So what do we do?
L641310 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ The only proof is those bodies.
L641309 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ I don't know. He could have told someone. He could have, like in the event of his death, somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried.
L641308 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ Like how?
L641307 +++$+++ u8771 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ FISHER +++$+++ Like if something happened to him, he could still get us.
L641306 +++$+++ u8773 +++$+++ m595 +++$+++ LIZ +++$+++ What does that mean?
