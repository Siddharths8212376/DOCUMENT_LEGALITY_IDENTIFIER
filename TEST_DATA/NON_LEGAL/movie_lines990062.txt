L335792 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ You told me what you could. I guess I'm through with your part of it.
L335791 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ Oh golly, oh just what I've always dreamed of, dirty phone calls.  How come?
L335790 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ You said you wanted these.
L335789 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ I thought you were going back to the apartment.
L335788 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ Well -- she's dead.
L335787 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.
L335786 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
L335785 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ It didn't go anywhere.  But that's not why --
L335784 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
L335783 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ No.
L335782 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ Did you like my friend Frankie?
L335759 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Is that what you gave him?
L335758 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ What did you expect? Frankie still has a good string, three girls. Figure three hundred a week from each.
L335756 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Well, let's go down and ask him.
L335755 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ He never told me.
L335754 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Do you know where he got the dumper?
L335753 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ You asked me where I got that date with the dumper -- Frank sent me on it.
L335752 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Maybe, if you tell me the things you haven't.
L335751 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ Can't you get him?
L335750 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ What do you think?
L335749 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ Well do you think it was him?
L335745 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ You go see agents -- or Equity calls, open casting calls. And ad agencies -- commercials -- you don't get work, you just go around.
L335744 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Rounds, what are they? -- don't watch me, keep talking.

L335742 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Tell me about acting -- what are you doing tomorrow -- where do you go?
L335739 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ I don't want you to look up. There's someone on the skylight.
L335738 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ You've changed your mind? You do want to play?
L335736 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ No thanks.
L335735 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ I thought you could trick me for those tapes. Don't you get lonely in that little green room? Or let me get you someone; I have terrific friends, wild.

L335733 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ What? This?

L335723 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ Klute, tell me, what's your bag? Are you a talker, or a button man or a doubler, or maybe you like them very young -- children -- or get your chest walked around with high-heeled shoes, or have us watch you tinkle? Or --
L335721 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ What about the old gentleman the other night, Mr. Faber?
L335720 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ Look, I'm sure this'll amuse you too. Ilia trying to get away from all that.
L335719 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ I have some names the police gave me. Frank Ligourin. Will you tell me what --
L335718 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ You're very square. Pimps don't get you dates, cookie; they just take the money.
L335717 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ How else do you meet them? Pimps? 
L335716 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ How would I remember?
L335715 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Is that how you met the Dumper? -- Someone else gave --
L335714 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ Most of them.
L335713 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Is that how you get most of your dates? Someone gives your name to someone else?
L335711 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ Look -- I'm sorry -- I've led everybody wrong. I mean yes, I get those feelings, but that's just me, that's just feelings.  I'm sure this will amuse you; I'm scared of the dark. And sometimes I get shook up, I hear people or -- well, I'll come out in the morning and think someone's been prying at my mailbox, or there's a little -- trash outside my door and I wonder if someone left it there for -- do you see? -- things other people wouldn't even notice. Well that's not real, it's just nerves; it's got nothing to do with --
L335710 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ What about the other things you've reported? --  -- being followed on the --
L335709 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ Just phone calls, right? They ring, you answer, they don't say anything, just blank. Kids getting kicks. Burglars looking for an empty apartment. I mean there is nothing that proves --
L335708 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Everything that's happened since Tom Grunemann disappeared. The phone calls and the --
L335707 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ What about everything since?
L335706 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ Well could I have them back now hon? -- those tape recordings you've got downstairs -- OK? -- and if you want you can have a good time and I'll have a good time and--
L335704 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ I can't say he was anybody!
L335703 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ But you can't say that Dumper was Tom Grunemann.
L335702 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ Nothing. Except he wasn't kidding. Usually it's a fakeout, you probably know. They pretend to tie you up, and you wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you --  Hell it's their money. I'll hang from the shower rod and whistle Maytime. Except this guy was really tripped out on it; he --
L335701 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ What?  What do you remember about that -- dumper?
L335700 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ You remind me of my uncle.
L335698 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ All right, yes, I had been. Those sick, wild letters -- I'm watching you, gonna follow you, gonna punish you, kill you et cetera. Well, they said, all right that's Grunemann. So try to remember when you and he - when -- well I don't know, there was that dumper once, he sounded like that dumper --  Dumpers; they get their kicks beating you up. A man hired me once, then tried to really kill me - that'd be about two years ago.
L335697 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ -- Tuscarora --
L335696 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ A name. Grunemann. Nothing. And they showed me pictures like this and they meant nothing. Then they asked me, well had I been getting letters, from someone out there in Cabbageville --
L335694 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ Isn't that sweet.  Well it could be any one of them bubi; I get to see them all.
L335693 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Company outing or picnic or something like that.
L335688 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ Or you'll get me shoved back in the brig you mean; another month with the bull-dykes.
L335687 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Could I ask some questions?
L335686 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ If I was taking calls full time would I be living in this kip? I'd be back on Park Avenue; I could support the whole National Guard!
L335685 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ No, I'm look --
L335684 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ Is it the shakedown hon? You picked a loser, I just don't have it.
L335624 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Mm.
L335623 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ And you just want to ask me a few questions?
L335622 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Mm.
L335621 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ You're not police or FBI; you're just a private investigator?
L335620 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ Dew yew hayuv ah-dentifikyshun?
L335619 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Will you let me ask you some questions?
L335618 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ Honest?
L335617 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ You know what I'm talking about. Miss Daniel.
L335616 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ Why?
L335615 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania. He disappeared from there last April. I've been hired to look for him.
L335614 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ Gee.
L335613 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some letters.
L335612 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ Who?
L335611 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ I'm an investigator. I'd like to ask you some questions about Tom Grunemann.
L335610 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ You said that.
L335609 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ My name's John Klute.
L335608 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ What about?
L335606 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Miss Daniel? My name is Klute -- John Klute --
L335605 +++$+++ u6204 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ BREE +++$+++ What is it?
L336171 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ Tomorrow. See you tomorrow night.
L336170 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Well --
L336169 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ No, I'd -- like to be in on it.
L336168 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Just send me a money order.
L336167 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ Suppose I meet you there a half hour before.
L336166 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Tomorrow evening, nine. East River Drive and 73rd Street.
L336165 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ I can talk it over; possibly I can get the money. When are you meeting the man?
L336162 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ All right, but I'm going to see that list.
L336161 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ Klute, the Company's interest is Tom Grunemann. Solely and exclusively. You say you can't find Tom; all right, I'll see that you're paid off; the case is closed.
L336160 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ It probably has the Dumper's name. It might give us some kind of new lead.  I want a look at it anyhow.
L336159 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ No. It's ridiculous. This has nothing to do with Tom Grunemann.
L336158 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Will the Company put up five hundred dollars to get Jane McKenna's list of clients?
L336157 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ I can't follow you.
L336156 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ I'm meeting a man tomorrow night. He wants to meet me on East-River Drive -- he wants five hundred dollars for the book. Can you get that for me Pete?
L336155 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ You were hired to look for Tom.
L336154 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Call-girls generally keep a book, you know, a list of their clients. Sometimes, if a girl retires, she'll even sell it worth good money. Jane McKenna had a black book; when she died it was stolen. I've been after it a long time.
L336153 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ What?
L336152 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book.
L336151 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
L336150 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Someone's been doing all these things.
L336149 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ You said he was no possible connection with Tom. The Page girl told you that, not Tom.
L336148 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.
L336147 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ That who?
L336146 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Not too bad. This brings back that Dumper in the picture.
L336145 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ You must be discouraged.
L336144 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ No. No mistake Pete. It doesn't prove who it was -- but proves it wasn't Tom.
L336143 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ Some mistake perhaps that --
L336142 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Not Tom. Whoever it was left a kind of souvenir, I told you, in her clothing. Semen. The laboratory got a blood group reading from that. The man was blood type 0; Tom was an AB.
L336141 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ It has to be Tom. You said he ripped up his own pictures, he --
L336140 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ It wasn't Tom that broke in the room.
L336139 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ I'm sorry. I don't understand.
L336138 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Yeah. It wasn't Tom.
L336137 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ You said Trask was arranging laboratory work. Police laboratory. Anything from that?
L336136 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Yeah, two things Pete, that --
L336135 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ I'm on my way to Chicago. Very important meeting tonight. Well -- any new developments?
L336134 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Yeah.
L336133 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ I've been up country, you know my summer place, my camp. I don't even have a telephone there. This morning they sent a messenger out, that you'd been trying to call me.
L336132 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Well as a matter of --
L336131 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ I read your report. I had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase, Tom being nowhere around --
L336130 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Well there's a couple --
L336129 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ Sorry we had to meet here. But I'm pressed for time.
L335931 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ I think you're homesick.  I'll be out at my camp over the weekend. Nice right now, that touch of fall in the air, that skim of frost in the early mornings, very peaceful.  John, I'll be back here again Thursday; I'll be in touch. Lieutenant, thank you.
L335930 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ How is it back there?
L335929 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ I'm flying back out to Pennsylvania Friday; I'll fill them in on things.
L335926 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ It's got to make sense some way.
L335925 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ You just finished telling me she had nothing to offer. Not Tom, you said, the Dumper was clearly not Tom.
L335924 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel.
L335923 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ Where, how?
L335922 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ I better keep looking.
L335921 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ Then, close the case.
L335920 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
L335919 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you?
L335916 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ I believed her, Pete.
L335915 +++$+++ u6205 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE +++$+++ She wouldn't be reliable anyhow -- a narcotics addict.
L336048 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Goodbye, Pete.
L336047 +++$+++ u6206 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE'S VOICE +++$+++ Thank you. Goodbye, John.
L336046 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ All right.
L336045 +++$+++ u6206 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE'S VOICE +++$+++ All right. All right --  John, just sit tight will you? I'll read your report, I'll discuss it with the others. I'll be back next Thursday, we'll talk the whole thing over then. Nothing til Thursday, all right?
L336044 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ I wanted to give it to you first.
L336043 +++$+++ u6206 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE'S VOICE +++$+++ Do they have the report? Have you discussed it with them?
L336042 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ It's in the report.
L336041 +++$+++ u6206 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE'S VOICE +++$+++ Have you discussed this with them?
L336040 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ No. They never did, really. But that's what I'm going to recommend. The next step. Unless something --
L336039 +++$+++ u6206 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE'S VOICE +++$+++ I'm sure the FBI and the Police explored that possibility.
L336036 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ I think Tom Grunemann's dead. I've been a lot of places - I've asked a lot of people. I've found no proof he's around. I've found no proof he was ever around.
L336035 +++$+++ u6206 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE'S VOICE +++$+++ What's in it?
L336034 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Would you like to know what's in it? The report.
L336033 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ It's not so bad.
L336032 +++$+++ u6206 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE'S VOICE +++$+++ It's a beautiful day in Tuscarora - I don't envy you that humidity in the city.
L336031 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ I'll be sending you on a report tonight.
L336030 +++$+++ u6206 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ CABLE'S VOICE +++$+++ John, how are you?
L335781 +++$+++ u6207 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Would I be telling you all this? She copped out long ago. She committed suicide Baxter.
L335780 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ I'd like to talk with Jane McKenna.
L335779 +++$+++ u6207 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You don't tell them. That one of their own in-laws laid a dumper on them?  Peace in the family.  Beyond that, I don't know. All she wrote.
L335778 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Why didn't you tell Bree, afterwards?
L335777 +++$+++ u6207 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ OK and one of them  Jane McKenna -- she blows a little jealous of Bree - you know? -- Bree comes first? And evidently she knew the freak --- that he was a dumper -- she conned me into passing him to Bree, you know, so Bree'd get hurt. I didn't know. Till afterwards.
L335776 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ She told me.
L335775 +++$+++ u6207 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ OK, a family matter. Between the girls. I had two other cows --  -- two other girls besides Bree.
L335774 +++$+++ u6207 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Look -- dad -- I may stand better with the cops than you.
L335773 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?
L335772 +++$+++ u6207 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Two years ago? Sorry.
L335771 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ I'm looking for a man. Tom Grunemann.  Bree thinks he may have been the dumper -- that call she had two years ago. She says you sent her on it.
L335770 +++$+++ u6207 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I'd like to make something clear. I don't go after a girl; a girl comes to me. Her choice. Right?
L335769 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ I've just got a few --
L335768 +++$+++ u6207 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I've always respected Bree.  I'd like to make something clear.
L335658 +++$+++ u6212 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ SPANGLER +++$+++ Oh sure they try. The idea of a better life.  But they don't really know much about life: They get confused -- or scared or frustrated or bored -- they pop back to the one thing they can handle. The trick. The trick. Men in bed. Not men in general, not life, not love, not even real sex -- it avoids all that. Just the trick, the transaction.
L335657 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ I think she's trying that.
L335656 +++$+++ u6212 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ SPANGLER +++$+++ No. She had every good intention of it -- coming to me as a private patient, getting out of the life, devoting herself to an acting career.
L335655 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Has she talked with you since prison?
L335654 +++$+++ u6212 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ SPANGLER +++$+++ About his letters -- that's all she remembered. Quite violent material, I'd say, obsessive, a quite sick man. But that's not unusual either.
L335653 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Did she talk about him to you?
L335652 +++$+++ u6212 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ SPANGLER +++$+++ Not unusual.
L335651 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it.
L335650 +++$+++ u6212 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ SPANGLER +++$+++ -- Usual case history -- this isn't a medical confidence, it's all of them -- broken family, lonely, confused, crummy childhood, early promiscuity, formal prostitution beginning in her teens, income twenty-five to thirty thousand a year.  Oh they don't keep the money: they get rid of it, they get pimps. Why?  Why do you want to know all this?
L336089 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ He called this morning from Tuscarora. Asked me to meet him at 3:00 at the downtown heliport. He's on his way to Chicago.
L336088 +++$+++ u6211 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Sounds to me you better shake him again. Put him in a spot he has to do something more -- but this time give him a time and a place to do it.
L336078 +++$+++ u6211 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ What about Grunemann's letters to the girl, everything like that?
L336077 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Because he knew I couldn't leave the case alone. And this way at least he'd keep track of it. And me.
L336076 +++$+++ u6211 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ But if Cable killed Grunemann why would he get you hired to look for Grunemann?
L335558 +++$+++ u6211 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Examine this letter please.  We recovered that from the shredder -- the plant disposal and incinerator system. Grunemann apparently typed it Friday, before he left, decided not to send it, tossed it away. We've already contacted the New York Police; they think they know the girl in question.
L335557 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ No.
L335556 +++$+++ u6211 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in New York?
L335555 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ Everybody's got some, I guess.
L335554 +++$+++ u6211 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Marital problems in general? Indicates possibly -- am I right Sergeant?
L335553 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ No.
L335552 +++$+++ u6211 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed?  -- indicates no -- Did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? Indicates no. Moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? --
L335551 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ No.
L335550 +++$+++ u6211 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ Can you account for his disappearance in any way?
L335549 +++$+++ u6208 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ KLUTE +++$+++ We grew up together. Kids.
L335548 +++$+++ u6211 +++$+++ m415 +++$+++ ROSS +++$+++ You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann. How well?
