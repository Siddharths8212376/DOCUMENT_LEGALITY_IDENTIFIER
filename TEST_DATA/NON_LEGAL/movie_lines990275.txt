L489916 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ He wouldn't just turn himself in.  It doesn't make any sense.
L489915 +++$+++ u7518 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ You don't.  It goes to court now.
L489912 +++$+++ u7518 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ So far it's all dead ends.  No credit history.  No employment history.  His bank account's only five years old and it started as cash.  We're even trying to trace his furniture, but for now all we know is he's independently wealth, well educated and totally insane.  We may never know how he got that way.
L489911 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ What about the trace on his bank account and the guns?  There must be something to connect him with a past.
L489910 +++$+++ u7518 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ He cuts off the skin if his fingertips. That's why we can't find a single usable print in the apartment.  He's been doing it for quite a while.  Keeps cutting before the papillary line can grow back.
L489333 +++$+++ u7518 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ Go start picking up the pieces.  We'll shuffle some paper and try to get you a new partner.
L489332 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Thank you.
L489331 +++$+++ u7518 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ That's not necessary.  You're in.
L489328 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ There's nothing that says I have to work with him.  If Somerset wants out, "goodbye."  Give it to me.
L489327 +++$+++ u7518 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ How's that?
L489326 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Give it to me.
L489325 +++$+++ u7518 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ I don't have anyone else to give this to, Somerset, you know that.  And nobody's going to swap with you.
L490105 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ I'll see you.
L490104 +++$+++ u7518 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ I guess... decide for yourself.  I don't know what it says.  I'm going to go.
L490103 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ I read about it in the paper.
L490102 +++$+++ u7518 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ He's being arraigned tomorrow.
L490099 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ It would be too hard.
L490098 +++$+++ u7518 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ They're hoping you stop and say goodbye before you go, but I told them not to expect it.
L490097 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Yeah, that's true.
L490096 +++$+++ u7518 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ We figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.
L490095 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Thank you.  Tell them, thank you.
L490093 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ I can breathe withour pain now, so I guess I feel great.
L490092 +++$+++ u7518 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ How you feeling?
L489918 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ He's not finished.
L489917 +++$+++ u7518 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ Well, there he sits.  It's not supposed to make sense.
L489357 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Really?
L489356 +++$+++ u7518 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ It's always been like this.
L489355 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ I have no understanding of this place anymore.
L489354 +++$+++ u7518 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ I heard.
L489353 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Did you read in the paper today, about the man who was walking his dog?  he was attacked, and his wallet and his watch were taken.  And then, while he was still lying unconscious, his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes.  It happened four blocks from here.
L489352 +++$+++ u7518 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ You know.
L489351 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L489350 +++$+++ u7518 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ Can't you feel it yet?  Can't you feel that feeling... ?  You're not going to be a cop anymore.
L489349 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house.
L489348 +++$+++ u7518 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ Come on.  What are you going to do with yourself out there?
L489347 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Good.
L489346 +++$+++ u7518 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ Yeah.
L489345 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ I'm sure everyone's doing their best.
L489344 +++$+++ u7518 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ I thought you might want to be filled in.
L489343 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ It's none of my business anymore.
L489342 +++$+++ u7518 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ Greed.  It was written in blood.
L489341 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Already.
L489340 +++$+++ u7518 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ There was a second.
L489339 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ No, I haven't heard.
L489338 +++$+++ u7518 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ Have you heard?
L489323 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Everything else was taken as close to conclusion as humanly possible.  Also... this shouldn't be his first assignment.
L489322 +++$+++ u7518 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ You've left unfinished business before.
L489321 +++$+++ u7518 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ I know what you're thinking, okay?  You don't want to get in bed with this every night, but it's different now.  You're retiring.  In six days you're all the way gone.
L489320 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ This can't be my last duty here.  It will go on and on.
L489319 +++$+++ u7518 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ What's this: "I'm declining this case?"  It don't work that way.
L489313 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ One is gluttony.
L489312 +++$+++ u7518 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins.  But, this was a fat guy.  The killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. And, writing on the walls happens all the time.  It's like the fashionable thing to do.
L489311 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ ... envy, sloth, pride and lust.  Seven.
L489310 +++$+++ u7518 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ So what?  This victim...
L489309 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ There are seven deadly sins.  Gluttony, wrath, greed...
L489308 +++$+++ u7518 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ CAPTAIN +++$+++ Announcing what?
L489307 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ "Dear Detectives, Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light." It's the murderer's way of announcing himself.
L489843 +++$+++ u7519 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ CRAZED MAN +++$+++ He had a gun.  He had a gun... and he made it happen.  He made me do it!  He made me put that... that thing on.  Oh, Christ!  He made me wear it... and... and he told me to fuck her.  He had the gun in my mouth.
L489842 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Who tied her down?  You or him?
L489841 +++$+++ u7519 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ CRAZED MAN +++$+++ She was... she was on the bed.  She was just sitting on the bed.
L489840 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Where was the prostitute?  Where was she?
L489839 +++$+++ u7519 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ CRAZED MAN +++$+++ What?  What?
L489838 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Where was the girl?
L489837 +++$+++ u7519 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ CRAZED MAN +++$+++ And... and... and he said... he asked me if I was married.  And, I could see he had a gun in his hand.
L490045 +++$+++ u7520 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ DELIVERYMAN +++$+++ Okay...
L490044 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Put it down.  Put it on the ground.
L490043 +++$+++ u7520 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ DELIVERYMAN +++$+++ This guy paid me five hundred bucks to bring it out here.  He wanted it here at exactly seven o'clock.
L490037 +++$+++ u7520 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ DELIVERYMAN +++$+++ I'm... I'm just delivering a package.
L490036 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Who are you?  What are you doing out here?
L490035 +++$+++ u7520 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ DELIVERYMAN +++$+++ What the hell's going on?
L490034 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Turn around.  Hands on your head!
L490033 +++$+++ u7520 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ DELIVERYMAN +++$+++ Jesus Christ, man, don't shoot me!
L490090 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ NO!
L490089 +++$+++ u7521 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ JOHN DOE +++$+++ You didn't know.
L490074 +++$+++ u7521 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ JOHN DOE +++$+++ Her pretty head.
L490073 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Give me the gun.
L490071 +++$+++ u7521 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ JOHN DOE +++$+++ I visited your home this morning, after you left.
L490070 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ David... please...
L490069 +++$+++ u7521 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ JOHN DOE +++$+++ It's surprising how easily a member of the press can purchase information from the men in your precinct.
L490018 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Why?
L490017 +++$+++ u7521 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ JOHN DOE +++$+++ What time is it?
L489988 +++$+++ u7521 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ JOHN DOE +++$+++ It's not too far away now.
L489987 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ What's so exciting?
L489970 +++$+++ u7521 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ JOHN DOE +++$+++ It doesn't matter who I am.  Who I am means absolutely nothing.  You need to turn left here... at the traffic light.
L489969 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ I mean, at this point, what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself?
L489968 +++$+++ u7521 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ JOHN DOE +++$+++ What do you mean?
L489907 +++$+++ u7521 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ JOHN DOE +++$+++ Hello.
L489906 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ I don't believe it.
L490076 +++$+++ u7521 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ JOHN DOE +++$+++ Because I envy your normal life.  Envy is my sin.
L490075 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Somerset...
L490061 +++$+++ u7521 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ JOHN DOE +++$+++ I want you to know, I wish I could have lived like you do.
L490060 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ What the fuck is going on?
L490059 +++$+++ u7521 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ JOHN DOE +++$+++ Here he comes.
L490056 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Shut up!
L490055 +++$+++ u7521 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ JOHN DOE +++$+++ You've made a good life for yourself...
L490050 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ What the fuck is going on here?!
L490049 +++$+++ u7521 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ JOHN DOE +++$+++ I wish I could have been a normal man like you.  I wish I could have a simple life.
L490021 +++$+++ u7521 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ JOHN DOE +++$+++ It's close.
L490020 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Just keep leading the way.
L490007 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Sit back.
L490006 +++$+++ u7521 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ JOHN DOE +++$+++ And, I remember breaking your nose.  You're only alive because I didn't kill you.
L490005 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ I seem to remember knocking on your door.
L490004 +++$+++ u7521 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ JOHN DOE +++$+++ Tell me what it was that gave me away. What was the piece of evidence you were going to use against me right before I walked up to YOU and put my hands in the air.
L490003 +++$+++ u7521 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ JOHN DOE +++$+++ Really?  Just biding your time, then? Toying with me.  Is that it?  Letting five people die until you finally felt like going out and hauling me in?
L490002 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ We would have gotten you eventually.
L490001 +++$+++ u7521 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ JOHN DOE +++$+++ You're going to be remembered, and it's all because of me.  And, the only reason I'm here right now is because I wanted to be.
L490000 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ And, why is that?
L489999 +++$+++ u7521 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ JOHN DOE +++$+++ You should be thanking me.
L489998 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Delusions of grandeur.
L489997 +++$+++ u7521 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ JOHN DOE +++$+++ A woman... so ugly on the inside that she couldn't bare to go on living if she couldn't be beautiful on the outside.  A drug dealer... a drug dealing pederast, actually.  And, don't forget the disease spreading whore.  Only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face.  That's the point.  You see a deadly sin on almost every street corner, and in every home, literally.  And we tolerate it. Because it's common, it seems trivial, and we tolerate, all day long, morning, noon and night.  Not anymore.  I'm setting the example, and it's going to be puzzled over and studied and followed, from now on.
L489996 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Murderers like you?
L489995 +++$+++ u7521 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ JOHN DOE +++$+++ A woman...
L489994 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Murderers?
L489993 +++$+++ u7521 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ JOHN DOE +++$+++ Innocent?  Is that supposed to be funny? Look at the people I killed.  An obese man, a disgusting man who could barely stand up... who if you saw him on the street, you'd point so your friends could mock him along with you.  Who if you saw him while you were eating, you wouldn't be able to finish  your meal.  After him I picked the lawyer.  And, you both must have been secretly thanking me for that one.  This was a man who dedicated his life to making money by lying with every breath he could muster... to keeping rapists and murderers on the streets.
L489992 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ You only killed a bunch of innocent people so you could get your rocks off.  That's all.
L489991 +++$+++ u7521 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ JOHN DOE +++$+++ You wouldn't because you know there are consequences.  It's in those eyes of yours, though... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work.  I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner.  I only took their sins to logical conclusions.
L489990 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Now... I wouldn't do something like that, Johnny.  I like you.  I like you a lot.
L489989 +++$+++ u7521 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ JOHN DOE +++$+++ I... I doubt I enjoyed it any more than... Detective Mills would enjoy some time alone with me in a room without windows.  Isn't that true?  How happy would it make you to hurt me, with impunity?
L489985 +++$+++ u7521 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ JOHN DOE +++$+++ Oh, don't worry. You won't...
L489984 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Well, I'll be standing beside you the whole time, so you be sure to let me know when this whole, complete reality thing is done.  Wouldn't want to miss it.
L489983 +++$+++ u7521 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ JOHN DOE +++$+++ I can't wait for you to see.  I can't wait...  It's really going to be something.
L489982 +++$+++ u7521 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ JOHN DOE +++$+++ It's going to be flawless.  People will barely be able to comprehend it.  It will seem almost surreal... but it will have a tangible reality, so they won't be able to deny it.
L489981 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Spit it out.
L489980 +++$+++ u7521 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ JOHN DOE +++$+++ You can't see the whole... the whole complete act yet.  Not yet.  But, when this is done, it's going to be... so... so...
L489979 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ In two months, no one's going to even remember this happened.
L489978 +++$+++ u7521 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ JOHN DOE +++$+++ You know that's not true.
L489977 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ I hate to burst your bubble, but other than the fact that you're especially sadistic, there's nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours.
L489976 +++$+++ u7521 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ JOHN DOE +++$+++ Not me.  I'm not special.  I'm not exceptional.  This is, though.  What I'm doing.
L489975 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ What makes you so special that people should pay attention?
L489974 +++$+++ u7521 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ JOHN DOE +++$+++ Wanting people to pay attention, you can't just tap them on the shoulder.  You have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer. Then, you have their strict attention.
L489973 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ We're not just going to pick up two more bodies, are we, Johnny?  That wouldn't be... shocking enough.  Wouldn't keep you on the front page of the newspapers.
L489972 +++$+++ u7521 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ JOHN DOE +++$+++ You'll see.
L489971 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Where we headed?
L490082 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Put the gun down, Somerset!
L490081 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Don't do this... please...
L490080 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Put your gun down!!
L490079 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ I can't let you do this...
L490078 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Tell me it's not true.
L490068 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ What did you say?
L490067 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Throw your weapon, detective!  Now!
L490065 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ What are you talking about?  What happened?
L490064 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Throw your gun down now!
L490025 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ There's no time to discuss it!
L490024 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Wait!
L490023 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Stay with him.
L489963 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Give me a break.
L489962 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Kiss me on the lips.
L489961 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Slut.
L489960 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Well, I have to tell you...  I think I've fallen in love with you.
L489959 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ What is it?
L489955 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ I will.
L489954 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ If John Doe's head splits open and a U.F.O. flies out, I want you to have expected it.
L489926 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ I can tell you this.  I recognize his lawyer.  His name's Mark Swarr.
L489925 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ No.
L489924 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ He's only two murders away from finishing his masterpiece, right?  Can you even conceive of what's going to happen next?  I mean, can you even imagine how he'll try to finish it?
L489923 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Well... what the fuck, man?
L489922 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ You and I are, probably for the first time ever, in total agreement.  He wouldn't just stop.
L489921 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ You know he's fucking us.
L489914 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ When do we get to question him?
L489913 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Because he is John Doe, by choice.
L489894 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Big surprise.
L489893 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ As soon as this is over, I'm gone.
L489892 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ No, actually, I wasn't sure at all.
L489891 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ You knew I'd say yes.
L489890 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ I'm requesting you keep me on as your partner a few more days.  You'd be doing me the favor.
L489889 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ You think you're doing me a big favor by staying?
L489888 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ One of two things will happen.  We're either going to get John Doe, or he'll finish his series of seven, and this case will go on for years.
L489887 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Oh, you want to stay now?
L489884 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Call for help, and you'll live.  But, you'll be disfigured.  Or, put yourself out of your misery.
L489883 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ He cut her up and dressed the wounds.
L489875 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ That part of me is dead.
L489874 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Listen to yourself.  You say, "the problem with people is they don't care, so I don't care about people."  But, you're already here.  You've been here a long time.  So, there's a part of you that knows, even if everything you say is true, none of it matters.
L489873 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ No I'm not!  I'm talking about common, everyday life here.  If you let yourself worry about one thing, you'll worry about the next, and the next, and it never ends. In this place, ignorance isn't just bliss, it's a matter of survival.
L489872 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ You're talking about people who are mentally ill.  You're...
L489871 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Wrong!  I sympathize completely, because if you can't win... then, if you don't ignore everything and everyone around you, you... you become like John Doe.  It's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it, because it takes so much work to love.  You just have to make sure you don't stop to think about the abuse, and the damage, because you'll risk being sad.  Keep ignoring.
L489870 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Oh, you're so much better than everyone, right?  No one's worthy of you.
L489869 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ It wasn't one thing, if that's what you mean.  I just... I can't live here anymore. I can't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue.
L489868 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ What the fuck is wrong with you?  What burnt you out?
L489867 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ People don't want a champion.  They just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers.
L489866 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ You think you're preparing me for the hard times ahead?  You think you're toughening me up?  Well, you're not!  You're quitting, fine... but I'm staying.
L489865 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Why don't you shut the fuck up for a while? You bitch and complain... if I thought like you, I would have slit my wrist already.
L489864 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Just know that in this case there's not going to be any satisfaction.  If we caught John Doe and he were the devil himself, if it turned out he were actually Satan, then, that might live up to our expectations.  No human being could do these things, right? But, this is not the devil.  It's just a man.
L489863 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ You follow the law and do the best you can. It's all there.
L489862 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Where's the victory?
L489861 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ You do your job...
L489860 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ You tell me, then... you walk into an apartment, and a man has beaten his wife to death, or the wife murdered the husband, and you have to wash the blood off their children.  You put the killer in jail.  Who won?
L489859 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ You're the oldest man I know, Somerset.
L489858 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind.  There's no winning and losing here.
L489857 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ How can you say that?  Especially after today?
L489856 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ No.  Face it now.  Stop thinking it's good guys against bad guys.
L489855 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ If we get him, I'll be happy enough.
L489854 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ You know... there's not going to be a happy ending to this.  It's not possible anymore.
L489853 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ One birthday he gave me this brand new hardcover book, "The Century of the Detective," by Jurgen Thorwald.  It traced the history of deduction as a science, and it sealed my fate, because it was real, not fiction.  And, that a drop of blood or a piece of hair could solve a crime... it was incredible to me.
L489852 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Sounds like a father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps.
L489851 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ The irony is, after a day of the type of work he did, he'd come home and read me these morbid crime stories.  Murders in the Rue Morgue.  Le Fanu's Green Tea.  My mother would give him hell because he was keeping me up till all hours.
L489772 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ These murders are his masterwork.  His sermon to all of us.  To all us sinners.
L489771 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ He's preaching.
L489766 +++$+++ u7522 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ MILLS +++$+++ Looking around... I've got a bad feeling these murders are his life's work.
L489765 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ No dates indicated, placed on the shelves in no discernible order.  It's just his mind poured out on paper.  I don't think it's going to give us any specifics.
L489763 +++$+++ u7524 +++$+++ m508 +++$+++ SOMERSET +++$+++ "What sick, ridiculous, puppets we are, and what a gross, little stage we dance on. What fun we have, dancing and fucking, not a care in the world.  Not knowing that we are nothing.  We are not what was intended."
