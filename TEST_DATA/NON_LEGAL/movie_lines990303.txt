L513263 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean I don't love her.
L513262 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ They ort to. You're a good boy.
L513261 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they're home. Reckon why they don't like me?
L513260 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I bet he will. I got a little money if he don't. I'll get 'em for ye.
L513259 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I ain't got no money to get 'em with but I bet Vaughan will let me have some of them flowers at the store.
L513258 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ If you want me to.
L513257 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Would you go see her with me? I kind of thought I might take her some flowers like that woman done you.
L513256 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Yeah, I recollect it.
L513255 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You know that girl I told you about. The one I love.
L513254 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ All right then.
L513253 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I was wantin' to ask you somethin'.
L513252 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Hit was right thoughty of her.
L513251 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Yeah, me too.  That was nice of that woman to give you them flowers.
L513250 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Yeah, I reckon they did. Hit like to tore me up when I read about that pore little cripple boy.
L513249 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Boy, folks sure had it rough back a long time ago, didn't they?
L513248 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ All right then.
L513247 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I'm gettin' tired of readin' for a while.
L513246 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Yeah.
L513245 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You want to go with me?
L513244 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ That's than un on Christmas I was tellin' you about.
L513243 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It's name's A Christmas Carol.
L513242 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Naw. You can look at all my books you want to.
L513241 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I was goin' to the secret place. I borried one of your books to take down there. You ain't mad, are you?
L513240 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ That gal that made employee of the month give 'em to me for awalkin' with her.
L513239 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Where'd you get them flowers?
L513238 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Yeah.
L513237 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Hey Karl, you off work?
L512998 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I like the way you talk.
L512997 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I like the way you talk.
L512996 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I reckon it tastes pretty good to me.
L512995 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I don't see how you can eat that stuff with all those insides it's made out of.
L512994 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I reckon if you want me to.  I got some of that potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some.
L512993 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Will you stay here with us for a long time?
L512992 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ He ort not to talk that away to you neither. He ain't no count. He's mean to you and your mama.  Yore mama and that feller that's carryin' me to get somethin' d'eat's gonna be back here directly.
L512991 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Well, I hate him.
L512990 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ You ort not to talk that way. You're just a boy.
L512989 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I'd like to kill that son of a bitch. I hate him.
L512916 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It's okay if you're lookin' out for yourself. If it's self-defense. Was it self-defense?
L512915 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I growed up and got taught it ain't right to kill nobody.
L512914 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Maybe they needed it.
L512913 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I thought they was.
L512912 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Were they bad people?
L512911 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Two people.
L512910 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Who did you kill?
L512909 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Yeah, I did.
L512908 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ 'Cause he didn't have enough money to take care of us the way he wanted to. That's what the letter said. He got laid off from work and had to just work odd jobs. I thought he took care of us fine.  Karl, did you really kill somebody?
L512907 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Why did he do that, reckon.
L512906 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ It ain't the truth. He shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose.
L512905 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Yeah, I remember you a-tellin' me that.
L512904 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Karl.  You know when I said daddy got hit by a train.
L512903 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ She says it's for the times when he's good to her. She's lonely since daddy died. She said sometimes she don't know why.  He threatened to kill her if she ever left him. My daddy would kill him if he was here and somebody was mean to mama. Vaughan, he's real good to mama. Vaughan that you met. But he's not able to do anything to Doyle, he's funny you know. Not funny ha, ha, funny queer. He likes to go with men instead of women. That makes him not to be able to fight too good. He sure is nice though. He's from St. Louis. People who are queer can get along better in a big town. He got transferred here to work. But mama said the real reason he left is 'cause his daddy hated him. For bein' the way he is. I wish he liked to go with women. I'd rather him be mama's boyfriend than Doyle.
L512902 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ How come her to keep bein' girlfriends and all with him if he's mean to her?
L512901 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I've had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died. Sometimes I wish I was still real little and he was still here. My mama's real good, but I wish I had both of 'em.  When we went to Memphis one time in the car, it was rainin' so hard we couldn't see the road. But I wadn't scared because I thought as long as daddy was drivin' nothin' could happen to us. I feel that way about mama now.  Mama has a boyfriend now. His name is Doyle Hargraves. He works construction so he makes a pretty good livin'. He still don't help mama out with any money though. He ain't no good. He's mean to her. He don't like me at all. Mama says it's because he's jealous I belong to my daddy instead of him. He stays with us all night sometimes, but he's got his own house. Somebody told me it's so he can still have other girlfriends. I like it on the nights when he ain't at our house. I'm not so nervous then.
L512900 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ You don't need to know all of that. You're just a boy. You need to think about good thoughts while you're still a boy. They'll be plenty of time for the other.
L512899 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ How did your mama die?
L512898 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ He never did want to. I figure he ain't changed his mind much.
L512897 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ How do you know?
L512896 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ My mother's dead. My daddy's s'posed to be around still. He don't want to have nothin' to do with me though.
L512895 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ They still around, your folks?
L512894 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Naw. Didn't have too much. Enough to scrape by on, I reckon.
L512893 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ This is what I call my secret place 'cause I come out here when I feel like bein' by myself. I used to come here with Karen Cross. She's kind of like my girlfriend, or used to be. She says she likes Jerry Maroney now. But I'm gonna get her back 'cause I love her. We used to come here and hold hands and talk and read books to each other with a flashlight. She didn't want to have anything to do with me in front of other people 'cause I don't have any money. Well, mama and me, I mean. She seemed to like me a whole lot when we were out here though. She said she loved me, too. Out here. Settin' right on that stump you're on. See, her daddy's a dentist so they're rich. So's Jerry Maroney's daddy. He owns the ice plant. Was your folks well off?
L512855 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ They sell some of everything. Come on let's go. I won't tell her about you bein' in the state hospital for killin'.
L512854 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I was kindly needin' to do some tradin'. Reckon they sell toothpaste?
L512853 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's real nice. She'll give us somethin' if we ask her to. Candy or somethin'.
L512852 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I don't want to worry your mama with company.
L512851 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Wait a minute. You want to go with me? You can meet my mama.
L512850 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ All right then.
L512849 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Well, anyhow, I was just fixin' to go see my mama down at Ben's Dollar Store. She's workin' two till eight.
L512848 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I ain't no good at it. I just come by.
L512847 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Did you want to play ball with us?
L512846 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ You told me to come by.
L512845 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Yeah. What you doin' by here?
L512844 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Yeah it is. Your name's Frank.
L512843 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Hey there. I thought I heard somebody on the porch. Wasn't your name Karl?
L512755 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Me and the Burnett twins and some boys plays down at the junior high practice field all the time. If you ever want to come by and play. We ain't no good either. Well, I'll see you later.
L512754 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I never was much count at it. I never did get picked out fer it.
L512753 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Do you like to play football?
L512751 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You don't seem like you'd kill nobody.
L512750 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I reckon I feel all right.
L512749 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Are you well?
L512748 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ They told me I was well. They had to turn me loose.
L512747 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ How come?
L512746 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Yeah.
L512745 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ They let you out?
L512744 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I killed some folks quite awhile back. They said I wadn't right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous hospital instead of puttin' me in jail.
L512743 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Why'd you live there?
L512742 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I did live there in the state hospital.
L512741 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Don't you live somewhere?
L512740 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Ain't got nowhere to set 'em down.
L512739 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ How come you're carryin' them around with you.
L512738 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Different ones. One's the Bible. One of 'ems a book on Christmas. One of 'ems how to be a carpenter.
L512737 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What are all them books?
L512736 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Childers.
L512735 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ What's you last name?
L513329 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ We've had a real hard life, too, Mama.
L513328 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I know honey. Just remember what I said, we'll bide our time. You just steer clear of him as much as you can. Doyle's had a real hard life. It's just about run him crazy I think.
L513327 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ He's lyin' Mama. He ain't gonna do better.
L513326 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Well, at least he's tryin'. But who knows for how long.
L513140 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I love you, too, Mama.
L513139 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I promise we're gonna get away from him. The time has to be right, that's all. I'd rather him get tired of me and leave me. Then he wouldn't want to hurt me. He wouldn't care then. We'll be fine. I promise. You go to bed now.  I love you.
L513138 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Doyle wouldn't really kill you, would he?
L513137 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Yeah, honey, someday everything's gonna be all right.
L513136 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Is everything gonna be all right someday? I just stay nervous all the time just about.
L513135 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Huh?
L513134 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Mama?
L513133 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I know he does.
L513132 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I bet he don't. Karl likes me.
L513131 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I guess. He went to the garage. Poor thing, he's probably never seen such a crazy mess. He probably wants to go back and live in Mr. Cox's shop.
L513130 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Did Karl go to bed?
L513129 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while. I do too.
L513128 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Did Vaughan go home?
L513127 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ What are you doin' up again, Frank? You need to get a little sleep.
L513125 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ No, honey, we don't.  I'll make some coffee and start cleanin' up this mess. Karl, you want some coffee, huh?
L513124 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?
L513123 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.
L513122 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ You all right, Mama?
L513033 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ He ain't ever okay to me.
L513032 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ He's no more an Indian than I am though. Anyhow, Doyle's gonna try and tease you and be mean to you to show off to his friends. Just like he does to Frank and me sometimes. You just ignore it. Or stay out here away from 'em if he'll let you. He's an okay guy till he gets drunk but tonight he'll get drunk. I guarantee it.
L513031 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ They ain't even no good. The only one can play is Randy Horsefeathers. He claims he's an Indian. His real name's Randy Collins and he works at the feed mill. He can at least play guitar.
L513030 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Karl, now listen, there's gonna be a party tonight here at the house. Doyle's invited his music-playin' buddies over to make a bunch of racket out on the patio.
L513018 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ I'm glad of it, honey.
L513017 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I sure like the way he talks. It sounds like a race car motor idlin'. It makes me not be nervous.
L513012 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ I don't know. He just said he'd eat out there.
L513011 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ How come Karl won't eat here with us?
L512963 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Naw, I don't want to. Me and Karl got things we need to do.
L512962 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Maybe you and Karl want to go with us?
L512881 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Frank told me about your situation. And Frank loves company. You know, especially after his daddy passed and all. There ain't no sense in you stayin' in that old greasy shop.  He's mentally retarded, poor thing.
L512880 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Hey Karl, guess what. Mama said you can stay with us. Out in the garage. Our car won't fit in there anyway. It's real neat.
L512865 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Nice to meet you, Karl.
L512864 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Oh, that's Karl. I met him at the laundrymat. Karl, this is my mama. And Vaughan, Vaughan's the manager. He lets mama off any time she feels like it 'cause they're best friends.
L512857 +++$+++ u7667 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ LINDA +++$+++ Hey, sweetheart. What you up to?
L512856 +++$+++ u7663 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ FRANK +++$+++ Hey, Mama. Hey, Vaughan.
L513236 +++$+++ u7669 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ MELINDA +++$+++ Me, too.
L513235 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that.
L513234 +++$+++ u7669 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ MELINDA +++$+++ Yeah.
L513233 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ A blister shore can hurt.
L513225 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I ain't really thought about it too much I don't reckon.
L513224 +++$+++ u7669 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ MELINDA +++$+++ These is the worst shoes I own for walkin'. How far did you want to go?
L513223 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I reckon.
L513222 +++$+++ u7669 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ MELINDA +++$+++ You walk fast, don't you?
L513205 +++$+++ u7669 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ MELINDA +++$+++ I stay on my feet all the time at work. I just can't find shoes that's comfortable.
L513204 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I like walkin' quite a bit from time to time.
L513200 +++$+++ u7669 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ MELINDA +++$+++ Well, when you like pricing items as much as I do, I guess it's just bound to happen sooner or later.
L513199 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Yes ma'am, I reckon.
L513371 +++$+++ u7670 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ I told you, I ain't got no boy, now get on out from here and let me be.
L513370 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ That grass out in the yard's all growed up. I figured I might cut it fer ye.
L513368 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ They turned me aloose from the nervous hospital. Said I was well.
L513367 +++$+++ u7670 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ I ain't got no boy.
L513366 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.
L513365 +++$+++ u7670 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ OLD MAN +++$+++ I ain't got no boy.

L513184 +++$+++ u7674 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ WOOLRIDGE +++$+++ I knew you'd do all right. Well, I just wanted to check on you. I'll say bye to Bill and get on back.
L513183 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ That boy, he's my friend. He likes the way I talk and I like the way he talks.

L513181 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I told 'em about it. They know I'm well. That Mizz Wheatley made me some biscuits.

L512798 +++$+++ u7674 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ WOOLRIDGE +++$+++ Well, I guess we better hit the road.
L512797 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Yes sir.
L512796 +++$+++ u7674 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ WOOLRIDGE +++$+++ Didn't you go to sleep at all, Karl? You been sittin' there like that all night?

L512779 +++$+++ u7674 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ WOOLRIDGE +++$+++ She's talkin' about me, Karl. That's my first name.
L512774 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I reckon I can just walk around till the mornin'. Or set and read me a book somewhere.
L512773 +++$+++ u7674 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ WOOLRIDGE +++$+++ No, I mean your past. About why you were in here.  I'll take you first thing in the mornin'. You have anyplace you can stay tonight at all? I just can't let you stay here. It's the rules. If something happened well, I'd be liable.
L512772 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I never was no good with history.
L512771 +++$+++ u7674 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ WOOLRIDGE +++$+++ I can't promise he'll hire you. I'll have to tell him about your history.

L512769 +++$+++ u7674 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ WOOLRIDGE +++$+++ I know, I've seen it myself. Would you give that a try?

L512767 +++$+++ u7674 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ WOOLRIDGE +++$+++ Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do. If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here if that's what you wanted. I'm just doin' my job.  You follow me?  Listen, I know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in Millsburg. He used to go to church with me. You're good workin' on small engines and things. If I put my neck out for you with him, will you work at it if he'll hire you?
L512766 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Naw. Never did know too much of nobody. Not to he'p me out anyway.
L512765 +++$+++ u7674 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ WOOLRIDGE +++$+++ Your daddy's still livin' down there from what you told me.  I guess he wouldn't help you any, would he? I wasn't thinking. You don't know anybody?
L512764 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ Naw.
L512763 +++$+++ u7674 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ WOOLRIDGE +++$+++ Well, you have to learn. It'll take some time. Don't you know anybody down there to help you out?
L512762 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I reckon I don't care nothin' about bein' a free man. I don't know how to go about it.
L512761 +++$+++ u7674 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ WOOLRIDGE +++$+++ Well, you can't do that. You're a free man. You've been let out to do as you please.
L512760 +++$+++ u7666 +++$+++ m518 +++$+++ KARL +++$+++ I want to come back and stay here.
