L614051 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ Then a little nap--
L614050 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ Together.
L614049 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ Then lunch in the Bois--
L614048 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ Um-hum ...
L614047 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ Then riding together.
L614046 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ Um-hum ...
L614045 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ Well, we'll have breakfast in the garden.
L614044 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ What are you going to do with my day tomorrow, M'sieu Laval?
L614043 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ Yes, madame?
L613938 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ And so will M'sieu Giron.
L613937 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ I'll be delighted.
L613936 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ Will you be good enough to run through these papers with M'sieu Giron?
L613935 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ Madame.
L613740 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ You're hired!
L613739 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ The same thing.
L613738 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ What would you do if you were my <u>secretary</u>?
L613737 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ And you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs, I would give you a good spanking--in a business way, of course.
L613736 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ Ye-es?
L613735 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ Everything! ... Madame Colet, if I were your father--  which, fortunately, I am not--
L613734 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is wrong?
L613733 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ It's disgraceful!
L613732 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ And how I handle my <u>money</u>!
L613731 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ Then you use the wrong lipstick--
L613730 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ Then I mislay my checkbook--
L613729 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ Madame Colet, I think you deserve a scolding. First, you lose your bag--
L613726 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ That sounds sensible. 
L613725 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ No! Not enough!  In times like these, when everything is uncertain, every conservative person should have a substantial part of his fortune within arm's reach.
L613724 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ You think that's too much?
L613723 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ But, madame, you keep a hundred thousand francs--in your safe--at <u>home</u>?
L613714 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ Isn't that wonderful!  You see, madame-- 
L613713 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ Too happy. That's why I discharged her.
L613712 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ I see.  She must have been very happy here.
L613711 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ This used to be my secretary's room.
L613710 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ Oh? 
L613709 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ It <u>is</u> beautiful. But I got a little tired of sleeping in antiques, so I gave it to my secretary.
L613708 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ Beautiful specimen.
L613707 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ Right!
L613706 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ Early eighteenth century. I should say around--seventeen thirty.
L613705 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ Yes!
L613704 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ Eighteenth century.
L613692 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ As you like. 
L613691 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ Make it out to cash!
L613690 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ What?
L613689 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ And do you know what I'd like to have you do with that check?
L613686 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ No. What is it? Tell me.
L613685 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ Do you know my first name?
L613680 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ Then I'm glad I lost the bag! I'll write you the check immediately. 
L613679 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ Don't be embarrassed, madame. I'll take it. I need the money. I wish I were in a position to ignore the whole matter. But you know, madame, the stock market, bank crash ... To make a long story short--a member of the nouveaux poor.
L613678 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ Yes.
L613677 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ In other words, madame, it embarrasses you to offer me the twenty thousand francs reward.
L613676 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ Goodbye, M'sieu La-- Oh, yes ... This is a rather delicate matter and I don't want to ... You see, if you read my advertisement carefully, you must have noticed that there was ...
L613653 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ But, Madame Colet, that's a matter of eye shadow. I can straighten that out in two seconds.
L613652 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ Do you realize I have light eyes?
L613651 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ That's too dark.
L613650 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ Peaches and cream.
L613649 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ What shade of powder do you use?
L613648 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ No, no, no!  I disagree with you completely! I tried it once--
L613647 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ That's what you need!
L613646 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ Too much blue in crimson.
L613645 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ With your skin, I prefer crimson.
L613644 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ What's wrong now?
L613643 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ But one suggestion, madame.  Not the major.  I don't  mind his grammatical mistakes. I'll overlook his bad punctuation. But the letter has no mystery--no bouquet--no ...  And one lipstick ...  Scarlet number four.
L613642 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ M'sieu Laval!
L613641 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ You needn't be embarrassed, madame. A lady as charming as you would, and <u>should</u>, get love letters.
L613640 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ Oh!
L613639 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ Naturally I did.
L613638 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ Oh! You didn't read it!
L613637 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue?  Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- Oh, yes, this letter from Major--
L613636 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ But really, m'sieu, this isn't necessary.
L613635 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ One purse--  empty. One vanity case-- 
L613632 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ The pleasure is mine, madame.
L613631 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ Well--how do you do, M'sieu Laval?
L613630 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ And I am M'sieu Laval--if you will allow me to introduce myself.
L613629 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ Well--I am Madame Colet.
L613628 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ Not in the least, madame. But you see, it's a very expensive bag--one has to be careful.
L613627 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ Of course it is! Are you doubting me?
L613626 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ Oh ... That's strange. Maybe--are you sure this is your bag?
L613625 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ I don't know how I could have lost it there.  I was nowhere near that niche.
L613624 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ Neither do I.  That's where I found it.
L613623 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ Not particularly.
L613622 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ You like that statue?
L613621 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ I remember.
L613620 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ And in that niche, there is a statue of Venus.
L613619 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ I know that niche.
L613618 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
L613617 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ Yes.
L613616 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ Then you go into the foyer.
L613615 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ Yes.
L613614 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ Then you go to the left. There's a landing.
L613613 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ Yes.
L613612 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ You know the main staircase in the opera?
L613598 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ That's it! Yes, that's it! ... Jacques!
L613597 +++$+++ u8437 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON +++$+++ Will you be good enough to look at this bag, madame? 
L613596 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ Yes...?
L613874 +++$+++ u8444 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE'S VOICE +++$+++ Well, the evening is still young. Let's go down to the living room and talk it over.  It's only ten o'clock.
L613873 +++$+++ u8438 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON'S VOICE +++$+++ Yes, madame!
L613872 +++$+++ u8444 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE'S VOICE +++$+++ No, m'sieu!
L613871 +++$+++ u8438 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON'S VOICE +++$+++ No, madame, it's the way you <u>follow</u>.
L613870 +++$+++ u8444 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE'S VOICE +++$+++ Oh, no, it's the way you lead.
L613866 +++$+++ u8444 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE'S VOICE +++$+++ I wanted to ask her to ask you if you'd be good enough to go out to dinner with me tonight.
L613865 +++$+++ u8438 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON'S VOICE +++$+++ What is it, madame?
L613864 +++$+++ u8444 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE'S VOICE +++$+++ Oh, that's too bad. You see, I wanted her to do something.  Well, I guess I'll have to do it myself.
L613863 +++$+++ u8438 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON'S VOICE +++$+++ Yes--uh--
L613862 +++$+++ u8444 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE'S VOICE +++$+++ Has Mademoiselle Gautier gone?
L613861 +++$+++ u8438 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GASTON'S VOICE +++$+++ Yes, Madame Colet?
L613860 +++$+++ u8444 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE'S VOICE +++$+++ Oh, M'sieu Laval ...
L613919 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ Jacques!
L613918 +++$+++ u8439 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GIRON +++$+++ You know what Paris is saying about the Countess Falconier and her chauffeur?
L613917 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ He is my secretary! I hope that answers all your questions, M'sieu Giron.
L613916 +++$+++ u8439 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GIRON +++$+++ Madame, let me ask you: Who is M'sieu Laval, anyhow? Where does he come from? What is he?
L613915 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ I know!
L613914 +++$+++ u8439 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GIRON +++$+++ Madame Colet, I've enjoyed the confidence of your family for more than forty years.  I was a school friend of your husband's ...
L613913 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ To M'sieu Laval?
L613912 +++$+++ u8439 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ GIRON +++$+++ I'm sorry, madame, but there are still certain matters which I think you should attend to yourself. And I, personally, would not care to refer them to--to-- 
L613911 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ But my dear M'sieu Giron, I'm having a tea party. Must I be bothered with all these papers now?
L614309 +++$+++ u8440 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ I don't want your money!
L614308 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ Mademoiselle Gautier--or whatever your name is--I thank you for your advice, but I must ask you to go. You've got your money--
L614307 +++$+++ u8440 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Let me give you a little advice. When you embrace him, be sure to put on your gloves. It would be too bad if your fingerprints were found ...
L614306 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ I beg your pardon!
L614305 +++$+++ u8440 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Ever had a romance with a crook?
L614304 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ I think you'd better go.
L613835 +++$+++ u8440 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Oh, madame, you're just too sweet for words! 
L613834 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ Well, in times like these most people are cutting salaries, but suppose we say, in your case, three hundred and fifty?
L613831 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ How much is your salary?
L613830 +++$+++ u8440 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Yes, madame?
L613827 +++$+++ u8440 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Very well, madame. Thank you. 
L613826 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ Oh, no, no, no, no, my dear child! That's ridiculous. You go home as usual--five o'clock every day. Now I'm going to be a little bit of a tyrant--I insist. It'll be nice for your little brother, too. <u>Five</u> <u>o'clock</u>--remember!
L613825 +++$+++ u8440 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ I'll do my best, madame, even if I have to work every night.
L613824 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ Right!
L613823 +++$+++ u8440 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ For all the really important things--
L613822 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ Yes! And he would have a little more time for--
L613821 +++$+++ u8440 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ So he wouldn't be confined so much to his office--
L613820 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ No, he <u>works</u> too much.  He's chained to his desk. Too much detail. Now, if you could take over some of his work--
L613819 +++$+++ u8440 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Nervous?  Um-hum. He smokes too much!
L613818 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ To me he seems rather nervous.
L613817 +++$+++ u8440 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Well--uh--yes and no.
L613816 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ Now. Uh--mademoiselle--in the short time you have been M'sieu Laval's secretary, have you noticed any change in him?
L613815 +++$+++ u8440 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Naturally not!
L613814 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ Potatoes. He doesn't want me to eat them--  and naturally I don't want to upset him.
L613813 +++$+++ u8440 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ About what?
L613812 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ You see--  Oh, not a word to M'sieu Laval!
L613811 +++$+++ u8440 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Yes, madame?
L613806 +++$+++ u8440 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ May I?
L613805 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ Please!  Thank you.
L613804 +++$+++ u8440 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Two lumps, madame?
L613794 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ Yes, that's the trouble with mothers. First you get to like them and then they die.
L613793 +++$+++ u8440 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ LILY +++$+++ Yes, madame. You see, I have to get up very early.  My little brother goes to school--  You see, Mother is dead.
L613792 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ You've had your breakfast--oh, but of course you have.
L613493 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ Well, where is it?
L613492 +++$+++ u8441 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MAJOR +++$+++ Yes, I saw it--but--
L613491 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ But you saw it here.
L613490 +++$+++ u8441 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MAJOR +++$+++ No--I'm sorry.
L613489 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ Apparently not. Don't you know where it is?
L613488 +++$+++ u8441 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MAJOR +++$+++ Didn't you take it with you?
L613487 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ Yes, my bag!
L613486 +++$+++ u8441 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MAJOR +++$+++ Your bag?
L613466 +++$+++ u8441 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MAJOR +++$+++ Well, he was in the navy.
L613465 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ You should have more self-control. You were in the army.
L613464 +++$+++ u8441 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MAJOR +++$+++ Because I hate him--because I love you!
L613463 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ Then why did you do it?
L613462 +++$+++ u8441 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MAJOR +++$+++ That's true.
L613461 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ But you're the more intelligent one.
L613460 +++$+++ u8441 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MAJOR +++$+++ He started it.
L613459 +++$+++ u8443 +++$+++ m573 +++$+++ MARIETTE +++$+++ You should be ashamed of yourselves. Two men of your standing, always quarreling.
L614995 +++$+++ u8446 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ An hour, two at most.
L614994 +++$+++ u8464 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ SMITH +++$+++ How much time?
L614991 +++$+++ u8446 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ The pumps buy you time... but minutes only. From this moment, no matter what we do, Titanic will founder.
L614990 +++$+++ u8464 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ SMITH +++$+++ The pumps --
L614989 +++$+++ u8446 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.
L614988 +++$+++ u8464 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ SMITH +++$+++ That's right.
L614987 +++$+++ u8446 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Water 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes... in the forepeak... in all three holds... and in boiler room six.
L615228 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ And to you, Mr. Andrews.
L615227 +++$+++ u8446 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Good luck to you, Rose.
L615225 +++$+++ u8446 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose.
L615224 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews?
L615081 +++$+++ u8446 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Hurry, Rose.
L615080 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Bottom, left, right. I have it.
L615079 +++$+++ u8446 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage, then make a right.
L615078 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer.
L615077 +++$+++ u8446 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ What? You have to get to a boat right away!
L615076 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master at Arms take someone under arrest?!
L615026 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Yes, I understand. Thank you.
L615025 +++$+++ u8446 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Please tell only who you must, I don't want to be responsible for a panic. And get to a boat quickly. Don't wait. You remember what I told you about the boats?
L615023 +++$+++ u8446 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Yes. In an hour or so... all this... will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.
L615022 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ You're certain?
L615021 +++$+++ u8446 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ The ship will sink.
L615020 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ I saw the iceberg, Mr. Andrews. And I see it in your eyes. Please tell me the truth.
L614830 +++$+++ u8446 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ About half, actually. Rose, you miss nothing, do you? In fact, I put in these new type davits, which can take an extra row of boats here.  But it was thought... by some... that the deck would look too cluttered. So I was over-ruled.
L614829 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Mr. Andrews, I did the sum in my head, and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned... forgive me, but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard.
L614755 +++$+++ u8446 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ANDREWS +++$+++ Thank you, Rose.
L614754 +++$+++ u8462 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ ROSE +++$+++ Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.
L615321 +++$+++ u8460 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ It's hers, you schmuck.  Look, Rose, I... I don't know what to say to a woman who tries to jump off the Titanic when it's not sinking, and jumps back onto it when it is... we're not dealing with logic here, I know that... but please... think about this a second.
L615320 +++$+++ u8447 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ BODINE +++$+++ Rush her.
L615319 +++$+++ u8460 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Don't drop it Rose.
L615318 +++$+++ u8447 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ BODINE +++$+++ Holy shit.
L614594 +++$+++ u8460 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Lewis...
L614593 +++$+++ u8447 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ BODINE +++$+++ So let me get this right. You were gonna kill yourself by jumping off the Titanic?  That's great!
L614430 +++$+++ u8460 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ LOVETT +++$+++ Rose might not want to see this, Lewis.
L614429 +++$+++ u8447 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ BODINE +++$+++ We've put together the world's largest database on the Titanic. Okay, here...
L614400 +++$+++ u8447 +++$+++ m574 +++$+++ BODINE +++$+++ Okay, so she's a very old goddamned liar. I traced her as far back as the 20's... she was working as an actress in L.A. An actress. Her name was Rose Dawson. Then she married a guy named Calvert, moved to Cedar Rapids, had two kids. Now Calvert's dead, and from what I've heard Cedar Rapids is dead.
