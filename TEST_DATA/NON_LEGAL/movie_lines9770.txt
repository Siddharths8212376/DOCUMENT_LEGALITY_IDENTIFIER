L179678 +++$+++ u4981 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ But, Mr. M. -
L179677 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Larry? We've got twenty-five minutes until the assembly, and we still have to do counts for VP, Treasurer and Secretary. Mr. Hendricks and I have both verified the numbers, and unless you can come up with the ballots you claim are missing -
L179674 +++$+++ u4981 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ I didn't make a mistake. Every vote was there when you sac down
L179673 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ It happens, Larry. People make mistakes.
L179672 +++$+++ u4981 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ But, they were there I counted 803 votes.
L179671 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ He's right. Two people must have pocketed their ballots. Usually it's more.
L179670 +++$+++ u4981 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ See, it doesn't add up. There are only 801 ballots but 803 people voted. Two votes are missing. Check the register.
L179669 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Mostly Tammy fans
L179663 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I think we've got a problem.
L179662 +++$+++ u4981 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Yeah?
L179661 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Larry?
L179653 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Huh.  Okay.  Well, I guess I'd better do my count.
L179652 +++$+++ u4981 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Mr. M.?
L179650 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Larry, we're not electing the fucking Pope here. Just tell me who won.
L179649 +++$+++ u4981 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ I thought those were the rules, Mr. McAllister. If they've changed in any way --
L179648 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You're kidding, right?
L179647 +++$+++ u4981 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ I'm not supposed to tell. Not until you've counted too. We're each supposed to make an independent count.
L179646 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ What d'you got?
L179633 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ All right.  I'll be back
L179632 +++$+++ u4981 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Okay.  Yeah.  We know
L179631 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I just want to get this over with, so we can have the assembly and go home. We don't have much time until eighth period.  I have other things going on, too, you know.
L179626 +++$+++ u4981 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ You have the key, Mr. McAllister.
L179625 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Fine.  So do your count.  Start with president, and I'll be right back.
L179624 +++$+++ u4981 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ LARRY +++$+++ Well, I thought that... well, the way it always works is that SGA president does a count, then the SGA advisor, you know, for the two independent counts.
L179623 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ What?  Right.  So let's start counting.
L179840 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You will.
L179839 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ I hope so
L179838 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You'll be fine.
L179837 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ I'm scared, Mr. M. I kind of don't feel ready for college.
L179836 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Take as much room as you want
L179835 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ What a surprise.
L179834 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Would you sign it for me?
L179833 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Oh, is this...?  God. First one of these I haven't been in for a long time.
L179832 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ I just have to get something. I'll be right back.
L179831 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Swallows, unsure what heaven or hell awaits him.
L179830 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ I want you to do something for me.
L179828 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ My house.
L179827 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ What's this?
L179826 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ I've got an idea.
L179825 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Well, I... I... that's very nice of you.
L179824 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Nooo.  I just thought...  l mean, I am looking for a new car.  But I just thought, well, I'm going away soon, and you'll be stuck here and, I don't know, I just think maybe if things had been different we might have been, well, friends. Real friends.  And then things would be different.  Don't you think?
L179823 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Coming to see me.  Are you trying to. . humiliate me?
L179822 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Doing what?
L179821 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Why are you doing this?
L179820 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Yes?
L179819 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ So Tracy?
L179818 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ That sounds good.
L179817 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard.
L179816 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Uh-huh.
L179815 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Plenty of pep, too.
L179814 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Yeah.
L179813 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Handles pretty good, don't you think?
L179812 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Anywhere you want.  Just so long as we're not gone more than a half-hour.
L179811 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Where to?
L179810 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Sporty.
L179809 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ So, are you looking for something sporty or more practical?
L179808 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Good for you.  Good for you
L179807 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.
L179806 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are you going?  Where 'd you get into?
L179805 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ My mother's buying me a new car for college.
L179804 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Oh.  New cars.  I see.  Well, you came to the right place
L179803 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ I'm looking at new cars.
L179802 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ So what brings you here?
L179801 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Hello, Tracy.
L179800 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Hello, Mr. M.
L179687 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ That said, the whole point of an election is to choose winners, and that you have done.  We'll begin with president.
L179686 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Act surprised. Walk slowly to the podium.  Be modest.  Thank them for this incredible honor.
L179539 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ That's enough, Tracy.  Quit while you're ahead, okay?  I'll handle this.  Could you ask Walt to come in?
L179538 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ I told you!  I told you!  You're going to pay for my banner!
L179537 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You're off the hook. Tammy here has confessed.
L179536 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ What do you mean?
L179535 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Looks like today's your lucky day
L179534 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Yes?
L179506 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ And I think certain older persons like you and your "colleague" shouldn't be leaching after their students, especially when some of them can't even get their own wives pregnant.  And they certainly shouldn't be running around making slanderous accusations. Especially when certain young, naive people's mothers are para-legal secretaries at the city's biggest law firm and have won many successful lawsuits. And if you want to keep questioning me like this, I won't continue without my attorney present.
L179505 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I agree.  But I also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very, very grateful the whole school didn't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations, and chances to win certain elections.
L179504 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ I don't know what you're referring to, but I do know that if certain older and wiser people hadn't acted like such little babies and gotten all mushy, everything would be okay.
L179503 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ This isn't the time or the place to get into it, but there is, for just one example, a certain former colleague of mine, who made a very big mistake, a life mistake.  I think the lesson there is that, old and young, we ail make mistakes, and we have to learn that our actions, all of them, can carry serious consequences.  You're very young, Tracy underage, in fact -- but maybe one day you'll understand.
L179502 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Why are you lecturing me?
L179501 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You're a very intelligent girl, Tracy. You have many admirable qualities.  But someday maybe you'll learn that being smart and always being on top and doing whatever you need to do to get ahead, and yes, stepping on people to get there, well, there's a lot more to life than that.  And in the end, you're only cheating yourself.
L179500 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ well, I don't know.  It could have been anybody.  There are a lot of, you know, subversive elements around Millard.  You know, like Rick Thieson and Kevin Speck and those burn-outs.  Or Doug Schenken - what about him?  Or what about Tammy Metzier?  Her whole thing is being anti- this and anti-that.
L179499 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it?  Whom should we "interrogate?"
L179498 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ I don't.  I just know they were there when I left.  I'm giving you helpful information is all.  You know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this.
L179497 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ 6:30.  How do you know what time the posters were torn down?
L179496 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ I was.  So?  Mr. Pecharda let me in. As you know, with all my responsibilities I often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so. But I left very early, around 6:30.
L179495 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Were you or were you not working in the Watchdog office over the weekend?
L179494 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Mr. M., I am running on my qualifications.  I would never need to resort to, you know, to vandalism like a, you know... Plus, my own best banner was torn down.  Did I do that too?
L179493 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Wait - are you accusing me? You're not serious.  I can't... Mr. McAllister, we have worked together on SGA for three solid years and... I mean, I can't believe it. I'm... I'm shocked!
L179492 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ A travesty.  Huh.  That's interesting, because I think you did it.
L179491 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ If it's about the posters, I think it's so awful. It's a travesty.
L179490 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I guess you know why you're here
L179397 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Look, why don't we just forget about Tammy?  We'll have the assembly tomorrow, everybody'll make their speeches, and I'm sure everything will be fine.
L179396 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Tim Kobza?  Tim Kobza!  Who's he? I've never heard of him!
L179390 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Looks like Tim Kobza.
L179389 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ These are a bunch of burn-outs. And look at this one, I can't even read this one.
L179384 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ As far as I know, they--
L179383 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Are you sure all her signatures are real?  It's not easy to get all those signatures.
L179382 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Calm down, Tracy.  Just calm down.
L179381 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ You're the advisor.  You should stop her.  She's not qualified.  She's just a sophomore.
L179378 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ So like I was saying, things were going pretty well in my life.
L179377 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Fuck me, Mr. McAllister
L179225 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Good luck, Tracy.
L179224 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
L179223 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Sure
L179222 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ You know, Mr. M., when I win the presidency, that means you and I are going to be spending a lot of time together next year.  And I for one would like that time to be harmonious and productive. Wouldn't you?
L179221 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Yeah.  Okay.  well, good luck Tracy
L179220 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Hell, you know, Coca-Cola's the world's number one soft drink, but they spend more money than anybody on advertising. I guess that's how come they stay number one.
L179219 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Should be easy.  So far no competition.
L179218 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ I can't wait to start campaigning.
L179217 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You bet.
L179216 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Thanks for everything.
L179215 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Okay, fine. Sure
L179214 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ I thought you were supposed to keep them.
L179213 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ NO, that's fine
L179212 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Aren't you supposed to keep them?
L179211 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Looks good to me.
L179210 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Right
L179209 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Could you approve them now?  I'd like to kick off my campaign right away, you know, in the morning.
L179208 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ You can put those in my box.  I'll look at them tomorrow.
L179207 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Here they are.
L179206 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Hey, that's super
L179205 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ I got all my signatures.  One hundred and fifty-eight -- way more than I need!
L179140 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Oh.  There's one more thing about Tracy I think you should know.
L179139 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ ...the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a...
L179138 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Now at the end of her junior year, Tracy was poised to win the presidency of the student body.  And so far she was running unopposed.
L179125 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Ethics are...
L179124 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Tracy.
L179123 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ I know.
L179122 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Okay.  But we're still missing something key here.  What are we missing?
L179099 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Thanks, Mr. M.
L179098 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Well, good luck there, Tracy
L179097 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Yes, I do.
L179096 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ You know what they say about the early bird.
L179095 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?
L179094 +++$+++ u4988 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TRACY +++$+++ Good morning, Mr. McAllister.
L179483 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Oh yeah, you bet.
L179482 +++$+++ u4989 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ WALT +++$+++ Well, that speech she gave -- it was pretty, you know, pretty out there.  But we'll get to the bottom of it.  Don't you worry. Mr. McAllister is going to see to that.  Right, Jim?
L179472 +++$+++ u4989 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ WALT +++$+++ Even tried you at home.  We've got a situation here.
L179471 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Nowhere.  I don't have class until second period.
L179470 +++$+++ u4989 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ WALT +++$+++ Jim, where the hell have you been?
L179418 +++$+++ u4989 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ WALT +++$+++ Yeah... whatever.  All I know is she's a troublemaker.  She's on my list.
L179417 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Walt, we can't throw her out of the election just because we don't like her speech.  That's not what student government's about.
L179416 +++$+++ u4989 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ WALT +++$+++ That little bitch made a fool of us I want her out of the election. Getting everybody all riled up like that.  She's finished, you hear me? Washed up.
L179760 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Thanks. Well. I'm going home now.
L179759 +++$+++ u4983 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ MISS BEEDER +++$+++ Okay, Jim. I understand.
L179758 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Walt will be speaking with you about this, but I need you to find someone to take over my classes. The lesson plans for the rest of the year are in my top right drawer.
L179737 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Oh.  Okay.
L179736 +++$+++ u4983 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ MISS BEEDER +++$+++ Walt needs to see you.
L179735 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Hmm?
L179734 +++$+++ u4983 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ MISS BEEDER +++$+++ Uh, Jim?
L179733 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Life would go on, and I would certainly be a stronger and wiser person from the experience.
L179530 +++$+++ u4987 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TAMMY +++$+++ I have proof.
L179529 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ I don't believe you.
L179528 +++$+++ u4987 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TAMMY +++$+++ I don't know. All I know is I did it I
L179527 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Which door?
L179526 +++$+++ u4987 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TAMMY +++$+++ Door was open.
L179525 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ And how did you get in the school?
L179524 +++$+++ u4987 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TAMMY +++$+++ I don't know. Yesterday.  Sunday.
L179523 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Exactly when?
L179522 +++$+++ u4987 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TAMMY +++$+++ This weekend.
L179521 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ And when did you do it?
L179520 +++$+++ u4987 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TAMMY +++$+++ I did it.
L179519 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Looks at her skeptically  doesn't say a word.
L179518 +++$+++ u4987 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TAMMY +++$+++ I'm the one.  I did it.  I tore down Paul's posters.
L179517 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ What is it. Tammy?
L179516 +++$+++ u4987 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TAMMY +++$+++ Well, this is hard for me, but I think it's important to be honest. Don't you?
L179515 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ So... what do you have to tell me?
L179512 +++$+++ u4987 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ TAMMY +++$+++ Okay.  Because I know who did it.  So.. I'll just be outside.
L179511 +++$+++ u4979 +++$+++ m331 +++$+++ JIM +++$+++ Possibly.  Please just wait outside.
