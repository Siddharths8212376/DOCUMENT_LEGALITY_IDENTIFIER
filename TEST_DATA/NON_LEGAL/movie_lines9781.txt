L184673 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ I see.
L184672 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ I'd seen you writing in that book. At the Embassy in Cairo, when I had thumbs and you had a face. And a name.
L184671 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ Me?
L184670 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ So, I come across the Hospital Convoy  I was looking for this stuff, and some nurse, Mary, Hana's friend, tells me about you and Hana, hiding in a monastery, in purdah, whatever it is - retreat -  how you'd come in from the Desert and you were burned and you didn't know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession -  - a copy of Herodotus - and it was full of letters and cuttings, and then I knew it must be you.
L184669 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ We shall miss you.
L184668 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ There are going to be trials, they want me to interpret, don't they know I'm allergic to courtrooms?
L184667 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ Hana tells me you're leaving.
L184634 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ What?
L184633 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ What?  You and Madox?  Or you and Katharine Clifton?
L184629 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ Very true!
L184628 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ Well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know -
L184627 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ I've had a drink.  Fatal.
L184626 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ Have a drink.
L184416 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ Is there a song you don't know?
L184415 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ Top Hat.
L184414 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ For?
L184413 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ Irving Berlin.
L184408 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ What? Hana comes in, sleepily, frowns at the gramophone.
L184407 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ Thought you'd never wake up!
L184353 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ I don't know.  Paper.  Is it? Paper?  I don't remember.
L184352 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ First wedding anniversary - what do you call it?
L184351 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ Moose.
L184350 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ Is it you?  If I said Moose… I look different, fuck, why shouldn't you?
L184349 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ I don't even know if it is my book. The Bedouin found it in the plane, in the wreckage.  It's mine now. I heard your breathing and thought it might be rain. I'm dying for rain - of course I'm dying anyway - but I long to feel rain on my face.
L184348 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ Why do I feel if I had your book I would know everything?
L184347 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ I can't hide anymore.  I breathe like a dog.  I lose my balance.  Stealing's got harder. Caravaggio stares at the Herodotus.
L184346 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ Are you outside? A beat and then Caravaggio shuffles in.  Like an old boxer.
L184098 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ I told her you can forget everything but you never forget your name.
L184097 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ I told her you would never invent such a preposterous name.
L184096 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ And you've forgotten yours.
L184095 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ Me?  You've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy.  So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name.
L184094 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ Are you planning to be the exception?
L184093 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ I think anybody she ever loves tends to die on her.
L184090 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ All over?  I kept trying to cover a very modest portion and still failed.  Are you leaving us?  Now's our opportunity to swap war wounds.
L184089 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ Oh, all over.
L184088 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ I understand you were in Africa. Whereabouts?
L184087 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ Thief, I think, is more accurate.
L184086 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ Finally!  So you're our Canadian pickpocket?
L184085 +++$+++ u5048 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CARAVAGGIO +++$+++ Hello.
L184345 +++$+++ u5049 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CLIFTON +++$+++ Marzipan!  I think you've got marzipan in your hair.  No wonder you're homesick.
L184344 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ What?
L184343 +++$+++ u5049 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CLIFTON +++$+++ I do so love you.  What do you smell of?
L184342 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
L184341 +++$+++ u5049 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CLIFTON +++$+++ Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war.
L184340 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Can't we really go home?  I can't breathe. Aren't you dying for green, anything green, or rain, wouldn't you die to feel rain on your face? It's Christmas and it's all - I don't know - if you asked me I'd go home tomorrow.  If you wanted.
L184339 +++$+++ u5049 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CLIFTON +++$+++ Sweltering.  Come on, I'll take you home.
L184338 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Aren't you?
L184337 +++$+++ u5049 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CLIFTON +++$+++ Right.
L184336 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ I'm not pregnant.  I'm hot.  I'm too hot.
L184335 +++$+++ u5049 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CLIFTON +++$+++ Lady H said she thought you might be -
L184334 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ I'm fine.  I got hot.
L184333 +++$+++ u5049 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CLIFTON +++$+++ Darling, I just heard.  You poor sausage, are you all right?
L184172 +++$+++ u5049 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CLIFTON +++$+++ But finally able to explore the Cairo night-life. I shall produce an authoritative guide to the Zinc Bars and - I want to say Harems - am I in the right country for Harems?
L184171 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Oh.
L184170 +++$+++ u5049 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CLIFTON +++$+++ Well look, if nobody minds, truly, then I suppose - I shall, of course, be bereft…
L184169 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Why do you think?  About my staying?
L184084 +++$+++ u5049 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CLIFTON +++$+++ Well, she is!
L184083 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Darling, for goodness' sake!
L184082 +++$+++ u5049 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CLIFTON +++$+++ I was just saying, I'm going to cable Downing Street, see if I can't stir up a few shillings - Katharine's mother and the PM's wife are best -
L184066 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ Oh really?
L184065 +++$+++ u5049 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CLIFTON +++$+++ The team is in mourning, darling.
L183969 +++$+++ u5049 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CLIFTON +++$+++ Off with his head!
L183968 +++$+++ u5054 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KATHARINE +++$+++ But then the Queen looked up and saw Gyges concealed in the shadows. And though she said nothing, she shuddered. The next day she sent for Gyges and challenged him.  And hearing his story, she said this -
L184164 +++$+++ u5049 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CLIFTON +++$+++ Have to return the favor - take a few photographs for the army.
L184163 +++$+++ u5057 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MADOX +++$+++ Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.
L184162 +++$+++ u5049 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CLIFTON +++$+++ To arm-twisting.
L184161 +++$+++ u5057 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MADOX +++$+++ And a special thank you to Geoffrey and Katharine, without whose fund raising heroics we should still be kicking our heels. They toast the Cliftons.
L184071 +++$+++ u5057 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MADOX +++$+++ Very much so.  We are all, save my friend here.
L184070 +++$+++ u5049 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CLIFTON +++$+++ Good heavens, are you married, Madox?
L184062 +++$+++ u5057 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MADOX +++$+++ I won't hear of it.  None of us will.
L184061 +++$+++ u5049 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CLIFTON +++$+++ Oh no, really.  She has her book.
L184060 +++$+++ u5057 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MADOX +++$+++ Of course.  Well, we should all go out onto the terrace.
L183943 +++$+++ u5057 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MADOX +++$+++ This is Clive Fenelon-Barnes.
L183942 +++$+++ u5049 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CLIFTON +++$+++ Apprentices.
L183941 +++$+++ u5057 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MADOX +++$+++ I think you know all of us, except for Geoffrey and Katharine Clifton, who've recently come out from England.
L183913 +++$+++ u5057 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MADOX +++$+++ We can finally consign my old bird to the scrapheap. Almásy smiles and walks on towards the others.
L183912 +++$+++ u5049 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ CLIFTON +++$+++ Isn't it?  Wedding present from Katharine's parents.  I'm calling it Rupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.
L183911 +++$+++ u5057 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ MADOX +++$+++ Marvelous plane.  Did you look?
L184632 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ That was a dance we invented at the International Sand Club.
L184631 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Never heard of it.
L184630 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ Who knows the Bosphorus Hug?
L184594 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Would you like me to?
L184593 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ Why don't you go?  You should sleep.
L184490 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ Don't depend on it.  Will you? That little bit of air, each day there's less of it, which is al right, which is quite all right.
L184489 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ You'd better be.
L184488 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ I'm still here.
L184453 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ - to her cooking.
L184452 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Hey! -
L184451 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ Hana was just telling me that you were indifferent -
L184450 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ I don't think it's indifference.
L184449 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ I don't think it does.  Anyway, he's indifferent to me.
L184448 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ You like him, don't you?  Your voice changes.
L184445 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ Condensed milk - one of the truly great inventions.
L184444 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Arguing about books.
L184420 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Kip's another one.
L184419 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ I've been told that before.
L184418 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Good morning.  Did you know that?  You're always singing?
L184372 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ In that case, I suppose we can't charge.
L184371 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ They have to clear all the local roads of mines.  That's a big job. They won't stay in the house. They're putting up their tent in the garden.
L184370 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ We should charge!  Doesn't anyone have a job to do?
L184369 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ With his Sergeant.  A Mr. Hardy.
L184368 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ Why?  Is he staying?
L184367 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ I liked it better when there were just the two of us.
L184366 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ My mother always told me I would summon my husband by playing the piano.
L184365 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ Really?  That's sudden.
L184364 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ I'll probably marry him.
L184363 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ Sikh.  If he wears a turban, he's a Sikh.
L184362 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ He wants us to move out, says there could be fifty more mines in the building. He thinks I'm mad because I laughed at him.  He's Indian, he wears a turban.
L184310 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ K is for Katharine.
L184309 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Tell me about this, this is in your handwriting - December 22nd - Betrayals in war are childlike compared with our betrayals during peace.  New lovers are nervous and tender, but smash everything - for the heart is an organ of fire…  I love that, I believe that.  Who is K?
L184273 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Yes, of course, I'm so sorry. Stupid of me. Hana gets up, upset to have hurt him.
L184272 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ Could I ask you to move?  I'm sorry - but when you turn, the sheets, I can't really bear the sheets moving over me. Sorry.
L184146 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ Do I recognize him?  I recognize what he is. I like him.  He's Canadian.  He can read Italian.  He can catch rabbits.
L184145 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you know him?  Do you recognize him?
L184144 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ That's a different dress.
L184143 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ He came back, he says he caught a rabbit.  I'm cooking it.
L184142 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ Something smells so rich.  My stomach is heaving -
L184124 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ Please, don't waste your time on pleasantries -
L184123 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ This is Captain McGann.
L184122 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Thank you.  Thank you.
L184121 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ Well then - yes.  Of course.
L184120 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get.
L184119 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ Just go off.  I'll be quite all right.
L184118 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ He's going back to the front this evening.  I can't see him otherwise.
L184117 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ Your friend?
L184116 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes?
L184115 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ Yes?
L184114 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Excuse me -
L184042 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ He won't disturb us then.  I think he's after morphine.  There's a war.  Where you come from becomes important.  And besides - we're vulnerable here. I keep hearing noises in the night. Voices.
L184041 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.
L184040 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ He needn't disturb you.
L184039 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place?  What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you?
L184038 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ He's Canadian.
L184037 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ Why?  Can he lay eggs?
L184036 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ There's a man downstairs.  He brought us eggs.  He might stay.
L183995 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Because I'm a nurse.
L183994 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ Why are you so determined to keep me alive?
L183993 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Are you crazy?
L183992 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ Could I have a cigarette?
L183991 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Are you remembering more?
L183990 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ I can see my wife in that view.
L183989 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.
L183988 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ Zerzura, the White City of Acacias, the Oasis of Little Birds.  As me about the scent of acacia - it's in this room.  I can smell it.  The taste of tea so black it falls into your mouth.  I can taste it. I'm chewing the mint.  Is there sand in my eyes?  Are you cleaning sand from my ears?
L183987 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ I'm turning you.
L183986 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ Not the window - I can't bear the light anyway - no, I can see all the way to the desert.  I've found the lost fossils.
L183985 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ How?  How can you see anything?
L183984 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ I can already see.
L183983 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ I should try and move your bed.  I want you to be able to see the view.  It's good, it's a view from a monastery.
L183974 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ Yes.  Dropping off.
L183973 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Are you asleep?
L183966 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ When my wife comes to lie down she always lays her garments one by one on a seat near the entrance of the room, and from where you stand you will be able to gaze on her at your leisure…
L183965 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ I'm not laughing at you.  Go on, please.
L183964 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Candaules…you're laughing at me.
L183963 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ Candaules
L183962 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ I will hide you in the room where we sleep, said Candaules. She stumbles over the word.
L183931 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ Thank you.
L183930 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Oh - I've found plums.  We have plums in the orchard.  We have an orchard! She has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth.
L183929 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ My book?  The Herodotus?  Yes, we can read him.
L183928 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ I think they're all in Italian, but I'll look, yes.  What about your own book?
L183927 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ Before you find too many uses for these books would you read some to me?
L183926 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ I was repairing the stairs.  I found a library and the books were very useful.
L183925 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ What was all the banging?  Were you fighting rats or the entire German army?
L183886 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Because you're leaning?  No, you're just on an angle.  You're too heavy!
L183885 +++$+++ u5062 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ THE PATIENT +++$+++ There was a Prince, who was dying, and he was carried up the tower at Pisa so he could die with a view of the Tuscan Hills. Am I that Prince? Hana laughs.
L184286 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ 
L184285 +++$+++ u5053 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ JAN +++$+++ Where's your Stuart from? Somewhere near there, isn't it?
L183865 +++$+++ u5053 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ JAN +++$+++ I love you.
L183864 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ I'm not sewing anything else for you!
L183863 +++$+++ u5053 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ JAN +++$+++ Hana, I know you do!
L183862 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ No!
L183861 +++$+++ u5053 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ JAN +++$+++ You don't have any money, do you? Just in case there's silk.
L183860 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ I'm not sewing anything else.
L183859 +++$+++ u5053 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ JAN +++$+++ There's meant to be lace in the next village - the boys are taking me.
L184791 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ So one day we'll meet.
L184790 +++$+++ u5055 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KIP +++$+++ I'll always go back to that church.
L184789 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.
L184788 +++$+++ u5055 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KIP +++$+++ Then come with me.
L184787 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ I've clung to you.  I've clung to you. Kip.  Life  a raft.
L184786 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ I'm thinking about your heart, not your skin.  And how to reach it. And that I don't think I can.  A bomb has ruined us, just not the bomb I thought would ruin us.
L184785 +++$+++ u5055 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KIP +++$+++ It's what I've learned.
L184784 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Is that what you think?  Is that what you think I think?
L184783 +++$+++ u5055 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KIP +++$+++ I know - here I am always a brown man, there you would be always a white woman.
L184782 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Kip… I -
L184781 +++$+++ u5055 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KIP +++$+++ I mean home.  India.
L184780 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Of course.  When?
L184779 +++$+++ u5055 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KIP +++$+++ Will you come with me?
L184756 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ Nya-nya-nya!
L184755 +++$+++ u5055 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KIP +++$+++ This is hot!
L184754 +++$+++ u5055 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KIP +++$+++ The lamp was burning all night in his room.  Caravaggio was there with him.
L184753 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ I should go to the house, get breakfast.
L184752 +++$+++ u5055 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KIP +++$+++ When I went to England I was amazed at what went on, the waste - I'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - India could live for a hundred years on what I saw thrown away.
L184751 +++$+++ u5055 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KIP +++$+++ That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon - Zamzammah - remember?  That was made out of the metal of ordinary things. I want to make an ordinary thing out of guns. His bayonet is thrust into the forge.  It's red hot.
L184750 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ What are you up to?
L184649 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ You wouldn't come to find me?  That makes me never want to come here. But she continues unraveling the turban.
L184648 +++$+++ u5055 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KIP +++$+++ Then I'd think there must be a reason.
L184647 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
L184646 +++$+++ u5055 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KIP +++$+++ I try not to expect you.
L184645 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ If one night I didn't come to the tent, what would you do?
L184644 +++$+++ u5051 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ HANA +++$+++ You loved him.
L184643 +++$+++ u5055 +++$+++ m334 +++$+++ KIP +++$+++ I was thinking yesterday - yesterday! - the Patient, Hardy: they're everything that's good about England. I couldn't even say what that was. We didn't exchange two personal words, and we've been together through some terrible things, some -  he was engaged to a girl in the village! - I mean -  and us - he never once… He didn't ask me if I could spin the ball at cricket or the kamasutra or - I don't even know what I'm talking about.
