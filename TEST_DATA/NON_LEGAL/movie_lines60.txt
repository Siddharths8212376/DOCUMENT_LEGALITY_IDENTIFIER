L60783 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ -- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything...
L60782 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian?  C'mon, you promised. Be honest.  Okay... Guard!
L60781 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.
L60780 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard --
L60779 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ What?
L60778 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there?
L60777 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Sure you do.
L60776 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I don't have a story.
L60775 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ -- No no, your turn. Tell me a story.
L60774 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Then who --
L60773 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?
L60772 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Who's doing this?
L60771 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair?
L60770 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ So you came to me...  Well, this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all...
L60769 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I'm close... but I can't get who it is...
L60398 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Hey, do I know you?
L60397 +++$+++ u419 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ RONALD +++$+++ Brian McCaffrey...  Oh this is really a treat. Brian McCaffrey. Lost a dad to the animal, huh?
L59997 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ See you Monday. Sir.
L59996 +++$+++ u413 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ CHIEF FITZGERALD +++$+++ Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.
L59995 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.
L59994 +++$+++ u413 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ CHIEF FITZGERALD +++$+++ Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.
L59993 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I need another one, sir.
L59992 +++$+++ u413 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ CHIEF FITZGERALD +++$+++ -- I don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a good firemen, but you had your shot.
L59991 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --
L59990 +++$+++ u413 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ CHIEF FITZGERALD +++$+++ Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take you back?
L59989 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I want another shot, Sir.
L59988 +++$+++ u413 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ CHIEF FITZGERALD +++$+++ You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?
L59987 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing.
L60893 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Like it never happened...
L60892 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Another couple of good men get burned up for their city? Is that how it's going to read?  You're the only one that knows.
L60891 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Yeah.
L60890 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Your brother was a good man.
L60767 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ I've been lying here hours... just thinking... We're close...  We're not looking in the right place, Brian. This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place...
L60766 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ So what do you want me to do?
L60765 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ I hate hospitals. You're so... so goddamn useless...
L60764 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Just wondering.
L60763 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ No.
L60762 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Did I say thanks?
L60761 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Yeah.
L60760 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Did you pull me out?
L60759 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ How ya feeling?
L60758 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Well Brian, I guess you can say it's arson now...
L60754 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ It had to be someone who knows numbers. Some kind of fancy accountant. But what's the connection?
L60753 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Then who wrote the report?
L60752 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.
L60751 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I've got three different drafts of the same report -- with different numbers that're all over the place. Looks like they were just making it up as they went along.
L60750 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Yeah? Airtight?
L60749 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released. Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all airtight.
L60709 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Who all ended up wearing candles for faces...  Swayzak's up to his ass in this somehow. Guy can barely hold a drink in his hand, he's so scared.
L60708 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Nice bunch of guys.
L60707 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate. They weren't very high on Seagrave, either.
L60706 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ So Seagrave and Holcomb were accountants...
L60705 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Son of a bitch. They knew each other.
L60704 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Hey boss, Dekom Trust is owned by Pan Illinois... which is majority controlled by Lakeside Dynamics... which is a division of Windy City Ventures... who's partners are...  Alan Seagrave, Donald Cosgrove, and Jeffrey Holcomb.
L60672 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Fire.
L60671 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ In a word, Brian, what is this job all about?
L60665 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I'm finished with Swayzak. I'll do whatever you want me to do. I just want to help catch the guy that burned Tim. You gotta give me another shot.
L60664 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ What the hell are you doing here?
L60557 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ No. Do that and I guarantee you'll scare him off. I don't want him running away.
L60556 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Are you going public with this?
L60555 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point.
L60554 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience?
L60553 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out.
L60552 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ What reason?
L60551 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.
L60550 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ But he killed these guys.
L60549 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts. 
L60548 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ What?
L60547 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ That's it! Oh, that son of a bitch, he's different, goddamn it! You see what this tells us, huh? Our killer doesn't love fire!
L60533 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ I don't work for them, either.
L60532 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Some people say you don't do much of anything when it comes to this case.
L60531 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ I don't guess.
L60530 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ But the right guess on this is arson.
L60529 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easier
L60528 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ And the putty around the door?
L60527 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Look, it isn't proof, okay? Someone may have put the chemical in the outlet, but we found it as a vapor in Cosgrove's clothes.
L60526 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Trychticholorate. Then Swayzak can announce Seagrave was a murder.
L60525 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Son of a bitch tears 'em apart just to eat the oxygen. Wouldn't take much at all to melt ten gauge wire. Problem's burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace -- unless you could find something that would eat its residue.
L60524 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Ever burned magnesium? It's so hot it takes water molecules and BAMM!
L60523 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ "During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium".
L60522 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ -- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.
L60521 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ "Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --"
L60520 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Read.
L60512 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ I just re-wrote your contract. C'mere...
L60511 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Uh, I don't think that's in my contract...
L60445 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ No it couldn't.
L60444 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire.
L60441 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ -- Another backdraft.
L60440 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Glass found in ignition room is in small, thin pieces, indicating explosion. Lack of discoloration indicates a long, slow burn. Explosion must of come after a slow burn.  You little tease... What were you up to you little bastard, huh? What made you that mad?  Or scared.  It started in this room. Took its time, hung out... but the air ran out. It couldn't breathe. So it was snuffed. But it wasn't dead... still all that trapped heat, lying low, waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air...
L60439 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Do we have a language barrier here? Glass.
L60438 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Glass?
L60437 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ So you were happy here. Warm and cozy and in no hurry...  Soot high, clean unburned wall low, indicates slow burn in thermal balance.  Find me some glass.
L60434 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ What are you listening to?
L60433 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ -- Shhh.
L60388 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Pest control.
L60387 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Where are you going?
L60386 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Look, I knew your father, he had a helluva reputation on this job. But that don't mean you get any slack. Swayzak sends you down here, okay, I gotta eat you, that's the rules and I got nothing to say about that. But Swayzak or no, you live with me. Step out of line, and I don't care who knows you, I'll swing the hammer.  You think you're the first?
L60385 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.
L60384 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.
L60383 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.
L60382 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Are you still here?
L60381 +++$+++ u420 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SHADOW +++$+++ Your Dennis' kid.  I work alone.
L60380 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new assistant.
L60083 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ You guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile.
L60082 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Oh, man, I'm sorry.
L60081 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.
L60080 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?
L60078 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident.
L60077 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?
L60076 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.
L60075 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ That's Sean? Jeez, he's a giant.
L60073 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I know, I know, Should'a called. I've been really busy. I joined the fire department.
L60072 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Four months?
L60071 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Four months.
L60070 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ 'Bout written you off. How long have you been in town?
L60069 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ You look like... Brian.
L60068 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.
L60067 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Brian?
L60649 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office. They loved it. And you know what? You were right, my family background in firefighting gave it weight.
L60648 +++$+++ u422 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SWAYZAK +++$+++ Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy?
L60567 +++$+++ u422 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SWAYZAK +++$+++ It isn't mine.  Let's get a picture.
L60566 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Nice boat.
L60565 +++$+++ u422 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SWAYZAK +++$+++ Mr. McCaffrey...
L60277 +++$+++ u422 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SWAYZAK +++$+++ Not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone, Brian. This could be a great opportunity to move... beyond a fire engine.
L60276 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.
L60275 +++$+++ u422 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SWAYZAK +++$+++ This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.
L60274 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I have a job.
L60273 +++$+++ u422 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SWAYZAK +++$+++ Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.
L60272 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Every little boy's fantasy.
L60271 +++$+++ u422 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SWAYZAK +++$+++ -- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.
L60270 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
L60269 +++$+++ u422 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SWAYZAK +++$+++ No need to be modest, Brian.
L60268 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.
L60267 +++$+++ u422 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ SWAYZAK +++$+++ And I'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian.
L60266 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Yeah. Big fan.
L60454 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Swayzak's not my boss.
L60453 +++$+++ u423 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.
L60452 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ So, you surviving without me?
L60260 +++$+++ u423 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ "Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey, on his very first fire, showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double-check a burning floor alone, emerging victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company... McCaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father's death..."
L60259 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ What?
L60215 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Ah man, is he usin' that line now on you? What, you think he made that little gem up? Jesus Christ, I used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning.
L60214 +++$+++ u423 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Y'know what Stephen said to me, right when all the shit was coming hard? "You never know till the moment the fire stares you down if you're just gonna do this job or be great at it".
L60213 +++$+++ u423 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Could you believe that fire? Man! First day! There I was, Adcox and me, pullin' that lady right out of the fire's fuckin' throat! I love it here -- No surround and drown for this company. Fighting 17th! Goddamn Stephen's amazing. You see how he took that fire by the balls? I'm gonna be that good some day, you watch.
L60212 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Do you have to do that?
L60048 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Backdraft.
L60047 +++$+++ u423 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Man. Something sure put a crimp in his evening.
L60020 +++$+++ u423 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Ah man, if you're gonna bribe your way into a station, why not 17 with me and your brother?
L60019 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Lots of fires. They promote faster there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s list, half the guys on it came from that battalion. Gotta think about your future, Timmy. 115's the station.
L60018 +++$+++ u423 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115?
L60017 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.
L60016 +++$+++ u423 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.
L60015 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Engine 115, right?
L60014 +++$+++ u423 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ Aren't you even curious?
L60000 +++$+++ u423 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ TIM +++$+++ What the hell are we waiting for?
L59999 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Completely out of control.
L60013 +++$+++ u424 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ WILLY +++$+++ You know, I've got a perfect little spot here for "Brian McCaffrey, Fireman"...
L60012 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ I was ahead of my time.
L60011 +++$+++ u424 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ WILLY +++$+++ And just this year, "Brian's Sound Spectrum". Your own company even. Big step.
L60010 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Coffee sucked.
L60009 +++$+++ u424 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ WILLY +++$+++ "Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?
L60008 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Management were pin heads.
L60007 +++$+++ u424 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ WILLY +++$+++ Uh huh. And "Pioneer's Pride, Mobile Log Cabins". That was in your blood about six months wasn't it?
L60006 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ Didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge I need.
L60005 +++$+++ u424 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ WILLY +++$+++ Really. Well, let's have a look at what else was "in your blood". I always look forward to getting these, they make such a nice collage for the bar... "Assistant Director, Sales, Aspen Snowmobile Tours..."
L60004 +++$+++ u412 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ BRIAN +++$+++ It's in my blood, Willy.
L60003 +++$+++ u424 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ WILLY +++$+++ Well, if it isn't the littlest McCaffrey.  Hey! You break anything with that you buy it!  Sorry, there must be something wrong with my eyes. I keep thinking that's a fire department uniform.
L59979 +++$+++ u414 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ DENNIS +++$+++ You've come along a dozen times, Stephen, give your brother a chance. We'll be back in a few minutes.  How 'bout it, sport?
L59978 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Dad!

L60730 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I don't want to confuse him, Stephen.
L60729 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ -- He's gettin' good on those eggs. And y'know, he told me he actually likes the piano.
L60728 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ -- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...

L60726 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Stephen... I... can I talk to you a second...
L60725 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Cook and I are almost finished here. Have a seat.
L60724 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ I...  It used to be, when I was a kid, what meant most to me about this job was there were no ifs. Life and death, right and wrong. When someone called the fire department, we came... Those guys don't know how much I love them... You don't leave people hanging... cause that's what it's all about. It's loyalty. It's 'till death do us part. Isn't that what you heard?... It's you go, we go... Cause without that, it's the end of families, it's the end of the fire department... and when the fire department stops coming... that's the end of the fucking world...  I'm sorry I came, Helen, it's just... it's just there's nobody I can talk to...  I miss you.
L60723 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ What's wrong?
L60722 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ I'm sorry... I... couldn't sleep...
L60499 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ You can't keep being his father...
L60498 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
L60497 +++$+++ u416 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Yeah? When was the last time?
L60496 +++$+++ u421 +++$+++ m25 +++$+++ STEPHEN +++$+++ Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.
