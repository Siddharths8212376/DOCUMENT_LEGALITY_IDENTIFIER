L64198 +++$+++ u3859 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PRESIDENT WIDMARK +++$+++ You're gonna have to repeat that, I think, Buckaroo.
L64197 +++$+++ u3850 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV +++$+++ Not too terrific, sir.  I apologize for the interruption but something very unusual has reared its ugly head in outer space, and it looks like the Earth's caught in a crossfire.
L64196 +++$+++ u3859 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PRESIDENT WIDMARK +++$+++ That which does not kill us makes us stronger, Buckaroo.  What's it like out there in the real world?
L64195 +++$+++ u3850 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV +++$+++ Hello, Mr. President.  How's my favorite patient?  Any tenderness?
L64194 +++$+++ u3859 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PRESIDENT WIDMARK +++$+++ World Watch One.  Direct incoming transmission.
L64359 +++$+++ u3852 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ JOHN BIGBOOTÉ +++$+++ Damn John Whorfin--!
L64358 +++$+++ u3853 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ JOHN O'CONNOR +++$+++ But John Whorfin said kill her.
L64072 +++$+++ u3853 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ JOHN O'CONNOR +++$+++ You look!  It's not here!
L64071 +++$+++ u3852 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ JOHN BIGBOOTÉ +++$+++ John Whorfin will kill us!
L64070 +++$+++ u3853 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ JOHN O'CONNOR +++$+++ Not here!  No Overthruster!
L63940 +++$+++ u3853 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ JOHN O'CONNOR +++$+++ I have a radio fix...
L63939 +++$+++ u3852 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ JOHN BIGBOOTÉ +++$+++ Where was it, John O'Connor? How far back?
L63935 +++$+++ u3852 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ JOHN BIGBOOTÉ +++$+++ A black thermopod here?  On Earth?!  Why, John Gomez?  Why?
L63934 +++$+++ u3853 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ JOHN O'CONNOR +++$+++ What? A black ship?  Where?  A black thermopod's been shot down ten miles back.
L64256 +++$+++ u3859 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PRESIDENT WIDMARK +++$+++ Should we be on Code Red?
L64255 +++$+++ u3855 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ NATIONAL SECURITY MAN +++$+++ Possible atmospheric condition, sir...solar.  It's unusual, but no cause for alarm.  Intelligence reports the Soviets are having the same problem.
L64254 +++$+++ u3859 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PRESIDENT WIDMARK +++$+++ Jammed--? By who? Whom by?
L64253 +++$+++ u3855 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ NATIONAL SECURITY MAN +++$+++ Still no confirmation either from SAC or Strategic Space Command.  They report all surveillance satellite communication jammed.
L64252 +++$+++ u3859 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PRESIDENT WIDMARK +++$+++ What's happening with my call to SAC?
L64251 +++$+++ u3855 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ NATIONAL SECURITY MAN +++$+++ No, sir.  I think the flint...
L64250 +++$+++ u3859 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PRESIDENT WIDMARK +++$+++ Buckaroo, come in...over.  How does this damn thing work?  Can anybody figure this lighter out?
L64008 +++$+++ u3857 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PENNY PRIDDY +++$+++ Better than him.
L64007 +++$+++ u3862 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ RENO +++$+++ Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women.  Can you play that thing?
L64006 +++$+++ u3857 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PENNY PRIDDY +++$+++ What's his problem?
L63956 +++$+++ u3862 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ RENO +++$+++ Course he's alive.  He's Buckaroo Banzai.
L63955 +++$+++ u3857 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PENNY PRIDDY +++$+++ Where's Buckaroo?  Is he alive?
L63954 +++$+++ u3862 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ RENO +++$+++ Government work.  Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around.
L63953 +++$+++ u3857 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PENNY PRIDDY +++$+++ What'd you do before?  Can I ask?
L63952 +++$+++ u3862 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ RENO +++$+++ Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.
L63951 +++$+++ u3857 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PENNY PRIDDY +++$+++ How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?
L64275 +++$+++ u3858 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PERFECT TOMMY +++$+++ Asshole probably got lost.
L64274 +++$+++ u3862 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ RENO +++$+++ We're waiting for the Jet Car.  Billy's bringing it.
L63928 +++$+++ u3862 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ RENO +++$+++ No!  Ditto the professor-
L63927 +++$+++ u3858 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PERFECT TOMMY +++$+++ Any sign of Buckaroo?
L63850 +++$+++ u3858 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PERFECT TOMMY +++$+++ Cause Buckaroo needs me here.
L63849 +++$+++ u3862 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ RENO +++$+++ Why me?
L63848 +++$+++ u3858 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PERFECT TOMMY +++$+++ Reno, how's about you take New Jersey's gear, mosey on over to the bus and introduce him to the rest of the hands.
L63844 +++$+++ u3858 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PERFECT TOMMY +++$+++ Where do you hail from, Doc?
L63843 +++$+++ u3862 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ RENO +++$+++ The name's Reno.  This here's Perfect Tommy.
L63827 +++$+++ u3858 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PERFECT TOMMY +++$+++ Hey, so was Mr. Wizard.
L63826 +++$+++ u3862 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ RENO +++$+++ You're thinking of Mr. Wizard.  This guy's an eccentric genius.
L63825 +++$+++ u3858 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PERFECT TOMMY +++$+++ Doctor Lizardo. Wasn't he on TV once?
L63821 +++$+++ u3858 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PERFECT TOMMY +++$+++ It's Peggy to these eyes.  Same nose, same hair.  Plus Buckaroo thinks so too or else he wouldn't be ready to go make a fool of himself, right?
L63820 +++$+++ u3862 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ RENO +++$+++ Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way.
L63819 +++$+++ u3858 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PERFECT TOMMY +++$+++ Pictures don't lie.
L63818 +++$+++ u3862 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ RENO +++$+++ Doesn't look anything like her to me.
L63817 +++$+++ u3858 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PERFECT TOMMY +++$+++ It's a spittin' image.
L63816 +++$+++ u3862 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ RENO +++$+++ I didn't drop 'em.
L63815 +++$+++ u3858 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PERFECT TOMMY +++$+++ Pick those up, Reno.
L63680 +++$+++ u3862 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ RENO +++$+++ Why me?
L63679 +++$+++ u3858 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PERFECT TOMMY +++$+++ Better see what's keepin' the boss, Reno.
L63719 +++$+++ u3858 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PERFECT TOMMY +++$+++ She's just a damn road hugger, Allison.  Plus the man can drive.
L63718 +++$+++ u3863 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ TV ANCHORWOMAN +++$+++ Now twenty seconds downrange...Perfect Tommy, how on earth is Buckaroo able to keep that thing on the ground?
L63693 +++$+++ u3858 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PERFECT TOMMY +++$+++ Bet I do.
L63692 +++$+++ u3863 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ TV ANCHORWOMAN +++$+++ Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy.
L63691 +++$+++ u3858 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PERFECT TOMMY +++$+++ That's why I wear a fifty dollar hat.  Was a two hundred dollar hat, I hadda kill you.
L63690 +++$+++ u3863 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ TV ANCHORWOMAN +++$+++ Flying to Cambodia.
L63689 +++$+++ u3858 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PERFECT TOMMY +++$+++ Unscheduled surgery.  He'll be waltzing along momentarily.  What're you doing tonight?
L63688 +++$+++ u3858 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ PERFECT TOMMY +++$+++ Whadda you need Buckaroo for?
L63687 +++$+++ u3863 +++$+++ m255 +++$+++ TV ANCHORWOMAN +++$+++ So where's Buckaroo?
L65706 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ I'll bet. Jesus – "The grand productive days." What a goddamn phony.
L65705 +++$+++ u3864 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ And my input was mostly... EDITORIAL, really, when he'd been drinking-
L65704 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Hah!
L65703 +++$+++ u3864 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ Barton, honestly, only the last couple-
L65702 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ I want to know!
L65701 +++$+++ u3864 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ Barton!
L65700 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote!
L65699 +++$+++ u3864 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ Barton, I think we should concentrate on OUR little project-
L65698 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ What do you mean so to speak?! Audrey, how long have you been his... secretary?
L65697 +++$+++ u3864 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ Well, Bill was ALWAYS the author, so to speak-
L65696 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Before Bill came to Hollywood.
L65695 +++$+++ u3864 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ Before what?
L65694 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ You wrote Bill's scripts!  Jesus Christ, you wrote his – what about before that?
L65693 +++$+++ u3864 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ Well, the basic ideas were frequently his-
L65692 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ You wrote his scripts for him?
L65691 +++$+++ u3864 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ Well... THIS.
L65687 +++$+++ u3864 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ Well, usually, they're... simply morality tales. There's a good wrestler, and a bad wrestler whom he confronts at the end. In between, the good wrestler has a love interest or a child he has to protect.  Bill would usually make the good wrestler a backwoods type, or a convict. And sometimes, instead of a waif, he'd have the wrestler protecting an idiot manchild.  The studio always hated that. Oh, some of the scripts were so... spirited!
L65686 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ What are they like? What are they about?
L65685 +++$+++ u3864 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ Yes, I'm afraid I have.
L65684 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ No, but the whole goddamn – Audrey? Have you ever had to read any of Bill's wrestling scenarios?
L65683 +++$+++ u3864 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ It's alright, Barton. You don't have to write actual scenes?
L65682 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Well I have to come up with – an outline, I'd guess you call it. The story. The whole goddamn story. Soup to nuts. Three acts. The whole goddamn-
L65681 +++$+++ u3864 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ Oh, he's... he drifted off. He'll sleep for a while now. What is it you have to do, exactly?
L65680 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Yes. Thank you. How's Bill?
L65679 +++$+++ u3864 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ Now that's all right, Barton. Everything'll be all right.
L65678 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Audrey, thank you for coming. Thank you.  I'm sorry to be such a... such a... Thank you.
L65677 +++$+++ u3864 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ Hello, Barton.
L65672 +++$+++ u3864 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ If I can. He gets jealous; he-
L65671 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ If you could, I'd –
L65663 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Barton. I'm sorry, it's Barton Fink.
L65662 +++$+++ u3864 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ ...Who is this?
L65661 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Audrey, listen, I need help. I know it's late and I shouldn't be calling you like this – believe me I wouldn't have if I could see any other alternative, but I – I'm sorry - listen, how are you – I'm sorry. You doing okay?
L65660 +++$+++ u3864 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ Hello.
L65659 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Pick it up... Pick it up. Pick it-
L65559 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ What. What don't I understand?
L65558 +++$+++ u3864 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.
L65557 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Okay, but that doesn't excuse his –
L65556 +++$+++ u3864 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.
L65555 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ ...Well that doesn't excuse his behavior.
L65554 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Really?...
L65553 +++$+++ u3864 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ No, sometimes he just... well, he thinks about Estelle. His wife still lives in Fayettesville. She's... disturbed.
L65552 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ What?! He's a son of a bitch!
L65551 +++$+++ u3864 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ ...Oh Barton, I feel so... sorry for him!
L65546 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ That son of a bitch... Don't get me wrong, he's a fine writer.
L65545 +++$+++ u3864 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ Let him go.
L65465 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ No, no –
L65464 +++$+++ u3864 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ ...I know this must look... funny.
L65463 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ I see.
L65461 +++$+++ u3864 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ Barton. You see, Barton, I'm not just Bill's secretary – Bill and I are... I love. We-
L65460 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Please, Barton.
L65459 +++$+++ u3864 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.
L65458 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Perhaps you and I could get together at some point also. –I'm sorry if that sounds abrupt. I just... I don't know anyone here in this town.
L65457 +++$+++ u3864 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ I'll tell Bill you dropped by. I'm sure he'll want to reschedule your appointment.
L65456 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Yes I am. I'm working on a wres – please call me Barton.
L65455 +++$+++ u3864 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr Fink?
L65454 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ How about you? Will you be alright?
L65453 +++$+++ u3864 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ I am sorry, it's so embarassing.
L65451 +++$+++ u3864 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ He will be... When he can't write, he drinks.
L65450 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Is, uh... Is he okay?
L65676 +++$+++ u3874 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MAYHEW +++$+++ Hesh up! Be still now! DROWN 'EM! DROWN 'EM! DROWN –
L65675 +++$+++ u3864 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ I'll try to slip out. If he quiets down, passes out... I'm afraid he thinks – well, he said you were a buffoon, Barton. He becomes irrational–
L65670 +++$+++ u3874 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MAYHEW +++$+++ Who is that?! Gaddamn voices come into the house... sons of bitches...
L65669 +++$+++ u3864 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ All right Barton, I'll see if I can slip away-
L65666 +++$+++ u3874 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MAYHEW +++$+++ Drown all those rascals...
L65665 +++$+++ u3864 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ Barton, I'm afraid it's not a good time-
L65542 +++$+++ u3864 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ Stop it, Bill!
L65541 +++$+++ u3874 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MAYHEW +++$+++ Am I? Maybe to a schoolboy's eye. People who know about the human heart, though, mebbe they'd say, Bill over here, he gives his honey love, and she pays him back with pity – the basest coin there is.
L65539 +++$+++ u3864 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ Not anything, Bill. Don't test me.
L65538 +++$+++ u3874 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MAYHEW +++$+++ M'honey pretends to be impatient with me, Barton, but she'll put up with anything.
L65530 +++$+++ u3864 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ Bill –
L65529 +++$+++ u3874 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MAYHEW +++$+++ So now I'm s'posed to roll over like an ol' bitch dog gettin' ger belly scratched.
L65525 +++$+++ u3864 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ That doesn't help anything, Bill.
L65524 +++$+++ u3874 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MAYHEW +++$+++ ...This'll sometimes help.
L65519 +++$+++ u3874 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MAYHEW +++$+++ Well, m'olfactory's turnin' womanish on me – lyin' and deceitful...
L65518 +++$+++ u3864 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ AUDREY +++$+++ That's hamburger grease, Bill.
L65517 +++$+++ u3874 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MAYHEW +++$+++ If I close m'eyes I can almost smell the live oak.
L65882 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Garland, it's me.
L65881 +++$+++ u3875 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ ...Hello.
L65309 +++$+++ u3875 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Chet! From downstairs!
L65308 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ ...Who?
L65307 +++$+++ u3875 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ Chet!
L65306 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ ...Who is this?
L65305 +++$+++ u3875 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ VOICE +++$+++ How d'ya like your room!
L65930 +++$+++ u3868 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ DEUTSCH +++$+++ All right, forget the heads. Where's Mundt, Fink?
L65929 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Could you come back later?  It's just...  too hot... My head is killing me.
L65871 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ He... I'm trying to think... Nothing, really... He... He said he liked Jack Oakie pictures.
L65870 +++$+++ u3868 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ DEUTSCH +++$+++ What else?
L65869 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Well that's what he said.
L65866 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Nothing, really. Said he was in the insurance business.
L65865 +++$+++ u3868 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ DEUTSCH +++$+++ So. You talked to Mundt, what about?
L65864 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ ...No. I never saw him with anyone else.
L65852 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ I...
L65851 +++$+++ u3868 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ DEUTSCH +++$+++ Yeah, he's funny that way.
L65844 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ ...Once or twice. His name is Charlie Meadows.
L65843 +++$+++ u3868 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ DEUTSCH +++$+++ Ever talk to him?
L65837 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ A week, eight, nine days –
L65836 +++$+++ u3868 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ DEUTSCH +++$+++ How long you been up there, Fink?
L65833 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ I – I've got respect for – for working guys, like you –
L65832 +++$+++ u3868 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ DEUTSCH +++$+++ What DID you mean?
L65831 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ No, I – I didn't mean to sound –
L65827 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Well as a matter of fact, I write for the pictures.
L65826 +++$+++ u3868 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ DEUTSCH +++$+++ Oh yeah? What kind of write?
L65825 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ I write.
L65674 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ I need help, Audrey.
L65673 +++$+++ u3874 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MAYHEW +++$+++ Goddamn voices... DROWN 'EM!
L65668 +++$+++ u3874 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MAYHEW +++$+++ I said drown 'em all! Who is that?
L65667 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ I'm sorry, I just feel like –I know I shouldn't ask, I just need some kind of help, I just, I have a deadline tomorrow-
L65548 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Are you all right?
L65547 +++$+++ u3874 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MAYHEW +++$+++ I'll jus' walk on down to the Pacific, and from there I'll... improvise.
L65536 +++$+++ u3874 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MAYHEW +++$+++ I'm buildin' a levee. Gulp by gulp, brick by brick. Raisin' up a levee to keep that ragin' river of manure from lappin' at m'door.
L65535 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ What's that?
L65534 +++$+++ u3874 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MAYHEW +++$+++ No son, thisahere moonshine's got nothin' to do with shuttin' folks out. No, I'm usin' it to build somethin'.
L65533 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ I don't know exactly. But I do know what you're doing with that drink. You're cutting yourself off from your gift, and from me and Audrey, and from your fellow man, and from everything your art is about.
L65532 +++$+++ u3874 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MAYHEW +++$+++ And what would that be, son?
L65531 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Look, maybe it's none of my business, but a man with your talent – don't you think your first obligation would be to your gift? Shouldn't you be doing whatever you have to do to work again?
L65523 +++$+++ u3874 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MAYHEW +++$+++ Mmm. Wal, me, I just enjoy maikn' things up. Yessir. Escape... It's when I can't write, can't escape m'self, that I want to tear m'head off and run screamin' down the street with m'balls in a fruitpickers pail. Mm...
L65522 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ ...No, I've always found that writing comes from a great inner pain. Maybe it's a pain that comes from a realization that one must do something for one's fellow man – to help somehow to ease his suffering.  Maybe it's a personal pain. At any rate, I don't believe good work is possible without it.
L65521 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Well... actually, no Bill...
L65520 +++$+++ u3874 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MAYHEW +++$+++ ...Still, I must say. I haven't felt peace like this since the grand productive days. Don't you find it so, Barton? Ain't writin' peace?
L65439 +++$+++ u3874 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MAYHEW +++$+++ So be it.
L65438 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ It's still a little early for me.
L65437 +++$+++ u3874 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MAYHEW +++$+++ ...A little social lubricant, Mistuh Fink?
L65436 +++$+++ u3874 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MAYHEW +++$+++ All of us undomesticated writers eventually make their way out here to the Great Salt Lick. Mebbe that's why I allus have such a powerful thrust.
L65435 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Sir, I'm flattered that you even recognize my name. My God, I had no idea you were in Hollywood.
L65430 +++$+++ u3874 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MAYHEW +++$+++ Just Bill, please.
L65429 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ W.P. Mayhew? The writer?
L65428 +++$+++ u3874 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ MAYHEW +++$+++ I beg your pardon?
L65633 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ Well what do I tell him?
L65632 +++$+++ u3870 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ GEISLER +++$+++ Who said write? Jesus, Jack can't read.  You gotta TELL it to him-tell him SOMEthing for Chrissake.
L65631 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ I can't write anything by tomorrow.
L65630 +++$+++ u3870 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ GEISLER +++$+++ Well he's taken an interest!  That means he'll make your life hell, which I could care less about, but since I drew the short straw to supervise this turkey, he's gonna be all over me too! Fat-assed sonofabitch called me yesterday to ask how it's going – don't worry, I covered for you. Told him you were making progress and we were all very excited. I told him it was great, so now MY ass is on the line.  He wants you to tell him all about it tomorrow.
L65629 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ I didn't say anything-
L65628 +++$+++ u3870 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ GEISLER +++$+++ Are you deaf, he LIKES you! He's taken an interest! What the hell did you say to him?
L65627 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ I don't understand-
L65626 +++$+++ u3870 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ GEISLER +++$+++ You thought! Where'd you get THAT from?  You thought! I don't know what the hell you said to Lipnik, but the sonofabitch LIKES you! You understand that, Fink? He LIKES you! He's taken an interest. NEVER make Lipnik like you. NEVER!
L65625 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ But... I thought no one cared about this picture.
L65624 +++$+++ u3870 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ GEISLER +++$+++ Souse! Souse! He manages to write his name on the back of his paycheck every week!
L65623 +++$+++ u3865 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ BARTON +++$+++ You don't understand. He's in pain, because he can't write-
L65622 +++$+++ u3870 +++$+++ m256 +++$+++ GEISLER +++$+++ A souse!
