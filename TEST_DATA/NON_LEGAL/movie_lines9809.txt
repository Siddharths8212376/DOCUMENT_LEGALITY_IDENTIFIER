L204142 +++$+++ u5214 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ I though we went over this.
L204141 +++$+++ u5217 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SEXY NURSE +++$+++ Stay right.  Left is trouble.
L204140 +++$+++ u5214 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Me like-y.
L204122 +++$+++ u5214 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
L204121 +++$+++ u5217 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SEXY NURSE +++$+++ My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
L204120 +++$+++ u5214 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
L204119 +++$+++ u5217 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SEXY NURSE +++$+++ I mean, you feel a little feverish.
L204118 +++$+++ u5214 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ So are you!
L204117 +++$+++ u5217 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SEXY NURSE +++$+++ You're hot!
L204109 +++$+++ u5214 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are <i>right outside that window</i> --
L204108 +++$+++ u5217 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SEXY NURSE +++$+++ And where do we think we're going?
L204736 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ But Johnny...you <u>can't fly</u>.
L204735 +++$+++ u5214 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Sis.  Let <u>me</u> take care of <u>you</u> for once.
L204734 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ What are you doing --
L204721 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ No, <u>I'm</u> sorry, for pushing you out.
L204720 +++$+++ u5214 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
L204668 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ As soon as you stop <u>acting</u> like one. Come on, you're <u>smarter</u> than this. You think those people out there <u>care</u> about you?  You're just a <u>fad</u> to them.
L204667 +++$+++ u5214 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Look around, sis!  <u>She's not here</u>.  So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
L204666 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Johnny, slow down.  <u>Think</u>.  You know mom didn't raise us to --
L204665 +++$+++ u5214 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
L204664 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Is that what you call it?  "<i>Real</i>"?
L204663 +++$+++ u5214 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Yeah, for the last time, I hope.  I'm done with this freak show.  I'm moving back to the real world.
L204662 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Johnny?  Did you see Ben?
L204531 +++$+++ u5214 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Blockhead started it!
L204530 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ You two need a time-out.
L204523 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ You gave us <u>names</u>?  What are you, the "face" of the Fantastic Four now?
L204522 +++$+++ u5214 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.  What?!
L204519 +++$+++ u5214 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Dude.  That's my sister.
L204518 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ I'm driving.
L204506 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ <u>Girl</u>...?!
L204505 +++$+++ u5214 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl...the Invisible Girl.
L204355 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ That's the temperature of the <u>sun</u>.
L204354 +++$+++ u5214 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Sweet.
L204353 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ You were at 4000 Kelvin.  Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
L204352 +++$+++ u5214 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ You're really cramping my style here.
L204318 +++$+++ u5214 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Is that a trick question?  C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
L204317 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Grow up, Johnny.  You want to run around <u>on fire</u> for the rest of your life?
L204316 +++$+++ u5214 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Wait.  You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
L204205 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ I think that thing is Ben.
L204204 +++$+++ u5214 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ What is that <i>thing</i>?
L204197 +++$+++ u5214 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Okay, "mom."
L204196 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Stop it.
L204195 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Johnny.
L204194 +++$+++ u5214 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Flame on, flame off.  Flame on, flame off --
L204192 +++$+++ u5214 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ <u>Please</u> tell me you go silent too.
L204191 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Apparently I can disappear.
L203988 +++$+++ u5214 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ JOHNNY +++$+++ Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
L203987 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
L204231 +++$+++ u5215 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street.  Tomorrow, who knows...maybe Washington.
L204230 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Front page?
L204229 +++$+++ u5215 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
L204228 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here.  And keep it quiet.  I don't need this to hit the press.
L204158 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ <u>That's</u> why.  Because I could have any <u>other</u> woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not <u>mine</u>."
L204157 +++$+++ u5215 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Sir, I've always wondered... Why <u>Sue</u>? You could have any woman in the world but --
L204156 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Later.  First, I've got some unfinished business.  A deal that needs closing...
L204155 +++$+++ u5215 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ You know, maybe you should get some rest --
L204154 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ And that's a <u>good</u> thing?
L204153 +++$+++ u5215 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
L204152 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've <u>got to</u> do something about this scar.  Make sure they only shoot my right side.
L204151 +++$+++ u5215 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
L204150 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Reed's disaster.  You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
L204149 +++$+++ u5215 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Stable.  We're looking at low twenties.  It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
L204148 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ How's the IPO?
L204021 +++$+++ u5215 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly.
L204020 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Leonard, how's the feed?
L203999 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ History, Leonard.  <u>History</u>. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
L203998 +++$+++ u5215 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Then what is it?
L203997 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ It's not just the money.  I could make money in my sleep.
L203996 +++$+++ u5215 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ Our numbers are through the roof.  The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share.  The bank's five times oversubscribed --
L203995 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Showtime.
L203994 +++$+++ u5215 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ They're ready for you, sir.
L203956 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Reed's <u>always</u> right.  Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...
L203955 +++$+++ u5215 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ LEONARD +++$+++ And if he's not...?
L203954 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.
L204566 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Which is precisely the <u>point</u>. Analysis is over.  It's time for <u>action</u>.  My men could have mass- produced this by now.
L204565 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ But I'm not done with the machine --
L204564 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ What I <u>should</u> have done a long time ago.  Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me.
L204563 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ What are you doing here?
L204338 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I don't want to <u>understand</u> it.  This isn't one of your science projects.  I just want to <u>fix</u> it.  <u>Fast</u>!
L204337 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
L204336 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ <u>Abort</u>?  Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will <u>not</u> let you make me look like a fool --
L204335 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ <u>I</u> ruined?  With all due respect, I told you to abort --
L204334 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Didn't go as <u>planned</u>?  It was a <u>catastrophe</u>.  You ruined the lives of four people --
L204331 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ Not much.  We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
L204330 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
L204211 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ He's had some kind of...reaction to exposure from the cloud.  And he's not the only one.
L204210 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ <u>Ben</u> did this?
L204209 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ Ben did this.
L204208 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Just a little banged up.  A couple scrapes.  Why?
L204067 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
L204066 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ Not until Ben is back inside!
L204063 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Reed, we're running out of time.
L204062 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ Come on, Ben, come on...
L204056 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ So reel him in.  But we came here to do a <u>job</u>.  So let's do it.  <u>Quickly</u>.
L204055 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ Ben's still out there --
L204054 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Get a grip.  Reed.  We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch.  Just close the shields...
L204053 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ We've got <u>minutes</u> until it hits, not hours...Victor, that storm's <u>deadly</u> -- the radiation's lethal.  We need to abort.
L204032 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ Sure.
L204031 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Got it.  So take a walk, Ben...I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
L203953 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ Hilarious.
L203952 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
L203946 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ The number's <u>seventy-five</u>.  And it's applications <u>and</u> patents.
L203945 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --
L203942 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ Not at all.
L203941 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
L203929 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ You remember in school we talked about working together.  That's what I was about to explain...
L203928 +++$+++ u5220 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ VICTOR +++$+++ But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
L204800 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ A <u>gasket</u>?  Reed, we're at a party.
L204799 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ I found a broken gasket, from space --
L204781 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ I'm sure I can come up with something.
L204780 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
L204675 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ You <u>need</u> a doctor.
L204674 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --
L204673 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
L204672 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ I can...make it work.
L204622 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ That would have kinda defeated the purpose.  And Reed...  I'm saying it now.
L204621 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ Why didn't you say something?
L204620 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ When I walked out, I waited <u>ten</u> <u>minutes</u> outside your door.  Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
L204619 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ I did.  I did, Reed...but I wanted <u>you</u> to be that man.
L204618 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you...speak his mind.  One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
L204615 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ I gave him twenty.
L204614 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
L204613 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Of course I was.  I'd read all your papers on bioethics.  Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you.
L204612 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ You <u>were</u>?
L204611 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Remember our first date here...?  God, I was so nervous.
L204610 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Reed.  Shh.  Just be quiet.  And look up.
L204609 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
L204578 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ <u>I'm</u> not the only one in there.  I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there.
L204577 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Every variable but <u>yourself</u>.  You don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in your head like --
L204576 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ Which is why I'm working <u>twenty</u> hours a day, checking every variable --
L204575 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Better than your <u>life</u>.  Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing.  <u>We</u> are.
L204574 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
L204573 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
L204492 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ No way to know.  Without more tests, experiments.
L204491 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Reed.  How close are we to a cure?
L204426 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm.  Maybe tie into the city grid...
L204425 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ And you sure you can control this thing?  Last time didn't work out so well.
L204424 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ Of course.  Of course.
L204423 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ But <u>we're</u> the focus, right Reed? <u>Reed</u>...?
L204422 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ Curing countless diseases, not just ours.
L204421 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ And reverse the mutations --
L204420 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
L204419 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ The plants, from space.  Their particles are still charged.  With the right amount of energy, those ions could <u>create</u> the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
L204418 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ What are you doing?
L204389 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ No.  There weren't.  There was <u>you</u>. And <u>me</u>.  No variables, no math.  It was actually the simplest thing in the world.  But your head got in the way... like it always does.
L204388 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ There were a lot of variables to consider --
L204387 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
L204386 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ I think it was a little more complicated than --
L204385 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Reed.  I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
L204384 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ No, I distinctly remember: <u>you</u> walked out <u>my</u> door.  Ergo...
L204383 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Are you kidding?
L204382 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ I mean, <u>you</u> broke up with <u>me</u>, right?
L204381 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ What in the world would give me that idea?
L204380 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
L204378 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ I'm sure I can come up with something.
L204377 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate that feeling?  Some memory or...
L204376 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Anger.  Rage.  Frustration.
L204375 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger.  Can you remember the exact emotions when --
L204374 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ Excuse me?
L204373 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
L204369 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ What about you?  You haven't eaten in days.  How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
L204368 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ It's not "invisibility" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field.  That's what you projected on the Bridge.
L204315 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ If it happened to him, then it could...
L204314 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ That's what we're here to find out.
L204313 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
L204253 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ What...?  <u>Oh</u>.
L204252 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them.
L204250 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ We need to get past them.
L204249 +++$+++ u5218 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ SUE +++$+++ What?
L204187 +++$+++ u5216 +++$+++ m345 +++$+++ REED +++$+++ Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a <i>massive amount of evidence</i> before making that leap.
