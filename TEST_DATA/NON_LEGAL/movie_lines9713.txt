L145195 +++$+++ u4634 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Back in the driver's seat again, Doctor?  That old dream -- study us to see what makes us sick.  So you can find a cure -- they'd name it after you?  Death is the only cure for people like me.
L145194 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Do anything you want to me.  I give myself to you.  Only put the knife down.  Isn't this what you always wanted?  I know it's what we all want, to love and to loved.  I could love you.  You could work together in some safe place, learn to really understand you, help you, give you some peace of mind, some happiness...
L145193 +++$+++ u4634 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Oh, please.  I know what's coming, now.  "Let me help you..."
L145190 +++$+++ u4634 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I don't have the talent for any of those things.  All I have a talent for is death.  And I am one of a kind.  What do you think of your student now?  I have made you famous, I am your creation and your monument.
L145189 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ That's not who I admire -- I admire people who are good at what they do, great artists, writers, thinkers...
L145188 +++$+++ u4634 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Why did you do that?  Didn't you have any idea how hard it was for me, to get that far?  I worshipped you.  You inspired me.  I thought you could understand me the way you understood the others.  I knew that about you -- the ones you admired were the great murderers; they fascinated you.
L145187 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I have no life anymore.  I ruined your life, make me pay for it.
L145186 +++$+++ u4634 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ We'll keep talking.  Until they get here.  Then... 
L145181 +++$+++ u4634 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Don't talk to me about courage.  I know death, what it's like to kill. You're not a killer -- you watched Daryll Lee kill that cop and you didn't make a peep, because you were paralyzed with fear.  You chocked.  I know something <u>else</u> about you.
L145180 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Do it.  If that's what all this carnage is about, then do it.  Have enough guts to do it.
L145179 +++$+++ u4634 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ No.  Not yet.
L145178 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Kill me, Peter, do it, now.
L145141 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Where it began -- McCluskey Auditorium.
L145140 +++$+++ u4634 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You know where.
L145139 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Yes.  I do.  I want it to end now. Let her go.  I'll come -- just let her go.  She's not important.
L145136 +++$+++ u4634 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I don't care -- she's a cop.  That's the important thing.  Cop-ness, not sex-ness.  It won't be perfect, but it'll be good.
L145135 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
L145134 +++$+++ u4634 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ I need her; she's a cop.  I have to kill a cop, and then...
L145133 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ For God's sake Peter, leave her out of it.  You don't want her, you want me.
L145131 +++$+++ u4634 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Oh, I think you will.
L145130 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ You know I can't do that.
L145129 +++$+++ u4634 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Mm-hmm.  I can't get to you.  You have to come to me.
L145128 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ It's Daryll Lee Cullum, isn't it?
L145127 +++$+++ u4634 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ What was that?  What am I hearing? The sound of an epiphany, a sudden blinding insight?
L145126 +++$+++ u4634 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ <u>You</u> thought I was going to do Ted Bundy next, so you sent your partner...
L145125 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Where are you, Peter?
L145124 +++$+++ u4634 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ You like that action?  Didn't that cop on TV look <u>solemn</u>?  The guy in the basement doesn't matter, anyway, just another lonely heart.
L145123 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Who was the man in the basement?
L145122 +++$+++ u4634 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ PETER +++$+++ Hi.  It's your worst student, Peter Foley -- how do you grade me now, Doctor?
L145224 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Well, thanks.
L145223 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Why can't I drive home?  I will. You.  Look at you.  <u>You</u> need a ride home.  And you don't even know it.
L145100 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Oh, shut up, and don't be so damn self righteous.
L145099 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ If there's a one percent possibil- ity, can you live with yourself when he kills again?
L145098 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ This has been the worst 48 hours of my life.  I'm going home.  I'm going to try to get drunk.
L145097 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ He hasn't done Bundy.  He's done every one of the others, hasn't he? If there are three dead Chi Omega college girls tomorrow, how will you feel?  Go there.  See if there could be any way for him to escape.
L145096 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Helen -- let go.  You've got to let go.
L145095 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ They never kill themselves.  How do you know it was him.  You never met him.  You never even saw a photograph...
L145094 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Helen.  I saw him die.  I saw him burning on the basement stairs, he never reached the top.
L145036 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Christ, Helen.  The first time, we're ahead of the son of a bitch! I can't leave you like this -- and there's no time.  Knock yourself out.
L145035 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ W-We had a fight.  I called him... called him a name...
L145034 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ How many do you need to sleep. Really sheep?
L145033 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ I've got to go.  I've <u>got</u> to go.
L145032 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I am not going to talk about it. How do you <u>know</u> it was Andy if the head was gone?  Where is the head? Are you looking for it?  Oh, God, why him?  Because of me.  I can't talk about it.  I write about things like this, stuff it all in books and bury it in libraries. This is the first person close to me who's ever died.  And it's because of me.  This monster killed him because I loved him.
L145026 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Out.  Where does he go?  Nowhere. What does he do?  Nothing.
L145025 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ I'm working on it!  It's what I do.  Quinn...Halloran.  I'll wait.  Where's Andy, can we get some coffee in here?
L145024 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Maybe you should...
L145023 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Bundy.  That's the last one in your speech...
L145022 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Yes.  Dahmer!  And after that...
L145021 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Look.  There's the order:  you wrote it:  DeSalvo, Bianchi & Buono, Berkowitz and Dahmer.  It's going to be Dahmer next.  Which means he'll kill a man.
L145020 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ The University computer is down for maintenance, but I've been going through my own notes...
L145019 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ What does it matter?  This guy, you checked your course records, who signed up?
L145018 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Who's the married man?
L145017 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Where's the john?  Let me clean up this mess, and get back to work.
L145016 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ You're exhausted.  Let me get you a brandy.
L145015 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ A man?  I thought he was a boy.  This last Christmas was the happiest Christmas I had in the last ten years... you know why?  It was the first Christmas in six years I was not in love.  Son of a bitch <u>married men</u>!  Who cares about marriage, the bed just gets crowded and noisy?!
L145014 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ He felt sorry for me.  It was so nice to flirt.  He was a darling man.
L145013 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ I just thought it was so -- unprofessional.  Of you both!
L145012 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Ruben's dead.   So stupid, a cop thing, a crazy kid and a buncha dumb mistakes... I'm sorry... because you and he...
L145011 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ What happened to you?!
L144904 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ You do that one, I don't want it...
L144903 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ They're not talking to me.  Saks looks right through me.  I ask him for some bodies, for the phones -- he's so encouraging: "you make that <u>your</u> little job."  Condescending bastard.  Helen, on your lists to call is San Quentin.  Daryll Lee Cullum?
L144902 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Let's speed up the game plan... call all the living serials to ask if they've had contact with a Peter Kurten.  We could use some help on the phones...
L144879 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ They get fan letters...
L144878 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ '...great dark hall of fame... all our greatest killers...'  His greatest <u>heroes</u>?  He wants to be famous.  When they're caught and people like me write about them, we give them a kind of immortality. They get thousands of letters. Ramirez kills eight women and gets a hundred marriage proposals a month.  They're like film stars.
L144869 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ It's not chronological: Son of Sam was before Hillside.
L144868 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ It's also the major piece of evidence, and it makes you a key part of his plan.  You can't run away from it anymore.  Look at the order he's doing them... He did three as the Boston Strangler just to tell us a copycat serial killer was at work.  Then he did one like the Hillside Strang- ler.  And then one as Son of Sam. To lead us on -- to where and what end?  And he's doing more than that -- he's imitating each killer's method as closely as he can -- in details.  Injecting Windex.  Using .44.  Playing Abba.
L144867 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ They weren't going to show it to me?!  The arrogance!  It's my <u>life</u>!
L144866 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ I put my ass on the line, giving you that.
L144865 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ What I can't believe is that in an earlier life I slept with him! Christ!  Any God that loved his people would give women a rewind on their life and an erase button.  Just give me a minute here.  The letter is addressed to me...  You don't feel fear, do you? You're young.  You feel like you'll live forever.  How wonderful.
L144864 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ He said to send you his regards and to tell you that the Bureau holds you in the highest esteem.
L144863 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ They put  Merry <u>Saks</u> on it?!
L144774 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Look in the crowd.  He liked to hang around and watch the cops at work...
L144773 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Ruben's gone to look... It's banged up but it looks like a .44.  It's Son of Sam.  Is it Son of Sam?
L144772 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going...
L144771 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ What's that siren?
L144755 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ What's that music.  It's Abba.  I can hear it.  It's Abba.
L144754 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Helen, hang up, let Ruben get on with his work...
L144741 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Because I'm all you've got.
L144740 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Why should I trust you?
L144739 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ I did not; the Mouth -- that's what we call Susan Schiffer -- got it on her own.
L144738 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ You betrayed me!  Now every psychopath in the city knows I'm back in business... You lied to me!
L144737 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Halloran.
L144732 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ I'm giving you Clint outside.
L144731 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ This one, yes.  I was always curious about these twisted little souls, but this is the first one I've felt personally terrified of. He's something new and unheard of. I don't know what he wants.
L144730 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ You're afraid of him.
L144729 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Who's going to catch him?  You?  And if you do, there'll be another one.  And one after that.
L144728 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ He'll get caught.  If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up...
L144727 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half way to nailing him.  Serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive.  This guy has a plan all thought out, flexible and complex.  He's playing a game with us.  Who will he imitate next? Maybe he's doing all the serial killers in history, the great innovators, the murderers' hall of fame.  Just to prove he's better than all of them.  They got caught; he didn't.
L144726 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Injected Windex!  Why would he switch to a new m.o.?
L144725 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ It's what Bianchi and Buono injected into one of their victims.
L144724 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ I know Windex, for God's sake, I clean my own windows...
L144723 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Consistency is the hobgoblin of <u>little</u> minds.  Tell them to test for the chemicals found in Windex. That's a product for cleaning with...
L144722 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ That's not consistent... You said they never changed their style, they're robots...
L144719 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ That's exactly... I could have taken that same picture, this morning.
L144718 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Is that it?
L144717 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ So far nothing they test for comes up positive.
L144716 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ There were needle marks.  But no drugs in her blood.
L144713 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Please thank Inspector Goetz for taking care of me last night.
L144712 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Hello, Ruben...  So that's that...
L144711 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Ruben.
L144708 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Clint is putting a guard on you. But if you swear to leave the computer on, Winona will assign him to the hall outside.
L144707 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ That little Winona Ryder manner... you're more convincing as Clint Eastwood.
L144706 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Helen -- the killer directly contacted you.  His interest in you is <u>intense</u>.  I'm worried about you. I don't want to lose you.  I know this stirs up every monster under the bed, but this is the only direct contact we have with him. The only chance we have to trap him.  So, you can turn Internet back on, or I do, and we put somebody here on a 24 hour shift and you can kick, scream and hyperventilate.
L144705 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Have you got a warrant?  Get the hell out o here!  This is the <u>only space I have left in the</u> <u>world</u>!  Why can't you leave me out of it?
L144704 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ He comes in the window, we maybe grab him.  Where's the on-switch?
L144703 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I turned it off.  It's like an open window he can climb right in...
L144702 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Who turned off the Internet computer...
L144701 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ You're saying it's the same man, but he's changed his style?  That doesn't happen.  These men are robotic; the murder is like a ritual.  The method itself is part of the pleasure...
L144700 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says "no dumping."  Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose.   It's all different but it seems so -- the same. Artificial and <u>posed</u>... Something's wrong with it.
L144699 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Then what do you need me for?
L144698 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ But it's a different m.o.
L144697 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ That's no surprise.
L144696 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ We've got another one.
L144592 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ I want a guard on you.  I'm worried about leaving you alone.
L144591 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ He's going home.  He slept over because I was a little anxious...
L144590 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ That's amazing.  A whole new book, thought up in a minute.  Very good.  All I know how t do is get up, take a shower, and go to work. Hope, if he does another I'll nail the son of bitch, and they'll spell my name right in the newspaper. Where is Andy going?
L144581 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Because I'm his damned pin-up girl! His, all of them!  They know me. They're in prisons with libraries, they collect clippings, I'm their worthy opponent.  You keep my name out of this.
L144580 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in <u>your</u> computer?
L144579 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ It's <u>anybody</u> connected to author- ity.  They write, they even knock on your door.  They're <u>fans</u>.  It thrills them to flirt with getting caught.
L144578 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Look at the sign.  'Hell'?  In the Festival of Love?  You make any sense in that?
L144577 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ She probably let him in the door without a thought.  Where are their mothers?!  Where are the mothers that are supposed to teach them to be wary and to tough and not afraid to fight?
L144576 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ I just came from her... here's what you haven't seen.
L144575 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Maybe that's why you can't catch him.  I <u>know</u> what she looks like -- the red-headed woman in my computer.
L144574 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ I don't look at pictures.  I look at the <u>real thing</u>.  I don't feel infected.
L144573 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I am not going to look at any more pictures.  They're like a disease. They get into my head.  I can't get them out.
L144560 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Show what?  It's gone.  He wrote a self destruct virus into the code, so it would only play until we try to copy it.  Then it erased itself. Gone...  Do you remember what you saw?
L144559 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ We'll show that to...
L144553 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ <u>He</u> won't.
L144552 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ One officer already got killed trying to protect me.  Please, just take it all away.  Leave me alone.
L144551 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ I'm going to put a guard on your door.
L144546 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ It's too big a file to copy to a disk.
L144545 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Can you make a copy we can show on our computers?
L144539 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Look at the bottom of the screen. You see the icon with the arrow pointing left?  Click on that... twice.
L144538 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ How do you know that?
L144513 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Work with me.
L144512 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ If you knew why, you might know where to look for him. I don't envy you this; he's not done -- he's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush.  Now, I've done what you asked me.
L144511 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Why imitate a dead serial killer?
L144507 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I sent Andy out on murder missions. For God's sake -- it's the Boston Strangler, Alber deSalvo.  He used their own stockings to strangle them.  Tied in a bow-knot.
L144506 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ How did you know they were stockings?
L144505 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Where are the stockings he strangled them with?
L144504 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Nothing.
L144503 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ The bodies have been carefully arranged... different positions, but somehow the same.  The positions are brutal... yet quite... artful.  It's like... a signature.  He's proud of his accomplishments.  There are early Picassos and late Picassos, but you always recognize the hand.  He wants us to recognize <u>his</u> hand. I've seen this hand before... what are you hiding?
L144502 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ He felt remorse.  He covered her.
L144501 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ How do you know that?
L144500 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ It was a lover or a husband. Someone close.  Somebody who knew her and cared about her.
L144499 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ For months... last October.
L144498 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Is it an ongoing case?
L144400 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ You can't go out lecturing?  Tough shit.  Women are dying.  Where can I lay this stuff out?
L144399 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Will you go.  Andy, make them go.
L144398 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Well, it's a hell of an apartment you got here.  I'm living one step away from the projects, myself, but I get to go to work every day, wading in blood and guts.  I guess the books you wrote about these sons of bitches paid off pretty good.
L144397 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Inspector Halloran, that is so much bullshit, you don't like or admire me, but the beautiful part is I don't give a fuck.  That's the upside of having a breakdown.
L144396 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ I think you are.  I really admire everything you've done; it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the help we can get, especially yours.
L144395 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.
L144394 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Would you want to work with us on this?
L144393 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.
L144392 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Sugar and cream for Goetz; I take mine black.  You're absolutely correct.  The politicians don't want panic headlines spoiling the Festival of Love.
L144391 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Yes, I did.  Poor impulse control. The accounts of the firs two murders made it so clear they were the work of the same man, but you kept announcing they were unrelated.  You'll never catch him that way.
L144390 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ <u>You</u> called <u>us</u>, Doctor Hudson.
L144389 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ You don't admire me.  No police admire me.  I got one of you killed.  Why don't you say right out what you're here for?
L144388 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ I want to tell you it's a great honor to meet you and talk to you.
L144383 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ What calls?  I haven't made any calls.
L144382 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Because of your phone calls.
L144381 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ If he's not out, why are they here?
L144380 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Who?
L144379 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Is he out?
L144378 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Ring the gong, he goes.  Poor impulse control.
L144345 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ That's an opinion, not evidence...
L144344 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I think this is number three...
L144343 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Do you have any evidence to report, ma'am?  Do you know any of the victims...
L144342 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ You're calling me a crank?
L144341 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ No, ma'am.  This is no joke.  And neither is tying up telephone lines to police with crank calls while people in trouble are trying to get through for help.
L144337 +++$+++ u4631 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ M.J. +++$+++ Inspector Halloran, Homicide.  I'm in charge here.
L144336 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Who is this?
L144835 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ What else?
L144834 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ You take it, hang on to it, it'll make you feel safer.  Stay put.
L144833 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ They taught me at the FBI.  I was very good at it.  It scared me... I liked it.
L144832 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ You know how to use this?
L144827 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ I know, baby.  I know.
L144826 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ He was in my apartment!
L144825 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Why don't you shoot off the lock?
L144824 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ Open the door.  Please.
L144764 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Go and look for a note.
L144763 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ They all have one...
L144762 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Is there a phone booth there?
L144761 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ Yes.
L144760 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Listen to me.  Is there a gas station nearby?
L144759 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ <u>What</u>?...
L144758 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Don't hang up!
L144753 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ She on the passenger side?
L144752 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ Yes.  I have to go...
L144751 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ It's a woman shot in a car?
L144617 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Will you stay?  Please?  I'm afraid to sleep... I don't want...<u>him</u>...in my head...
L144616 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ I'll get a locksmith.
L144615 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ The lock...
L144613 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ Shhh.  It's okay.  Just breathe. I'll fix it...
L144612 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Don't let go... I can't breathe... I'll die!
L144609 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ I'm falling!  I'm going to fall!
L144608 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ Tell me what to do!
L144602 +++$+++ u4630 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ HELEN +++$+++ Well.  Another time, then.  I'll be all right.  He's not going to attack me; what I' m rally afraid of is all in my own head, Ruben.
L144601 +++$+++ u4636 +++$+++ m306 +++$+++ RUBEN +++$+++ The problem for me is... you're in the witness category.  Know what I mean?
