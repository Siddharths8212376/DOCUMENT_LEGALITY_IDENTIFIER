L172386 +++$+++ u823 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ Are you sure you're not tired?
L172379 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ Not at all.  When I was a boy back on the farm I used to pump my own water.
L172378 +++$+++ u823 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ Are you getting tired?
L172377 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ This is a fine thing to be doing at my age.

L172253 +++$+++ u823 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ Carry out this tragic folly if you will -- But I for one will not be a part of it.  I will stay here in Freedonia.
L172252 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ You keep that up and you'll crab the whole war.
L172073 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ You couldn't hang me in your bedroom -- I'll make a note of it.  Where's my secretary?

L172332 +++$+++ u822 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ TRENTINO +++$+++ Oh yes! -- UPSTART!
L172331 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ No... it was a seven letter word.

L172321 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ Nothing doing!!  I've taken a lease on the battlefield.  I'd lose my deposit, besides, I've already ordered the ammunition...

L172070 +++$+++ u822 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ TRENTINO +++$+++ You don't understand.  This is my niece Vera.

L172068 +++$+++ u822 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ TRENTINO +++$+++ Excellency, may I present my niece.
L172067 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ Why yes.  I met you at the dog races -- say, you could have won that race if you tried a little harder.
L172066 +++$+++ u822 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ TRENTINO +++$+++ Your Excellency, haven't we met before?
L172065 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll give you Mrs. Teasdale as security.  or my jackknife.  If you want my advice, you'll take the jackknife... I've a better proposition...  Make it $25 and I'll give you a first mortgage on my son and I hope you foreclose.
L172064 +++$+++ u822 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ TRENTINO +++$+++ $50?
L172063 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ Well, in the meantime, could you let me have $50 personally?
L172062 +++$+++ u822 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ TRENTINO +++$+++ Twenty million dollars is a considerable sum...  I'll have to discuss that with my Minister of Finance.
L172061 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ I'll keep the greetings -- but you can send back the good will... what we need right now is twenty million dollars.
L172060 +++$+++ u822 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ TRENTINO +++$+++ I bring you the greetings of my President and the good will of my people.
L172059 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ That's even a greater honor.

L172520 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ You know I think they think I should be king.  Although it would please me to govern the throng, suppose I were king and then everything went wrong.
L172399 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ You satisfied your selfish whims, while nations tottered, dynasties rocked and the world plunged headlong into a chasm of chaos and oblivion --  Not bad, eh?
L172398 +++$+++ u821 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ MRS. TEASDALE +++$+++ But -
L172397 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --
L172396 +++$+++ u821 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ MRS. TEASDALE +++$+++ I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
L172395 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
L172394 +++$+++ u821 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ MRS. TEASDALE +++$+++ I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War.
L172393 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ WHAT  ?
L172392 +++$+++ u821 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ MRS. TEASDALE +++$+++ My purse has been stolen -- the plans of war are in it.
L172391 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ That's all right.  I'll fix you right up.
L172390 +++$+++ u821 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ MRS. TEASDALE +++$+++ Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened.
L172389 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ Take a seat -- you're next. 
L172388 +++$+++ u821 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ MRS. TEASDALE +++$+++ I hope I'm not interrupting.
L172347 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ You can call me Gloria too.  Gloria -- what a beautiful name.  When I was born my mother named me Gloria -- two minutes later she found out her mistake...
L172346 +++$+++ u821 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ MRS. TEASDALE +++$+++ Why -- why -- of course.
L172345 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ Gloria -- may I call you Gloria?
L172343 +++$+++ u821 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ MRS. TEASDALE +++$+++ Oh, your Excellency, you take me off my feet.
L172342 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ Well -- they might come better but they don't come any bigger... and the bigger the better.  The bigger the betta you've got on a horse, the more you lose, and speaking about horses, why don't you marry me. Come, come -- say yes and you'll never see me again.  I'll go 'way if it means your happiness...
L172341 +++$+++ u821 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ MRS. TEASDALE +++$+++ Now -- er --
L172340 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ Guard them with your life... don't leave them out of your sight...  If the enemy gets those papers  we're lost.  If they don't get them, we're lost.  Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you?  I love you...   Mrs. Teasdale, you're the salt of the earth.  They don't come any better than you...
L172325 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ Well, maybe I am a little headstrong...  But, you know, it's awfully hard to forget what he called me. 
L172324 +++$+++ u821 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ MRS. TEASDALE +++$+++ Oh, won't you reconsider...
L172317 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ Let him patch up his own breeches...
L172316 +++$+++ u821 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ MRS. TEASDALE +++$+++ But Your Excellency -- the Ambassador is here on a friendly visit...  He came to ask you to patch up the breach.
L172315 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ So -- you've come to ask for clemency! I'll give the enemy no quarter -- not a dime...
L172234 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ I wouldn't know what to say either if I was in your place.  Maybe you can suggest something.
L172233 +++$+++ u821 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ MRS. TEASDALE +++$+++ Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say.
L172232 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ All I can offer you is a Rufus over your head.
L172231 +++$+++ u821 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ MRS. TEASDALE +++$+++ Oh, Rufus!
L172117 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ He did?... I told my son not to leave it laying around... Where is son?
L172116 +++$+++ u821 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ MRS. TEASDALE +++$+++ Why, that's the speech that Lincoln made at Gettysburg...
L172115 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ I wrote a speech last night that'll knock them off their seats...  Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation --
L172114 +++$+++ u821 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ MRS. TEASDALE +++$+++ Your Excellency, you mustn't forget your appointment at the House of Representatives... Have you got your speech ready?
L172113 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ That's what I get for dressing in a hurry.
L172112 +++$+++ u821 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ MRS. TEASDALE +++$+++ You've made a wonderful impression. Your views are liberal... It is easy to see you have an open mind.
L172099 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ These are the laws of my administration: No one's allowed to smoke or tell a dirty joke -- And whistling is forbidden...
L172098 +++$+++ u821 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ MRS. TEASDALE +++$+++ If it's not asking too much --  For our information just for illustration  Tell us how you intend to run the nation.
L172097 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I couldn't handle any more.
L172096 +++$+++ u821 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ MRS. TEASDALE +++$+++ Your Excellency, the eyes of the world are upon you.  Notables from every land are gathered here in your honor --  This is a gala day for us.
L172056 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ You're not so bad yourself, Mrs. Teasdale, when I look at you I can see that we're facing a crisis. We've got to balance the budget -- we've got to cut down everything including, you.
L172055 +++$+++ u821 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ MRS. TEASDALE +++$+++ Your Excellency!
L172054 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ No wonder he passed away.  I'd like to be with you to the very end. Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you -- I love you.
L172053 +++$+++ u821 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ MRS. TEASDALE +++$+++ Why - er -- my husband passed away...  I was with him to the very end.
L172052 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ I haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me.  Not that I care -- but where is your husband?
L172051 +++$+++ u821 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ MRS. TEASDALE +++$+++ The future of Freedonia rests upon you.  Promise me you will follow in my husband's footsteps.
L172050 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ Well, I won't stand for much.  And I won't stand for you if you don't show some improvement soon.  Look at your report card last month -- "D" in spelling...  six in behavior. Now who were the six?  A fine state of affairs -- no wonder you can't matriculate, now what were you saying?
L172049 +++$+++ u821 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ MRS. TEASDALE +++$+++ In choosing you, I feel that I serve my country well.  I heartily endorse everything you stand for.
L172046 +++$+++ u820 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ GROUCHO +++$+++ You can keep it -- I've got a whole pack...  Now what were you saying?
L172045 +++$+++ u821 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ MRS. TEASDALE +++$+++ What'll I do with this card?
L172307 +++$+++ u822 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ TRENTINO +++$+++ For you, I would do anything... 
L172306 +++$+++ u821 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ MRS. TEASDALE +++$+++ Oh, would you...?
L172305 +++$+++ u822 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ TRENTINO +++$+++ Mrs. Teasdale, I'm willing to pocket my pride and do anything I can to make up with his Excellency.
L172248 +++$+++ u821 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ MRS. TEASDALE +++$+++ This is terrible!
L172247 +++$+++ u822 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ TRENTINO +++$+++ I shall report this indignity the my President.  Mrs. Teasdale,  I feel this regrettable occurrence will plunge our countries into war.
L172238 +++$+++ u822 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ TRENTINO +++$+++ I didn't come here to be insulted.
L172237 +++$+++ u821 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ MRS. TEASDALE +++$+++ Gentlemen!  Gentlemen!
L172227 +++$+++ u822 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ TRENTINO +++$+++ Gloria -- I've waited for years.  I won't be put off!  I love you!  I want you!  Can't you see that I'm at your feet?
L172226 +++$+++ u821 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ MRS. TEASDALE +++$+++ Well no -- not exactly -- but --
L172225 +++$+++ u822 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ TRENTINO +++$+++ Oh.  Then there his somebody else?
L172224 +++$+++ u821 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ MRS. TEASDALE +++$+++ Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --
L172223 +++$+++ u822 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ TRENTINO +++$+++ ...but would further cement the relations of our countries.
L172022 +++$+++ u822 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ TRENTINO +++$+++ Mrs. Teasdale -- no matter who rules Freedonia, to me you will always be the first lady of the land.
L172021 +++$+++ u821 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ MRS. TEASDALE +++$+++ Ambassador!  I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.
L172020 +++$+++ u822 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ TRENTINO +++$+++ What is money?  Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything.
L172019 +++$+++ u821 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ MRS. TEASDALE +++$+++ Your uncle has been such a friend to us in every crisis.  Without his country's financial aid --
L172309 +++$+++ u822 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ TRENTINO +++$+++ Perhaps he will listen to you...
L172308 +++$+++ u823 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ If only we can get his Excellency to listen to reason...
L172299 +++$+++ u823 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ Maybe you can still win the old dame over -- why not try to --
L172298 +++$+++ u822 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ TRENTINO +++$+++ Fine nothing!  I didn't want war... My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale and overthrow Firefly.
L172297 +++$+++ u823 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ I thought everything was working out fine.
L172296 +++$+++ u822 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ TRENTINO +++$+++ This is all Firefly's fault -- that idiot, that fool...
L172251 +++$+++ u823 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ It is every woman's problem.  Who supplies the sons? -- the brothers? -- the husbands?  Who...
L172250 +++$+++ u822 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ TRENTINO +++$+++ My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a woman's problem.
L172249 +++$+++ u823 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ Uncle, you can't do this!
L172029 +++$+++ u822 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ TRENTINO +++$+++ That's where you come in.  I'll leave him in your hands, and don't forget you're supposed to be my niece.
L172028 +++$+++ u823 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.
L172027 +++$+++ u822 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ TRENTINO +++$+++ With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control -- 
L172026 +++$+++ u823 +++$+++ m52 +++$+++ VERA +++$+++ So that's the one you want to marry.
L180382 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good.
L180381 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
L180380 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.
L180379 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.
L180375 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Oh, yes.
L180374 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ I've always thought that myself.
L180373 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ They have noble faces.
L180370 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ How lovely.
L180369 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ And here is one of Frederick's mother.
L180352 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Oh?
L180351 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Oh yes. You have so many nice things, and so much room.
L180348 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Two, please.
L180347 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ One or two?
L180346 +++$+++ u832 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ MERRICK +++$+++ Yes please, two.
L180345 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Mr. Merrick, sugar?
L180508 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Oh Frederick.
L180507 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ ...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
L180506 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
L180505 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
L180504 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
L180503 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ That I am very little different from him.
L180502 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
L180501 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.
L180500 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ ...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.
L180499 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Hmmm?
L180498 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ More romances for John?
L180497 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.
L180496 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ You stay with me.
L180372 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ And here are my mother and father.
L180371 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Yes.
L180350 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Do you?
L180349 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ John loves the house.
L180168 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ I've only got until two o'clock tomorrow afternoon, when Carr Gomm meets him. Somehow, between now and then I've got to make John Merrick at least seem like an intelligent man... Why am I fooling myself? Nothing short of John delivering the Sermon on the Mount is going to sway Carr Gomm...
L180167 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Well, these things take time.
L180166 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ I'm sorry... I don't know either. I just don't know.
L180165 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ I'm sure I don't know, Freddie.
L180164 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?
L180163 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Perhaps you're just polishing a stone, endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he doesn't possess?
L180162 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ I don't know. I can't explain it. If this is an intelligent man, trapped in the body of a monster, then I'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind, free that spirit as best I can, to help him live as full and content a life as possible. But! If he's an imbecile, who's body I can't treat and who's mind I can't touch, well, then my obligation is discharged. They can put him where they will; he won't be bothered, I won't be bothered, and everyone's conscience can remain free and untroubled. And that is my dilemma... what is in his mind?
L180161 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Frederick, why are you so interested in this particular case?
L180160 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ He is. I mean, I've always thought he was. I think he must be. Is he simple? Or is that just something I've wished upon him to make things simpler for myself?
L180159 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?
L180158 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Well, I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me.
L180157 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ What do you mean?
L180156 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.
L180155 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged.
L179960 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ No, I think a whiskey.
L179959 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
L179958 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
L179957 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ Did it go well, darling?
L179847 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ I'll join you shortly.
L179846 +++$+++ u824 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ ANNE +++$+++ You won't be long?
L179972 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ I'll get my bag.
L179971 +++$+++ u825 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Like this. 
L179970 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ What is it?
L179969 +++$+++ u825 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Our man is sick. Come right away.
L179889 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Did you see it?
L179888 +++$+++ u825 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ I found it.
L179887 +++$+++ u838 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ TREVES +++$+++ Yes?
L179886 +++$+++ u825 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ BOY +++$+++ Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir.
L180635 +++$+++ u826 +++$+++ m53 +++$+++ BYTES +++$+++ Shut up!
