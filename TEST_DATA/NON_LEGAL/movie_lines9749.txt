L164224 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ We can still use my butter money.
L164223 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Well -- what are we going to do?
L164216 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ If it would only move old Miser Stevens -- We've still got to pay him.
L164215 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ That's wonderful language. It would move a stone.
L164214 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ " ... and if the final vote shall leave thousands of our fellow citizens and their families in hopeless distress, can we -- members of the Government -- go to our beds with a clear conscience, can we, without self- reproach, supplicate the Almighty Mercy to forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors?
L164170 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ It's Tom Sharp and two other fellers -- Oh, glory -- where's my pants?
L164169 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Who is it?
L164168 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Well, I'll be -- there's a rig, turning in, by the gate.
L164158 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Hold the splint tighter -- it's almost done.  Go on reading, Ma. This man, Job, he had troubles, didn't he?
L164157 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ He's stubborn as a Stone.
L164152 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ That's what we said.
L164151 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Jabez, don't you remember your own wedding? We said it's for better or worse. We said it's for richer or poorer.
L164150 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ I remember Dad used to say sometimes, when they were handing out hard luck, the farmers got there first.
L164149 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Yep.
L164148 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Oh, Jabez.
L164147 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ I think his leg is broken.
L164140 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ You're right, Mary.
L164139 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Now, Jabez! I've got on my Sunday bonnet and I'm going to church with my husband. Almost the first time since the beginning of winter -- and if that isn't an occasion, I don't know what is.
L164138 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ What is that smile on your face?  Is there anything wrong with me?
L164134 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ All right -- only he needn't dirty my pants!
L164133 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ He only wants you to throw the stick for him, Jabez. I guess he's feeling the spring a-coming, too.
L164132 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Down, Shep! Down!
L164131 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Coming.
L164130 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Jabez -- help!
L165025 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ Of course it's all right, son. You had Daniel Webster, didn't ye?  Breakfast's ready!  I've made a special surprise for Mr. Webster.
L165024 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Ma -- Ma -- it's all right, Ma!
L164915 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ Gone with Daniel Webster -- to Marshfield, son.... You told Mary to go--
L164914 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Ma! ...  Where's Mary ... and little Dan'l?
L164913 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ My son ... what's the matter?
L164654 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ And I say she won't! I'll not have the scorn of God on this place -- with the smell of fish in it, polluting up the Sabbath!  And as for you -- let me tell you, young woman...!
L164653 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ I want you to fix these fish!
L164604 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Sure, Ma.
L164603 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ You go down and see what's keeping Dorothy.
L164594 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ Fiddlesticks! She don't hear it. Got better music to listen to than that.  There -- that's what I mean.
L164593 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Golly, Ma --  Consarn that music! Shouldn't a-had the harvest festival tonight.
L164592 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ You'll be a father any minute now.
L164591 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Ma -- is she? --
L164569 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Make out? We'll do better than that!  I never thought I'd be glad for bad luck, but I am. I never thought I'd be glad of a hail storm at harvest time, but I am! Oh, bless ye the works of the Lord in the hail and the storm and the rain!
L164568 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ Now that's the way to talk, Son! I know you worked hard for that crop. But we'll make out.
L164567 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ I say -- it don't matter.
L164566 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ What's that you say, Son?
L164565 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ It don't matter!
L164564 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ Oh, here you are, Jabez. Lan's, I was worried about you.... Hail in August! The crops will be ruined!
L164553 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ A man can always change things, Son. That's what makes him different from barnyard critters.
L164552 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Ma -- and yet, a man could change that, couldn't he?
L164551 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ You see, son? I'm old and I've lived. When a man gets his money in bad ways -- when he sees the better course and takes the worse -- then the devil is in his heart -- and that fixes him.
L164550 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ Wouldn't profit him none.
L164549 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ I know, Ma, but -- Suppose a man got his money in bad ways --
L164548 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ Why, that's just sense, Son. Now a man like Daniel Webster -- guess they pay him high for what he does. But he's worth it -- and he helps others. Makes all the difference.
L164547 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Do you really think that?
L164546 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ I figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it, Son.
L164545 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Money -- money's a funny thing, ain't it, Ma?
L164544 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Me -- a son.
L164543 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ Lan's, I'd think you was having the baby, to hear you.
L164542 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ I feel -- fidgety, Ma -- not right at all.
L164541 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ Well, thank the Lord you can always depend on New England for weather. We've got enough for the whole United States.
L164540 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Queer sort of weather we're having -- queer like everything else.
L164538 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ Oh, go along with you! As if it mattered to a grandma! But p'raps you got an even chance.
L164537 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ My son! Do you really think, Ma....
L164536 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ It won't be the first baby ever born in this house.  There! Made me drop a stitch!  Sit down, you make me nervous!  Lan's, that's the way a man always is. Thinks his son's the most important thing in the world.
L164516 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Now look here, Ma. I'm not a boy anymore. I want that understood. I don't aim to stay a one-horse farmer the rest of my life. Mary's got to be the kind of wife a -- a big man needs --
L164515 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ Well, son, I'm glad to see a Stone come up in the world again.
L164324 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Say, Mary, how is your shoulder?
L164323 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ Well -- that's comforting!  Supper.
L164319 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ But it's true. Take 'em up in your hands, Mary -- feel 'em -- they're real all right.  Aren't you glad?
L164318 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ Most outlandish thing I ever heard tell.  Don't seem right, somehow!
L164317 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Yes -- I was getting the seed -- I stumbled -- I saw one of the boards warped up a bit -- and -- there it was.
L164316 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ You found it in the barn, hey?
L164260 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ I can't help it. I mean it, I tell you. I've had more than my share. Nothing ever goes right for me -- nothing!
L164259 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ Hush up such talk, Jabez!
L164258 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ And why should I? Let him howl if it makes him feel good.  Consarn it. He's better off than I am! I wish I could tell Him...  ... up there, just what I think.
L164257 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ Well ... make him keep quiet.
L164256 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ I dunno.
L164255 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ What's ailing that dog?
L164246 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ All right, son -- if it helps.
L164245 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Helps sometimes to say it.
L164244 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ That's a word you're too free with lately, Jabez, consarn this and consarn that ...
L164243 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Yes -- and you figgered right, consarn it!
L164242 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
L164241 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ How'd you know to have the calf ready, Ma?
L164164 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ Not on the Sabbath you won't, Jabez!
L164163 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ There! Guess that ought to hold good. Put him down here, by the fire, Mary.  But we don't want to get him too close -- we'll have roast pork for supper.
L164162 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ That's right, Ma -- we ain't licked yet. A Stone's never licked till he's dead -- that's what Dad used to say, didn't he, Ma?
L164161 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ Now, Jabez Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well, we made New England out of it. That and codfish.
L164160 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Hard luck -- like me.
L164159 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ You know that, son.
L164156 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Sorry, Ma -- but this consar-- this little pig --  He won't let me fix him --
L164155 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ Jabez! What kind of talk is that for the Sabbath? And me a-reading the holy word!
L164154 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Consarn the consarn --
L164153 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ "There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God and eschewed evil."
L164674 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Belle, give the Sheriff a cup of rum.
L164673 +++$+++ u4834 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Jabez -- seems  like I've been hearing talk around. Reverend Harper thinks more Cross Corners folk oughter be in church, Sabbath morning.
L164672 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Come in, Sheriff.
L164490 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Very well, folks. I accept.
L164489 +++$+++ u4834 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ It seems such an obvious candidature to us all.
L164330 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ And you didn't get it, hey? Come on, we'll have another talk with him.
L164329 +++$+++ u4834 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.
L164328 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Hello, Sheriff.
L164221 +++$+++ u4834 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ The law is the law. Good-bye, Mary.
L164220 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ Let him try it.
L164219 +++$+++ u4834 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Wish I could really do something for you. But you know Stevens. He'll throw you off your farm tomorrow if you don't pay him tonight.
L164218 +++$+++ u4828 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ JABEZ +++$+++ It's all right, Sheriff.
L164217 +++$+++ u4834 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SHERIFF +++$+++ Yep -- you can't get around that mortgage. -- I'm sorry, Jabez.
L164815 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I won't forget.
L164814 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ Be sure to let me know if Daniel is over there.
L164813 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ Ah, fiddlesticks -- you are old enough to know what you are doing.
L164812 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You aren't angry with me?
L164811 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ So you've made up your mind to go to the party.
L164716 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I said you should stop worrying because I've made up my mind!
L164715 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ What's that?
L164714 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Worried about me! Well, you just stop it!
L164713 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all.
L164712 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Now, Ma -- You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself.
L164711 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ Fox hunting -- a Stone going fox hunting on a week day -- and the earth crying out for the touch of him!
L164652 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Jabez -- for the good of your soul ... please come with us.
L164651 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ She'll do nothing of the kind! She's going to church with me, right away!
L164649 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Yes, Ma -- I'm ready --
L164648 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ Mary! Ready? First bell's a-ringing!
L164629 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ What mountain?
L164628 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.
L164627 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ What a nice -- and kind girl --  Who is she --?
L164503 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ Yes, Mrs. Slossum told me -- Lucy can't even keep a secret -- Selectman -- my son -- well, who would have thought of that?
L164502 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You know, Ma, why the Squire came to see Jabez?
L164321 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ H'm. Hessian gold. Well -- hope it'll do us more good than it did the Hessians.
L164320 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I'll try hard -- I just can't take it all in.
L164265 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Yes, Jabez -- don't worry.
L164264 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ Let her be, son. She'll do all right. You better get yourself straightened out.
L164167 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ Land sakes, I don't mind. I never did hold much with Job, even if he is Scripture. He took on too much to suit me. I don't want to malign the man, but he always sounded to me as if he came from Massachusetts. Yes, Mary, you go ahead and read.
L164166 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ That is -- if you don't mind changing the lesson, Ma.
L164145 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ I guess we won't.
L164144 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ Well, I guess we won't be going to church today.
L164137 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Coming, Ma.
L164136 +++$+++ u4829 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MA STONE +++$+++ Mary -- Jabez --
L164135 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You throw mighty far, Jabez -- almost into the pigsty.
L164411 +++$+++ u4830 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Yes, sir -- I guess I do -- Gee --
L164410 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ Of course. And you tell your father for me -- we may be on opposite sides of the fence, but I'm always glad to hear of a man who holds to his own opinions. As long as people do that -- the country's all right. Do you understand, Martin?
L164409 +++$+++ u4830 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Gee, would you, Mr. Webster? Honest?
L164408 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ Well, Martin, I only wear them in Washington -- that's the trouble. But if you ever come down there, I'll show them to you.
L164407 +++$+++ u4830 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARTIN +++$+++ Martin Van Buren Aldrich and my Pa's the only Democrat in Cross Corners. He said you had horns and a tall, Mr. Webster, but I ain't seen 'em yet.
L164406 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ What are you looking for, Colonel?  What's your name?
L165034 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ She'll be here in a moment. She has a special surprise for you.
L165033 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ There is nothing like a good old country breakfast. Where's Ma?
L164928 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ I'll do my best, Mary.
L164927 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Mr. Webster -- you will help him?
L164926 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ Mary -- what love and trust could do for your husband, you've done. And frankly, in a very few moments, this is going to be no place for a lady.
L164925 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Jabez ...
L164870 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ Are you, Mary?  Well, I guess I'm glad myself -- seeing as how you feel this way.  Party seems to be quite a success.  Lots of guests, anyhow.
L164869 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Oh -- Mr. Webster -- I'm so glad you came!
L164741 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ And now come on, Mary. I want to show you the all-fired biggest parsnips in the whole United States, raised right here in Marshfield -- of course!
L164740 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Oh, could you, Mr. Webster ?
L164739 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ Mary -- you've talked to me as you might have talked to your father and I believe he wants me to help you a little. You see, sometimes we think we're licked in this life -- but we weren't put here to be licked. Don't you believe it. Sometimes the shadows seem to get hold of us -- the shadows and the evil -- but it is still up to us to fight. Now I was thinking before you came, of coming over to Cross Corners end of the month, to get acquainted with my Godson -- and other things.
L164738 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ You see, I don't care if we are rich or poor -- I don't care if we're big or small, all I care about is Jabez. He was the first man I loved. He never used to care about money -- we were poor as Job's turkey, but none of us minded. Now I've seen him drive the poor from the door, and we used to be poor ourselves. I've seen him get hard and mean, and he isn't hard or mean. I've heard him mock at the church bells -- the bells that rang for our wedding. That's not like him, Mr. Webster -- It must be my fault somehow -- my fault.
L164737 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ You don't have to defend him to me, Mary -- I've been called names myself.
L164736 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Mr. Webster, you mustn't believe all that people say.
L164735 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ I've heard some odd things about Jabez lately -- he seems to make the wrong kind of name for himself.
L164734 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Why -- yes -- it's hard to put it into words, Mr. Webster. There's this matter of little Daniel's schooling and the new house -- and well -- there's something else that's wrong -- it gets worse, year after year -- it's like a shadow growing -- I can't really talk about it, even to Ma -- she puts it all on Jabez and I won't stand for that.
L164733 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ Yes, you've chatted a lot, woman-like nibbling around the edge -- But, Mary, forgive an old lawyer's legal mind, I don't think you ever once came to the point. And there is a point, isn't there?
L164732 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Goodness, Mr. Webster, I've done nothing but talk about that all through dinner.
L164731 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ No, you wouldn't -- You're not the sort of woman that's afraid of smoke -- or fire -- But now let's talk about your affairs.
L164730 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ Of course not --
L164729 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ Well -- she hardly ever comes here -- she's not the type of woman who cares to live in the country. Yes -- I'm all on my own -- sometimes it makes you feel a little lonely --  Do you mind if I indulge?
L164728 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ No, really, thank you. -- Is Mrs. Webster coming back soon?
L164727 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ Well Mary, it's too bad I didn't know -- I would have given you a real dinner, but with my wife being in Washington -- Have another piece of pie -- 
L164431 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ -- I'm going to try, Mr. Webster.
L164430 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ You've got a smart man, Mrs. Stone. Hang onto him.
L164429 +++$+++ u4831 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ MARY +++$+++ It is.
L164726 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ Why, that's different!  Well, boys, I guess we'll knock off. I've got to see a friend.
L164725 +++$+++ u4832 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ OLD FARMHAND'S VOICE +++$+++ Just someone from New Hampshire!
L164724 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ If it's the British Minister, take him around to the pantry and give him some Madeira --
L164723 +++$+++ u4832 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ OLD FARMHAND'S VOICE +++$+++ Someone to see you, Dan'l!
L164722 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ Hullooo!
L164721 +++$+++ u4832 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ OLD FARMHAND'S VOICE +++$+++ Hey there, Dan'l! Black Dan'l!
L165016 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ Why, you long-barreled, slab-sided, lantern- jawed, note-shaving crook, be off with you ...
L165015 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ My congratulations -- as between two gentlemen.
L164985 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ I object.
L164984 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ Your Honor -- gentlemen of the jury -- this case need not detain us long. It concerns one thing alone -- the transference, barter and sale of a certain piece of property, to wit, his soul by Jabez Stone. That transference, barter or sale is attested by a deed. I offer that deed in evidence and mark it Exhibit A.
L164973 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ I'll drink to that, Mr. Scratch!
L164972 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ The quick or the dead! You have said it.  May -- the best man win, Mr. Webster!
L164971 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ Let it be the quick or the dead -- So it is an American judge and an American jury!
L164970 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ Very well. -- You shall have your trial, Mr. Webster. The case is hardly one for an ordinary jury --
L164969 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ I do! If I can't win this case with a jury, you shall have me, too. If two New Hampshire men aren't a match for the devil, we'd better give this country back to the Indians.
L164968 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ You mean -- a jury trial?
L164967 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ Then I stand on the Constitution! I demand a trial for my client.
L164966 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ And who with better right? When the first wrong was done to the first Indian, I was there. When the first slaver put out for the Congo, I stood on the deck. Am I not spoken of, still, in every church in New England? 'Tis true, the North claims me for a Southerner, and the South for a Northerner, but I am neither. To tell the truth, Mr. Webster, though I don't like to boast of it, my name is older in the country than yours.
L164965 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ Well, I never heard the dev-- of your claiming American citizenship.
L164964 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ Foreign? And who calls me a foreigner?
L164963 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ H'm. This appears -- I say appears -- to be properly drawn. But you shall not have this man! A man isn't property! Mr. Stone is an American citizen, and no American citizen may be forced into the service of a foreign prince.
L164962 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ There, Mr. Webster.  All open and above-board and in due and legal form.
L164961 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ Not so fast, Mr. Scratch. Produce your evidence -- if you have it.
L164960 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ Your spirited efforts on behalf of your clients do you credit, Mr. Webster -- If you have no more arguments to adduce I'll take him along now.
L164948 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ Cup for cup!
L164947 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ Talk has never proved that question, Mr. Webster!  Cup for cup -- what do you say?
L164946 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ There isn't enough Medford rum in the whole of New Hampshire to make me sleepy. 
L164945 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ Oh ..  not that you ever get drunk! No, indeed! But a kind of overpowering lassitude or, more plainly, a deep and enveloping sleep.
L164944 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ Me?
L164943 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ It even kicked back -- once at you, didn't it?
L164942 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ Why, certainly -- but be careful, Mr. Scratch -- Medford rum has an uncanny habit of kicking back, even with old-timers like yourself. 
L164941 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ Scratch will do for the evening. May I -- join you?
L164940 +++$+++ u4839 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ WEBSTER +++$+++ Attorney of record for Jabez Stone. Might I ask your name?
L164939 +++$+++ u4833 +++$+++ m322 +++$+++ SCRATCH +++$+++ Mr. Webster, I presume?
