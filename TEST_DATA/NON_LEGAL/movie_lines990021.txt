L293907 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Oh, it isn't your fault, Amy. You're the one person who's been standing by me through all this.
L293906 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ ...I'm sorry.
L293905 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story.
L293904 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Let me hold it, or you'll have a real shiner.
L293903 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Sid found me the icepack.
L293902 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Let me look.
L293901 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Oh. Nothing, really, just... the more timid investors are no longer running for cover.
L293900 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ ...What happened?
L293811 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ I bet that's exactly what she tells herself! But you and I both know she's just a dried-up bitter old maid. Say, how about you and I grab a little dinner and a show after work? I was thinking maybe The King and I --
L293810 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
L293809 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline?
L293808 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Smitty.
L293807 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Yeah, you know. Probably dresses in men's clothing, swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole, and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named Biff or Smoocher or...
L293806 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Oh, is that it!
L293805 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Yeah, you know. Suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays. Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it? She's probably very unattractive and bitter about it.
L293804 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.
L293803 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Yeah, you know, probably one of these fast-talking career gals, thinks she's one of the boys. Probably is one of the boys, if you know what I mean.
L293802 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Confused?
L293800 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Well, it's done now -- what's the use of grousing about it. Forget the letter, Amy, I just had to blow off some steam...
L293799 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Sure, but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record!
L293798 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Well, she probably had a deadline...
L293797 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Well, I don't know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man.
L293796 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's just doing her job, I guess.
L293795 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ ...Why don't I just type this up...
L293794 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ ...You know! For kids!
L293792 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Oh sure, you're biased -- you're a fellow Muncian. But would an imbecile come up with this?
L293791 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Well, I --
L293790 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Go on, tell the truth; I trust you and I put a lot of stock in your opinion.
L293789 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I'm sure I --
L293788 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ ...Well, you know me, Amy, at least better than that that dame does. Do you think I'm an imbecile?
L293787 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Is that all, Mr. Barnes?
L293786 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ -- these preposterous inventions, would be better suited to the pages of Amazing Tales Magazine. If the editors of the Manhattan Argus see fit to publish the rantings of a disordered mind, perhaps they will see fit to publish this letter! But I doubt it. I most seriously doubt it. As I doubt also that you could find a home at Amazing Tales, a periodical which I have enjoyed for many years. Yours sincerely, et cetera.
L293785 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ -- or lack thereof?
L293784 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ The picture was fine! It's what that knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath! Of all the irresponsible... Amy, take this down: Dear Miss Archer. I call you 'Miss' because you seem to have 'missed' the boat completely on this one! How on earth would you know whether I'm an imbecile when you don't even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man! No, change 'guts' to 'courage.' No, make it 'common decency.' These wild speculations about my intelligence --
L293783 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Well, I... didn't bother to read the article. I didn't think the picture did you justice.
L293782 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ ...Did you happen to see the front page of today's Manhattan Argus?
L293745 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Please! Norville!
L293744 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Well, I just don't know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes --
L293743 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ -- A Muncie girl! Can you beat that!
L293742 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Of course -- I went to the Muncie, uh, Secretarial Polytechnic!
L293741 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Oh, of all the foolish... Listen, do you take shorthand? Are you familiar with the mimeograph machine?
L293731 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Don't bother to thank me, it's the easiest thing in the world. Matter of fact, I know where a vacancy just came up.
L293730 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Oh, no, really, I --
L293729 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ ...A Muncie girl! Talk about the cat's pyjamas! Tell you what, Amy. I'm gonna cancel the rest of my appointments this afternoon and get you a job here at the Hud.
L293726 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Why yes, do you know it?
L293725 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ You're from Muncie?!
L293714 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Mind if I join you?
L293713 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ -- these were the values that were instilled in me while I was growing up in a little town you've probably never heard of --
L293712 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ No thank you. Seek and ye shall find, work and ye shall prosper -- these were the watch words of my education, the ethics of my tender years --
L293711 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Cigarette?
L293709 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ I myself --
L293708 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ A little naive perhaps but -- thank you -- armed with determination, a solid work ethic, and an indomitable belief in the future --
L293707 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ At any rate I arrived in town not ten days ago, full of dreams and aspirations, anxious to make my way in the world --
L293706 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really --
L293705 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ What a horrible little person.
L293696 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I don't want to bore you with all the sordid details of my life; it's not a happy story...
L293695 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Hungry, anyway.
L293692 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ The couch, please.
L293691 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Not at all. You're light as a feather.
L293690 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I'm sorry we had to take the stairs. It was just that horrible little elevator boy...
L293617 +++$+++ u5964 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ EDITOR +++$+++ Well, do a follow-up: Hoover: Hero or Mama's Boy? The rest of you bums get up off your brains and get me that Idea Man story!
L293616 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I filed it yesterday.
L293615 +++$+++ u5964 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ EDITOR +++$+++ Yeah, well, monkey or not I'm still editor of this rag. Amy, I thought you were doing that piece on the F.B.I. -- J. Edgar Hoover: When Will He Marry?
L293614 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ ...On payday! The only story here is how this guy made a monkey out of you, Al.
L293610 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Sez me! Amy Archer. Why is he an Idea Man -- because Hudsucker says he is? What're his ideas? Why won't they let anyone interview him?...
L293609 +++$+++ u5964 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ EDITOR +++$+++ Sez who?
L293608 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ As a three-dollar bill.
L293607 +++$+++ u5964 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ EDITOR +++$+++ Phony, huh?
L293606 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I tell ya the guy's a phony.
L294144 +++$+++ u5963 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ CHIEF +++$+++ Amy -- take a break. You've worked hard on this story -- heck, you broke it for us! But it's passed you by and Smith here has taken up the slack.
L294143 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ You're fools, both of you! It's obvious they're out to crucify Norville! They're trying to destroy him!
L294142 +++$+++ u5963 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ CHIEF +++$+++ Whatever! It's no dig on you, Archer, but this story is hot and you're no longer on top of it. Why, it's the scoop of the century -- the other papers won't have the Gunderson dope 'til tomorrow -- The Allemeinischer Zeitung, Le Figaro, they'll be choking on our dust come mornin' --
L294136 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Says who?!
L294135 +++$+++ u5963 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ CHIEF +++$+++ Archer, you're a broken record. Fact is Gunderson did design it -- apparently he's some kind of prodigy --
L294131 +++$+++ u5963 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ CHIEF +++$+++ He grins wolfishly.
L294130 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ You can't print that!
L293858 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ It's about a dimwitted editor who --
L293857 +++$+++ u5963 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ CHIEF +++$+++ Watch it, Archer --
L293856 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk.
L293855 +++$+++ u5963 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ CHIEF +++$+++ Whatever. That's what sells newspapers.
L293854 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Muncie.
L293849 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ I don't know...
L293848 +++$+++ u5963 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ CHIEF +++$+++ You don't know anything! Fact is they haven't bought it! The stock is cheap, Archer! What're they waiting for?
L293845 +++$+++ u5963 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ CHIEF +++$+++ It's pure speculation! Why, they'd have my butt in a satchel!
L293844 +++$+++ u5958 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ AMY +++$+++ Why not, it's all true! The board is using this poor guy! They're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap!
L293843 +++$+++ u5963 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ CHIEF +++$+++ I can't print this!
L293477 +++$+++ u5959 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ ANCIENT SORTER +++$+++ Forty-eight years...
L293476 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ How long've you been down here?
L293475 +++$+++ u5959 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ ANCIENT SORTER +++$+++ Nooo, I don't guess you will be.
L293474 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom long.
L293473 +++$+++ u5959 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ ANCIENT SORTER +++$+++ Terrific.
L293469 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ For instance, take a look at this sweet baby...
L293468 +++$+++ u5959 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ ANCIENT SORTER +++$+++ I'm sure you do.
L293467 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ I got big ideas, though!
L293466 +++$+++ u5959 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ ANCIENT SORTER +++$+++ Tell me about it.
L293465 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Ya know, entry level!
L293464 +++$+++ u5959 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ ANCIENT SORTER +++$+++ Terrific.

L294170 +++$+++ u5960 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ BARMAN +++$+++ It's a juice and coffee bar, man, like I been tellin' ya --
L294169 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ What kind of bar is it if ya can't get a martini?!
L294168 +++$+++ u5960 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ BARMAN +++$+++ Yeah, daddy, that's a roger, but we don't sell alcohol.
L294167 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ I thought you served misfits here!
L294166 +++$+++ u5960 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ BARMAN +++$+++ Daddy, it's like I been tellin' ya --
L294165 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ I want a martini! It's New Year's Eve and I want a Martini!

L294272 +++$+++ u5961 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ BENNY +++$+++ What the heck's she doin', Lou?

L294097 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ This is the most idiotic thing I've ever seen in my life!

L294258 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ 'Many years, uh... I know that you will be wondering why I have decided to move on, ending my tenure at Hudsucker, and here on Earth. You will be thinking, Why now, when things are going so well? Granted, from the standpoint of our balance sheet and financials, sure, sure, we're doing fine. However, Sid. These things have long since ceased to give me pleasure. I look at myself now and no longer see the idealistic young man who started this company. Now I see only an empty shell whom others call a 'success.' How has this come to pass? When and why did I trade all of my hopes, dreams and aspirations, for the emptiness of power and wealth? What the heck have I done?
L294257 +++$+++ u5965 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ HUDSUCKER +++$+++ Yeah, yeah, it's the standard resignation boilerplate -- go down to the second paragraph.

L294252 +++$+++ u5965 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ HUDSUCKER +++$+++ Well, why don't ya read it.
L294251 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Yessir.
L294250 +++$+++ u5965 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ HUDSUCKER +++$+++ Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.

L294245 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Huh? Oh, geez, Mr. Hudsucker, I apologize, there was an awful lot of excitement and I guess I must've mislaid --
L294244 +++$+++ u5965 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ HUDSUCKER +++$+++ Anyway. Any particular reason you didn't give him my Blue Letter? I mean, Jesus, Norman, just a dying man's last words and wishes, no big deal.
L294243 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Yes sir...
L294242 +++$+++ u5965 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ HUDSUCKER +++$+++ Mm. Well, say what you like about the man's ethics, he's a balls-to- the-wall businessman. Beat ya any way he can. Straight for the jugular. Very effective.
L294241 +++$+++ u5971 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ NORVILLE +++$+++ Norville.
L294240 +++$+++ u5965 +++$+++ m395 +++$+++ HUDSUCKER +++$+++ ...Jesus Christopher -- That smarts... Where was I? Oh yeah, the board. I guess Sidney's been puttin' the screws to ya, huh, Norman?
