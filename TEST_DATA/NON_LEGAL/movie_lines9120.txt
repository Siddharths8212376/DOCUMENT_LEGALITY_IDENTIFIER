L269661 +++$+++ u1267 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ I called every L.A. hotel. The Holiday Inn gave this as a referral number. Your office said you had no business in New York, so I figured you had come out here.  What's happening, Jake? What are you doing? Nobody's heard from you. Anne's worried sick. We didn't know if you were dead or alive.
L269660 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ How did you find me?
L269659 +++$+++ u1267 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ Jake?
L269434 +++$+++ u1267 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ You should come around more often. You haven't been around for weeks. Anne complains she doesn't see you anymore.
L269433 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Pretty good.
L269432 +++$+++ u1267 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ How's your business, Jake?
L269388 +++$+++ u1267 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ I'll come with you. Let me pack some things.
L269387 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.
L269386 +++$+++ u1267 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ Is Marsha there?
L269383 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ They don't know. They were having some recreation deal out at Knott's Berry Farm and Kristen wasn't there when they got back to the bus and they couldn't find her.
L269382 +++$+++ u1267 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ What happened?
L269379 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Wes, Anne, come here a moment.
L269378 +++$+++ u1267 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ What is it, Jake?
L269328 +++$+++ u1267 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ Anne wants to make sure you come over for dinner Sunday. With Kristen gone you'll be all alone.
L269327 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ No. Thanks anyway. I've got to get over to the office.
L269326 +++$+++ u1267 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ You want to go for coffee after we send the girls off?
L269713 +++$+++ u1256 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JISM JIM +++$+++ Look, I know this chick Niki. She works at Les Girls. She would know. Honest.
L269712 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Where!
L269711 +++$+++ u1256 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JISM JIM +++$+++ I don't know.
L269710 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Where does he hang out?
L269709 +++$+++ u1256 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JISM JIM +++$+++ She's got a man. A white guy. Tod something or other.
L269708 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Where is she? Where is the girl?
L269707 +++$+++ u1256 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JISM JIM +++$+++ Hey, stop, stop. I'll do anything you want. It's okay. I can dig it. You can do anything you want to me.
L269703 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I thought you were quite good in it. I also like the girl in it. Really thought she was good.  I wondered if she was still around. If she was still working.
L269702 +++$+++ u1256 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JISM JIM +++$+++ God, I don't know what it was called. I never saw it. I only got twenty- five bucks for the whole Goddamned thing.
L269701 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ It was called 'Slave of Love.'
L269700 +++$+++ u1256 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JISM JIM +++$+++ Oh yeah? I remember that. It was made by some college kids.
L269698 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
L269697 +++$+++ u1256 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JISM JIM +++$+++ Oh yeah? I've done a lot of good stuff. Shorts, features. No major roles it's true. But good stuff.
L269696 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ That's not true, Jim. In fact, I think you're very close to the type we're looking for.
L269695 +++$+++ u1256 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JISM JIM +++$+++ Jim Sullivan. Sometimes they call me Jism Jim.
L269694 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ That's not true, Mr...?
L269693 +++$+++ u1256 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JISM JIM +++$+++ I know. Word's out on the street -- word's also out you ain't really hiring anyone.
L269692 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ We're casting for an explicit sex action feature...
L269691 +++$+++ u1256 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JISM JIM +++$+++ Hey man.
L270020 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Let's go.
L270019 +++$+++ u1266 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ Who the fuck knows? The Four Aces. He goes there.
L270016 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Ratan!
L270015 +++$+++ u1266 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ That film was a fake! Everything's phony...
L270013 +++$+++ u1266 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ Who?
L270012 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Where's Ratan?
L270010 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ You ain't goin' nowhere alone.
L270009 +++$+++ u1266 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ You wait here. I'll find out where she is.
L270005 +++$+++ u1266 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about.
L270004 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I want to know where my daughter is. Her name is Kristen, or Joanne. She's with you.
L270003 +++$+++ u1266 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ What do you want?  Do I know you from somewhere?
L269954 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Good.
L269953 +++$+++ u1266 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ Meet me here today at seven o'clock. With the money. Then we'll go see the film.
L269952 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Okay.
L269951 +++$+++ u1266 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ Take it or leave it.
L269950 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Well...
L269949 +++$+++ u1266 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ Um-hm. You got the five hundred?
L269948 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Is this with a girl named Kristen?
L269947 +++$+++ u1266 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ I don't know no Ratan, but I may be able to help you out. It's not me, of course. Just helping out a friend. It'll cost you five hundred bucks for a single screening.
L269946 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Rucker.
L269945 +++$+++ u1266 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ Who told you about this?
L269944 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Yeah. I heard you and Ratan just came from Mexico. And that you had a film of a girl being, ah you know...
L269943 +++$+++ u1266 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ You're talking about real excitement?
L269942 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I was told that there were certain things that only Ratan could provide.
L269941 +++$+++ u1266 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ What is that? A kind of chair? I never heard of no Ratan.
L269940 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I want to meet Ratan.
L269939 +++$+++ u1266 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ What you got in mind?
L269938 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ No.
L269937 +++$+++ u1266 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ Do you work for the San Francisco Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
L269936 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Yeah.
L269935 +++$+++ u1266 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ TOD +++$+++ I hear you got money to spend.  I hear you're interested in... interesting things.
L269543 +++$+++ u1265 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ TELLER +++$+++ No, take it. I don't want your Goddamn fifty cents.
L269542 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ That's all right.
L269541 +++$+++ u1265 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ TELLER +++$+++ Here. Take your fifty cents back.
L269540 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ No.
L269539 +++$+++ u1265 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ TELLER +++$+++ You don't want anything for your fifty cents?
L269538 +++$+++ u1265 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ TELLER +++$+++ I don't know nothing, man.
L269537 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ But I...
L269536 +++$+++ u1265 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ TELLER +++$+++ I don't know. Look, man, if you're looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops.
L269535 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I'm just trying to find...  Who owns this store?
L269534 +++$+++ u1265 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ TELLER +++$+++ That girl? No, never saw her. I don't know anybody.
L269533 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I wondered if you had ever seen this film or this woman...  ...right here.
L269532 +++$+++ u1265 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ TELLER +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about.
L269531 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ This is from the movie I was talking about.
L269529 +++$+++ u1265 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ TELLER +++$+++ They're all about the same. You want something?
L269528 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ It's a short film.
L269527 +++$+++ u1265 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ TELLER +++$+++ What we got is just these here.  What you see.
L269526 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Do you have a, ah, film called 'Slave of Love?'
L269525 +++$+++ u1265 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ TELLER +++$+++ It's fifty cents admission. It's applicable to a purchase.
L269524 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ What?
L269523 +++$+++ u1265 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ TELLER +++$+++ Fifty cents admission.
L269636 +++$+++ u1263 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ RAMADA +++$+++ Okay. Keep in touch with my secretary.
L269635 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Sounds all right.
L269634 +++$+++ u1263 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ RAMADA +++$+++ ...I'd just start my own business. That's what I did. Get into kid porn. That's big now. Why don't you come around the set? Meet some people. If you still want to invest, I'll ask around.
L269633 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Jake.
L269632 +++$+++ u1263 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ RAMADA +++$+++ Don't get me wrong. A couple years ago, I woulda jumped at fifty thousand dollars possible financing. But the Lord's been good to me. I can now finance any films I choose. Big ones, small ones. Right now we're setting up a two hundred thousand dollar feature film. Live sound. I like to keep my own money in my films. That way you don't have to share the profits. There's plenty of guys in town that'll take it, though. But if I was you, Mr... what was your name again?
L269631 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I thought you were a businessman.
L269630 +++$+++ u1263 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ RAMADA +++$+++ If you want to watch when we shoot a film, for fifty bucks, I let guys stand around and watch. It's a lot cheaper.
L269629 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ It's an investment.
L269628 +++$+++ u1263 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ RAMADA +++$+++ It's cool. Why do you think I got in the movies? How much poon do you think you get in the car wash business?  Look, fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy. You can get your joint pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your life for fifty thousand dollars. So why fuck with the movie business?
L269627 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Not exactly...
L269626 +++$+++ u1263 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ RAMADA +++$+++ In other words, you want to get laid?
L269625 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I thought I'd invest in a film. I want to sort of become involved in the process of making a film, meet the people who make films, learn how it's done...
L269624 +++$+++ u1263 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ RAMADA +++$+++ What exactly do you have in mind?
L269623 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Well, Bill -- mind if I call you Bill?  Let me be frank. I've made a lot of money. I've got my own business in Detroit. Rivets. I make rivets and sell them to Fisher Body.  Well, rivets, you know, can get pretty boring after a while. When my business manager told me I should shelter some money, I thought I'd try this.
L269622 +++$+++ u1263 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ RAMADA +++$+++ Oh.  Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
L269621 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I've got fifty thousand dollars to invest.
L269620 +++$+++ u1263 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ RAMADA +++$+++ Film making can be pretty expensive...
L269619 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Yes.  I'm interested in financing an adult feature film. I was told you were the man to come to.
L269618 +++$+++ u1263 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ RAMADA +++$+++ My secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition.
L269617 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ No. I walked up. Don't ride elevators.
L269614 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ What do you think of that? Or this?
L269613 +++$+++ u1258 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ Hold it, mister.
L269612 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ Cool off, huh? How's this for cooling off?
L269611 +++$+++ u1258 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
L269610 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen, but I suppose you've never seen her?
L269609 +++$+++ u1258 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ MANAGER +++$+++ Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
L269608 +++$+++ u1255 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ JAKE +++$+++ I got a picture here. I want you to tell me where to find this woman. I been asking everybody. Nobody knows anything.
L269367 +++$+++ u1259 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ MARSHA +++$+++ Well, each time he comes in closer, like this.
L269366 +++$+++ u1257 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ What does that do?
L269365 +++$+++ u1259 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ MARSHA +++$+++ Well, a boy goes like this, see.
L269364 +++$+++ u1257 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ Com'on, tell me.
L269363 +++$+++ u1259 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ MARSHA +++$+++ You never heard of that?
L269362 +++$+++ u1257 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ What's that?
L269361 +++$+++ u1259 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ MARSHA +++$+++ You ever play Chicken?
L269360 +++$+++ u1257 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ I don't know.
L269359 +++$+++ u1259 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ MARSHA +++$+++ He asked me. You going with anybody?
L269358 +++$+++ u1257 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ KRISTEN +++$+++ You going to Knott's Berry Farm with him?
L269776 +++$+++ u1267 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ To anybody.
L269775 +++$+++ u1261 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ MAST +++$+++ To his own daughter?
L269774 +++$+++ u1267 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ You have to understand. He can be mean, self-righteous. He had a Vishund once. Loved that dog. He came home one day and the dog bit him. He took that dog and staked him out in the back yard. It was winter. Every day he came home and watched that dog until he froze. He's capable of doing anything.
L269773 +++$+++ u1261 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ MAST +++$+++ Huh?
L269772 +++$+++ u1267 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ I also want you to protect my brother- in-law.
L269771 +++$+++ u1261 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ MAST +++$+++ Maybe. Maybe not.
L269770 +++$+++ u1267 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ Do you really think Kristen is just a runaway?
L269769 +++$+++ u1261 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ MAST +++$+++ I've been on another case. All day.  I suppose I can move it over. Seven fifty a week, plus travel expenses.
L269768 +++$+++ u1267 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ I want to rehire you. To find out what's happening to my brother-in- law.
L269766 +++$+++ u1261 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ MAST +++$+++ I'll tell you, that was an interesting case. The Van Dorn girl. I've handled runaway cases like it before. Usually when you put the pressure on the porn underworld for an underage kid, she pops up in about a week. Everybody denies ever seeing her, but there she is at the airport with a prepaid ticket home. Well, I put pressure on all over town for this girl and it stayed cold as ice. In fact, certain people for this girl and -- nothing.  I guess I gave your brother-in-law sort of a raw deal.
L269765 +++$+++ u1267 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ He didn't look good at all. Something strange is going on. He's got himself into some trouble. He wouldn't say what.
L269764 +++$+++ u1261 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ MAST +++$+++ I'm off that case. He fired me.
L269763 +++$+++ u1267 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ I'm worried about Jake.
L269762 +++$+++ u1261 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ MAST +++$+++ I'm staking out this beer bottle. Trying to find out if I'll finish it or it'll finish me.
L269761 +++$+++ u1267 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ WES +++$+++ Oh.
L269760 +++$+++ u1261 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ MAST +++$+++ Ssh. I'm on a stakeout.
L269968 +++$+++ u1261 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ MAST +++$+++ Who? Van Dorn? You must be kidding yourself, honey. You think once that guy finds his daughter he'll care about you?
L269967 +++$+++ u1262 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ NIKI +++$+++ Jake'll take care of me.
L269966 +++$+++ u1261 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ MAST +++$+++ Oh no? What you gonna do? Get a job?
L269965 +++$+++ u1262 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ NIKI +++$+++ I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.
L269964 +++$+++ u1261 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ MAST +++$+++ You're taking a big chance.
L269963 +++$+++ u1262 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ NIKI +++$+++ You can fuck off, too.
L269961 +++$+++ u1262 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ NIKI +++$+++ Well, he can just fuck himself.
L269960 +++$+++ u1261 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ MAST +++$+++ The guy who bought you that ring.
L269959 +++$+++ u1262 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ NIKI +++$+++ Who's that?
L269958 +++$+++ u1261 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ MAST +++$+++ Granville's looking for you anyway.
L269957 +++$+++ u1262 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ NIKI +++$+++ My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica.
L269956 +++$+++ u1261 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ MAST +++$+++ You know Granville's looking for you, Niki?
L269505 +++$+++ u1263 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ RAMADA +++$+++ Nope never saw her before.  Kurt, come over here. Don't use underage kids. Wouldn't touch 'em for all the cow shit in Mexico.  You recognize this piece of wool, Kurt?
L269504 +++$+++ u1261 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ MAST +++$+++ Look again, Billy-boy. This is jail bait. Could get you in a lotta trouble.
L269503 +++$+++ u1263 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ RAMADA +++$+++ No, Andy. Don't know the kid.
L269502 +++$+++ u1261 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ MAST +++$+++ I want you to take a look at this girl here. She's been in some porn stuff.
L269501 +++$+++ u1263 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ RAMADA +++$+++ At least I improved myself. What's up?
L269500 +++$+++ u1261 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ MAST +++$+++ You don't have to get uppity with me, Bill. I remember when you was running that car wash and couldn't make it go. And what was that other thing you tried? A Dairy Queen? Went busted too.
L269499 +++$+++ u1263 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ RAMADA +++$+++ Hey, piss-head, what brings you around?
L269839 +++$+++ u1262 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ NIKI +++$+++ Thanks.
L269838 +++$+++ u1264 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ RUCKER +++$+++ No.
L269837 +++$+++ u1262 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ NIKI +++$+++ Was he with a girl?
L269836 +++$+++ u1264 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ RUCKER +++$+++ 'Was.' He and that shitheel Ratan went down to T-J. Maybe I shouldn't say that. Anyway, I hear he's back in Frisco now.
L269835 +++$+++ u1262 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ NIKI +++$+++ I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking for Tod. I heard he was around.
L269834 +++$+++ u1264 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ RUCKER +++$+++ You working in San Diego now?
L269833 +++$+++ u1262 +++$+++ m83 +++$+++ NIKI +++$+++ You remember me. Louise? Rhymes with squeeze.
L270210 +++$+++ u1268 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ Oh, <u>yes</u>? Well, that's all right. I've got a brother who's a real cut-up, too. I'll never forget the time we had this old TV set with no parts in it. Well, Tommy stuck his head behind it and started giving a newscast before the whole family. We were all hysterical. And here's little Tommy pretending to be Walter Cronkite.
L270209 +++$+++ u1274 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MRS. CHASEN +++$+++ I think I should mention, Candy, that Harold does have his eccentric moments.
L270207 +++$+++ u1274 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ MRS. CHASEN +++$+++ Yes, that's good planning. Tell me, are you a regular, Candy, in this computer club?
L270206 +++$+++ u1268 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ He seems very nice. Is Harold interested in, eh, what's going on? I think it's such a super thing to study. And then, of course, I can always fall back on home ec.
L270204 +++$+++ u1268 +++$+++ m84 +++$+++ CANDY +++$+++ Political Science. It's all about what's going on.
