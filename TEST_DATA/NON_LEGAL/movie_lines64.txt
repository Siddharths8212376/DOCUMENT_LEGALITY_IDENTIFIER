L63052 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Same here.
L63047 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Just don't lie to me.
L63046 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ What do you want me to say?
L63045 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ We both lied to him.
L63044 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.
L63043 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Your life will never be the same.
L63025 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Break a leg.
L63024 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Just want to say good luck.
L63015 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I'm gonna slit my wrists.  Cut my throat.  For the love of Joseph.
L63014 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ You've said that already.
L62971 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ The big one.
L62970 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Which one is your brother?
L62969 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ This is the group I was telling you about.
L62938 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I've never worked with any of you and you've never worked with me so we'll be starting from scratch. I'm a fair person, a straight shooter and I don't hold my tongue. Everybody up in here should know I had nothing to do with you being hired. 
L62937 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Hello.
L62936 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Good morning, for those of you who don't know me, I'm Pierre Delacroix. I'm running things and this here is my assistant Sloan Hopkins.
L62920 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Like I said, all this for some twisted, distorted sense of principal.  Dunwitty, he just tolerates your Negroidal ass, he doesn't respect it.
L62919 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I wouldn't bet against it.  My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place.
L62918 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?
L62917 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Even if money wasn't an issue, Dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous.
L62913 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Fuck da money.  Why do through all this effort?  Why?  Are you looking for love from Dunwitty?  For respect?  Dunwitty and his likes don't give a goddamn about you.  So now what are you gonna do?
L62912 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ It was the principle.  Dunwitty had to be enlightened.  I was making a point.  I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money.
L62911 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?
L62910 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
L62909 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ What is your problem?
L62879 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.
L62878 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ You okay?
L62755 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ This is Cheeba.
L62754 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Hello.
L62667 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Manray better not be bleeding to death.  I need him.  After we're done he can do whatever he wants to do, until then, he's ours.
L62666 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Maybe something happened to them. Maybe they're lying in an alley bleed to death.
L62659 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ And lose out on my money?  The only way I get paid is if I get fired. And that's what I intend to do.
L62658 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Can't you just quit?  Walk away?
L62657 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Good.  I'm going to need your support.
L62656 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ I'm in till the end.
L62655 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ You getting cold feet?
L62654 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Sounds risky to me.
L62653 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons.
L62652 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ What point is that?
L62651 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air.  Hence I'll prove my point.
L62650 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ You lost me.
L62649 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Not yet, but this thing will never get made.
L62648 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Do you know how you will use him?
L62647 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Manray was under our nose the whole time.
L62644 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ The idea was out there in the universe.  Now what?
L62643 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ How can this be?  You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary.
L62642 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ It hit me like a ton of bricks.
L62641 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ How did you know?
L62640 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Manray!
L62639 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Manray!
L62593 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ It wasn't my fault.  If I would have known, I would have known.
L62592 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
L62591 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Nobody told me anything.
L62590 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?
L62589 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ How was it?
L62951 +++$+++ u448 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MONA +++$+++ I've always liked the format of Rowan and Martin's "LAUGH-IN."
L62950 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ David, I appreciate your comments. Anybody got an ideas?  Everybody just talk out loud.
L62949 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ This thing was rigged, the deck was stacked, the fix was in.  Could Don King be near?  Good thing Sloan had my back.  She's my rock.  This was going to be a whole lot of work.
L62944 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Oh, is that what I'm doing?
L62943 +++$+++ u448 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MONA +++$+++ I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.
L62942 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Hi, Mona.
L62941 +++$+++ u448 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MONA +++$+++ He, I'm Mona.
L62940 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Yes, your name?
L63562 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Kook and the Gang, it's Manray. Let's do the taping.  You go back to your dressing room, get dressed and blacken up.
L63561 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ My name is Manray, goddamnit.
L63560 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Mantan, we got a show to tape.
L63512 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Do I have to spell it out for you? In fact, go ask Sloan yourself.
L63511 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ I don't believe it.
L63510 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place?  I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity.
L63509 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
L63508 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.
L63507 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ What you did is dead wrong.
L63506 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ You shouldn't even be mad at me over Sloan.
L63453 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ And now is definitely not the time to bitch up.
L63452 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Yeah.
L63451 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ You've made it from the guttermost to the uppermost.  Don't you know you should never let them see you sweat.  Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?
L63450 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece.
L63449 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
L63448 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ No.
L63447 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ What are you?  A man or a mouse? Are you a punk?  Punking out on me?
L63350 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ In time.
L63349 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Hope the same thing doesn't happen to me.  That's some big shoes to fill.
L63348 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ No joke.  Serious.
L63345 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Tomorrow it will be all about cruelty to animals or some sex scandal.  Besides, there is no such thing as bad publicity.
L63344 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Same thing Giuliani said.
L63343 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow.
L63342 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ You sound like the media.
L63341 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ So they can be on TV.
L63032 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Sloan, will you take your boss out of here so I can get ready.
L63031 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Not nervous?  Relaxed?
L63030 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ I feel fine.
L63029 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ You feel good, not nervous?
L63028 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Naw.  I'll take the zero.
L63027 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Can I kiss you too?
L62889 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ The point I'm trying to make is that this is a blessing.  It's going to be fun doing this show and we should all look at it that way.
L62888 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  Because I didn't call home a cardboard box?  No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.
L62887 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ That's the way it came out.  Let me ask you one question.  Have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life?
L62886 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I didn't mean it to sound like that.
L62885 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.
L62884 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I'm happy for all of us.  It's just we have a great responsibility now. The pressure is on.
L63545 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Soon.
L63544 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?
L63543 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan.
L63542 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ You know how your Daddy is.
L63541 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Not at all?
L63540 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ No.
L63539 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Yes I have, very hard.  Has Daddy called?
L63538 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.
L63537 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ You going to attack me too.  The show is a hit.  Aren't you happy for me?
L63536 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ I'm doing okay.  Been reading about your show, it's all over everywhere. I watched it's all over everywhere. I watched it once.  I thought you said there would be no buffoonery.
L63118 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ Peerless, last time, go see your father.
L63117 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.
L63116 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
L63115 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
L63114 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ Regardless, he still is your father.
L63113 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.
L63112 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ Richmond is not all the way down south.
L63111 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I can't go all the way down south.
L63110 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
L63109 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Where is he?
L63108 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ Yes he did.
L63107 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ He said that?
L63106 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ He wants you to come and see him.
L63099 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I'll be right over.
L63098 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ Peerless, your father called.
L62877 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ I will.  And good luck with your show.  I hope it's a huge success. You've worked very hard.  You deserve it.
L62876 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.
L62875 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
L62874 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
L62873 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?
L62872 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?
L62871 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ Son, Peerless is your name.  Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate.
L62870 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Mommy, please don't call me that.
L62869 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
L62868 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show.
L62867 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ That's wonderful.  Isn't that what you always wanted, a show of your own?
L62866 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.
L62865 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ How's the food?
L62864 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ I said no such thing.  All I said is that something must be wrong.
L62863 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.
L62862 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
L62861 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ It looks delicious.
L62860 +++$+++ u450 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ ORCHID +++$+++ You must think I'm some kind of fool.
L63049 +++$+++ u444 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUKKA +++$+++ Thank you very much.  I always try my best.
L63048 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show.
L63013 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ This is a travesty.  A debacle.
L63012 +++$+++ u444 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUKKA +++$+++ Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
L63011 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ This is a TV show, not a music video.
L63010 +++$+++ u444 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUKKA +++$+++ My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
L63009 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ How did you get this gig?
L63008 +++$+++ u444 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUKKA +++$+++ Thank you for correcting my ignorance.  I'm looking forward to working side by side with you.  I feel we make a good team.
L63007 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were NEGROES.  I'M A NEGRO.
L63006 +++$+++ u444 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUKKA +++$+++ Ahhh!!!  I never heard of that term before.  I thought you were BLACK of African-American.  No?
L63005 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!
L63004 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ A fiasco.  A disaster.  A boondoggle. An abomination.
L63003 +++$+++ u444 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUKKA +++$+++ What's a Negro.
L63002 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
L63001 +++$+++ u444 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUKKA +++$+++ You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?
L63000 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Finland.
L62999 +++$+++ u444 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUKKA +++$+++ Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland.
L62998 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Where are you from?
L62995 +++$+++ u444 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ JUKKA +++$+++ I just turned twenty.
L62994 +++$+++ u439 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DELACROIX +++$+++ Nice to meet you.  If you don't mind me asking you - how old are you?
L63300 +++$+++ u449 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MYRNA +++$+++ This show was created, conceived by you, a non-threatening African- American male.  Voila.  End of argument.  It can't be racist because you're black.
L63299 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ Yes you!
L63295 +++$+++ u449 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MYRNA +++$+++ Thank you.  And always smile.
L63294 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ Let Myrna finish.
L63289 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ We all stick to this, it's smooth sailing.
L63288 +++$+++ u449 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MYRNA +++$+++ The Mantan Manifesto.  Catchy ain't it?  Number One.  We gainfully employ African Americans, in front of and behind the cameras.  Two. Let the audience decide.  Three. Who put these critics in charge? These so-called cultural police? Four.  Who determines what is black? Five.  Mantan is a satire.  Six. If they can't take a joke, "F" 'em.
L63282 +++$+++ u449 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MYRNA +++$+++ The best defense is offense.
L63281 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy.
L63278 +++$+++ u449 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MYRNA +++$+++ First, I would like to say I love the show.  It's very courageous. My parents marched in Selma, Alabama with Dr. King.
L63277 +++$+++ u441 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ DUNWITTY +++$+++ I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings.  Through the roof.  But in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead.  I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. She's the best media consultant in the biz.
L62722 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ I envy you.  That's the way I want to feel about my work.
L62721 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.
L62720 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.
L62719 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.
L62718 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.
L62717 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  You look beautiful like that.
L62716 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ No, we're not knocking boots.  I got this internship while I still was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant.
L62715 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ Are you and him kicking it? Knocking boots. Y'knowwhatI'mtalkin'bout.
L62714 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ What do you mean?
L62713 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ So what's up with you and DeLa?
L62712 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies.
L62711 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ You sing and dance?
L62710 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while.
L62709 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.
L62708 +++$+++ u452 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ SLOAN +++$+++ You've never had any formal training, either?
L62707 +++$+++ u446 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANRAY +++$+++ I never had a really real pair before.
L63466 +++$+++ u453 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ TAVIS SMILEY +++$+++ I admit, that's a very hard thing to do.  Quickly let's go to the phones before we pay the bills and hear from our proud sponsors, DA BOMB.  125% PURE PLEASURE MALT LIQUOR.  IT MAKES YOU WANNA GET YA FREAK ON AND TIMMI HILLNIGGER. 125% AUTHENTIC GIT-TOE GEAR WHEN YOU WANT TO BE GIT-TOED FABULOUS. 
L63465 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem.  This is America.  Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.
L63464 +++$+++ u453 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ TAVIS SMILEY +++$+++ Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?
L63463 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand.  Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing.  If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it.  Or better yet write your own show.  Do it better.
L63462 +++$+++ u453 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ TAVIS SMILEY +++$+++ Is it inevitable that the game plays you?
L63461 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Money makes the world go round.  It ain't no joke being poor.  I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on the street.  I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game.
L63460 +++$+++ u453 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ TAVIS SMILEY +++$+++ Money and nothing else?
L63459 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ Yo, Tavis, check it out.  This is the two-one, the 21st century and it's all about the money.  Like my man Mase says, "it's all about the Benjamins."
L63458 +++$+++ u453 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ TAVIS SMILEY +++$+++ Let's jump right into it.  Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue.  How do you see all of this?
L63457 +++$+++ u447 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ MANTAN +++$+++ I'm more comfortable around my people.
L63456 +++$+++ u453 +++$+++ m27 +++$+++ TAVIS SMILEY +++$+++ Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview.  You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here.
