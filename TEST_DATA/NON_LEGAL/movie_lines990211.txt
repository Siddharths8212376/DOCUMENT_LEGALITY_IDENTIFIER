L449179 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Smart.  You burn time in the vault.
L449178 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ Never go for the vault.  They never get greedy.
L449177 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ They don't go for the vault?
L449176 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ Yeah, they control the room well. Stick strictly to the cash drawers.
L449175 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Good move.
L449164 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ Welcome to Sea World, kid.
L449163 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
L449162 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ Pappas.  Angelo Pappas.
L449159 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ The shit they pull, huh?
L449158 +++$+++ u7121 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ PAPPAS +++$+++ Added to which indignity, I got three months left to retirement and they saddle me with some blue-flamer fresh out of Quantico for a partner. Some quarterback punk, Johnny Unitas or something.
L449583 +++$+++ u7122 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ Fuck you, Johnny Utah.  Fuck you!! Don't you have a soul?  Goddamn you to hell!
L449582 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ I work bank robbery.  Guys I'm after are surfers.  I needed you, at first, but not--
L449580 +++$+++ u7122 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ You tell me the fucking truth Johnny... did your parents really die in a car crash?  DID THEY?!
L449579 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Tyler, put the gun down.
L449578 +++$+++ u7122 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ Jesus Christ, Johnny -- you've been using me!  Your jacket's on the floor in the bathroom -- this goddamn thing's half out of the pocket... Oh God, it's all part of some case, isn't it?
L449572 +++$+++ u7122 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ But you look like you been in a train wreck, how'd he just drive away?
L449571 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.
L449570 +++$+++ u7122 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ So what'd the other guy look like?
L449569 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ You're kneeling on my hand.
L449568 +++$+++ u7122 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ Betadyne doesn't hurt.
L449567 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Ouch.
L449508 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ No.  I'm sorry.  I have to go. I'll, uh... I'll call you later. I'm sorry.
L449507 +++$+++ u7122 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ Johnny... what's going on?  I don't get it... did I do something?
L449506 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ I... I gotta go.
L449454 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Warm them up.
L449453 +++$+++ u7122 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ Those are cold.
L449451 +++$+++ u7122 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ You don't have to.
L449450 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ I... I don't know.  I can't describe what I'm feeling.
L449449 +++$+++ u7122 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you.  See, it's gone.  If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy.
L449448 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ What?
L449447 +++$+++ u7122 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ Look at you.
L449446 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Yeah.  I just want to sit out here for a minute.
L449445 +++$+++ u7122 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ You had enough?
L449433 +++$+++ u7122 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ Come on.  At least no one's gonna see how bad you are.
L449432 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ I can barely do this in broad daylight.
L449429 +++$+++ u7122 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ Swell's here, Johnny.  Bodhi always knows.
L449428 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ What's goin' on?
L449424 +++$+++ u7122 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ I've seen that kamikaze look, Johnny.  You've got it.  And Bodhi can smell it a mile away.  He'll take you to the edge... and past it.  Hey, Bodhi.
L449423 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ What are you talking about?
L449422 +++$+++ u7122 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. I hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies.
L449404 +++$+++ u7122 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ Yeah, he thinks he's evolved to a higher plane of existence, or something.  Maybe he has.  You've seen him surf... that frenzy.  It seems like anger.  It's not.  It's the energy of lovemaking.  The sea is the woman in his life.  She's his only true lover.
L449403 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Sure, he's "the Bodhisattva".
L449402 +++$+++ u7122 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  But you can't hold it against him, he's... different.
L449401 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Meaning you were expendable.
L449400 +++$+++ u7122 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ People are expendable to Bodhi.
L449399 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.
L449398 +++$+++ u7122 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ Catch of the day.
L449397 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Who's the girl?
L449393 +++$+++ u7122 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ He rents it for the summer.  Bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around.  Most a these guys can't keep a job.  When the swell comes, they're gone, they have to ride.
L449392 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Nice place.
L449285 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Sure.
L449284 +++$+++ u7122 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ Stop here.  Do you agree to do exactly what I say when I say it?
L449282 +++$+++ u7122 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ Tomorrow, 6 AM.  Here.  If you're a minute late I'm gone.  And Stud... I didn't take you to raise.  I can show you a few things but after that you're on your own. That'll be four fifty.
L449281 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ I came out here from Ohio a month ago.  Never saw the ocean before.  I didn't think it would effect me so much.  Like I'm drawn to it, or something.  I want to do what you do.  It's the truth.
L449280 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Wait, so I'm a big hero to my folks, right?  But two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and I just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals.  And I hadn't been living my own life.  So I wanted something for myself.  Something that maybe didn't make any sense.  You know what I mean?
L449279 +++$+++ u7122 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ This gonna take long?
L449278 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ No, no.  See, all my life I've done things for other people.  In high school I played football because my old man expected me to.  Then my parents always figured I'd go to law school, so I did.  Football scholarship.  Graduated Phi Beta Kappa--
L449277 +++$+++ u7122 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ What is it?  You all of a sudden got this bug you had to go surfing? This is a line, right?
L449276 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Well, I'm just gonna go back out there till I catch on to it or break my neck.
L449275 +++$+++ u7122 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ I can see that.  But forget it. Stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at.  Miniature golf.  Here, your number's 37.
L449274 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ I'm serious.
L449273 +++$+++ u7122 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ Gimme a break.  One shrimp and fries to go!  Anything to drink?
L449272 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ I need you to teach me.
L449271 +++$+++ u7122 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ I mean, what do you want?  What are you doing hanging around here.
L449270 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Shrimp and fries.
L449269 +++$+++ u7122 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ TYLER +++$+++ What do you want?
L449257 +++$+++ u7124 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Wait!  Jesus Christ!  You're fucking crazy, you know that? You go in there you're gonna eat it on the rocks.  Here, follow me.
L449256 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Bye.
L449255 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ I'm telling you so when you look back on this moment, you can think... there was this guy named Utah and he was pretty much a dork but maybe not such a bad person and I let him drown in conditions he had no business being in whatsoever... when I could have easily helped him.
L449254 +++$+++ u7124 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Who cares!
L449253 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ My name's Johnny Utah!
L449252 +++$+++ u7124 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Carefully, tough guy.  Very carefully.
L449251 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Hey!  Uh, how do I get back in?
L449250 +++$+++ u7124 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ WOMAN +++$+++ Yeah, you saw me and you figured that if a mere girl can do it, a big strong stud like you shouldn't have any problem.  Right?!  Well you figured wrong, dork!
L449249 +++$+++ u7123 +++$+++ m477 +++$+++ UTAH +++$+++ Well, I saw you and--
L450227 +++$+++ u7125 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Something... in the trees...
L450226 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ Billy... What the hell's wrong with you?
L450150 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ What about the rest of Hopper's men?
L450149 +++$+++ u7125 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ I don't believe he did, Sir. I couldn't find a single track. Just doesn't make sense.
L450148 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ I can't believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush.
L450147 +++$+++ u7125 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Strange, Major. There was a firefight. Shooting in all directions.
L450132 +++$+++ u7125 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Six others, U.S. issue jungle boots. They came in from the north, then followed the guerrillas.
L450131 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ What do you mean?
L450130 +++$+++ u7125 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ BILLY +++$+++ Major, looks like there were ten, maybe twelve guerrillas. Looks like they took some prisoners from the chopper.  Then a different set of track, over there.
L450344 +++$+++ u7126 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ DILLON +++$+++ Right behind you.
L450343 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ I'll see you there.
L450340 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ You know you can't win this one.
L450339 +++$+++ u7126 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ DILLON +++$+++ Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch. Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right. Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along.
L450338 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ This isn't your style, Dillon.
L450337 +++$+++ u7126 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ DILLON +++$+++ No way, Dutch. I'm going. You get these people and get the hell out of here.
L450329 +++$+++ u7126 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ DILLON +++$+++ Now what, Dutch. You going to send your mystery guest an invitation?
L450328 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ He'll be looking for the trip wires. If we're lucky, he won't see this.
L450323 +++$+++ u7126 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ DILLON +++$+++ That rendezvous is ten maybe twelve miles, at most! We're almost home. But the chopper won't wait.
L450322 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ We're not going.
L450321 +++$+++ u7126 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ DILLON +++$+++ What are you talking about? We'll be out of here in ten minutes.
L450320 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ We're going to need everyone.
L450319 +++$+++ u7126 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ DILLON +++$+++ What the hell do you think you're doing?
L450311 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ No more games.
L450310 +++$+++ u7126 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ DILLON +++$+++ You're wastin' your time.
L450276 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ Bullshit. You're just like the rest of us.
L450275 +++$+++ u7126 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ DILLON +++$+++ I can accept that, it comes with the job.
L450274 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them.
L450273 +++$+++ u7126 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ DILLON +++$+++ We're still too far in, they won't risk coming in for us.
L450255 +++$+++ u7126 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ DILLON +++$+++ The wound all fused, cauterized... what the hell did this?
L450254 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ Blain...  ... Just like the others... no powder burns, no shrapnel.
L450198 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ We take her and she'll give away our position, every chance she gets. No prisoners, Dillon.
L450197 +++$+++ u7126 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ DILLON +++$+++ She's too valuable. She's got to know their whole network. The whole set up. We take her with us.
L450184 +++$+++ u7126 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ DILLON +++$+++ We've been lookin' for this place for months. The chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down. Hopper was sent in to get my men. He was just doing his job. When he disappeared I had to clean this up, I had to stop there bastards. We were so close, we couldn't quit. We couldn't sleep through this one. I needed you, Dutch, can't you see that?
L450183 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ What story did you give to Davis?
L450182 +++$+++ u7126 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ DILLON +++$+++ Because I told you, you're the best. I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story.
L450181 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ Why us?
L450180 +++$+++ u7126 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ DILLON +++$+++ That's right, I set you up. You're a veteran at this, Dutch, I had to.
L450179 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ It was all bullshit. All of it. From the start... you set us up, got us in here to do your dirty work.
L450143 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ Well somebody sent them.
L450142 +++$+++ u7126 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ DILLON +++$+++ Jesus... this is inhuman.  Uh... I wasn't told of any operations in this area. They shouldn't have been here.
L450141 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ I knew this man. Green Berets, out of Fort Bragg. What the hell were they doing in here? You got any answers for this, Dillon?
L450134 +++$+++ u7126 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ DILLON +++$+++ Probably another rebel patrol. They operate in here all the time.
L450133 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ Mean anything to you?
L450129 +++$+++ u7126 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ DILLON +++$+++ They're getting better equipped every day.
L450128 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ Billy's on it.  Heat seeker. Pretty sophisticated for half-asses mountain boys.
L450120 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ You never were all that smart... let's go!!!
L450119 +++$+++ u7126 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ DILLON +++$+++ You don't know how much I missed this, Dutch!!! Once you get this in your blood, you never get it out!!!
L450113 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ This gets better by the minute.
L450112 +++$+++ u7126 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ DILLON +++$+++ No such thing, old buddy. It's a one way ticket. Once we cross that border, we're on our own.
L450111 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ Who's our back-up on this?
L450110 +++$+++ u7126 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ DILLON +++$+++ Our rendezvous points and radio freqs. are indicated and fixed. AWACS contact on four hour intervals.
L450098 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ Go on.
L450097 +++$+++ u7126 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ DILLON +++$+++ Those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world. They're about to get squeezed. We can't let that happen. I needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet... no screw-ups. I needed the best. The best. So, I pulled a few strings at the State Department... and here we are.
L450096 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ Wasn't my style. We're a rescue unit, not assassins.  This must be good. Big shot from the CIA, leaves his desk to come back to the bush. What's so important?
L450095 +++$+++ u7126 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ DILLON +++$+++ Also heard that you passed on that little job in Libya.
L450094 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ Like the old days, Dillon.
L450093 +++$+++ u7126 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ DILLON +++$+++ That piece of work you guys pulled off at the Berlin embassy last week was really something. Blew the entry points on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat. Beautiful.
L450092 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ You never did know when to quit.
L450091 +++$+++ u7126 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ DILLON +++$+++ No way, old buddy.
L450090 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ You've been pushing too many Pencils, Dillon. Had enough?
L450356 +++$+++ u7126 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ DILLON +++$+++ We both got scores to settle.
L450355 +++$+++ u7127 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ ... Right, I got a score to settle for the Bro...
L450354 +++$+++ u7126 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ DILLON +++$+++ Take a position over there. I'll work around towards you. When I flush him, you nail him...
L450281 +++$+++ u7127 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Those eyes... disappeared. But I know one thing, Major...  ... I drew down and fired right at it. Capped-off two hundred rounds and then the Mini-gun; the full pack. Nothin'... nothin' on this earth could have lived... not at that range.
L450280 +++$+++ u7126 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ DILLON +++$+++ What, Sergeant?
L450279 +++$+++ u7127 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Don't know, only saw one of 'em. Camouflaged. He was there...  ... Those fucking eyes...
L450212 +++$+++ u7127 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Anytime.
L450211 +++$+++ u7126 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ DILLON +++$+++ Thanks.
L450268 +++$+++ u7127 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ The best friend I ever had.
L450267 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ I'm sorry, Bull. It's never easy. He was a good soldier.
L450266 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ Thank you, Sergeant.
L450265 +++$+++ u7127 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ We've got most of the flares, frags. and two claymores just outside. Nothin's comin' close to here without trippin' on somethin'.
L450264 +++$+++ u7127 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ I'll take him.
L450263 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ Put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back. We'll bury him in the morning.
L450253 +++$+++ u7127 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ I saw it.
L450252 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ You saw what?
L450224 +++$+++ u7127 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ Can't say, Major... been squirrely all mornin'... fuckin' weird... sometimes I think that nose of his is too good... smells things that ain't there.
L450223 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ What's got Billy so spooked?
L450167 +++$+++ u7127 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ MAC +++$+++ We found 'em both, dead. And the gear from the chopper. If they're Central American, I'm a fuckin' Chinaman. By the looks of 'em, I'd say our cabinet minister and his aide are CIA.  Another thing, Major, we were lucky... couple of those guys we waxed are Russians, military advisors by the look of it. Something big was about to happen here.
L450166 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ Any sign of the hostages?
L450084 +++$+++ u7128 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ PHILIPS +++$+++ Someone else will be going in with you.
L450083 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ What's that, General?
L450082 +++$+++ u7128 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ PHILIPS +++$+++ You lift off in three hours.  There's one other thing.
L450080 +++$+++ u7128 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ PHILIPS +++$+++ We figure we've got less than twenty-four hours to catch up with them. After that, there's not much hope. We want a rescue operation mounted tonight. That doesn't give you much time.
L450079 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ What have you got in mind, General.
L450078 +++$+++ u7128 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ PHILIPS +++$+++ That's the problem. Apparently they strayed off course.  We're certain they've been captured by the guerrillas.
L450077 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ That's over the border, General.
L450074 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ It's been a long time, General.
L450073 +++$+++ u7128 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ PHILIPS +++$+++ You're looking well, Dutch.
L450305 +++$+++ u7129 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ RAMIREZ +++$+++ Why didn't he try to kill one of us last night?
L450304 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ He knows our defenses.
L450303 +++$+++ u7129 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ RAMIREZ +++$+++ How could anyone get through this, carry Blain out, right under our noses without leavin' a trace?
L450241 +++$+++ u7129 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ RAMIREZ +++$+++ There's no sign of it.
L450240 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ Where the hell is his body?
L450239 +++$+++ u7129 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ RAMIREZ +++$+++ I think it's Hawkins.
L450238 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ What in God's name...?
L450237 +++$+++ u7129 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ RAMIREZ +++$+++ I can't tell.
L450236 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ Hawkins?
L450235 +++$+++ u7129 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ RAMIREZ +++$+++ Major, you'd better take a look at this.
L450137 +++$+++ u7129 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ RAMIREZ +++$+++ Same business, guerrillas hauling two guys from the chopper... followed by men with American equipment...
L450136 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ What's he got?
L450125 +++$+++ u7129 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ RAMIREZ +++$+++ I don't think that was any ordinary army taxi...
L450124 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ Mmmnnn...?
L450123 +++$+++ u7129 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ RAMIREZ +++$+++ There's something else, Major...
L450122 +++$+++ u7130 +++$+++ m478 +++$+++ SCHAEFER +++$+++ Took 'em out with a heat seeker.
L450759 +++$+++ u7131 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ BRIDGET +++$+++ They never are, dear.
L450758 +++$+++ u7142 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ VIVIAN +++$+++ He's not really my uncle.
L450757 +++$+++ u7131 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ BRIDGET +++$+++ Your uncle will like this.
L450756 +++$+++ u7131 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ BRIDGET +++$+++ Philip!  We'll need shoes!
L450755 +++$+++ u7142 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ VIVIAN +++$+++ I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?
L450754 +++$+++ u7131 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ BRIDGET +++$+++ You'll want a cocktail dress then.  Turn.  You have a beautiful figure.  A little too out in the open but simply lovely.  Size six? Do you need shoes?
L450753 +++$+++ u7142 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ VIVIAN +++$+++ Well... I might be going out to dinner.
L450752 +++$+++ u7131 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ BRIDGET +++$+++ No wonder.  For starts, you should know that hot pants are <u>horrid</u>, even when you do have the legs to carry them off.  What are your plans while you're in town?
L450751 +++$+++ u7142 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ VIVIAN +++$+++ Georgia.
L450868 +++$+++ u7132 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I do.  I take it all very personally.  Very nice meeting you, Vivian.
L450867 +++$+++ u7133 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally.
L450866 +++$+++ u7132 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
L450865 +++$+++ u7133 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ We can reach an understanding on this.
L450850 +++$+++ u7133 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ But I do know.  I also know your lines of credit are over-extended. If I don't buy your company, someone else will...  Ah, the escargot.
L450849 +++$+++ u7132 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ There's no way you could know that.
L450848 +++$+++ u7133 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ You're not getting any navy contracts.
L450847 +++$+++ u7132 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ We're on the verge of closing a large navy contract.  Double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares.  We would give you a promissory note...
L450842 +++$+++ u7133 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ EDWARD +++$+++ Twenty-five percent.
L450841 +++$+++ u7132 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ Mr. Harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock.  We also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share.
L450996 +++$+++ u7132 +++$+++ m479 +++$+++ DAVID +++$+++ I'd like to find out.  You don't know anything about me either. That's why people have lunch.
